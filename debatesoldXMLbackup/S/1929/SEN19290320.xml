      <P>The point I wish to raise is really for the purpose of asking the Government if they have any voice, or are prepared to take any action, in regard to recent events in connection with certain statues in the city of Dublin.  I need hardly say that I raise this matter in no narrow or sectarian spirit.  I raise it because I believe, and I am sure the House will agree, that the history of our city, and it is a great city, and its architectural and artistic history, is largely bound up in its statues.  They form a distinct and a very valuable link with our past, and we cannot view this matter merely in the narrow and sectarian or party view of events of the past. We have to take a generous, broad and statesmanlike view of recent happenings, and I submit that it is most unfortunate that a certain famous statue, that of William III., has been removed from the place where it has rested for, I suppose, nearly 250 years, and we do not know what has happened to it.  I shall be quite satisfied if we can get an assurance from the Government that it is the intention to preserve that historic link.  Only recently I visited the National Gallery and saw that well-known picture of the assembly of Charlemont's Volunteers. The statue figures largely in that picture.  Around it were grouped men whose names are honoured amongst what can be described as the most hardened Nationalists that could be conceived.  I suggest that it would be most unfortunate if for any purely narrow and immediate, and, I might say, extreme party point of view, that statue is allowed to be removed and never to re-appear.  I need hardly remind this House that that statue underwent various vicissitudes.  On a former occasion when it was dismounted it was restored.  By whom was it restored?  By a Nationalist Corporation under the Mayoralty of, I think, Daniel O'Connell.  In this year of solemn anniversary, when the name of Daniel O'Connell will figure largely in our celebrations, I <Col N="437" /> think it is at least due to his memory that efforts should be made, however difficult they may be from the architectural or the physical point of view, to restore that statue and preserve the tradition and our history in a suitable manner.</P>

      <P>I doubt really whether this is in order under this particular measure, but as far as the Minister for Local Government is concerned he has no more power over the Commissioners than he would have over the Dublin Corporation in connection with what statues will remain in the streets and what statues will be removed.  As to whether the Minister for Local Government or the Ministry have a policy with regard to King William, whose statue has been taken from College Green, I am not prepared at short notice to discuss that matter.  Whatever powers the Minister for Local Government has in connection with these matters he deals with them with a long spoon if with any.  It is a question for the Commissioners, a question for the Dublin Corporation, as to what statues will remain in and decorate the streets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the matters that I want to raise on this Bill, or shall I say, to initiate a discussion upon, is the proposal in regard to the curtailment of postal services in the country.  The policy of the Minister for Finance is alleged to be responsible for the action of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in reducing the postal services in country areas.  One gathers that the expectation is to save a sum of about £40,000 or £45,000 yearly by substituting a three-days' delivery for a six-days' delivery, and thereby saving the wages of 700 or 800 auxiliary postmen.  Now, the matter can be discussed from two angles, that of the curtailment of services, and that of the effect upon employees of the Post Office who are being transferred from the National Exchequer to the Unemployment Insurance Fund in the first instance, and to home relief in the second.  The case appears to me to resolve itself into this, whether the Ministry is wise, <Col N="439" /> whether it is good policy for the sake of an appearance of economy, for the sake of transferring a book-keeping item from one account to another, to curtail the services of the Post Office in the manner that is suggested.  It is, I think, quite true to say that the proposal is merely a book-keeping proposal.  It is not going to be a real saving.  There is no real saving on the country as a whole.  There may be in the Post Office accounts. Those 700 or 800 men are employed as auxiliaries, and nominally it is expected of them that they will have some other employment supplementary to the one in the Post Office, but I am informed on the best authority, that probably not more than 10 per cent. have wage-earning employment outside the Post Office. Many of them may have gardens. Many of them may have supplementary employment of a kind that is not wage-earning, but which, perhaps, adds a little to the family resources, but the actual money return on which they live is, in respect of 85 to 90 per cent. of the cases, the money they receive for work as Post Office servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many of these cases the men have been 20,25,30 or 35 years in the particular service, and it is now proposed to reduce their duties and consequently their pay by half.  The inevitable effect, in respect of those who are completely unemployed, which will be many, will be that for the period in which they are in benefit they simply transfer themselves to the Unemployment Insurance Fund, and in many cases will be better off for the time being as unemployed insured persons than they would be in the Post Office service, but when that has been exhausted, one knows that in rural districts there is seldom any alternative employment to look for, and in the great majority of cases they will be transferred to the Home Relief Fund.  Now that cannot be called national economy, and while it may suit a particular Department to have that kind of appearance on the books, it is not good business, it is no economy, and it is bad politics&mdash;<Col N="440" /> I am not speaking of politics now in the narrow party sense&mdash;but it is bad national housekeeping.  What is the effect?  The effect is to deprive a very great percentage of the population of a service of civilisation which has come to be regarded as normal.  It may be said that it is a luxury of civilisation, and that it should not be required.  People who talk about deprecating &ldquo; shirt economics&rdquo; ought not to make a suggestion that the benefit of the luxury of a postal service is one that can be removed without any general disparagement.  The community has come to look upon the postal service as part of the normal amenities of ordinary civilised life, and one can see very little reason why there should be deprivation in large areas of this normal postal service. If one could say that there was a very big saving, perhaps one might well balance expenditure against saving, but I suggest, and I think it is incapable of refutation, that there is no real saving to the National Exchequer, because the maintenance of these people will have to come out of some kind of public fund, inasmuch as there is no prospect, at present, at any rate, and one can see no immediate likelihood, of one developing that these men can transfer themselves to new employment.  After all, a man who has served twenty years as a postal messenger or deliverer cannot slip into new employment as though he had been trained all his life to that employment, and one's chief criticism of this policy might be said to be that it is an entire reversal of everything said by every public man of common-sense and responsibility, that it is not a good thing for the morale of the people that you should be paying away money without requiring in return some service.</P>
    <P>One hears on every occasion denunciations of what is called the dole, of what is called poor law relief, and so on, because it is giving away something to people, trusting them to depend upon a kind of public maintenance without having to give any work in return.  Here we have a complete reversal of that <Col N="441" /> policy.  These men were receiving 15/-, 20/- or 25/- weekly for part-time services, and they are giving some return for their work.  When these 700 or 800 men are dismissed they will be thrown upon other funds, and they will be giving no service in return for their pay.  Now I take that to be an evil public policy, and the Senate ought, if only on that account alone, to express its emphatic dissent from such a course of action.  People who are familiar with the circumstances appertaining to country districts will be able to speak from the point of view of the resident who is normally in expectation of correspondence.  It cannot but have a detrimental effect upon the development of certain commercial transactions that farmers have been encouraged, time and time again, to enter upon.  There have been quite considerable developments in some districts of this country through direct postal work.  That cannot be possible unless there is freedom of correspondence.  Freedom of correspondence almost inevitably necessitates a regularity of post office communications.  From every point of view, it seems to be a disastrous departure on the part of the Post Office service, and I hope the Senate will express itself emphatically in dissent from such a policy.</P>
    <P>I do not want, at this stage at any rate, to go into detail in regard to how it is going to affect individuals; but I have numerous complaints, letters and explanations as to its importance, and as to how it is going to affect individuals here and there and in all parts of the country.  We hear of the effect upon the public service as a service, but I am speaking now of the farming community, of creameries and the like, that will be deprived of their daily service of letters unless they can make special arrangements with the towns.  All this means reaction from civilisation, reaction from the amenities of civil life, and I think it is a course that should be stopped practically before it is entered upon.  I would make this appeal&mdash;as it is not too late for <Col N="442" /> the Ministry to stay their hand&mdash; for them not to enter upon this course, which is not going to be a saving, but is going to be really detrimental to the public interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to criticise the Government without sending a letter to the &ldquo;Irish Times,&rdquo; but it occurred to me that it might be possible to effect a saving of the necessary money if the tradition of the Post Office could be altered.  It may be an inherited tradition&mdash; though I am not one of those who wish to recognise the Saxon in any of our shortcomings; I think we have enough of our own&mdash;but there is a tradition in this service of marking time.  We have had it in the old Local Government Board.  You might think that the modern motor-car had not been invented twentyfive years ago.  I am speaking now of the delivery of letters.  The Post Office certainly is a more heavily-endowed service than that of the private company which represents the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; daily papers, but that company is able to deliver its papers daily in every little hamlet in Ireland, and it has not the same sources of earning as the Post Office, which is now to take the retrograde step of depriving the citizens in country districts of a service for half the week, leaving at the mercy of the country postmistress and the steaming kettle any correspondence that may excite her interest.  With the Ford motor-car, it ought to be possible to make a journey of 100 miles a day.  If this were a private company selling tea or newspapers, that would be done, and therefore I would direct the attention of the Post Office and of the Government to the fact that the motor-car has come to stay in this country and that it can be obtained cheaply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of the case, and it is this: I suppose Governments cannot be accused of breach of contract; but the actual condition of the service that obtained when the Government was returned to power, the fact that the service was there in actual fact, and <Col N="443" /> that the Government were returned in order to keep such services there, with law and order to support them, is a consideration which the Government should realise; in other words, it is indebted to the community, in so far as that service interested the community in the Government's return, and this is a breach of contract in a Government way.  I suppose that Governments are not amenable to the ordinary laws, but it would be a breach of contract in any public service if, in the middle of the year, they curtailed it to such an extent as is now proposed.</P>
    <P>There is another consideration which will affect the Government very much.  Few people are still able to maintain themselves in a private capacity in country places.  One great threat to public health and to modern conditions is the overcrowding of towns, and if the people who are upset and unable to communicate with the outside world for half the week were to leave these country places, there would be overcrowding in the towns, which would be greatly to be deprecated; in fact, I would go so far as to make a census of people in the cities who came from the country, and I would forbid anybody, in view of modern facilities of transport, entering the cities.  I think we should have places outside the City, like Leixlip and Lucan, developed, to prevent overcrowding and prevent the people coming into the City&mdash;to extend Dublin and make it Greater Dublin.  It is a strange thing to see, with transport so perfect, with £5,000,000 spent on the roads, and with their surfaces prepared in such a manner that one can make a circuit of the whole country in about thirty hours, that the postal service should be curtailed and all this inconvenience caused.  I have been quite astonished at the letters which I have received asking me what I now thought of my friends.</P>
    <P>Politically, whether it is, as Senator Johnson said, small politics or greater politics, I am interested in this matter, and I think the Government <Col N="444" /> are doing themselves a certain amount of damage that may be remembered to them when the election day comes.  In this matter, politics has been mixed up with commerce. It does not require the first notice on to-day's Order Paper to show that commerce is the predominant thing in the nation and that politics is a sort of frill for people of ideas and imagination to amuse themselves with.  But wherever politics touches commerce it is a serious matter; and on all our future developments, the steps that are being taken towards industrialising the country and towards making for sources of wealth, which would be quicker than the seasonal source of agriculture we are putting, to my mind, this avoidable curtailment. The framers of the Constitution provided in theory that we should not discuss finance, and if we could discuss it, we might not have the data on which to form opinions, but the Seanad is able to discuss finance in the guise of the postal service and of economy.  I do put it to the Minister that by speeding up the service and achieving what has already been achieved by a newspaper company, the money might be saved and the people also saved from this very great discomfort, to put it in the lowest way.  I thought it might mean an injustice, inasmuch as it might be taken to represent a breach of contract, but, as I say, political contracts are not the same as commercial contracts, and I would like to have the commercial and the political kept separate in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to call attention to the numerous cases of indiscipline in the C.I.D. force.  It may be remembered that this time last year I called the attention of the Seanad to the shocking ill-treatment of Mr. Tuohy during the election campaign in the South, when he was frightfully beaten&mdash;maltreated in a horrible way&mdash;and laid up for a long time.  I happened to be in the hotel in Tralee at the time. I do not want to go into that now, except to ask if any steps have been taken to discipline those members of the C.I.D. who were connected with that affair, which was condemned in an extremely strong manner by the Court at the time.  This man was tried before the Court, and I read out the statement of the Judge, who condemned his ill-treatment in the strongest manner&mdash;I do not want to take any partisan view of the matter&mdash;but that was the decision of the Judge.  I would like to know if anything has been done to discipline those people who deliberately waylaid and beat this man.  Since then there has been a number of other cases; it would take too much time if I were to go through all the misbehaviour of the C.I.D.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But a case has arisen quite lately in the case of a Mr. Glynn and of a Miss Jennings, of Bloomville House, Portarlington.  It happened in this way: Their place was boycotted for a considerable period, and finally the house was partly burnt.  The police were sent for, and after a good deal of investigation, which I need not bother to go through, Mr. Glynn thought they were not doing very much, and he came up to Dublin to see the Minister for Justice on the subject.  When he went back he was asked what the hell he meant by going up to report the police.  Sometimes he was ill-treated and threatened, and finally he was arrested and a conspiracy was made&mdash;I can call it a conspiracy&mdash;by the C.I.D. men to charge him and Miss Jennings, <Col N="446" /> an old lady of seventy, with burning her house.  I am not going to say what my own opinions are on the matter; it has nothing to do with me.  The case was tried twice.  Glynn was asked what the hell he was doing with the Minister for Justice, getting the Guards into trouble.</P>
    <P>He then told the sergeant of the Guards&mdash;I do not want to mention names&mdash;to do various things, and he was arrested, put in prison, let out again, put in prison two or three times, sent to Mountjoy, and he was told when he was in prison that Miss Jennings had admitted the whole thing, in order to extort a confession from him.  Miss Jennings was arrested and told that Glynn had admitted the whole thing, and that she had better do something, or that else she might be spinning a rope to put round her own neck.  All sorts of illegal practices were committed. After months and months of detention, some of the time out on bail, they were eventually brought up for trial in Dublin and acquitted of the whole thing.  The old lady was accused of burning her own house, and in her defence she said: &ldquo;Do you think I was going to burn my dear old home, every stick and stone of which I love?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The matter came before Judge Wakely, when a claim for compensation had been put in, after the two had been acquitted, and here is what Judge Wakely said: &ldquo;Miss Jennings and Mr. Glynn have been treated absolutely wrongly from the date of the fire and the time of the trial in the criminal court&mdash;they have been shamefully treated.&rdquo;  He referred to the treatment of Miss Jennings during what he described as the &ldquo;bad times,&rdquo; and he went on: &ldquo;Glynn's life has been in danger again and again, but he stuck loyally to his work and the effort to protect Miss Jennings' property.&rdquo;  Then the Judge went on to refer to the fact of Glynn going to the Ministry of Justice and complaining there that the Civic Guards were not looking after Miss Jennings' property, or attending to the complaints made about the trouble she was put to, and the Judge thought very few <Col N="447" /> people would have the pluck to do that, but Glynn did it, and, of course, he is the worst in the world for that, the Judge said.  It half made him sad, he continued, to see in a civilised country a person or persons bringing forward a claim for compensation treated as Miss Jennings and Patrick Glynn were treated, and he hoped that he would never in his life hear of such a case again.  Then he went on to say that, because she put in a claim against the County Council she was prosecuted for deliberately making a fraudulent claim to get money from the County Council.  In her evidence, went on the Judge, she said: &ldquo;Do you think I was going to burn my dear old home, every stick and stone of which I love?&rdquo;  That was the charge on which she was dragged through the Criminal Court, the Judge said, the charge of burning the dear old home she loved.  The disgrace of that would reflect on this county for many a long day, and he hoped in God such a thing would never occur in the Free State again.</P>
    <P>That state of affairs is pretty constant in this country.  I do not wish to impute blame to the ordinary Gárda, but I do honestly impute great blame to the members of the C.I.D. force, or at all events, to some of them who do these things.  It is a perfect scandal, and it ought to be remedied.  I daresay that these things may occur from time to time in other countries, but in other civilised countries when these things are done, the Minister concerned and his subordinates see that discipline is carried out.  If discipline is not carried out, the law will not be respected.  Ministers complain that the law is not respected.  How can it be respected when this sort of thing goes on?  In Dublin the other day, numbers of young boys and young women were arrested and kept in prison, without any charge being made against them.  When the police were asked why they arrested and kept them, they said that they arrested them, not because they believed them to have been guilty of <Col N="448" /> certain things, but because they wished to examine and cross-examine them as to where they had been on certain days, and what they had been doing, and they arrested them to get whatever evidence could be got.  I think the Minister for Justice ought to see that discipline is maintained.  I remember in the time of the Black and Tans saying that if General Macready did not discipline the Black and Tans and his troops he would fail in the object he wished to achieve, and he did fail. I made the charge of indiscipline myself, and I told him that.  As a result I was arrested.  Anyway, what I suggested happened, and very much on account of that indiscipline the Black and Tans were driven out of the country.  Here we have the same thing again, and if these things are not put a stop to there will be no peace in the country. I wish that the Minister for Justice were here to tell me why these people, who have been guilty, and who are shown to have been guilty by a Judge who was not prejudiced in the matter, have not been properly punished.</P>

      <P>So many subjects may be discussed on this Bill that I think it would be well to follow up one at a time.  If any Senators wish to follow up what Senator Moore said, it would be better for them to do it now, and then we can return to the postal question, if the House will allow that suggestion. Of course I cannot dictate to the House, but it appears to me that it would be better to discuss one subject at a time than to carry on an acrimonious debate on two or three subjects at the one time.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to say very much in addition to what Senator Moore has said on this matter of the Civic Guards and the C.I.D.  He has made his plea for better organisation and for better control.  I would like to refer for a moment to the expenditure involved in the maintenance of the Guards, and in doing so, I do not wish to approach the matter in any spirit of <Col N="449" /> carping criticism; I merely wish to ask if we are really getting value for the money that is being expended; if the force that is being maintained throughout the country is necessary for the maintenance of law and order, and if this force could be reduced, and economy effected. Throughout the country I hear on all sides that there are so many Guards in a little barrack in such and such a place and that they do not seem to have much to do during most of the day.  I do not know whether it is a practical proposition &mdash;I suppose it could hardly be looked upon as such&mdash;but on the one hand we are cutting off postal supplies and on the other we are maintaining a very considerable force of men who seem to have comparatively little to do during the day, and I suppose that it would be revolutionary to suggest that these people might deliver letters, or do something to justify their expense.  However that may be, I think it will be admitted generally that throughout the country the Gárdaí are hardly fully occupied, and I think that a considerable saving could be effected by a reduction of the force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of the question is that the Gárdaí are expected to collect data for the benefit of certain Ministries, notably with regard to agricultural production, stock, and so on.  I am informed on very good authority that this data supplied by the Gárdaí is entirely misleading, that a Gárda is told anything that the farmer likes to tell him, and this has serious reactions in so far as the information may be entirely misleading when used in any economic survey of the country. I think it is an important thing that if these people are responsible for the collection of economic details we should get accurate returns, not simply that there should be a mere formal visit by the Gárda to ask: &ldquo;How many cows have you?  How many acres have you under wheat? How many acres have you under potatoes?&rdquo; and for the farmer to tell him anything that comes into his head.  I think that that is a <Col N="450" /> point that might be looked into in order to see whether the Gárdaí are doing properly what belongs to the civil side of their work in making up these returns.  I do not want to labour the matter any further.  I feel that the amount spent on the Gárdaí might be considerably reduced. In going through the country and in seeing numbers of these men practically unemployed for the whole day, it occurs to one that they have too little to do, or that there are too many of them.  I suggest that that is one item where considerable economy could be effected.</P>

      <P>As far as the Guards are concerned, one can only speak from experience.  I know that as far as my travelling about the country goes, I see the Guards doing a great deal of work.  For instance, take the question of the watching of rivers, and that sort of thing.  Those of us who fish a little have found a very remarkable and a very great change for the better with regard to the care of the rivers.  These fisheries are a very valuable asset to the country.  The Guards are very nice about it; they do not make trouble but they do watch and help. Undoubtedly they are very good at that.  There is no doubt that when people are distributed all over the country with guns, dogs, and all sorts of things, doing what they please, the Guards are required in the country nowadays, and they perform their duties quite properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as these agricultural returns are concerned, I have a good deal to say to prices of various grains, and I have something to do with cattle and one thing or another. I read these returns very carefully, and as far as one can judge from one's own knowledge the men who send them to the Department must be intelligent men to make them worth reading.  We study them, and we get very clearly the prices that are ruling throughout the country. From a business point of view&mdash;take barley, in which we are interested&mdash; the returns that we get as to the amount in the country, as to whether there is a shortage of this, that, or <Col N="451" /> the other thing, which enables prices to be calculated, are good and reliable, and we are asked to curtail this service.  That is the experience of one who merely watches the matter from a business point of view, and I think it is only fair to say that.</P>

      <P>I wish to corroborate what Senator Jameson has said about the Guards.  I have had experience of the Guards coming to me for returns of cattle and crops, and I must say that my experience has been that they have been most attentive, praiseworthy and courteous. The Guards who look after the figures in connection with farming are mostly farmers' sons themselves, and they take quite an intelligent interest in having these returns made out in a satisfactory way.  It would be a very poor compliment to the farmers to say that they make fools of them, or give them false figures.  These Guards are quite capable of getting intelligent returns, and I can testify to their courtesy and civility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards this question of the Post Office, which arises on the reduced amount asked for by the Minister for carrying on the postal services, I see by the Estimates that the amount is reduced this year by a sum of £192,000, and I understand that from £40,000 to £50,000 will be saved by the new system of postal delivery in the rural areas of three days a week instead of six days.  Considering the demands that have always been made on the Government for economy, I think that we ought to be very pleased that the Minister has decided to make such a big cut as £192,000 in the postal services. I believe that the farmers and other rural dwellers will be quite satisfied with a three days' delivery instead of a six days' one, when they know that by that system such a large sum as from £40,000 to £50,000 will be saved to the State.  I gather from the statement made by the Minister in the other House that it will be possible for the rural dwellers to get their letters at the local post <Col N="452" /> offices by sending for them if they so desire.  That would be sufficient to enable people who expect letters on a certain day to get them.  A regrettable feature of this is, of course, the throwing out of employment of 700 men.  I know that a good many of those rural postmen are only part-time officers, and that for a portion of the day, when they have completed their rounds delivering the letters, they are employed by farmers as agricultural labourers.  If they get agricultural employment they are quite competent to do it.</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister for Finance that he should consider carefully the amendment put forward by the leader of the Labour Party for the encouragement of the production of home-grown wheat, in connection with a tariff on flour, for the purpose of keeping our mills going, that is to come before the Dáil one of these days.  Deputy O'Connell is putting forward that policy.  I regard it as a very sound one, and I am prepared to give it my heartiest support.  I am satisfied, if it were carried out, that in a very short time far more than the 700 men who are now to be disemployed would receive employment.</P>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister whether he has given any consideration to what has occurred in neighbouring countries in respect to the de-rating of agricultural land, and the relief thereby given to agriculture.  Perhaps it is not too much to expect that the matter will be dealt with in the coming Budget.  If that is not to be the case, then I hope the time is not far distant when the matter will be taken into consideration and arrangements made to place the Irish farmer in at least as favourable a position as that occupied by his brother-farmer in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the agricultural grant which is given for the relief of the rates, a good many people seem to have a very imperfect idea as to its meaning and what it really is.  As I regard the expression &ldquo;grant,&rdquo; it means giving something for nothing, but in this case, when the Local Government Act of <Col N="453" /> 1898 was passed, the agricultural grant was merely the equivalent of the landlords' portion of the poor rate which the tenants or occupiers had then to take upon their shoulders.  I think it is rather a mistake to call that a &ldquo;grant.&rdquo;  I suggest to the Minister that he should take this question of the de-rating of land into his consideration as soon as he possibly can.  I cannot see any greater means than it of helping agriculture in this or any other country.</P>
    <P>It appears very unjust that a man with an income of from £500 to £1,000 a year should contribute nothing to the support of the poor, of lunaties in asylums, or to the upkeep of roads except the amount of rate based on the valuation of the house he lives in.  That valuation may not be more than £10, while a struggling farmer, with possibly a big valuation and scarcely any income, has to pay a big rate for the services mentioned.  I would like to have the views of the Minister as to whether he has considered this question of the de-rating of land, and what we may expect in that regard in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>My views on the matter of postal deliveries are very much in accordance with those expressed by Senator Linehan.  Nobody, of course, likes to be inconvenienced, but it is up to the critics of the Minister's policy to suggest alternative methods of effecting economy. Economies come along, but nobody likes them.  I do not feel myself that I could oppose the economy suggested unless some substantial alternative be suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point made by Senator Johnson applies to almost every economy that one could think of: that you are going to dislocate existing employment and for the time being impose some inconvenience and probably put an increased strain on the Unemployment Fund.  If you are to get efficiency and consider each section on its merits, you cannot condone any employment which has not got <Col N="454" /> an economic and efficient justification. I do not agree with the Senator as to letters being a necessity or a blessing to civilisation.  I think they are the curse of civilization, especially in the seasons when the income tax people get busy.  I should be very glad indeed if I only get my letters once a week at that period.</P>
    <P>There is just one point that I would like to call attention to.  I think that the Minister might get the Postal Department to consider the method employed in the delivery of letters in Canada and America. There they have an extremely satisfactory system.  They have wayside boxes which can be slewed round so that they can be filled from the side of a motor car.  I imagine that the delivery of letters here could be accelerated tenfold if a system of that kind were introduced. In Canada the householder has his box at a convenient place on the main road, and calls to it for his letters.  I would imagine that if such a system were adopted in this country there could be an enormous increase in deliveries.  I do not believe people cannot be trusted not to tamper with these individual boxes.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter that I wish to refer to, and that is the question of the delay in the vesting of land under the 1923 Land Act. It is now nearly six years since that Act was passed, and only some ten per cent. of the holdings have been vested.  Solicitors tell me that they cannot explain the reasons for the delay.  In some cases where the title was perfectly straightforward, where all the preliminaries have been discharged, maps lodged and everything done, the delays continue.  It may be that there are not sufficient inspectors. I suggest that it would be good economy to sanction an increase in the Land Commission staff in order to get this vesting of lands settled.  The tenants have to pay a ten per cent. increase in interest in lieu of rent during this period.  That is not only a great hardship on the tenants but it is also a hardship on owners, who have to pay interest at <Col N="455" /> very high rates.  If the land were vested, the owners in many cases could discharge their capital obligations by the payment of stock.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised to hear Senator Linchan and Senator Sir John Keane state that this would be a blessing in disguise for the farmers, and that they welcomed the proposal to reduce the delivery of letters to the farmers of the country from six to three days a week.  I cannot agree with these Senators.  I am inclined to agree with Senator Johnson that it is a disastrous proposal. If the proposal is carried into effect it will, I believe, raise a storm of protest that the Government will find it hard to withstand.  I think they will have to give way under it. To say that sixty per cent. of the people of the State should have their postal deliveries reduced from six to three days in the week is, to my mind, a most unjust and unreasonable proposition.  During the last fortnight or three weeks I have been through many parts of the South, West and Midlands of the country, and I can say that the sole topic of discussion amongst the people in trains and at fairs I attended was the effect which this proposal will have on the rural communities, if carried into effect.  I appeal to the Minister for Finance to reconsider this matter, and to endeavour to find some other method of effecting economy than that of the indiscriminate cutting down of postal deliveries in the rural areas from six to three days a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister states that this will mean a saving of £40,000 a year in the Post Office.  I am afraid that is a very questionable figure if we take into account the number of men who will be thrown out of employment. They will have to be put on the dole, while the revenue from postage stamps will be considerably reduced. If we take all that into account, as well as the inconvenience and loss caused to the farming community, I think the Minister would be well advised to reconsider his whole scheme, apart altogether from what the two <Col N="456" /> farming representatives in the Seanad have stated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that this economy, in the case of the Post Office, is largely inspired by the desire on the part of certain people to get back to what are called the old days.  It is certainly bringing us back, in certain districts at any rate, just one hundred years.  In portions of the County Dublin to-day to which this new arrangement will apply, they had three deliveries in the week a hundred years ago.  These deliveries were between the hours of 8 a.m. and 9 a.m.  Under the new arrangement, I understand, the deliveries, in order to include the cross-Channel post, will not be made until after noon, so that we are back one hundred years, with a late-day delivery instead of an early-morning delivery as was the case a century ago.  Of course, a farmer has got into the Post Office.  As one of those who stood out for merciless economy at all costs and in all directions, and being a consistent man I presume he feels that he has to begin at home.  Therefore, the unfortunate Post Office is to be the victim of his tomahawk.  Ever since the Free State came into being, the Post Office has been the Cinderella of the Service.  It was the first institution that was attacked after the Provisional Government was set up, and it has been attacked ever since.</P>
      <P>Some of the salaries paid in the Post Office are a disgrace to civilisation. If Senators take up the Estimates they will find that there are 19 part-time telephonists paid at from 3½d. to 6¾d. an hour.  Others are paid at from 3¾d. to 7d. an hour. I see that a charwoman, part-time, is paid 4½d. an hour.  I say that to bring a poor woman in for, say, two hours in the morning, make her pay her tramfare, or walk if she cannot afford to do that, and then offer her 9d. for two hours' work, which I think is about the average period occupied in the cleaning out of offices, the lighting of fires and the washing down of rooms, and so on, is a disgrace to the Post Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find that a charwoman, employed <Col N="457" /> full time is paid 18/- a week.  The Estimates also show that part-time auxiliary postmen, in some places are only paid from 6½d. to 7½d. an hour and that women are paid from 5½d. to 6½d. an hour.  This is the Department in which this new economy is to be effected.  The total saving estimated is £192,000, of which it is expected £42,000 will be achieved by the dismissal of 800 auxiliary postmen.  I think that we could congratulate the Minister and say that he had done very well by saving £150,000 in one year and without disturbing these men.</P>
    <P>A return furnished by the Post Office Workers' Union shows that less than 10 per cent. of these auxiliary postmen have any other employment.  If they have to go out in the morning delivering letters it will be very hard for them to get any other kind of employment.  Very few employers will require them for the remaining part of the day.  We all know that when any job is likely to be had huge numbers of men turn up for it.  There are thousands of men who cannot get work of any sort.  Therefore, it is most unlikely that men, who have any little job at all, are going to get work elsewhere in their spare time.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has repeatedly, in these formidable tariff debates that make the welkin ring in the other House, given particulars of the amount of additional employment that has been provided as a result of the imposition of tariffs.  You have had the case of £150,000 additional being imposed on the country through tariffs for the sake of giving employment to an additional 500 men.  Here, for the mere saving of £42,000, it is proposed to throw 800 men out of employment.  I cannot see the consistency of that policy at all.  After a most elaborate debate we had a tariff imposed by the other House on glass bottles for the purpose of keeping 25 men in employment.  One year after the tariff had been imposed the number of men employed in that factory was less than the number employed there before. <Col N="458" /> That was the result after all the public time that had been wasted in discussing that case.  Tariffs are imposed with one object: of trying to keep men in employment and of giving work.  To give work to provide the necessaries of life is, after all, the main object of humanity, but here by a stroke of the pen 800 men are to be thrown out of employment. I doubt if any industry in this country which has recently been given the advantage of a tariff is going to absorb these 800 men.</P>
    <P>The tourist districts, which are mainly in the rural areas, will, of course, come under this new regulation, and are certainly going to suffer.  If you are only going to have deliveries of letters on three days a week, then I fear that hotel bookings and various other arrangements in regard to the tourist traffic of the country are going to suffer in places like Glengariff, Rosapenna and the railway hotels down south. We are now to have just three days a week for bookings by letter in hotels, and this in a country where we are told we have rounded the corner.  I suggest that this is an instance of applying the policy of the huxter instead of the policy of the enterprising, courageous business man.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the Minister, or whoever is responsible for this pitiful economy, has been unduly impressed by the wave of pessimism that has been developed by certain interested speakers and writers.  I read the other day an extract from a speech by Mr. Bruce, the Prime Minister of Australia, which reminded one of conditions in this country. He said that one of the tasks of the Australian Press was to get rid of pessimism.  According to some people, he said, Australia's problems were so overwhelming that it appeared impossible ever to reach prosperity. &ldquo;Acres had been written about the drift from the country to the cities. America's story was Australia's story, but one hundred times worse. Australia's difficulty was solvable. Our troubles are so few that we make <Col N="459" /> a devil of a fuss about those we have.&rdquo;  So that the pessimism that we hear so much about and the hard bad times are not confined to Ireland. At the very worst they are only transient difficulties that will pass, and there is no need at all for our Ministers to get into a panic and wipe out essential services that are a necessary feature of civilisation&mdash;that are necessary to trade and progress.</P>
    <P>By making this economy the Government propose to throw this large number of men out of employment. They propose to do that while, as I have said, they have repeatedly imposed additional taxes on the community tending to increase the cost of the necessaries of life with the avowed object of providing employment. I hope it is not yet too late for the Government to give reconsideration to this question, which is one that affects such a large area of the State and such a large number of people, and which, I suggest, will give the country the name of having taken a definite step backwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Farrell that, from the business point of view, this reduction in the number of letter deliveries per week is a retrograde step.  We are trying to get people to come to this country and spend their money here.  These people were in the habit of getting their letters and newspapers every day.  They may come here to hunt or to spend a holiday.  What will <Col N="460" /> they think if, under this new arrangement, they can only get their letters and newspapers three days a week?  We will be looked upon across the water as a retrograde nation.  I say again that this is a retrograde step.  Are we, for the sake of £40,000 a year, going to deprive people of the facilities they have enjoyed and of pursuing their business properly?  Take even the case of Senators.  Many of the members of this House live in the country. If letters are only to be delivered three days a week, then I fear the notices sent out calling the House together will not, on many occasions, reach Senators in time.  I think that under this new regulation it will be impossible, at times certainly, to summon Senators to meetings here unless the method of the 1/6 telegram is used.  Having deliveries on only three days a week, Senators cannot rely on getting their letters in time.  Take the case of Senators who live some distance outside the City of Dublin.  In these days of motoring, a man can quite easily carry on his business in the city and live ten or twenty miles outside of it.  When going home in the evening he can be certain that he will have his letters in the morning. He knows from the letters he receives whether it is necessary for him to come into town that day or not.  That will not be the position in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I doubt very much if the Minister has considered the need of the commercial community.  Some Senators seem to think that the farmers of the country can do without a daily delivery of letters, and that their requirements will be amply met by deliveries on three days a week.  I suggest that the position will be very serious for a business man living in an area where you have only deliveries of letters on three days a week.  This new regulation is going to cause him immense inconvenience. He will not get his paper in the morning and will not know what is going on.  In that event he will have to send a telegram or use his telephone, which is extremely expensive. <Col N="461" /> I think this is a most retrograde step for the Minister to take.  It is certainly a very serious matter as far as the business and farming community are concerned.  There is a sum of over twenty millions a year raised in taxation here, and in order to balance his Budget I cannot understand why the Minister for Finance should have picked out as a saving this item of £42,000 in connection with the Post Office.  The result of it will be to inflict great hardship on a most estimable class of people, and very real injury on the commercial community.</P>
    <P>When one moves in business circles on the other side one is reminded that telegrams here cost 1/6.  When you go into a Post Office in London to send a telegram and the official sees that it is going to Ireland you are told that the charge is 1/6.  I suppose the British Government gets sixpence out of the 1/6. Our letters cost us 2d., while at the other side the charge is 1½d.  It seems to me that the Government ought to try some other method of effecting economies before they propose an arrangement of this kind, which is calculated to inflict so much hardship on the commercial and farming community of the country and, in my opinion, to injure the country in other ways.  If this is the only saving that we can effect, then the sooner that we give up shop the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, as a rural dweller, to protest against this proposed change in the delivery of letters. I cannot understand how it can be justified when we realise that from 70 per cent. to 75 per cent. of the total wealth of the country is produced in the rural areas.  Surely the dwellers in those areas, who are doing the vast bulk of the work of the whole State and who are earning practically all the money that comes into the Exchequer, should not be deprived of a daily post and expected to carry on business in an up-to-date fashion at the same time?  I do not think that this is really economy.  I believe what will happen <Col N="462" /> if this change is brought about is that any up-to-date business man or farmer will of necessity have to send to the post office if he wants to get his letters daily.  In many cases that will entail financial loss.  It will possibly necessitate the using of a pony or a motor car for the purpose of getting the letters.  You are going to put those people who want to carry on their business in an up-to-date fashion to extra expense.</P>
      <P>I believe it would be far better to increase the price of the letter stamp than to do away with the daily deliveries. I believe that would be more acceptable to the people of the country, even if the price of the stamp were raised to three pence, than to reduce the delivery of letters to three days in the week.  I am well aware that many of the letters postal officials deliver are of little use to the community.  I am not concerned about that.  What I am concerned with is that where a man wants to keep in touch with the market, wants to know the current prices, and wants to keep in touch with the tendency of things in his own particular industry, he should not be debarred from doing so by reason of the fact that he cannot get a daily letter delivery.  I believe that this reduction of postal deliveries is one of the worst kind of attempts at economy, and I think the Minister should very seriously consider whether he cannot abandon this proposal and continue the present system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>One hesitates a good deal before opposing any economy. My own feeling is that a daily delivery in the Free State, apart from any of the arguments used, is a thing of real value, and that the publication of the statements that have been made here may quite conceivably do a certain amount of harm.  I feel a difficulty in this debate, principally because we have had no clear statement on this particular subject we are discussing, and one cannot depend entirely on the statements one sees in the newspapers. I do not think this House can do anything.  I think the position <Col N="463" /> is that whether or not this reduced estimate is passed by the Dáil it will not come before this House, and that all we can do is to talk.  I would like the Minister to make it clear first, is this simply a reduction in the delivery of letters to the houses?  Secondly, will there be a delivery, as before, every day to every post office in the Free State? If there is to be a delivery daily to every post office in the Free State, while I still think this proposal is a mistake I do not think it will be a national hardship.  If the letters are sent to the Post Office every day, then there will be no question, for instance, of tourists being handicapped, as suggested by Senator O'Farrell.  I would not like it to go out that tourists travelling in Ireland cannot get their letters every day, unless it is true.  I hope the Minister will deal with that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am still of opinion that this proposal is a political mistake, but I do not think that if you are maintaining a postal delivery to every post office that every evil set out in this debate is going to happen.  I am assuming there will be delivery to every post office.  I hope an authoritative statement will be made on the matter and that it will appear in the Press, so that whatever the harm is we will know what it is exactly and not get exaggerated reports spread all over the country.  In connection with the economies in the Post Office, I would like to know could the Minister give us any idea of the cost of the work done by the Post Office for other departments.  Is that estimated at all?  Are there any figures available?  If there are not, and if those are not credited to the Post Office we do not know the annual loss to the Post Office.  It used not to be done, but I do not know the present position.  I think if the country is to judge as to how much it can afford to lose or spend on the Post Office it should know what is the cost of the Post Office by itself. Senator Jameson suggested that Senator when in the country will not be able to get letters from the Seanad as at present, and that telegrams <Col N="464" /> would have to be sent out sometimes when convening a meeting of the Seanad.  That will not matter as these telegrams will be sent out by the Oireachtas at the expense of the Post Office.  If they are sent out no credit will be taken by the Post Office for that.  It will be just an additional expense.</P>
    <P>My opinion is the time will come when it will be recognised as wise to run the Post Office in much the same way as the Shannon Scheme, that is, as a business proposition&mdash; run by a board to make it pay as far as possible, and who would report annually on matters of policy to the Oireachtas.  If that were done Parliament could allot a specified sum which it would be prepared to lose, assuming there is a loss. Efficient managers would then in a business-like way decide on the best facilities they could give the country, and we would not be from time to time grumbling against or criticising proposals of this kind with very little knowledge.  The proposal for a reduction in the number of days of delivery of letters seems to me a bad one.  I can only repeat that I think it would be far better to have a business board on the same lines as the Shannon Scheme which would report annually and get instructions from Parliament as to conducting the Post Office as a business.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the present proposals with regard to three-day deliveries in the rural areas will, to a large extent, nullify the good that would accrue in the way of prosperity and employment from legislation dealing with agriculture that passed through the Oireachtas.  We had great hopes that the Dairy Produce Act would induce the farming community to do everything possible to produce the best article and to market it in a most satisfactory way.  We were all very pleased to note the good results that have been produced.  This country was more than holding its own in the foreign markets, the price for Irish produce was going to the top, and we were beating other competitors <Col N="465" /> in the market.  If the Minister persists in proceeding with his present proposals I believe he will to a large extent nullify the good work already done.  In my opinion he should rather encourage farmers to produce the best and market it in the best possible way and with the greatest expedition.  I am not engaged in the agricultural industry, but I have sufficient business experience to know that people engaged in the handling of perishable food products must be in touch with the markets.  I think it would be a very retrograde step on our part to place the farmers, who, as has been said, produce from 70 per cent. to 75 per cent. of the wealth of the country m a worse position than the producers of other countries with whom they have to compete.</P>
      <P>I think it is all-important that the farmers who are doing their share in building up the country should be put in the position that they would be able to carry on their business on equally favourable terms with those of other countries.  If you prevent them from receiving their mails and from knowing how the markets are going on you are handicapping them in the carrying out of their business. I think it is a suicidal act on our part for the mere sake of saving £40,000 to inflict such a great injury on the farming community.  Some may think that the only object of the Labour representatives in interfering in this matter is because of the fact that the disemployment of 700 or 800 men is involved.  That, of course, is a matter of grave concern to us, and we think it ought not to take place, but at the same time we have sufficient knowledge of the business requirements of the people of the country to know that apart from the disemployment of 700 or 800 men you are going to inflict great hardship on the business community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason, I think the Minister ought to consider very carefully the whole position before he puts his proposal into operation.  He ought to consult the interests concerned. He is entering into this <Col N="466" /> matter very lightly.  Economy can be carried too far.  It can be false economy.  If you are going to save £40,000 in the Post Office Service and by doing so handicap the business community to the extent of £1,000,000, I believe that is false economy.  If the business interests concerned were consulted they would have no hesitation in informing the Government that it is false economy. We hear a lot of pessimism about the future of the country.  I have not time to waste on the dismal Jimmies who are knocking about.  I believe if the people got a fair opportunity, if they put their backs into their work, and if they were given encouragement instead of having obstacles placed in their way and indulging in false economies, we would be able to build up a prosperous and wealthy country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it might be said that every economy is a political mistake, because undoubtedly it is impossible to find any reduction which can be effected in public expenditure which does not arouse more opposition than support.  There are certain details in connection with the Post Office changes which I cannot deal with very fully.  Deputy Heffernan, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Post Office, was not able to be here, but I think I can deal with most of the points that have been raised.  The Post Office here is carried on at a loss, allowing it full credit for the service it gives to other Departments.  In 1927-28, the last year for which we have figures, there was a loss of about £264,000. That loss was incurred with a letter rate of 2d.  In Great Britain, with a letter rate of 1½d., there was a profit. The profit there was certainly due to the fact that there are crowded populations in Great Britain, while for the most part in this country there is a sparse population. The cost of delivery services over a sparsely-populated country is disproportionate to the revenue obtained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In rural areas the six-day-a-week services are being reduced to three. <Col N="467" /> In a great many rural areas at present there are deliveries on only three days, and those areas will not be affected.  Certain people in the rural areas will continue to receive the six-day deliveries.  Where the postman has to travel to a sub-post office the people along the route will obtain the six-day delivery.  Where the post office is situated in a village there will be a six-day delivery still in the village, and to any houses that can be reached by the postman out on his rounds.  Away from the sub-post office they will have a three-day delivery.  In answer to the question put by Senator Douglas, there will be a transmission of mails to each sub-post office every day. The postman will leave that sub-post office with mails for some part of the area around the post office every day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It may have been the case a thousand years ago, but I doubt it.  A great number of these services cut off were altogether uneconomic. The number of letters delivered was altogether disproportionate to the cost of delivering them.  Even with the three days a week delivery it will be very far from being economic, but we realise that postal services will have to be maintained, not merely at a loss to the post office, but to the Exchequer, and the question is whether it is essential to civilisation that there should be six deliveries a week.  You cannot set up a standard six-day delivery and say that is the irreducible minimum.  You may as well say that two deliveries a day is the irreducible minimum.  There are areas, say, in Dublin, where one delivery a day would not be sufficient or reasonable.  In those areas where a three-day a week delivery is to be instituted, we think that is a fairly reasonable service, all things considered. While occasionally some individuals may suffer inconvenience, the great mass of the people in those areas will not be detrimentally affected.  The ordinary farmer <Col N="468" /> through the country very seldom gets an urgent communication&mdash;a communication that would not do as well, say, on a Tuesday as a Monday. I was brought up in the country, and I do not think I ever saw a letter coming to the house that it would not have suited just as well to have received the next day. There may be, occasionally, people who do business of other sorts than farming who may require more frequent deliveries, and the change will be some inconvenience to a very small number of such people.</P>
      <P>I would be very glad if people could devise other means of saving the £40,000 or £45,000 involved. Senator Sir John Keane referred to a system they have in the United States and Canada.  I am informed the system there is that at some cross-roads there are 200 or 300 letter boxes.  There is a letter box for each family in the neighbourhood. When the postal vehicle drives up the postman goes around from one box to another and he puts the letters into them, and the various families come down, some from half a mile or a mile away, and each, having a key for the letter box belonging to them, can open that box and get their letters.  There is no interference with the boxes.  It would take a good time to accustom the people here to that.  I do not think they would like it anything better than the arrangement proposed. I am afraid that with such a system here, for a considerable time the boxes would be subject to interference, and the arrangement could not be so easily worked.  With regard to the men who are likely to suffer loss of employment, I think I have mentioned that in each village there will be a delivery.  Senator O'Farrell made a reference to Glengarriff being affected by a reduction in the delivery of letters.  There will be a delivery there, and I do not think the tourist traffic will be affected at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the men who will be disemployed, it may be that a considerable number of them have no other employment. There is supposed to be an investigation <Col N="469" /> or an inquiry before a man is employed as a part-time deliverer to make sure he has other means of earning his livelihood.  It may be that an examination of that kind is in some instances merely casual.  It is quite probable in a number of cases that after appointment men may lose their other employment, and it may be that a considerable number have no other means of livelihood.  There are, we believe, a considerable number who have other resources.  In dealing with the reduction of these deliveries every consideration will be given to the men affected.  In some cases it may be that the amount of pay to the men engaged will be reduced, and that the men employed will be retained.  In cases where there are two men one may go and the other take the two areas on alternate days and receive the same money as at present.  In dealing with the matter the Post Office will take all the care it can to insure there is a minimum of hardship.  It is too much to ask us to accept the views of the men who are to be discharged. A considerable number of them hold other employment.  It is suggested that the whole of these men are going to be put on the unemployed list, and something like permanently, but I do not think that is so.</P>
    <P>If we were to accept the arguments made in this case we could not reduce the number employed in any branch of the State service, and we could not, as we have done, been able to reduce the numbers of the Army.  We would be simply tied to the present expenditure in a great variety of directions.  I think that while it is necessary to give all the consideration that can be given to the circumstances of the individuals, we cannot take the view that the State must not disemploy anybody who is in its employment.  I do not think that the analogy suggested by Senator O'Farrell with reference to tariffs applies, and that the purpose of tariffs was to help people.  Tariffs were imposed <Col N="470" /> for the purpose of creating a new source of production.  It was not a case of deciding to provide an amount of money out of the Exchequer so that certain people might continue to be uneconomically employed.  The position in regard to tariffs was to impose some burden, or at any rate the possibility of some net burden, on the taxpayer in order that an industry might be established, might strike root, and might provide a permanent source of employment for those engaged in it, and who would be employed ultimately without any charge to the general taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I think in this particular case it is a question of alternatives.  Have we alternatives before the Post Office which do not involve any unemployment, and which would enable the money to be saved?  If alternatives could be put forward whereby the daily deliveries could continue, and the money could be saved, we would be glad to receive them, and I am sure the Post Office would accept them.  It comes down to a question of alternatives.  When we were looking over our expenditure, and doing what we could to avoid putting a heavy additional impost on the taxpayer, we had to explore all the avenues that seemed to be open, and we could not just simply turn a blind eye to one of them.  It may be that if we had not attempted to carry out any economy we might not have had so much complaint as we are likely to have, and we might have been able to get a majority to impose any additional taxation that might be required.  I think it is only looking at one side of the case to assume we may have taken the better course in doing that.  I think it is wrong to assume that the imposition of taxation for some uneconomic object does not itself affect the country as a whole, because if increased taxation caused no unemployment, then the line we really ought to take is lavish expenditure. No Government can hope that economies will be popular, and no Government can hope to receive <Col N="471" /> other than criticism when any reduction in expenditure is effected, nor can we expect to receive much other than criticism when any reduction is effected.  But I think it is entitled when a case is made against a particular reduction to ask those who criticise to study carefully whether there are other alternative ways of getting the money, and not merely suggest that that particular saving should be cut out.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator Moore about the C.I.D., I would deny altogether that there is indiscipline in the C.I.D.  I do not say that cases of indiscipline might not have occurred.  In any police force can you avoid having occasional cases of indiscipline; in any police force can you avoid some occasional wrong-doing by members of that force?  But I do say this, that the Government, the Department of Justice, and the heads of the police, have consistently and promptly punished any cases of indiscipline that have been brought to their notice, that no indiscipline has been allowed to continue, and that if, on all the facts of the case, it is shown that any member of the police force did wrong, and that he did that wrong either wilfully or through culpable negligence, he will be punished for it.  In punishing men for acts, all the circumstances, of course, will be taken into account, and the errors which were made.  If they seem to have been acts that were not quite correct, seem to have been made entirely in good faith, without any animus against any individual, they would naturally be looked upon in a different way from acts that were done through personal animus, or were done with the deliberate knowledge that they were wrong.  In certain other cases, extreme provocation would serve as some measure of excuse, and all things would have to be taken into account, but no growth of indiscipline and no practice of indiscipline will be, or has been, permitted.  I know nothing about the individual case the Senator referred to.  I saw something in the newspaper about <Col N="472" /> the trial.  That is really all I saw. I do not know it at all.</P>
    <P>With regard to frequent arrests in Dublin lately, the police are acting there under Government instructions, with a view to rooting out the gang of people who have been firing at jurors and witnesses, and generally attempting to hold up the administration of law, and so far as that is concerned, the Government is determined to deal with that with all the vigour that is possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Connolly referred to the Civic Guard.  I do not say that no reduction in the Civic Guard would be possible.  As a matter of fact, some time ago the Government decided to stop recruiting for the Civic Guard, and so long as that decision holds it means that a reduction in the number of the Guards will take place, because the ordinary wastage is somewhere between 150 and 200 yearly.  Members of the force fall ill and have to retire for reasons of health; members join other police forces, where they are better paid; members occasionally want to go to America, and occasionally members have to be required to leave, so that there is an annual wastage of between 100 and 200 men, and as long as no recruiting takes place a process of reduction in numbers will be going on.  But I do not believe a considerable reduction, which was the term used by Senator Connolly, can be effected.  As was indicated by other Senators who spoke, and I think recognised in Senator Connolly's own remarks, the police here have duties other than the duties that police in certain other countries have.  For instance, they have the enforcement of the School Attendance Act, which gives a great deal of labour to a member of the force in practically every barracks.  They are dealing with the preservation of rivers, the collection of agricultural statistics, and other matters, and even if you take a particular area and are able to say that the police in that area are not fully occupied, it does not follow that you could <Col N="473" /> withdraw them from the area. Sometimes the presence of the police is the only thing that prevents a considerable measure of crime.  There have been cases where various sorts of both petty and serious crime has been rife, and by putting a number of Guards in the area, normal conditions have been restored; but, in most of these cases, if you were to withdraw the Guards, you would have a recurrence of the evil which existed before they went there.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in the Dáil a week ago, I would like in some parts of the country to have a trial made of the village constable system, which they have in England, and if it worked, and if it could be extended, then the possibility of a considerable reduction would certainly be opened up.  But there are areas of the country where, I think, you simply could not try it, where, as I said, you have the poteen tradition, and various bad traditions, traditions of agrarian crime, shall I say, that tend to bring the gun or some other lethal weapon into quarrels about fences, lands, and so on.  You have a great number of areas where, for one reason or another, it would be, at present, madness to work with a single policeman, who, in the carrying out of his duties, would rely on the support of civilians around him, and it is because there are only comparatively small areas where you could at present make any alteration in the present system that I think it must be taken that, while reduction might be effected gradually, no considerable reduction can take place.  The Government has tried to meet the difficulty that arose by imposing duties on the police that they had not before.  For instance, normally the enforcement of the School Attendance Act would have been done by special school attendance officers, who would have been paid by the county councils. The duty of enforcing that Act was given to the police, because it was recognised that where you have to maintain a barrack system with a group of four or five men, there must <Col N="474" /> be times when the men have not really enough to do, or have not as much to do as they ought to have; but because we do not believe we can alter to another system, or take them away, the object was to throw additional duties on the police.  In certain other respects additional duties have been thrown upon them, and it will, possibly, prove practicable to give them other duties.  But, while economies might be effected in these two ways, by perhaps some small reduction, and by giving extra duties to the police, I think what are called considerable economies are not possible, and to answer the question with which Senator Connolly began, I think the country is really getting value for the money expended.  It might be, if there was less expenditure, that there would be a great deal more police work to do, but that would not prove that better value was then being got for the money being expended.  To some extent it might truthfully be said that the less the police have got to do, the better value is being got for the money that is being expended on them.</P>
    <P>Senator Connolly asked whether the agricultural statistics were being properly collected.  I think they are.  A Guard who is collecting statistics goes into the house of a farmer, asks questions and takes his answers.  I do not know whether he ever checks them, or questions them, unless they seem to be in some way very ridiculous, but we must take it that the ordinary person when questioned about the number of acres that he has under potatoes, the number of acres he has under oats, and the number of cows he has, will give correct answers.  He has no reason for not giving correct answers, but if there are occasional errors they, perhaps, balance one another, and, on the whole, I think the primary statistics collected by the police give a thoroughly solid basis on which to work.  I do not think it would be possible to do anything more.  It would make it inordinately expensive to collect statistics if the police had to check the statements of the <Col N="475" /> people from whom they make the inquiries. When a census is being prepared, you have to take the statement of the householder.  You cannot have inquiries into his veracity, and I think nothing different can be done with regard to agricultural statistics.</P>
    <P>A Senator asked about the delay in the vesting of lands bought under the 1923 Act, and inquired if there were enough inspectors in the employment of the Land Commission. There are certainly enough inspectors. There have been too many.  As a matter of fact, concurrently with the Post Office reductions, a number of inspectors are being discharged. The difficulties, I am informed, are not on the inspectors' side at all&mdash;I cannot deal very fully with this&mdash; but on the legal side.  I understand that vesting has been going on for the last year or so very much more rapidly than before.  Such delay as has occurred has nothing to do with the work of the inspectors.</P>

      <P>I was waiting for the Minister to say something on the de-rating question.  That is of much more importance than the other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to de-rating, that is a very big matter.  It is a matter which has been receiving consideration for the past five or six months or more, and it is one on which I am not at present able to make any final or definite statement. In England, the cost of de-rating agricultural land is a very small fraction of the cost of the whole scheme.  I forget the exact percentage, but it is very small indeed. The big cost in Great Britain is the cost of de-rating premises where industries are being carried on.  It is estimated in Great Britain that after a few years the entire cost of the de-rating proposals will be defrayed from the 4d. duty on petrol.  So far as the Free State is concerned, de-rating along the same lines as in Great Britain would cost from £2,100,000 to £2,400,000.  The yield of 4d. duty on petrol would be about £300,000, so that the particular duty which in Great Britain, after a year <Col N="476" /> or two, will defray the entire cost of the scheme, in the Free State would defray from one-seventh to one-eighth of the cost of the scheme.  Then, if de-rating were carried out here&mdash;and I think I mentioned this before&mdash;its reactions on the whole problem of local government would be very serious indeed, because there would be county councils which would get 90 per cent. and over 90 per cent. of their revenue from the Central Exchequer, and it seems to me it would be entirely impossible to let local government remain in its present form, or perhaps remain at all, if de-rating were carried out.  In England the value of the agricultural land is a little over two per cent. of the entire valuation; in Scotland it is six per cent. of the entire valuation; in Northern Ireland it is thirty-eight per cent., and in the Free State it is sixty-five per cent.  I think if we carried out de-rating it would be impossible to allow local government to continue in its present form, because, undoubtedly, a county council which had only to raise one-tenth of its revenue by striking a rate, and which got nine-tenths from the Central Exchequer, would, one way or another, manage to indulge in an orgy of expenditure.  On the other hand, if the Central Government assumed control of services which are now locally administered, and paid for out of the rates, there would be no force at all that would stand for any limitation of expenditure. The local authorities, in connection with matters that they have to pay for out of the rates, are inclined to try to shift some of these things on to the Central Government.  But they have some realisation now and stand for it in public that service that is given has to be paid for, and that the cost has to be raised in rates, and there are disadvantages in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Central Government assumed control of services now run by local authorities the clamour for increasing them, and for running them on a more magnificent scale, would be almost irresistible.  I do not know whether by running these on a different, and a more costly <Col N="477" /> scale, any real advantage would accrue to the community.  That is one of the factors in considering de-rating.  The other is the question of revenue.  It would take very considerable series of new taxes to raise a revenue of £2,300,000 or £2,400,000. They would fall to a very large extent on the rural community.  In so far as they were raised by indirect taxation, they would fall, with certain additions, on the rural community. In so far as that additional revenue was got by imposing a customs duty, for instance, it would mean that the community would have not merely to pay the amount of the duty, but would have to pay the cost of collecting it, which would be very much more considerable than the cost of collecting the rates.  In addition to that, it would have to pay a profit on the duty to the wholesaler and the retailer here, and it might very well be that, in so far as money was raised by a customs duty, the agriculturist would be worse off than he was when he paid his rates.  In this country, it is a far bigger problem than in England and, as I have indicated already, that is illustrated in England where the effect of one tax, a tax on petrol, would give the revenue necessary, but here a similar tax would only give one-seventh or one-eighth of the amount necessary.  It is a very big complicated problem, and, as I said, it is one that has required so much consideration that it is not yet possible to make any pronouncement with regard to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is quite a simple Bill. Its object is to prevent the arrival in this country of the insect known as the Colorado beetle, a pest that attacks potato crops.  It has created considerable ravages amongst the potato crops in the United States of America for some years, has now got to France, and is practically endemic in France.  France is pretty close to this country, and, while there is no sign whatever that there is any likelihood that this pest will arrive in this country, nevertheless we want to make sure that in the event of any crops being found affected with this particular virus we will be in a position to deal with the matter.  Our potato trade is increasing every year and is a very important trade so far as the average <Col N="482" /> farmer is concerned.  Some years ago we had a big import of seed potatoes and, in fact, a considerable import of ware potatoes.  We have no such imports now.  We supply all our own seed.  We have radically altered the position: we have quite a considerable export trade, and it is increasing every year.  For that reason we consider that every precaution should be taken to enable us to deal with any threat to the purity of our supplies.</P>
      <P>We are in a particularly lucky position.  Northern Ireland has a very big potato trade, but the farmers there who grow potatoes are at a great disadvantage, in view of the fact that black scab is very widespread in that area.  We have it in only two areas, one in Louth and the other in Donegal, and, moreover, we have practically no other potato disease.  In view of the fact that the development of the export trade in potatoes has increased very much for the last few years, and that, generally speaking, the growing of potatoes is on the increase, we want to make quite sure that the reputation which we have at present for having pure line varieties and also varieties free from disease is put beyond any doubt whatever.  We are afraid that this particular pest has become endemic in France and in other areas quite close to our coast, and that possibly it might show itself in this country, and we propose to take precautions beforehand to deal with it in the event of its arrival.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill provides that, in the event of a crop being found to be affected by disease brought about by this particular pest, the crop may be destroyed and that compensation may be paid.  There are other provisions in the Bill, provisions to deal with not only a crop affected, but with the crops of neighbouring farmers. It is well known that if a contagious disease of this sort attacks a crop like potatoes, crops of potatoes grown by neighbouring farmers, while they may be free, may, at the same time, contain the incipient stages of the virus.  It is also provided in this Bill that in addition to <Col N="483" /> the provisions which deal with compensation for crops destroyed, there is an arrangement by which neighbouring crops may be inspected and certified.  That is really all that is in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrington</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain what is meant by paragraph (b) of Section 3, which provides that an inspector may charge a fee &mdash;&ldquo;such fee or other charge as the Department with the consent of the Minister for Finance may prescribe&rdquo;? Who is to pay the fee?</P>

      <P>(b)  impose in respect of any certificate given in pursuance of such order after an inspection, such fee or other charge as the Department, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may prescribe.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, it may be that crops are infected with this particular disease, and in the same neighbourhood, or, say, in the same county, farmers find that they are not getting the same sale for their potatoes in England, or in any other market they may have, by reason of the fact that the reputation of the county, the district, or the parish has suffered as a result of crops in that district being affected with the disease. They may then call upon us to inspect the crops and certify them, just as they call upon us at the present time in the case of growers of seed potatoes, to certify them where they propose to sell them in districts where mosaic or rough leaf exists.  We do that at present, and where these are inspected and certified the farmers get for them very much more than the cost of the certificate, in addition to their profit when they sell them as seed potatoes. Here, if this disease should manifest itself in some crop and the farmers ask us to certify their crops as being right and free from disease, we are prepared to do it.  But we think that because they will get a very much increased price by reason <Col N="484" /> of the fact that we give certificates they should pay, at least, some small charge in respect of the certificates. The amount is not specified in the Bill, but the Bill will enable us to settle with the Minister for Finance a small fee, after the usual arguments with the growers or their association.</P>

      <P>There is a reference in this Bill to an Act of 1877.  A few years ago a Bill somewhat similar to this against the Colorado beetle was passed in the British House of Commons. We have been a very long time in taking precautions against this pest.  We have fortunately escaped this pest.  I presume the Minister has some explanation from his experts who deal with plant diseases that there is more danger of this pest arriving in this country now than there was previously.  I understand from the Minister's remarks in the Dáil that it had appeared in France and was a serious danger there.  I do not know whether it has come to Great Britain yet or not.</P>

      <P>I understand that the spraying spoken of in this Bill is not the ordinary spraying that is carried out to prevent the blighting of potatoes; it is a separate spraying altogether, and the substance used is quite a different poison from sulphate of copper.  This is arsenic of lead, I think.  All those poisons put on the ground have a serious effect in other respects, especially on birds. The cause of the extermination of partridges in this country was generally admitted to be the sulphate of copper used in the ordinary spraying. I do not know if this spraying mixture is of the same destructiveness. I observe in one section of the Bill as regards compensation that <Col N="485" /> the Minister reserves to himself the right not to pay any compensation, because the word used is &ldquo;may.&rdquo; Would not &ldquo;shall&rdquo; be better, because if a man's property is destroyed he should get compensation, whereas with the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; it may be a matter of doubt?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Seanad requests the Government to take immediate steps to remedy the grievances of the town tenants in the Saorstát, whether by implementing the recent Report of the Commission on the subject or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reason for asking the House to accept this motion is because of my knowledge of the number of victims that there are owing to the delay in putting into operation the recommendations contained in the Town Tenants' Commission's Report. I will cite only a few cases in my own area of which I have actual knowledge.  I am aware that landlords, expecting that the tenants of small shops will get protection within a month or two because of this report, are rushing their tenants to court and getting orders against them.  People living in Talbot Street and in the North Strand Road are the special victims of that class of house-owner.  I am aware of the fact that in the North Strand Road within the past month three shopkeepers, one of whom has been in business for thirteen years, another for fifteen years, and a third for seventeen years, have been treated in this way. The man who has been in business for thirteen years built up a small business which helped him considerably in rearing his family.  It is a small shop, though it is covered, strange to say, by the Rent Act, but <Col N="486" /> in another Act there was a section which gave the house-owner power to demand possession, not to ask for an increase in rent or to give the tenant an opportunity of making any offer, and within the past week in this case an order for possession was given by the court, which was empowered to decide which was the greater hardship&mdash;to leave this small shopkeeper and this family there to continue to earn their living in it, or to give it to the shopkeeper next door, who wanted to enlarge his premises, and the judges, in their wisdom, have given an order that means that this small shopkeeper and his family must clear out.  I think that that is a hardship that this House, as well as the other House, intends that protection should be given against in any legislation we are to deal with.</P>
    <P>Of the other two cases, one man was in a shop for seventeen years.  I knew it well, and when he took possession of it, it was of little or no use to anybody and it was hard to get a tenant to take it.  This young man went into it, spent a good deal of money on improvements, and built up a successful trade, rearing a family in it.  To his great surprise, within the past couple of months, while the rent had been increased under the Rent Act from 25/- to, I think, 35/&mdash;I have not the exact figures&mdash;he was met quite recently with a demand from the landlord for £5 a week or that he should get out.  His next door neighbour built up a successful dairy business during the fifteen years he has been in the shop and has made a handsome and a substantial property for the owner by bringing trade to it which was not there before.  These two men have also been victims of the delay, and within the next month, if no protection is given to them, these three shopkeepers would be left on the roadside.  In Talbot Street there is a trader who also took premises that the landlord found it hard to get a tenant for, and as a result of his energy, ability and devotion to work, and very hard work, he has built up a substantial business.  The moment he turned the corner and <Col N="487" /> that the business became a success he got a demand, I am informed, for an increase of rent from £200 a year to between £400 and £500 a year.  It that is not profiteering and if it is not a class of thing that should be attacked by the Oireachtas I do not know what is.  I do not know what better work we could do than to afford protection for those people, and protection for tenants of small cottages.</P>
    <P>I know of a house on the North Strand Road, convenient to Newcomen Bridge, that in pre-war days was let for 9/- a week, and the landlord induced a young couple who were very anxious to get housing accommodation at any price, to sign an agreement to pay 30/- a week for a four-roomed ramshackle house, because when they went in they found it was ramshackle, and they had to spend their savings to make the house habitable.  I am told that the same kind of thing is going on on the South Circular Road, that the owners of houses which were previously let at 7/- and 9/- a week are asking £1 a week and are getting it.  People in Baggot Street are the victims of the same kind of landlords. In the case of these small shops, when the tenants have made them attractive by decoration and have built up a business by devotion to work, the moment they become a success the landlords demanded increases, in some cases amounting to four times the rent.</P>
    <P>I will not delay the House further. In putting down the motion I was hopeful that I would get some assurance from the Government, and I hope the House will press for it, that if and when they introduce legislation dealing with these matters&mdash;and I hope it will be in the very near future, to protect any further victims of this delay&mdash;where it is intended that people should benefit by the recommendations of the Town Tenants' Commission, that the houseowners will not be allowed to get away with these practices, and that some kind of retrospective legislation will be provided so that protection will be afforded to <Col N="488" /> tenants in cases where the landlords have demanded these fabulous increases of rent, and that the Government will see that these tenants will not be thrown on the roadside, as is bound to happen in the case of the three tenants on the North Strand Road that I have mentioned.  I feel confident that I am appealing to a sympathetic House.</P>

      <P>I was pointing out that my amendment requested the Government to give effect to the Interim Report of the Town Tenants' Commission on the working of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, 1899.  That report deals with this particular question.  The Final Report of the Commission is of a more general character and deals with the whole question of housing.  The housing question is one that has been spoken of and written about a lot. To attack it in its entirety would be a colossal job, and I think it is best taken in separate sections.  In that way we are more likely to arrive at some constructive conclusions and to make some positive headway than if we were to tackle the problem as one big question.  The question really has not been seriously tackled at all when we realise the few thousand houses that have been built here since the war period.  In Great Britain, up to the end of last year, they had either authorised the construction or completion under the 1923 and the 1924 Housing Acts of no less than 1,300,000 houses. Making allowance for the difference in population, our contribution to this problem is absolutely insignificant when compared with what has been done elsewhere.  We have barely made up the ordinary normal wastage.  We are only doing that, I think, in recent years, and that only in certain districts.  Before the war, we were supposed to be about forty thousand houses in arrears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We built no houses during the war period.  We have built a few thousand houses since, which, as I have said, barely keep pace with the wastage that is going on.  The position undoubtedly is a very serious <Col N="490" /> one.  We have only been tinkering with the question so far.  It is true, of course, to say that practically the whole problem is one of finance.  If money were available in a sufficient amount, a commodity for which there is such an urgent demand would inevitably be forthcoming in a short time in sufficient quantities.  The costs of building and of building materials have gone up enormously since the pre-war period.  It was not possible, in recent years, for builders to build houses and let them at an economic rent without a subsidy of some kind.  The position, therefore, is that there are many speculative builders who would be quite prepared to build decent houses if they were able to find purchasers for them, people who would be able to purchase them at the price at which they were built.  The trouble for those would be purchasers is to find the necessary money.  In that respect the banks are an impossible proposition.  No bank will, I believe, advance money now for the purchase of a house for a longer period than ten years, and that at a very high rate of interest.  In such circumstances the burden that would have to be borne is an impossible one for the average person, even the person of moderate means.</P>
    <P>It is just in this direction that the report of the Town Tenants' Commission on the working of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, would make a great step forward towards the solution of this problem.  The report summarises the nature of the Act of 1899.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, 1899, with the amendments introduced by the Housing (Ireland) Act, 1919, empowers the local authority for any area to advance money to a resident of a house within the area for the purpose of enabling him to acquire the ownership of that house.</P>
    <P>The conditions under which money is advanced are: (a) the market value of the house does not in the opinion of the local authority exceed £800; (b) the amount of the advance <Col N="491" /> does not exceed 90 per cent. of the market value; (c) the advance shall be repaid with interest, in weekly, monthly, quarterly, or half-yearly instalments, within a period not exceeding 50 years; (d) the interest shall not exceed ten shillings per cent. above the rate at which the authority is able to borrow the money; (e) the applicant resides in the house, or undertakes to begin residence therein not later than six months from the date of the advance, and (f) is not already the proprietor within the meaning of the Act of a house to which the statutory conditions apply.</P>
    <P>The great problem is the making of money available for local authorities to advance it for the purchase of these houses.  That Act was put into operation by the requisite statutory resolution by only a small number of local authorities before the war, with the result that there were only purchased under it 565 houses.  Of these, 358 were purchased in the City of Dublin.  As a result of their inquiries, the Commission gives a reason why that Act was not more widely availed of. Amongst the reasons given are: (a) ignorance of the facilities which it provided; (b) delay due to the elaborate procedure laid down; and (c) difficulty experienced by local authorities in obtaining loans for the purposes of the Act.  The majority of people in pre-war days were not anxious to purchase their houses. Rents were reasonable.  It was comparatively easy, in most districts, to get accommodation and even to change from one place to another. There was a general desire to shirk the responsibility which ownership of a house entailed.  The position, of course, has altered enormously since the war by the tremendous shortage in houses and the failure to make good even the normal wastage over a great many years.  In 1923, the Act was amended in Great Britain.  That amendment raised the maximum amount of the market value of a house to which this Act applies from £800 to £1,200.  The amount originally was £400.  It was <Col N="492" /> afterwards raised to £800, and in Great Britain it is now £1,200.</P>
    <P>The Town Tenants' Commission recommend that a similar amendment to the Act should take place here&mdash;that the market value of houses be raised to £1,200&mdash;as to the period for repayment, which is at present 50 years, their recommendation is that it should stand.  The Commission also recommends that advances be encouraged mainly in the case of people desiring to buy new houses or, say, in the case of speculative builders.  You do not relieve in any way the housing shortage by helping people to buy houses of which they are already the tenants.</P>
    <P>One result of the amendment and extension of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act would be to encourage the speculative builder again.  I believe that, in addition to whatever encouragement may be given to local authorities and to public utility societies, the private speculative builder should also be encouraged to make his quota towards the solution of this very important problem, and for one reason that you would encourage the building of a better type of house than is now being built.  We shall very soon, I am afraid, lose the very science of house architecture by the type of wretched shelters that are being erected at the present time.  It is a terrible commentary on what seems to be the awful necessities of the time when you find the Dublin Commissioners erecting three-roomed concrete houses along some of the finest boulevards around the Metropolis. Splendid new roads, like Griffith Avenue and others, are being lined with three-roomed concrete houses into which large families are being thronged.  That is inevitable, and means that in a very short space of time these areas on the outskirts of the city, and in some of the best parts of the city, will become slums. They will take away from the value of property in the vicinity and they are certainly no credit to the capital of Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="493" /> The Housing Bill that is getting a Second Reading in the Dáil to-day puts a premium on this type of three-roomed house, because it makes provision for the same amount of State grant for a three-roomed house as for a five-roomed house.  We must assume that this Bill will be an encouragement to public utility societies, public authorities even, and the private speculative builder to build the small type of house, because they will get the same State grant for it as for the larger type. The extension of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act would enable people, for whom there is no consideration at present, to get some consideration.  There are people in constant employment whose salaries or wages may not be very big.  But their employment is constant and fairly assured.  These people are desirous of providing themselves and their families with something approaching decent accommodation. In Dublin, for instance, unless they have a minimum of six in family their application for a house is ruled out according to the present regulations. Now, the ordinary decent citizen would like to have all his children born in decent surroundings. He does not want to have to wait to have the first six born in a slum area in order that he may qualify for one of these Dublin Corporation concrete houses.</P>
    <P>This Act would also make provision for the young married couple to start life in decent surroundings.  It would enable people of that type, who are prepared to make big sacrifices in other respects in order to have a decent home, to enter into arrangements with a speculative builder and buy a new house in that way.  The Commission, in their recommendations, suggest that money might, in the first instance, be advanced under certain statutory conditions, and providing that the speculative builder would be repaid as soon as he sold the house, the loan eventually being made to the purchaser of the house.  The object of that provision is that it would save <Col N="494" /> double stamp duties.  That is a useful recommendation, because if each person had to go and make arrangements for the building of his own house it would mean enormous expense and be quite an uneconomic arrangement.  The recommendations of the Commission take all these considerations into account.  They put forward provisions that are capable of overcoming any difficulties that may arise.</P>
    <P>There are plenty of examples of this type of legislation.  I find that, towards the end of last year, in the New South Wales Parliament a Bill of a somewhat similar character was introduced.  It was known as the &ldquo;Government Savings Bank (Housing) Amendment Act.&rdquo;  The Premier in explaining the Bill, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Under the first part of the Bill the Savings Bank Commissioners were authorised to erect homes for eligible persons who would be required, in the first instance, to have only 10 per cent. of the cost of the dwellings, including the land which they desired to acquire. The title would be vested in the Commissioners, and the intending purchaser would enter into a contract with the Commissioners for the purchase on terms which would allow of the discharge of the liability in instalments within the reach of persons of moderate means.  The Commissioners would provide up to 90 per cent. of the total cost of land and dwelling. The maximum amount they might furnish under the Bill was £1,200, but it was intended that for the present the limit should not be more than £1,000.  A term of 30 years would be allowed for the purchase of brick or concrete dwellings, and 20 years for the purchase of wood or wood-frame dwellings.</P>
    <P>That is what is being done in the New South Wales Parliament.  It is making exactly similar provision to that which has been suggested in the report of the Town Tenants' Commission here.  Similar arrangements are being made in other States of the Australian Commonwealth.  All really <Col N="495" /> that is necessary is to float at intervals a housing loan and make substantial sums available for local authorities as an inducement to them to adopt this Act, and so that they could deal with applications without undue delay.  The purchaser of the house, of course, pays back the principal and interest on an annuity basis, with the result that it may not cost one penny to the taxpayers or the ratepayers of the country. What a splendid thing it would be if, by that means, we could build, say, 10,000 additional houses, apart from anything that the local authorities are doing.  In concluding their remarks, the Town Tenants' Commission really sum up the arguments in support of this proposal.  They say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Assuming that the amount of labour requisite for building operations and the production of materials is available, without having to be withdrawn from other productive undertakings, and assuming that an undue proportion of the expenditure has not to take the form of purchase of foreign building materials, the advances made to facilitate building operations are all wealth-producing advances. The measure of this production is not to be found merely in the sum-total of the new houses erected.  A much wider complex of potential resources are made actual.  The amount immediately expended upon the houses which afford the security for and eventually repay the loans, passes through a succession of hands and implements a succession of transactions of all kinds&mdash;the State itself all the while, through a variety of channels of taxation, earning a fair commission on the expansion of business that is promoted. Just as the effects of a tightening of credit (due frequently to causes which seem small in proportion to the results produced) are felt in every direction. so the bringing into play of such a large security as would be brought into being by the erection of, say, 10,000 new houses would have <Col N="496" /> widespread beneficial reactions.  In a sense, a nation as a whole lives by its expenditure.  If the nation is to be prosperous, the expenditure must be both large and wise; if the expenditure is either restricted or foolish, prosperity declines.</P>
    <P>That Report was signed by people who are anything but vague and irresponsible visionaries.  It is signed by Mr. Justice Meredith, as Chairman; Mr. John J. Horgan, of Cork; Mr. J.J. Murphy, the Chairman of the Electricity Supply Board; Mr. M.P. Rowan, a Dublin trader; Mr. P.J. Byrne, Principal Architect in the Board of Works, and by the Secretary, Mr. John B. Hughes, Registry of Deeds Office. This is the Interim Report of the Town Tenants' Commission.  It is sold by Messrs. Eason &amp; Son for 3d., and is well worthy of study by anyone interested in the housing question.  It is certainly a Report that deserves the consideration of the Government.  Here it is not a question of giving a free grant.  It is merely a question of making a few millions of money available, by way of a loan and on excellent security and under proper safeguard, and bringing into being a source of wealth in the way of rates, while at the same time giving much-needed employment.  It directs a way of making a very material contribution to one of our most crying national and social problems at the present time.  The recommendations of the Commission apply, of course, not only to the cities and the urban centres, but also to the rural districts. The Small Dwellings Acquisition Act could be applied by any local authority that passes the necessary statutory resolution.  To that extent its ramifications would be more wide-spread in the benefits they would bring to the community than any mere legislation affecting town tenants in the ordinary sense of the word.  I hope that the Seanad will pass the motion and the amendment, even if it be only with the object of drawing the attention of the Government to this matter and inducing <Col N="497" /> them to give practical consideration to what, in my opinion at all events, is one of the most serious and practical proposals that we have received for the solution of this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">

      <P>On a point of order, I would suggest that it would be much better to word the resolution in this way:&mdash;&ldquo;Resolved, that it is desirable to remedy the grievances of town tenants, etc.&rdquo;  It seems to me that this is not a very proper method for the Seanad to recommend the Government to do something.  The Seanad should either pass a resolution of that sort or itself bring in a Bill for that purpose. I think to pass a resolution amended on the lines suggested would be more consonant with the dignity of this House than to ask the Government to bring in a Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that this question of town tenants of houses, both in the towns and the country, is receiving consideration from the Seanad.  I hope it will be fully debated from every point of view, because it is in many ways a very thorny subject.  I am in favour of the resolution proposed by Senator Byrne, and of the amendment proposed by Senator O'Farrell, with certain limitations, however, and any criticism that I may have to make on the resolution and the amendment will be, I think, in favour of making the legislation more liberal than is proposed.  There are two fundamental difficulties in relation to this question.  The first is that any great restriction in the right of ownership, and in the powers of an owner, will result in the complete stoppage, perhaps, of speculative building.  That is one point.  Another matter which has to be considered is that no doubt the sitting tenant is, as Senator Byrne has suggested, very often subject to oppression.  This question is wholly unlike that of the land agitation, with which we are so familiar for the past forty years.  The head landlord, that is the feudal landlord, in <Col N="498" /> many cases throughout the country charges only the ground rent.  The rack rent which the sitting tenant ultimately pays goes to the middle-man, or more frequently the middle-woman. I know of many cases of widows and others dependent entirely on the profit rent which they derive from houses in the towns.  These are the two fundamental problems which face us when dealing with a question like this, and they form the reason why the agitation in respect of houses in towns was not taken up as part of the land agitation.  But although these difficulties arise, I think it is not beyond the power of Parliament to deal with them.</P>
      <P>I see that in the final report of the Town Tenants' Commission the Commission are in favour of what used to be known as the three f's&mdash;fair rent, fixity of tenure, and free sale. I think that with certain reservations, and with such limitations as to see that justice is done to everybody, these three principles ought to be accepted.  Free sale is the only remnant of feudalism which exists in the relations between landlords and tenants in property in the towns. It is the law that if there is a covenant against alienation in a lease that any attempt by a tenant to sell his interest is absolutely void.  I think that should go, and instead of it there should be substituted a provision that the landlord should not be entitled to object to a sale of land except for good and sufficient cause. That is the tendency, I think, of modern legislation, and it is the tendency of modern thought.  Therefore, I think no harm could be done by allowing the tenants of house properties the right to free sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, what about a fair rent?  Why should not the tenant in a town be entitled to have his holding at a fair rent?  But the question arises, what is a fair rent?  You will sometimes have to consider, and you will find tribunals which will have to decide what the fair rent is, to decide between the rich and prosperous tenant and the very needy middle-man or middle-woman.  Still, I think if the <Col N="499" /> principle of a fair rent is accepted we should have no objection to that. Now we come to the other question, fixity of tenure.  Why not fixity of tenure?  There frequently arises a case where a man has only one house.  He makes a letting of that house for a year, or for two or three or four or five years.  In the course of time he may require that house for himself or his son.  That was the main difficulty in the Act of 1906. Very frequently it was found a man who built a house was more in justice entitled to possession than the man who was sitting there as tenant, so that there are many things to be considered.  I think the principle can be accepted of fixity of tenure, free sale and fair rent, provided there is the over-riding principle of justice and fair dealing as between the parties concerned.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that if these principles are adopted they will have a certain effect on the speculative building of houses.  In all probability they will dry up the sources of supply altogether and you must be prepared for that.  It seems to me the only way to deal with it is by accepting the amendment of Senator O'Farrell, or some modification of it. If I proceed to criticise the speech of Senator O'Farrell it should not be taken in any hostile attitude.  I would like to see the proposal in that amendment made absolutely and entirely effective.  Senator O'Farrell says that we ought to put into operation the provisions of the Act of 1899, as modified and extended by other Acts.  The principle of the Act of 1899 was that it made available to local authorities monies to enable a willing tenant purchaser to purchase from a willing landlord vendor, and it provided that the tenant purchaser should have one-fifth of the money in cash.  That was a fatal blemish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now one-tenth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>It was amended to one-tenth.  There were very few transactions under the Act of 1899, and the reason was that when the <Col N="500" /> tenant was willing the landlord was not willing, and when the landlord and the tenant were willing the tenant had not the 20 per cent. to pay in cash, so that it made the Act absolutely and entirely nugatory.  It was applied only in Dublin and three or four other districts in Ireland.  All through the rural areas it was entirely ignored, and the framers of the Act might have known it would be a failure, because they had the experience of the Land Purchase Acts, which were conceived in the same spirit.  The first of the Land Purchase Acts provided that one-fourth of the money should be paid in cash by the tenant.  That was the Act of 1869.  Then came the Act of 1881, which had the same vice.  The State was to advance a certain amount of money and the tenant was to plank down cash.  The Act was a failure.  There were no sales under the Act, and then the legislature had to resort to a device which I think my friends will have to resort to. There is no use in expecting a purchasing tenant in a town or elsewhere to put down one-fourth or one-tenth of the cash, for it is more than a year or two years' rent in advance, and they will not and cannot pay it.  Another plan will have to be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think those considering this measure would do well to study what was done under the Land Acts when the tenants were refusing to pay money in cash.  I think my friend Senator Barrington will remember all these matters.  The plan was adopted of providing for a guaranteed fund, and one-fourth of the purchase money was allowed to remain in the hands of the Land Commission as a guarantee that the instalment of the annuity would be paid.  In that way Land Purchase proceeded, without any necessity on the part of the tenant to put down any cash whatever, and the landlords' deposit, which remained as security, remained there, of course, earning interest, and in that way, although the Land Purchase was an absolute failure, so long as the tenant was required to pay cash, when this procedure was <Col N="501" /> adopted the wheels of land purchase were greased, and the sales of land proceeded in the regular way.  I think it will be found that procedure such as I have indicated will have to be resorted to.  There was another reason why the Act of 1899 was a failure.  It was sporadic in its operation.  A house might be sold here and a house 20 miles away, and the costs were prohibitive.  There were the costs of the landlord, the tenant's costs, and the costs of the tenant's counsel.  A landlord was disinclined to go into the title of his entire estate for the purpose of effecting a sale of one house.  That is a matter which will have to be considered.  If advances are to be made for the purchase of a dwelling house, just as they have been made for the purchase of holdings on estates, the operation must be carried out on an extensive scale, and it must go not by houses but by estates. These are a few of the objections which occurred to me as having been the cause why that very beneficial Act of 1899, which seemed on its face to be so reasonable and beneficial, was a failure.  These reasons will still operate if the amendment of Senator O'Farrell is accepted in its entirety, unless you make some provision whereby the tenant can become the purchasing tenant without making any lodgment whatever in cash.</P>
    <P>I stated at the beginning what I considered the effect of Senator Byrne's motion would be if carried out, and I see nothing to stop it now. I see no reason why it should not be carried out, but we must face the consequences, and the consequences will be that speculative building of houses for the sake of the rent will necessarily come to an end.  Something else will have to be adopted in its place.  I think Senator O'Farrell has suggested what ought to be adopted&mdash;that the State should come to the encouragement of the speculative builder.  I think it would be quite feasible to introduce legislation which would legalise an agreement between a speculative <Col N="502" /> builder and a prospective purchaser, and that a house or house would be built to the order of the purchaser out of the money to be advanced by the local authority or the State.  If proper supervision were adopted I see no reason why there should be any national loss.  The Act of 1899 contemplated that the extreme limit of loss under its provisions was to be one halfpenny in the £ in rural areas and one penny in the £ in towns.  With such a measure as Senator O'Farrell has indicated, and with such improvements as I think could be made, I see no reason why the State should lose on this.  I think the State would gain very considerably, because there is nothing more hideous and nothing more destructive of individuality than the series of uniform little habitations that are being constructed in the most beautiful sites around our cities and towns.</P>
    <P>What are these three-roomed little houses for?  A man and his wife can live in them, but a man and his wife cannot bring up a family in them. They are all uniform, they are all miserable, they are all machine-made, and, they will all result in a machine made population.  I am entirely in favour of encouraging individuality. I am glad that Senator O'Farrell takes that view, and I hope he speaks, as I am sure he does, for the Labour Party in this question in favour of allowing a prospective purchaser to have some choice in the kind of house in which he has to live Leave it to private enterprise, and in that way I think you will get greater variety in the habitations not merely of the poor but in those of the better classes.  You will get a greater return for the money expended because the operation of house building under the plan proposed would not be so much officialised as it is at present.  Therefore I urge upon the Seanad to consider favourably both the motion proposed by Senator Byrne and the amendment, which is really an expansion of the motion which has been proposed by Senator O'Farrell.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. Bagwell Mr. Bagwell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to speak against the motion both in its <Col N="503" /> orginal and amended form.  There is much in the report of the Town Tenant's Commission with which I do not agree.  I do not propose to go now into detail on the subject, because I do not believe any useful purpose would be served by my doing so.  There is no Bill before us, but there is going to be one.  When that Bill comes before us we can deal with it on its merits and according to our varying points of view. To vote for this motion now would be, in my opinion, to say that everybody who votes for it voted as if he thoroughly understood and belived in everything in the Report.  It is a very difficult and complicated subject, and I gravely doubt whether members of this House are really competent to call on the Government to legislate on the particular lines put before them having regard to the difficult and complicated nature of the subject.  I do not propose to discuss the subject and I intend to confine myself to the principles involved.  I wish to make it clear that the reason why I am voting against the amendment is that we have not a Bill before us. I am opposed to any further interference with freedom of contract.  I do not say that in some respects that might not be done without doing much harm, but I believe that in a Housing Bill there would be interference with freedom of contract, and the more interference the greater will be the difficulty.  Senator Comyn foresees some difficulties.  He is in favour of the motion.  He takes a different point of view from me, but he recognises that this kind of legislation will result in there being no speculative building of houses, and no private building of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you built by private enterprise to make speculation pay, and if that had been left to itself, I do not think there would be as much housing difficulty as there is.  The proposal now before the House would make things very much worse.  I believe the cure proposed is worse than the disease.  Further, I would like to point out that there is nothing like the analogy there would appear to <Col N="504" /> be between this question and the land question, because in the one case by no amount of legislation could you reduce the amount of land.  It is there, and the people would still go on producing food from it, but by legislation in the case of houses you could reduce the supply, and that is what I think would come about if this thing is driven too far.  As I have said, when a Bill comes before the House I think it will be time enough for us to grapple with the problem in detail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that I would go quite as far as the Senator who has just spoken in my opposition to the amendment, for I think there is contained in it the possibility of going towards a statesmanlike solution of the housing question.  The proposal that loans should be advanced to enable houses to be built and to secure the repayment of the loans by means of a sinking fund is, I think, an admirable method of dealing with the problem, for it enables individuals to own their own houses once and for all.  It encourages private possession and, as Senator Comyn says, that individuality which essentially centres around the home.  I do not think it will be denied that a satisfactory settlement of the housing problem goes nearer to the root of our difficulties than anything else.  At the same time it makes me blush to think what we could have done with the £8,000,000 we voted for the Shannon scheme of electrification.  I believe, from a social point of view, that money could have been better spent on the sound financing of housing schemes.  Senator Byrne sought to excite our pity by references to certain cases within his own experience. I do not question there are hard cases.  There are always hard cases when questions of scarcity arise. It applies to any commodity which is scarce.  The prices rise and there are hardships, but when such rises are uneconomic the system is only in a transition stage to the supply of capital and the evoking of enterprise to take advantage of these conditions <Col N="505" /> of scarcity.  The whole cycle of trade is involved in that.</P>
      <P>If you never had any inducement to people to invest you would never have any progress or development. For that reason you should not attempt to regulate this scarcity by control, and create a static position which immobilises capital that might with advantage to the community go to the solution of the housing question.  We will have the opportunity of going into this question. It is a question on which, though we take different points of view, we should try and get a satisfactory solution.  I would invite the attention of the House to the main principles involved in the final report of the Town Tenants' Commission. It is a very complicated report, and I suggest that in many respects it is imperfect.  If you were trying to draft a definite measure on that report it would give you nothing but a few very general headings, and it would not help you at all in the essential details that would be necessary in an Act of Parliament. In essence it is perpetuating this method of Government control.  It is practically holding up the operation of all contracts connected with the whole existing housing question. It purports to give the tenants the three f's which were mentioned by Senator Comyn.  Senator Bagwell told us the conditions were more simple and rational in connection with land legislation.  It enables, on the expiration of a lease of a so-called tenant, the person who owns the lease to go before somebody very vaguely defined, to obtain a renewal of his lease on the terms of a fair rent, of which there is also a most complicated definition and which will only serve those lawyers, solicitors, and a whole mass of officials and people who will get additional employment under the complexities which this measure will create.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To give you one instance in passing: attention is frequently directed in this report to the equities of the tenant.  In the case of a leaseholder, <Col N="506" /> that is a person who holds the lease, at its expiration that person, or his predecessor in title, having built the house, is entitled to certain equities and increments in consequence of past expenditure. What are the facts?  As we know them that house was possibly built eighty or ninety years ago and the lease has passed through several hands, and in every case has been bought on its wasting value.  In many cases these leases go at nominal sums on account of the short period they have to run, and they have little value as a reversion. According to this report, apart altogether from the total breach of contract involved, you are giving a windfall to a certain party to a contract who is not entitled to it, and who never expected it when he bought the reversion.</P>
    <P>Take the position of ground landlords. They have been valued periodically, when estates pass on their reversionary values.  As leases are shorter the values have been placed higher, and death duties have been charged on increasing values on short term leases.  It is most unjust to come along and cancel the whole of the contracts on which no values have depended and on which the State is benefiting in the form of taxation.  But that is only a small part of the proposal.  It is further proposed, as far as I can make out, that every occupier&mdash;there is no suggestion as to a limit&mdash;a person paying £400 yearly in rent or a person paying only 2/- weekly, can go to this court&mdash;either the District or Circuit Court&mdash;and question the reasonableness of the rent; they can simply go and say they are being charged an abnormal rent&mdash;whatever an abnormal rent may be&mdash;and you lay this whole question open to litigation, valuation and all the delays which that sort of thing involves.  I ask the House to pause seriously before giving a vote on that question because it is really fundamental, I submit, and altogether wrong, with the experience which you have got of the land courts, and of the delays and expenses which they involve, and <Col N="507" /> the inhibitions they produce, that we should now start for the first time to set up this hierarchy of officials that must necessarily be involved in a matter of this kind.  What would be the result?  The result would be that house property would not be an attraction for any form of investment and you would not get the speculative builder or anyone else to come along and take the chance of supplying houses which are so badly needed.  Once you start to bring this matter down to State regulations, and State control and interfere with contracts you will never be able to say: &ldquo;This is where we draw the line and will move no further.&rdquo; You will always have apprehension on the part of any investor that the law will be extended to cover future building; as it is proposed to cover previous building.  You have it written all over land legislation which began with yearly tenants only, but which extended to leaseholders, and finally everybody was roped in.  You will have the same pressure.  Eventually capital will not come.  All essential housing needs will be thrown upon the State. We know what that means, and what an uneconomic thing it will be.  I hope the House will content itself, without passing the amendment, with giving it much more serious consideration, and not be carried away by individual cases of hardship, such as the Senator quoted, and wait until this Bill appears before committing itself to the principles of the Report of the Town Tenants Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Senator who has just sat down and Senator Bagwell have read rather more into Senator O'Farrell's amendment, in fact, than appears in it, because unless they are denying any grievances of town tenants, or, if admitting that there are grievances, they deny that there should be any legislation to remedy them, they might as well support the motion of Senator Byrne, because it asks that the grievances be remedied, whether by implementing the Report or otherwise, so that both Senator Bagwell and Senator <Col N="508" /> Keane could quite legitimately support the motion as it stands.  I want to refer to the Report of the Commission in some degree and leave Senator O'Farrell's statement regarding the importance of the Interim Report to suffice, because I think the argument he has used has been conclusive and has not been answered by any of the critics.  I think there is a question as to what is going to be the effect of implementing the Report of the Commission in respect of a class of houses not mentioned by Senator Byrne.  It appears to me that what was in the mind of the Commission in making their Report was the house held under a lease, or a house and shop, a town tenant as he was known a few years ago, as distinct from a householder, who occupies a house for domestic reasons alone, and who is not interested in the question of business premises.</P>
      <P>The question of the restriction of rents is touched upon in this Commission's Report, but it is not clear yet to me, although I have read the Report several times, what is the recommendation of the Commission in regard to the ordinary house tenant. If the Commission's Report in regard to the establishment of a fair rent tribunal is to be put into operation and to be made applicable to house tenants, then I think the position of the house tenant will be worsened as compared with the position he occupies to-day, or ought to occupy.  I stand definitely for the position that in time of famine of any commodity the owner of the goods ought to be restricted in the price he should be allowed to charge for these goods.  Senator Bagwell or Senator Keane, or both, made some reference to the effects which would follow in respect to house building and the effects that have followed&mdash;the shortage of house building that has followed restrictive legislation.  One would have more faith in that argument if it could be shown that there had been a consistent supply of houses to meet the demand before there was any restrictive legislation.</P>

      <P>Pre-war there was a very distinct shortage of house building and a fall-back in the number of houses being built, and the attraction to the capitalist to supply capital for house building, apparently, was not as great as the attraction in other directions.  Whatever the explanation, there was undoubtedly a failure of house building in pre-war days.  There are probably 80,000 houses in the Dublin area, and those 80,000 tenants will be in the position, unless there is an extension in the period, which has been more or less promised&mdash;but not very definitely promised&mdash;during which the Rent Restrictions Act shall operate, that they will be quite definitely at the mercy of the landords, with regard to the rents they will be charged after the end of June.  I think it would be quite defective to trust to the operation of a Fair Rent Court to protect the ordinary working-class tenant from overcharges by the house owner.  If the tenant has to go to the court to be protected the difficulties are too great, and unfortunately, unless a very strong organisation develops, and a great deal of agitation develops, to arouse the interest&mdash;and, shall I say, the animosity&mdash;of the tenants, the tenants will be mulcted in charges which they are at present protected from.  The needs of the case, to my mind, are very distinctly that, while there is a shortage of houses there should be a restriction in the amount chargeable by the landlord for the use of a house, and in so far as the Report of the Town Tenants' Commission fails to recommend such a provision, I think that the Report of the Commission is faulty and should not be followed.  I would like the House to bear in mind that it is desirable&mdash;I think it is necessary&mdash; for the peace, order and good government of the city and the country that house tenants should be protected against charges for rents which more than suffice to pay a fair interest on the capital originally invested. Of course, Senator Sir John <Col N="510" /> Keane will quite appreciate the point that it is a fundamental divergence of view, that this doctrine that there should be no interference with freedom of contract might be justifiable and defensible if there was equality of power between the persons concerned. But when you have the case of a man and a woman needing shelter, and unable to buy or to build shelter for themselves, and who are therefore at the mercy of the owner of the shelter, there is no freedom of contract&mdash;the freedom is all in the hands of one man, and the other party is virtually in a position of dependence and semi-slavery. So that one cannot speak of freedom of contract in such a matter.</P>
      <P>Therefore, in so far as the Report of the Town Tenants Commission is concerned with the house tenant it fails, in my opinion, to recommend proper protection for the house tenant, and is not satisfactory in that respect.  I think what Senator O'Farrell seeks to achieve in the amendment would in time go far to remedy the evils of the present situation arising from the shortage of houses, as compared with the demand for houses.  When that amendment would have had full effect, when houses had been built, either by local authorities or by private speculators, to meet the demand, there would be something like equality, and then one might think seriously of removing the restrictions. But until that day comes I hope that the restrictions will continue.</P>

      <P>I want to correct a few misunderstandings before the motion is put.  Senator Comyn referred to the cost of the purchase of a house, arising out of the administration of this Act.  It is recognised in the Report that that is exorbitant, and the Commission made recommendations by which that cost could be materially reduced.  The Senator pointed out what is, of course, correct, that to a considerable number of would-be purchasers one-tenth of the price is a matter for consideration. It may be of interest to him to <Col N="511" /> know that the rents now charged for houses that are built by speculative landlords are just ten per cent. per annum of the sale prices of the houses.  For instance, in the case of a house that is worth £1,000 they charge at least £100 or £110 a year rent.  I know a house recently built the sale price of which was £800, the rent of which is £87 a year where they have not been able to sell.  So that the would-be purchaser has only to produce one year's rent in advance in order to meet with the requirements of the Act, and many people pay as much per year for a flat or for a very poor house as would enable them to pay one-tenth of the price of a very decent house.</P>
      <P>Senator Bagwell has apparently mixed up the Final Report of the Town Tenants Commission with the Interim Report, with which the amendment deals.  The Interim Report is certainly not a complicated report; it is quite easy to understand. The Final Report may be complicated, of course, because of the wider nature of its survey.  He said that the amendment suggested that everybody would build houses for everybody else.  Of course, that is not the case.  All it does mean is that it should make money available on annuity terms to enable people to buy their own houses or, in other words, to build their own houses, and pay back the principal and interest. It would impose no burden on anybody except the person who purchased the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be differences of opinion, as I said, with regard to the Final Report.  I could not accept the Final Report in its entirety; neither could Senator Sir John Keane, and to that extent we could agree on the <Col N="512" /> amendment, which cuts out references to that.  I take it that Senator Byrne is not particularly keen on it, because he says &ldquo;or otherwise,&rdquo; and to that extent the motion, as amended, while it does support the Interim Report, does not bind the House at all to the Final Report of the Commission.  For that reason, I hope it will be possible for the House to accept the motion as amended, because I take it that Senator Byrne is not objecting to the amendment.</P>

      <P>I agree with everything that Senator O'Farrell has said.  He said it much better than I could.  I hope in the very near future that the housing problem will be tackled by a great national movement.  I think it is the duty of all Irishmen to unite on this problem, a problem that does not belong to any one Party.  I think the bulk of all Parties should get together and try to deal with the housing situation as it exists to-day. I hope that the House will accept the motion as amended.</P>

      <P>The larger Report of the Town Tenants Commission was stressed by Senators.  I think that they were justified in stressing it, because, after all, Senator Byrne's motion was: &ldquo;That the Seanad requests the Government to take immediate steps to remedy the grievances of town tenants in the Saorstát.&rdquo; Those grievances, when they are being considered, will surely entail reference to the Report of the Town Tenants Commission.</P>
      <P>Motion, as amended, put and declared carried.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7 o'clock.</P>
