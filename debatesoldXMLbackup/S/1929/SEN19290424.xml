    </Speaker>
    <P>It is somewhat unfortunate, in my view, that the Standing Order regarding motions is couched in such a way as to make it necessary that a motion which may be the basis of a Message to the Dáil should be as bald and skeleton-like as this motion is.  One cannot get a proper understanding, I think, of the spirit in which this motion was put down by reading it as it stands on the Order Paper.  It is quite a misconception to imagine that in putting down the motion in this form I was animated by any idea of a tit for tat, as suggested. My intention is that the Message should not be in the nature of a reply churlish, or a counter-check <Col N="167" /> quarrelsome, but rather of the retort courteous, and I think the circumstances are such, that this is the most appropriate occasion that is likely to arise for a considerable time, when the question which was discussed in the early days of 1923 should be reconsidered.  I do not want to enter into any argument as to the merits of the case for a change of any kind in the remuneration of Ministers, or the allowances to Senators or Deputies, but I do want to make the case that the time is opportune for reconsideration in the light of the experience of the past seven years.  I have already given a little indication of what is in my own mind regarding this matter, and I do not intend to repeat that, but I think, when we remember that what is now embodied in the Statute governing these matters was the result of consideration, in the rather hectic days of 1922-23, and at a time when nobody knew what would be the calls upon Senators, Deputies or Ministers, or what the circumstances would be, or what was a fitting sum to allocate for these respective purposes, the time is opportune for reconsideration of this question, without prejudice.  I do not even want to refer to the circumstances in which this matter has come before us, and I am far from imagining that there should be anything in the nature of a dispute between the two Houses.  I sincerely put this point: That the matter, having been raised, it provides an opportune occasion for a full reconsideration of the question, in the light of the experience of the last six or seven years, and it is solely with that view, and without any controversial idea in my mind, that I move the motion.</P>

The matter was dealt with in the other House last week, and the reasons were given by the Minister for taking the course which it is proposed to take here to-day. An emergency has arisen in the affairs of Ennis which could not be dealt with, save by legislation, which involves this Bill.  It is a matter of urgency, and that is the reason why this Bill should secure legislative form on the earliest possible occasion.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Housing Bill, 1929, be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a continuation of previous Housing Bills that we have had, except that there is a <Col N="169" /> new departure introduced in this one.  On the 28th November last this House had another Housing Bill before it in which powers were taken to increase the amount of money that was to be made available under the 1925 Housing Act. During the debates on that Act I said that in my opinion it was only tinkering with the problem, and the proof that the statements that were made then were correct is the fact that in a few months we have another Housing Bill introduced to provide another £200,000 in order to encourage the building of working class dwellings.  In the former Acts the grants allotted to local authorities, public utility societies or private persons were for the building of five-roomed houses.  I should say that there was a grant for three, four or five-roomed houses of so much per room.  It is the experience of those who have practical knowledge of house building that if you build bigger houses and get a bigger subsidy that that is more economic. But, under this Bill there is a new departure, as the subsidy that is being given is to encourage local authorities, public utility societies and private speculators to build three-roomed houses.  I do not say that there is no necessity for some three-roomed houses, but I say that it is a bad policy to introduce at this stage the building of three-roomed houses, because every effort was made under the Housing Acts that were passed to see that the largest families were first provided for.  I speak with some knowledge of conditions in the City of Dublin when I say that you must have a large family to-day to get a house erected by a local authority.  That being so, we know that a large proportion of the large families inhabiting the slum dwellings in Dublin have not yet been provided for, and I think the time is not opportune to start building three-roomed houses.  It is all very well for people to say that we must begin with three-roomed houses as they are much better than one-room tenements in a slum.  It must be admitted that such houses are a great improvement but, at the <Col N="170" /> same time, the type of family that requires to be housed in Dublin is too large to put into a three-roomed dwelling.  That is the reason that I think the time is not opportune for building three-roomed houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I can see, under the provisions of this Bill there will be three-roomed houses and, at the outside, four-roomed houses, because the amount of the subsidy will be the same for a three-roomed house as for a five-roomed house.  Under former Acts the amount of the subsidy was given according to the number of rooms.  Local authorities and public utility societies got £20 per room and private builders got £15 per room.  The total amount of subsidy to be given under this Bill will be £45 in the case of a private speculative builder, and £60 in the case of a local authority or a public utility society.  I think it is an unwise policy to put a clause in this Bill that will in practice bring about the erection of three-roomed houses only.  I noticed that when introducing the Bill the Minister went out of his way to lecture local authorities on their inefficiency, and took advantage of the opportunity to bring out the shortcomings of the people who were in control of local bodies. Of course, a good deal has been said with regard to the type of person that was on these local bodies, but the fact ought not to be lost sight of that when the people with property would not face the music a few years ago and act on these local authorities, it was the splendid men and women with no property who had to step into the gap.  When the British Local Government Board was being defied it was felt better to have poor men and women who had no property on these boards.  If they were not selected because of their efficiency and of their knowledge of local administration, I think it is unfair that every opportunity is taken to belittle the work that these people tried to do.  Those who selected them for the local bodies are the very people who are loudest in their condemnation.  The argument was used also for the purpose <Col N="171" /> of bolstering up the Commissioner system.  The Minister pointed out several cases where with Commissioners in charge, with efficient management, they had reduced the rates.  Of course, the Minister did not tell us what methods were adopted to reduce the rates.  Any public body could reduce the rates, but could they give efficient service?</P>
    <P>When I read the Minister's statement I was thinking that the sooner a commissioner was brought into the Department of Local Government the better.  It would be in the interests of efficiency to do something like that. When we hear so much talk about the economic policy with regard to the building of houses, and get down to the position where building will be economic I remember that on the 28th November last, only a few short months ago, the Oireachtas spent a considerable time, and so did the officials of the Local Government Department, and the draughtsman preparing a Housing Bill, and now on the 24th April we have another Housing Bill produced.  I think there is inefficiency somewhere, and I would go so far as to say that if the cost and all the time of the officials of the Local Government Department, the Minister's time, the time of Deputies, the printing as well as the time of the members of this House had been put into the Bill in November, 1928, the saving, I think, would provide a couple of dozen houses.  I think the people who are always talking about inefficiency elsewhere should look round at their own particular departments to see if everything there is as highly efficient as it ought to be.</P>
    <P>On a Housing Bill, as usual, comment is made about wages and output of the operatives engaged in the building industry.  As usual the spokesman of the building trade employers took advantage in the Dáil to attack the wages and conditions of the building operatives, and to make comparisons with the wages paid elsewhere. He wanted houses to be built that could be let at an economic rent.  We all want that but, if you <Col N="172" /> want the workers to pay an economic rent for the houses they are to occupy then you have got to pay them an economic wage that will enable them to do so.  As far as I can see this talk about subsidising housing for the working classes is in reality subsidising employers to pay bad wages because if the employers were compelled to pay sufficient wages that would enable the workers to pay economic rents.  Of course we have the usual tears shed over the poor workers who live in the slums, who never got sufficient wages to enable him to pay an economic rent. It would be more honest instead of weeping over the unfortunate workers and the slum dwellers if the people were paid sufficient to enable them to pay economic rents for houses.</P>
    <P>Nobody can oppose this Housing Bill, because no matter what type of house is being erected the problem is so desperate that we cannot afford to oppose any measure put forward to deal with the housing shortage. There is no necessity for me to go over the ground again.  We have for five or six years pointed out the policy that ought to be adopted with regard to housing.  I am still convinced that from this problem arises practically the whole of the social evil from which we suffer, and that it will not be solved by these piecemeal measures, that some proper authority must be set up to deal with it.  The Government will have to adopt some methods similar to those adopted with regard to the Shannon scheme, give control to responsible people, fix the responsibility upon them, and give them money, before the problem can be dealt with.  There is no use talking about the workers' wages and that class of thing.  That will not solve the housing problem.  Some people will never be in a better position, so far as wages are concerned, until they arrive at the happy position at which the Aberdonian arrived when he wanted to build a house.  As usual, the Aberdonian wanted to build in the cheapest possible way and he hit upon a brilliant idea&mdash; and I hope the Deputy in the other <Col N="173" /> House, who is always referring to the wages of the workers, will never be in the same position&mdash;he rang up the Lodge and asked them to send him a few Freemasons.  Under this Bill the Minister has asked for £200,000.  A sum of £200,000 will not go very far in dealing with this problem, but, nevertheless, we have to support this Bill.  It is going to do something, but, at the same time, I regret that only three-roomed houses will be built under the Bill.  I admit that a certain number of three-roomed houses may be necessary, but, taking into consideration the type of family that is to be housed, I think the time has not yet arrived when we should start the policy of building small houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister is replying, perhaps he would be able to inform us of the number of houses that have been built by private enterprise under these various schemes.  If the Minister could give us a summary of the figures it would be a great help to us.  There has been a number of schemes and, unless one studies them closely, it is rather hard to know what is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a matter to which I would like to draw attention which was not referred to by Senator Farren.  Section 7 of the Bill provides that it shall be compulsory upon local authorities to give the stipulated rate remissions in the case of houses coming within the Bill.  Under previous Acts the Minister had power to make rates remission compulsory where the local authority did not give the rates remission. I hope that he will either exercise that power where necessary, or that he will make this Bill retrospective for at least a year.  I have one glaring instance.  The administrative area of the County of Dublin is giving neither grants for the erection of houses nor the rates remission in respect of those houses.  A number of schemes that I know of are built by private speculators, but they are doing very useful work, building good houses and decent <Col N="174" /> houses, much better than anything being erected by a local authority, and they are setting the majority of those houses at the lowest rents at which one could reasonably expect them to be set.  But the Dublin County Council has refused to give any grant&mdash;the Government have given the grants provided in the Act &mdash;and in addition to refusing to give a grant, the County Council refuses to give the remission of rates.  That means, of course, that the tenants will have to pay higher rents, or that when the houses are sold higher prices will be obtained for them. That is going to make it very difficult to set or to sell these houses, and the result will be a slowing down if not a complete discontinuance of building by private speculators. That is the attitude that has been taken up by this beggarly County Council that surrounds this City of Dublin, where housing is such a terribly acute question.  They refuse to give any encouragement, good, bad or indifferent, to the erection of houses.  I do hope that the Minister will exercise his statutory powers and make this reactionary body carry out its civic duties by at least granting the remission of rates.  The County Council would lose nothing by it, because every new house means more rates, although it may be only one-twentieth the first year, and it is no cost at all to them to grant this remission.  I know one private speculator who was refused on the ground, as stated by one of the officials, that it made the keeping of accounts very difficult.  That was the excuse that was handed out for refusing to grant the remission of rates to help what is, in my opinion, the most desirable form, apart from the local authorities, of assisting in the solution of the problem by encouraging the private speculator to build.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to add my protest to that of Senator Farren to the Bill placing a premium on the three-roomed cottage.  It looks as if in the new order, to which we are all looking forward with such confidence, the three-roomed concrete shack is to be the basis of our urban civilisation <Col N="175" /> for the future.  No private speculator, no public utility society, or, for that matter, no one who wants to make a profit of building, is going of necessity to build a three-roomed house as against a four or a five-roomed house.  There is an immense amount of hypocrisy in our public lives, and an immense amount of it creeps into our legislation.  We will have the Committee Stage of the Censorship Bill to-morrow.  One of the main provisions of that Bill is a provision prohibiting the very mention of birth-control. To have large families is to act in accordance with good citizenship, and in accordance with the best form of Christianity.  But side by side with that Bill which encourages large families we have this Bill, which places a premium on the three-roomed house to house the large families.</P>
    <P>The three-roomed cottage means two wretched rooms and a little kitchen.  If you give to the parents and, say, a baby one of these rooms, you have to pack the whole of the rest of the family&mdash;there may be six or seven, or ten for that matter&mdash; into the remaining room.  Fancy the condition of affairs that obtains in such a house as that when babies are being born, when secrecy and privacy and some sort of Christian decency are necessary.  Unless the woman is taken away to a hospital, where she will have to pay something she is not able to pay, you have the most gross indecency and scandal taking place under those conditions.  The Oireachtas should not give its imprimatur to the three-roomed basis of civilisation.  It may be tolerable in country districts in the old farmhouses that have two very large rooms and a very large kitchen.  In the case of those houses the kitchen would be as big as the whole of the three-roomed house we are discussing, and there are wide open spaces and fields about there.  In that type of house it is easy to put up a bed in the kitchen.  The conditions there are quite different from those in the crowded areas that we find in our cities and large towns.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="176" /> The argument that a three-roomed house is infinitely better than a one-roomed tenement is the argument of a fool or a knave.  On the very same basis it could be said that if you built only one big room, instead of the small rooms that people occupy now, it would be an improvement, and consequently justifiable.  Could you not also put forward an argument in favour of a two-roomed house instead of a one-roomed tenement? That is not an argument at all.  In the other House the President indicated that the difference in cost between a four-roomed house and a three-roomed house was about £20 per house.  Supposing we erected a thousand of these little cottages in the City of Dublin, packed into them the poorest of the poor, people who have large families, what a fearful scar and eyesore they would be in the capital of Ireland.  What would be the difference between the cost of these thousand three-roomed houses and a thousand four-roomed houses?  Twenty pounds a house, or, in other words, £20,000.  This State may be fairly poor, but I think it would pay it to make a present of the additional £20,000, and save the city from the scar and the eyesore it would become by erecting a thousand slum-producing cottages.  When the housing shortage is less acute than it is to-day, and when it will be, I hope, much easier to get decent houses than it is to-day, these cottages will remain as an eyesore; they will have developed into slums in a very few years, and then we shall be faced with the task of rebuilding them or of clearing them out, as we are faced with the task of clearing out the tenements to-day.  In my opinion, it would be far better economy, far better statesmanship even, to make a free grant of the difference for the four-roomed house than to give a grant at all for the erection of three-roomed houses that will only result in producing new slums in what should be the finest portion of our city.  They are now building on decent sites and in decent surroundings, and they are ramming in these three-roomed houses that will pull down the value <Col N="177" /> of decent property around them, that will destroy what should be the suburbs of our city.  Instead of being an actual contribution to the housing shortage, it will make one of our principal difficulties in regard to housing and town-planning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken the trouble to look through the discussions on this Bill in the Dáil with a view to finding out what is the policy which the Government is pursuing in regard to housing.  For some years now it has been urged that we should treat the housing problem of the country as a national problem that can only admit of a national solution; that it is not being tackled with energy or with a full view of the evil which it is intended to surmount.  I gathered in the course of an examination of the discussions in the other House that a statement of the Government's policy can in fact be extracted from the speeches made there, and I want if I can, in the absence of any Government statement introducing this Bill, to summarise as fairly as possible what I consider to be the Government's policy with regard to housing.  They tell us that since 1922, including the sum provided in this Bill, a sum of £2,050,000 in State grants has been made available for house building.  The policy has been to give as generous subsidies to private builders as to local authorities and utility societies, with a view to attracting private capital into the business of house-building. Since the £1,000,000 grant of 1922, voted by the Provisional Government, which was a £2 to £1 grant to local authorities, there has been a succession of Housing Bills with grants.  Certain limitations have been inserted in some recent Bills, until the Bill that is now before us appears to encourage the local authority and the public utility society rather than the private speculator, and to encourage the smaller house rather than the larger house.  It has been found&mdash; and apparently it is the view of the Government&mdash;that the policy of the past having led to the revival of the <Col N="178" /> building industry and having stimulated it into action, that action, having found its outlet in the main in the building of the larger houses, should now be diverted to the building of smaller houses.  It is thought that the activity of the private builder will continue at the lower subsidy because of the fact that there has been a reduction in the cost of building, and that that reduction is rather more than is commensurate with the reduction in the subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told that there has been a reduction in the cost of building in Dublin, for instance, of fourteen per cent. for a certain class of house, and as high as twenty-nine per cent. for a certain class of house in Cork city.  It is intended, I gather, that the policy of reducing subsidies will continue until there is a complete abolition of subsidies, presumably in the near future, and I venture to guess that the reason for the delay in the introduction of this Bill was the hesitation as to whether the subsidies should not stop altogether for private enterprise houses.  However, it is indicated as the definite policy of the Government to abolish subsidies in respect of what they call the ordinary working-class houses, as distinct from slum dwellings, and to rehabilitate slum dwellers, it is thought that these may be the subject of continued State grants.  But in respect of what is called the normal housing of the working class in Dublin and the large towns, that problem, if it is to be solved, must needs be solved by the operation of the ratepayers alone; that if, apart from the slum workers, housing is to be assisted by a subsidy of any kind, it must be assisted by a charge on the rates.  I commend that statement of policy&mdash;which I am quite prepared to have a denial of from the Minister if I am misrepresenting it, but I think I can give him quotations from the columns of the various debates which will justify what I have said&mdash;I commend that statement of policy to those who are thinking of the de-rating of <Col N="179" /> either industrial buildings, or other class of business enterprises in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is claimed that the cost of building a house during the last seven years has come down steadily under the Government's housing policy, and it appears to be claimed that it was the deliberate intent on the part of the Government, in pursuing the policy that they have pursued, to bring down house-building costs.  But it is said that further drastic reductions are necessary&mdash;&ldquo;the further driving down by external circumstances, or pressure if it cannot be brought about by conference, of the cost of building.&rdquo; That appears in Column 1,758 of the Dáil Reports.  I would like a little explanation of what is meant by &ldquo;driving down by external circumstances or pressure.&rdquo;  Now, the policy in the last eight years, including that in the present Bill, has been to build houses, as I have said, for the better-off working people and for others who are better off, and, as a result of that policy, when the programme in this Bill is completed, there will have been 21,600 houses provided, at a cost to the taxpayers of £2,050,000.</P>
    <P>That is in respect of past policy, and when challenged as to what is the future policy, the Minister said: &ldquo;It is to provide another 21,000 houses.&rdquo;  Now, those other 21,000 houses have to be built in the main without Government subsidy.  What is the problem that this policy set out to solve?  The problem was to build 60,000 houses.  Certain discounts have been made from that figure, but as late as 1923 it was declared by the Local Government Department that the working-class housing needs of the country were about 60,000 houses, about 10,000 being needed in rural areas, 10,000 in small urban areas, and 40,000 in the large towns and cities.  It has been said that that was a rather generous estimate.  Perhaps so.  But in that six or seven years there has been a steady deterioration, a wearing out of houses, so that even though it was a generous estimate in <Col N="180" /> 1923, or in 1919, there has been such a decline in the condition of many of the houses which were on the point of being unfit for use at that time that the owners of houses have refrained from spending upon rehabilitation or strengthening or improvement.</P>
    <P>The problem was 60,000 houses, of which 40,000 houses were needed in the large towns and cities.  How has that problem been met?  I think Ministers have taken rather an undue pride in their housing efforts of the last seven years.  We were told by the President, I think, on the introduction of the first Housing Bill, that in fifty years before the war no more than 10,000 working-class houses had been built in the Free State.  Since 1922 how many houses have been built in the Free State? One would imagine that the effort has been a tremendously successful one.  The fact is that something less than 10,000 houses in urban areas have been built in those seven years; with all these Housing Bills only 9,500 have been built by the aid of State subsidies in the towns and cities of the Free State.  There were in 1913 in the city of Dublin more than 20,000 families living in one-roomed tenements.  The number of one-roomed tenements in the city of Dublin is not quite so high to-day, but the number of people living in one-roomed tenements is considerably larger to-day than it was in 1913.  In 1913 73,973 was the number of people living in families occupying one-roomed tenements in the city of Dublin, and in 1926 there were 78,934 persons who were members of families living in one-roomed tenements in Dublin, an increase of, say, 6,000 persons, notwithstanding the housing effort.</P>

      <P>I got that information from the Report of the Unemployment Committee.  It is supplied by the Secretary of the Department of Local Government.  I understand that out of the 9,500 houses built in the towns of the Free State since 1922 something less than 4,000 have <Col N="181" /> been built in Dublin.  Four thousand houses in seven years!  Something about 20,000 houses was the figure stated in 1919 as needed then in the City of Dublin, and if it takes us seven years to build 4,000 houses, how many years will it take us to build 20,000 houses, quite apart from any deterioration or depreciation of existing property?  The Government's policy is to be continued, but with the deprivation of any subsidy.  We are to lose the subsidy, and the additional charge, if any is needed to encourage building, is to be thrown on the rates.  We are to wait for 35 or 40 years to have the housing problem solved on the present policy as stated by the Minister.  By the time that process has been completed many houses, no doubt, will have to be re-built.  A forty-year period for some of these houses is looked upon as a fairly satisfactory life, and when one remembers that the policy is that of tenant-purchaser&mdash;that is, selling to the tenant&mdash;and that the tenant is, in the main, a man who will not be able to afford much outlay on repairs and re-equipment, the tendency will be towards a rapid deterioration.</P>
      <P>I have commented upon the fact that there has been undue boastfulness on the part of Ministers as to the Government's great housing efforts in these last few years in face of the problem.  If all this kind of thing depends upon a comparison, what is the relative effort made in the Free State as compared with neighbouring countries which are comparable?  I read that in Scotland, which has a population of five millions as against our three millions, in the last four years 60,000, houses have been built.  In 1927, taking the figures for one year, more houses were built in Scotland than were built here in seven or eight years, including the scheme of this Bill.  21,660 houses were built in Scotland in 1927, and 19,799 in 1928. These figures are taken from the report of the Scottish Board of Health. But it may be said that in Scotland the problem is even worse than it is here in Dublin.  I think it is not.</P>

I can give the figures for England and Wales, but that information, I presume, would not be appropriate to the quotation which I have just now been giving.  But, let us take Northern Ireland, which has a population of one and a quarter millions, as against our three millions.  I gather from a statement made a few months ago by the Prime Minister for Northern Ireland that, since 1923, there have been built there 16,357 houses, and that by the month of April, 1930, 20,000 houses will have been finished in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;By the aid of, and as a result of, the Government's generous financial assistance.&rdquo;  Presumably that means a subsidy. What is the subsidy?  There is a State subsidy of £100, and a municipal subsidy of £40.  That applies to Belfast, but whether it applies to the other municipal areas in Northern Ireland I cannot say. From my information the Northern Ireland houses are not as satisfactory&mdash;they are not as good&mdash;as the houses that are being built in the Free State, and they will be slums at an earlier date than the houses here will be.  The Ministers in Northern Ireland are complimenting themselves upon the prospect that within a year from now in the cities &mdash;by the cities, I presume, is meant Belfast and Derry, but taking Belfast alone, the problem as it exists there was not nearly as serious at any time as the Dublin problem&mdash; the supply of houses will be equal to the demand for houses, and that there will be no need for a further subsidy.  They are offering a sum of £400,000 to be spent between March, 1929, and March, 1930, for the purpose of hurrying on the building <Col N="183" /> of working class houses.  We are contenting ourselves under this Bill with a sum of £200,000, though our problem is much more serious than the problem as it exists in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, on the question as to the provision of long term loans for housing purposes as applicable to urban districts and the smaller towns, Ministers have told us, in explanation of their policy, that they refuse to agree to the granting of long term loans while we have the present costs of building and the present rates that are being charged for money.  It is said that to do so would place a burden upon the ratepayer or the taxpayer and the purchaser of houses, or the tenants of houses in future years, that would be beyond their ability to bear.  Therefore, they tell us that we must wait until money terms are easier and building costs come down further before the Local Loans Fund will be made available for housing in urban districts.  If I may comment upon that, there has been, if not an actual encouragement, a fairly general consent to local authorities burdening themselves excessively by borrowing from the banks for a fifteen years' repayment period, and how that can be reconciled with a refusal to burden the purchaser or the tenant or the local authority for a very much smaller sum for a longer period, I cannot see.  We are told that the opinion&mdash;this is the Minister's statement on the Second Reading of the Bill in the Dáil&mdash;of the Executive Council is, that the continuance of the present scale, or even an extended scale, of subsidy would not solve the housing problem.  &ldquo;An extended scale or the continuance of the old scale would prevent the coming about of a drastic reduction in building costs.&rdquo;  Further, he said, &ldquo;Steadily, under the influence of the Government's policy, building costs have been coming down.&rdquo;  I think it is a fair inference to say that the claim made by the Government in justification of their past policy has been to go slow on house building so as to force down building costs. Building costs have come down as a <Col N="184" /> result of the Government's housing policy, and &ldquo;we will continue to go slow, because we must bring about a further reduction in building costs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know whether that was intended by the Minister, but it is a fair and a reasonable deduction from the statements Ministers make in defence of what I might call a go-slow housing policy.  Now, what justification there is for saying that an extension or an intensification of house building would raise building costs in this country I do not know. One would imagine that, in respect to building materials, this country determines prices.  That surely is not so.  There may be a local ring for the purpose of holding up prices occasionally, but, speaking generally, it is certainly not true to assert that the demand for building materials in Ireland determines their price in a world market.  But, presumably, there is a fixed conviction in the minds of Ministers that the policy they have been pursuing, which has resulted in providing something less than 10,000 houses in the towns of the Free State in seven years, has brought down building costs, and that the erection of another 10,000 houses in the next seven years will continue to bring down building costs further.  In the meantime, those 70,000 persons are going to be condemned to continue to live in one-roomed tenements in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I have said that the determination of the Ministry, presumably, is to abolish the State subsidy for house building, except possibly in respect to the re-habitation of slum dwellers.  I am not sure whether I ought to make that exception, but it is the deduction I draw from certain statements made by the Minister, and I hope that he will either confirm or correct what I am saying.  I want to know whether the statement of policy in regard to the future is the final decision of the Ministry which will determine their housing policy and whether they are really asking us to assume that the housing of the working classes can become within any reasonable time what is called an economic proposition? <Col N="185" /> I do not think that there is any reason to believe that the price of money&mdash;of credit&mdash;is likely to come down to a pre-war level for a very long time.  I do not know whether it is assumed that wages will come down to pre-war level, and I do not know whether there is any intention to adopt any other method of cheapening the cost of building working-class houses.  We from these benches, and our colleagues in the Dáil and outside, have advocated and urged that the building of working-class houses should be taken up as a distinct and separate function from the ordinary building operations of the ordinary building contractor.</P>
    <P>I want to direct attention to certain rather important facts which ought to be borne in mind by anyone who is thinking of this problem. People speak of the building contractors. One would imagine that where they are speaking of building contractors or building operatives in relation to house building, they are dealing with the largest proportion of those engaged in the industry. From inquiries that I have made I have come to the conclusion that, not more than 25 per cent. of the operatives in the building industry, are ever engaged upon house building. I take from the Census of Production Returns relating to building and construction, certain figures which go far to confirm that estimate. Out of a total gross output in 1926 of the businesses engaged in building construction, the total work done on buildings was value for £2,324,000, of which the building of working-class dwellings absorbed £475,525, or, say, 20 per cent.  The output of the building contractors was, therefore, only 20 per cent. in respect to working class houses. That is an important consideration that ought to be borne in mind when one is considering this problem, either in relation to builders as employers, or the worker-builders as wage-earners.</P>
    <P>I urge for consideration the proposition that the building of working-class houses is going to be facilitated and cheapened if there is construction <Col N="186" /> on a much wider scale than anything that we have known up to now.</P>
    <P>Somebody in the course of the discussions in the Dáil&mdash;I think it was the Minister himself&mdash;said they were encouraged to give larger subsidies to local authorities and public utility societies as against the private contractor, because of the fact that they were more likely to build in larger numbers than the private contractors, and that it was obvious that a cheaper house could be produced per house if ten were being built instead of one, or if a hundred were being built instead of ten.  That was the reason, amongst others, for encouraging the public authority and the public utility society as against the private contractor.  I carry that argument a considerable stage further, and urge that if instead of dealing with a hundred houses one were to think in terms of 20,000 houses over a period of years, building four or five or six thousand houses per year, one would be able to purchase ahead, to manufacture ahead, and to plan ahead, and generally to produce a cheaper house whether by mass production or by farming-out your contract to the private builder.  The larger scale construction would lead to better organisation on the job, steadier employment and no tailing-off at the end of a job, with the resulting loss that that undoubtedly involves. There you would find one means of cheapening costs without having to assume that the wage level of the people engaged in the trade was to be cut for the purpose of securing that cheaper cost.  You would get a lower price level per unit without anything in the nature of lower wages for the worker.</P>
    <P>The Minister was rather insistent upon what he called facing facts and getting down to realities.  There are some facts that I am going to ask the Seanad, and particularly the Minister, to take note of.  One of those facts is that, as far as Dublin is concerned, the people whom you are going to ask to occupy the newly-built <Col N="187" /> houses under this scheme, whether 3-roomed or 4-roomed, are in a very large proportion unskilled or semi-skilled workers with casual labour.  In the Occupational Census Returns, one finds that there are round about 32,000 persons out of a total of 94,000 occupied persons who are in the class of unskilled or semi-skilled workers.  It is probably within the mark to say that half of those are earning casual wages.  If you think of 16,000 casual workers out of the class of unskilled or semi-skilled labour&mdash;I say that is a generous estimate, and the number is probably a great many more, but I am trying to be within the mark in everything that I am saying on this &mdash;what are you thinking of as to the fund out of which they are going to pay the rents required for these new houses when you say they are to be built no longer out of a State subsidy and are to become an economic proposition?  Will anybody say that it is not too generous or too high an estimate to presume that the workers' average earnings in that period would be at the rate of 50/- a week? I think that if you were to go to a very large proportion of those casual workers and offer them 50/- a week all the year round, they would think that they were coming to affluence.  But I am assuming now for the purpose of this argument that the wages of these men average 50/- a week or £130 a year.  Take even a house which, after all expenses have been met, costs £300 all in.  The subsidy is £60.  That leaves the tenant, if he is a purchasing tenant, to pay the sum of £240 for his house.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the present charges made by the Dublin Corporation for houses recently built, the tenant would be required to pay about 10/- per week for his house.  That is a steady charge upon him.  It means 20 per cent. of what I assume to be the average earnings of that man.  It is based upon an earning of 50/- per week, though the probabilities are that his earnings would be much less than 50/- per week.  But the 10/- per week has to be paid, nevertheless.  I <Col N="188" /> think in the cost of living returns that were compiled in 1922 or 1923 the sum then given as the average amount being paid out of income for rent was about 6 per cent. on incomes of £3 a week.  When we speak of 20 per cent. of the income being paid in rent we are thinking in terms of 10/- per week out of earnings of the kind I have mentioned. That is the position as it affects probably one-fifth of the body of workers in the city of Dublin. In the country towns, where the average earnings are much less than 50/- per week, you will not cut down the cost of building to anything like the extent that would warrant an economic rent if the house subsidies are to be cut down.</P>
    <P>Again, to come down to realities, what are those realities?  One might say a considerable rise in the cost of materials and of administration since 1914, because that is generally the base year.  A rise in the cost of material, labour and credit, and the greatest of these is credit.  Take a £400 house.  The State and local subsidies amount to, let us assume, £100, or half the cost of the labour going into the building of that house.  That leaves £300 to be paid for in a period of 40 years.  From an examination of certain tables officially provided some years ago to a Commission on which I sat, these are my deductions: A five per cent. annuity loan would cost over a forty year period for that £300 a total of £699 6s. 0d., that is to say the tenant purchaser for his £300 has to pay £699 6s. 0d.  Let us assume for the moment that the original cost of £300 is to be met by 40 equal annual instalments of £7 10s. 0d. each, no interest being charged.  The amount to be paid weekly in each case of the constituent elements of the house would be&mdash;half the cost of wages&mdash;the other half being paid out of a subsidy&mdash; 1/- per week (the total cost of wages, assuming that the subsidy was not paid, would be 2/- per week); materials 1/4 per week, profit and expenses of administration 7d. per week.  But for the payment of <Col N="189" /> the usurer, the man who provides the money, the weekly charge to be paid by the tenant is 3/10 per week.</P>
    <P>So that assuming the whole of the wages were being paid for without any subsidy the usurer would be charging the tenant occupier as much as the whole of the building costs taken altogether.  These are the main causes of the problem.  That is, the service that is being paid for in this method of financing is one of the realities the Minister asks us to come down to.  This problem is not going to be easily solved.  It is not going to be solved by any action our Government may take, or anybody in this country, but if we could reduce the rate from 5 per cent. to 4 per cent. the tenant would be saved 1/- per week for 40 years; that is as much as if the labour costs were reduced by 25 per cent.  The workers in the building industry cannot regulate the rate of interest, nor can the employers in the building industry, nor the house tenants. My point is that it is a social liability, a burden which is abnormal, and which cannot be regulated by any of the individual agents.  The abnormal costs of house building due to high rates of interest should properly be borne by the whole social organisation as represented by the national Exchequer.</P>
    <P>If it is ever to be dealt with satisfactorily, it can only be done by State action, and probably by international action, but failing any action to regulate the rate of money-lending charges, surely what is abnormal ought to be borne by the community as a whole, and not thrown upon the individual employer, the individual worker, the individual tenant or house purchaser? So that it is fundamentally a point of disagreement when the Minister comes along and says that it is his purpose and the purpose of the Government gradually to adjust their policy&mdash;the policy of State subsidies&mdash;and throw any liability that may be required to bridge the difference between the workman's ability to pay and the economic charge upon the local authorities.  These are two ideas that have been talked so much <Col N="190" /> about in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and are now talked about in this country.  The idea of de-rating land cannot be reconciled with the idea of throwing the burden of bridging the difference of house building charges as compared with the ability of labour to pay an economic rent on the local authority.  These two ideas are irreconcilable, and are not deserving of the consideration the Government appears to have given to them.  I ask the Seanad and the Government to give some consideration to the effect of what I still call the &ldquo;Go slow&rdquo; policy with regard to housing upon the next generation of workers in the cities and overcrowded towns.</P>
    <P>Complaints are frequently heard about the lethargy of workmen. Occasionally I have travelled in crowded boats and railway carriages at night and tried to sleep.  I do not know what other people's experience might be, but the lethargy that such a crowded condition produced upon me would make it impossible for me to do any active work with any spirit if it were to be a continued experience.  If we are asked to assume that for the next 20 years it shall be the normal condition of the families of the workers that they shall be reared in overcrowded conditions, then that lethargy is inevitable as a result of sleeping for seven or eight or nine hours in crowded rooms.  Apart from any moral effects, the economic effect is bad, and ought to be taken into account in considering the cost of this problem to the community.  I agree with my colleagues in their denunciation of this policy of three-roomed houses.  I think I am right in saying that the Minister indicated it was not his intention to permit any considerable number of three-roomed houses to be built as a matter of general policy.  I would like to have made quite clear what is the intention of the Government in this scheme in regard to the proportion of houses which shall be three-roomed houses, especially in Dublin. A much larger number of three-room houses than I imagined have been built already in the City of Dublin. <Col N="191" /> I urge the Minister and the Seanad to give consideration to the plea that this problem of house-building for the working classes ought to be considered on a much broader level, a much broader plan, and dealt with as a national problem and not one that can be thrown upon the local authorities.  The tendency to throw the solution of this problem on small local authorities throughout the country is fatal to any expectation of its being solved in respect of those districts.  In regard to the City of Dublin, where the problem is probably at its worst, the proposal steadily to reduce the subsidies in the hope that you can build houses at such a price as to make it an economic proposition would mean that the workman would have to pay 15/-, 18/- or 19/- per week for a house where he now pays 9/-, 10/- or 11/- per week out of his 50/- per week.  That will have no result except to make new slums by the adoption of the policy of sub-letting small rooms.  I ask the Minister to take into account the problem from the point of view of the workmen. The vast proportion of the workmen who have to be catered for are casual labourers in receipt of small wages.  However high they may appear to be paid from day to day or week to week, when employed on the average over the year their earnings are so small that it is impossible for the workers to pay high rents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no enthusiasm for this Bill, because it appears to me to be only a tentative attempt to grapple with a great problem.  It is perfectly clear that there is a great deficiency of houses throughout the country, not only in Dublin, but in all the big cities, urban areas and rural districts.  This proposal to subsidise the building of small houses, and to limit the total amount of the subsidy under all the Acts to £1,200,000 is only tinkering with the question.  The Minister is approaching it in much the same way as the British Government in former times approached the question of land purchase in Ireland.  This Bill reminds <Col N="192" /> me very much of a clause in the Act of 1881 which imposed a limit as to the total amount of money that could be advanced.  If the Minister faces this problem in its entirety he will find support in unexpected quarters. Before I go into that aspect of the question, I desire to express my full approval of the condemnation that has come from the Labour Benches of the three-roomed houses, or the birth-control houses, as Senator Farren has described them.  I think 500 square feet is entirely too small. When 500 square feet is mentioned the ordinary individual does not visualise how small a space it is.  No room ought to be less than 16 feet by 30 feet.  The total floor space is 500 square feet in a house in which a family is supposed to be brought up. I thoroughly endorse the condemnation that has come from the Labour Benches in respect to these small houses.</P>
      <P>There has been a good deal spoken on this question.  The Minister in the Dáil expressed his views, and leaders of the Labour Party have expressed their views in the Seanad.  It seemed to me in listening to all that has been said that language is given to conceal thought.  What is the matter in controversy between the Government on one side and those who represent the Labour Party on the other?  Why do the Government talk of reducing costs, and why do the leaders of Labour avoid the question? The problem is, and it is better that we in the Seanad should understand it, that there is a certain number of operatives trained in the building of houses, masons, carpenters, and people of that description. Will they agree not to limit the output? I think if they do agree not to limit the output, and if they cooperate with the State in providing houses for the workers, the State ought to undertake this question in a larger and more generous spirit.</P>

If he brings in a measure to provide for such a programme, I am sure he will get general support, and the advantage of that programme will be that it will enable costs to be reduced not merely in regard to materials, but in every department connected with house building. For instance, it is quite possible with the assurance that there will be a continuous demand for cement and other materials that a cement factory might be started in this country. With that assurance rugs could also be manufactured.  Carpets, I think, are already manufactured in this country.  I think a comprehensive scheme of house building is the only possible solution of the problem, that is a scheme which would take into account the necessities of the case and provide for the proper housing of the people.  I think Senator Johnson entirely misunderstood me when I said there should be no limitation as to output.  What I meant is, that all parties should approach this question in a large and generous spirit. From what Senator Johnson has said I believe he is inclined to do that, because in the course of his speech I think I discerned a hint that he is in favour of a comprehensive scheme.  I <Col N="194" /> think that the limitation of the amount of the advances, and the suggestion about costs is a veiled reference, on the part of the Executive to the fear they have in their minds that in case there is a large scheme of housing costs will go up, not merely of labour but also of material. I am in favour of the Bill because it is to provide workers with housing. I do not support it with any enthusiasm, because I do not think it is comprehensive enough, and I do not think it gives an indication that the Minister has in his mind a plan for dealing with the entire problem.</P>

      <P>Prior to the Great War it was the practice that if people wanted houses and had the money, they built them.  After the war, however, a great change came and people expected the State to provide everything, and that applied particularly to the building of houses.  I agree with Senator Johnson when he says that this is a social problem, and that the Government should provide houses for those who cannot provide them for themselves. The experience gained from the working of the recent Acts has shown that it is necessary to have a change in policy.  I am with the Government in the direction which that change of policy has taken, but I am not in favour of the policy of the three-roomed houses.  Still, I take it, if Senator Farren's argument is that three-roomed houses are better than two-roomed houses, two-roomed houses are better than one-roomed houses.  Is it not better with the limited money at the disposal of the Government that they should build four three-roomed houses rather than three four-roomed houses?  The result of such a policy is that with the aid of a subsidy more houses will be built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Government will take my view, that we have no right to subsidise houses larger than four-roomed ones.  Let the people who want bigger houses build themselves without assistance.  The Acts up to the present have produced nothing but four or five-roomed houses, and they have not helped to any extent those whom it is the State's duty to <Col N="195" /> help.  For that reason, I think the change of policy indicated in this Bill is to be preferred.  I did not rise for the purpose of saying very much regarding this Bill, but I am interested in the position of the families who have been rendered homeless by the ravages of the sea at Greystones.  People had their houses demolished by the waves, and in order to help them it is necessary that some provision should be made in this Bill.  I intend to table an amendment asking for power to give in those particular cases a greater subsidy than is proposed under this Bill.  Are these 3-roomed houses?  Senator Comyn spoke of a large building programme, and so on. After all there is a limited number of operatives available.</P>

I am against this policy of a wholesale programme, with millions of pounds to be spent, which would take years to carry out, while the work might be just as effectively done by the system which is being pursued now.  I hope that the Minister will take in what I have said about the houses in Greystones, and that he will at least do something to help these poor people.  The sooner we get away from this hot-house plant idea of building the better.  Every industry, and particularly the one in which I am engaged, has to fight for its living in the open market.  We have to take our knocks, and building operatives and builders should do the same.  Unless for the benefit of the slum dweller, I will oppose any subsidy for building in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first place an immense amount has been made of this three-roomed house question, but I have not heard any Senators who attacked that type of construction mention a single person who was in favour of it.  I have nothing to say in favour of three-roomed houses, but I do say this, that if, after consultation between the local authority concerned in the matter of putting up a scheme and our Housing Department, a certain number of three-roomed houses are involved in that scheme, it is not our proposed policy to say that three-roomed houses shall not be built, or that, if they are, a smaller grant should be given for them.  The number of three-roomed houses that have been built up to the present is comparatively small.  Senator Johnson suggested that a very large number of three-roomed houses had been built in Dublin.  I do not think he will find that that is a fact.  Only at the present moment the Dublin Commissioners are preparing to invite tenders for approximately 1,200 houses, and there is not a single three-roomed house among that 1,200; all of them will be four-roomed houses. Senator Comyn suggested that from <Col N="197" /> all that he had heard about this matter language is given to conceal thought.  Certainly the question of three-roomed houses has been used for filling up a tremendous amount of time in order to keep away from the actual facts of the situation.</P>
      <P>The Bill at present before the Seanad is the Government's proposal for the building of approximately the next 3,000 houses, and it is continuing their housing policy.  A comprehensive scheme is wanted by everybody.  The very fact that houses are needed in so many of our urban districts, particularly in the capital, presents you with the greatest possible help to a comprehensive scheme, that is, the actual want of houses, and from that no Minister, no Seanad, no Dáil and no Commissioners can get away.  The very fact that the want exists means that the want must be tackled.  The people who, for one cause or another, say that you cannot get the best possible thing done until you have got your comprehensive scheme are simply refusing to face the facts at issue, and are making excuses for not getting down to the consideration of these facts.  Senator Johnson summarised statements that have been made as an outline of the Government's policy, as far as references to it in the Dáil were concerned. I have not anything to quarrel with him in regard to what he said in relation to these matters. It was covered with a certain amount of comment and suggestion, which, of course, was inevitable. The Senator pointed out that certain very important factors are involved in this matter&mdash;the case of increased cost of material, the case of increased cost of labour, and the case in regard to increased cost of credit, and he said that credit was the most important factor of all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To a certain extent I agree with him.  He said that if we could get money at 5 per cent. we could have certain conditions obtaining from the point of view of meeting our housing problem by fixing rents that the people for whom the houses are being provided are able to pay, and <Col N="198" /> that if we could get money at 4 per cent. instead of 5 per cent. we would have a much more improved situation. But he very truly said that we are not able to get it by simply wishing for it, or even by trying very hard to get it.  While pointing out these matters he said that the solution of the problem should be borne by the National Exchequer. One of the fundamental points in the Government's attitude in regard to housing is that such financial assistance as is necessary to provide houses for those numbers of the working classes whom it should be regarded as the State's duty to help to provide houses for will not be borne by the Exchequer alone.  If we are going to solve the most important factor in the matter&mdash;that is, the credit factor, the price of money&mdash;we have to make it perfectly clear that responsibility has to rest on broader shoulders than the shoulders of the Minister, the shoulders of the Executive, or the shoulders of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Senator Comyn told us that five hundred feet per house is not sufficient. Five hundred feet is the minimum figure.  He said that a five-roomed house is not enough, that houses should have six rooms.  Our experience is that there is no end to what will not be asked for.  As I say, in order to make the best solution of the matter that is possible on the credit side of the problem, one of the main planks in the Government's attitude in regard to the solution of the housing problem is that the additional cost which must be provided must fall on some broader shoulders than those of the Exchequer alone.  Senator Farren suggested that I had belittled and attacked local authorities in connection with this matter.  Senator O'Farrell, his own colleague, gave him a sample of what persons other than Ministers can say about local authorities.  Previous Housing Bills have provided that a local authority could give the same amount of money grant to a private person or a public utility service building houses as the Government gave; in <Col N="199" /> addition, could give a substantial reduction in rates, and could also give loans.  What I have to say on that matter is that local authorities have not risen to their responsibilities. When Senator Johnson proceeded to consider the question of the casual labourers in the city for whom three-roomed houses were provided, he talked about the Government grant of £60 and about the rent.  But there is no complaint at all about the position which he put up to us of the contribution from the city of Dublin towards providing the additional money that is necessary in order to give a house at today's price to the casual labourer with small pay.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnson has sketched fairly elaborately my attitude with regard to the matter, but I would like to put it briefly again so that we will be quite clear about it.  I am asked if it is our policy not to provide any assistance from the State towards houses for the working classes, but simply to provide assistance in the future for building houses to relieve the slums.  I am no more prepared to say at what particular point in the spectrum of the problem the State should draw the line and to say that State assistance should cease and that assistance should come in some other way than I am sure Senator Johnson is able to draw the line in the spectrum of the working classes and say: &ldquo;Here are the houses for which State assistance must be provided, and here are the houses for which State or any other assistance need not be provided.&rdquo;  We are dealing with a problem that is, to a certain extent, in a nebulous form.  It will only crystallise and become clear as the policy works down at it, and as I say, the policy that is enshrined in this Bill is a policy of financial assistance in respect of the next 3,000 houses.  The policy that is enshrined in that is reduced State grants, based upon the fact, in the first place, that there have been reductions in the cost of building, not only in Dublin and in Cork, but substantial reductions in the smaller <Col N="200" /> urban districts throughout the country.  There have been substantial reductions in some of the principal building materials also.  So that, having by previous efforts stimulated the building industry to the extent of making a very serious initial attack on our housing problem, in spite of what Senator Johnson suggests, there is a case for reducing the State grant now because of the reduction in building costs.</P>
    <P>But there is also involved in this reduction the further suggestion that the Exchequer is not to be asked to bear the full cost of solving the housing problem.  The local authorities must be prepared to bear their share of the cost of the erection of working-class houses in their own districts.  By that means you will have a more satisfactory scrutiny of every fact with regard to assistance from public moneys for building houses for the working classes. In the first place, you will have a clearer idea as to who are the persons and the classes in any particular area for whom houses are required and in respect of the provision of which public money should be given. That aspect of the problem will be more carefully examined.  You will have greater responsibility in making decisions as to what type of houses should be erected for these persons.  When the question as to whether three or four-roomed houses should be built for the working classes in the area concerned is discussed, you will get a more responsible and a more critical discussion from every aspect when the local body discusses it than you would get simply by setting up a housing dictator with an exchequer. A housing dictator in a position like that, even with an exchequer, would have to set out to guard his funds and to cut his coat according to his exchequer measure, and he might easily embark upon a policy of three-roomed houses which people would be saved from by local responsibility and local consideration.  You will also have greater responsibility in the safeguarding both of national and local finances in the same way as you will have greater responsibility <Col N="201" /> in the carrying out of the social duty that does exist of providing houses for the working classes.</P>
    <P>I cannot get any clear idea from what Senator Johnson said as to what he thinks ought to be done.  He has implied in what he suggested that we should have a housing dictator, that we should give him an exchequer, and then that the housing demands from all over the country would come to him; that he would either set up machinery for building houses, or would give contracts to different people.  That is what I infer from what Senator Johnson said.  I have not been able to gather, good, bad or indifferent, from a Senator with so much connection with our labour situation, what rent he would expect the casual labourer in Dublin whom he spoke of to pay, because we are reduced to this, that assuming we are to have State assistance for housing, assuming that we are to have a contribution from the local authorities to housing, the remaining money, as well as the annual expenses, must be found from the tenant.  We must be clear as to the amount of money we want to give for housing, and that anything that we cannot get from the State or from the local authority must be got from the tenant, and we might have a suggestion from the Senator as to what rent the person he spoke of in the sample he gave might be expected to pay. I do not want to labour these points, because we must all realise that we are dealing with a problem that is to a certain extent dynamic, and because it is dynamic, as Senator Wilson interpreted it rather correctly, we are prepared in the circumstances to come yearly or half-yearly to the Oireachtas and to say: &ldquo;Here are our financial provisions for dealing with the next certain number of thousand houses.&rdquo;  I think that by doing that, at any rate for the present, we are approaching the matter in a sympathetic and a careful way, and that later we might be able to introduce legislation which might be held to be comprehensive. But I see no reason why there should be any holding up in <Col N="202" /> the progress of house building, why there should be any holding up in the progress of the solution of the housing situation, simply because proposals are presented in this way. No one is taken short as a result of this Bill.  Everyone who had begun to build houses before 1st April will get grants under the old system, and everybody who has an idea of building a house now knows what he can expect to get.</P>

The conditions here since 1922, if we take that alone, have been very different from the Scotch conditions, and my recollection is that if local bodies in Ireland had been able to take advantage of the 1919 Act to build houses, we would probably be paying for them at a much dearer rate than we are paying now.</P>

      <P>In quoting figures in Scotland for the last four years the Senator suggested that he was comparing them with our figures for the last seven years.  But in fact, although the £1,000,000 that was provided in 1922 gave very substantial assistance to local authorities, the number of houses that had been built by local authorities up to the 31st December, 1924, was only 464, so that we are really dealing with five years.  The number of houses that have been built, or are being built, in rural areas is 8,600, and in urban areas 9,500.  The very fact that, although £1,000,000 was provided early in 1922 for the provision of houses by local authorities, only 464 houses were being built after two years shows the lag that there was in getting house building started.  That lag continued to a certain extent, but I think that the Government can pride itself on having dealt with a situation in which there was such a very great lag in 1922 and 1923, and on having moved the wheels of the building industry at rather a rapid pace, because the reductions that have taken place in the cost of building are an indication as to the extent to which the building industry has got on its feet.</P>

This Bill applies to houses begun subsequent to the 1st April last.  In special circumstances it might be possible to insert an amendment to the effect that special houses, the building of which was begun before the 1st July or the 1st August, would get the benefit of the old rates.

    </Speaker>
    <P>If we refer to Clause 5 of the Principal Act so called we find that it says: &ldquo;Nothing in this section shall be taken to prohibit solicitors from taking such part as they have heretofore taken in proceedings analogous to any proceedings under this Act.&rdquo;  The feeling is that this clause entitles solicitors operating in the Saorstát to represent patent agents not resident in the Saorstát, and to make their applications for patents and trade marks, and thus eliminate the necessity for those firms requiring protection for their <Col N="206" /> patents or trade marks being represented by local patent agents.  I think the general purpose of the Act is to protect and safeguard our own agents here, but a legal decision given comparatively recently makes it clear that the legal interpretation of the Act is not such.  We want, as far as possible, to develop in this country a profession of patent agents and for the protection of our rights I think it desirable that such a profession should be encouraged. Patent agents will have to have technical knowledge and experience so that they may prepare a case for submission to the Patent Office. This clause in my judgment would eliminate the necessity for having patent agents in this country at all. We know that a very considerable amount of this business in connection with the protection of patents will be on behalf of large concerns across the water, and that in many cases these firms will entrust large firms of patent agents, with activities in various countries, with the protection of their patents and patent rights.  In most countries they have either an office or a partner resident, or a citizen, at all events, of the State, who will present their case and act for their clients in that particular country.</P>
    <P>Now with the insertion of this clause such a thing would not be necessary here.  It would be sufficient for a firm of patent agents in London, New York, Berlin or Paris simply to prepare a brief, send it on to any local attorney and let him act for them.  The result would be that in this country we would not be developing anything in the nature of professional experience in that matter, which the Act is out to provide. On that argument I feel that the clause might be deleted, so as to ensure the protection of the patent agents already operating here, and to prevent exploitation by foreign agents who would not need even an office in this country under the clause.  It seems to me perfectly obvious, and I think the argument is sound, that such power should not be given foreign patent agents to make the operation so simple for them as <Col N="207" /> it is made under Clause 5. I commend the amendment to the consideration of the House and to the Minister.  The elimination of this clause will not inflict any particular hardship on any non-national registering patents or trade marks here. It will simply mean that he will have to use a citizen of the Saorstát to present the case for the protection of a patent right.</P>

      <P>I do not understand what Senator Connolly is anxious to bring about, because at the present time there are patent agents actually residing in Dublin who are prepared to take up any business of that description that is offered to them. It may be that patent office agents in London or elsewhere send over business to solicitors here, but there are patent agents in Dublin who are prepared in their professional capacity to take up the business of registration or other matters connected with patents.</P>

      <P>I think that probably Senator Connolly is unduly apprehensive as to what will happen under the Principal Act.  I was chairman of the Committee which was really responsible for the Principal Act, and one of the questions that was raised by solicitors at the time was whether they would be prevented under the Principal Act from doing the work which they had done before in connection with patents.  If the Senator reads the section, which was put in in order to protect them from being deprived of what they used to do under the old system here&mdash;we had no Patent Office here&mdash;I think he will find that there is no real fear of the patent agents being injured in any way. The sub-section which he proposes to delete reads:&mdash;&ldquo;Nothing in this section shall be taken to prohibit solicitors from taking such part as they have heretofore taken in proceedings analogous to any proceedings under this Act.&rdquo;  Now before the Principal Act was passed we had no Patent Office here.  There was no patent procedure in this country, and all the solicitors in this country <Col N="208" /> did was the preliminary work which enabled the patent agent in London to do the work there.  That is all they can do under the Principal Act now.  I was of opinion at the time that this sub-section was not necessary, that they could have gone on doing it, but they wanted to be quite sure that they were protected in doing what they had done before. I do not think the amendment is necessary for the protection of the patent agents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">

      <P>I second the amendment. Section 63 of the Principal Act provided for the establishment in this country of a profession of patent agents who should be citizens of this State and resident in it. The object, of course, was that the industries of this country should be protected and that new devices in manufacture or new methods of business and new ideas which originated here should be preserved for the use of this country and not be exploited by patent agents who had a dual allegiance.  Section 63 states: &ldquo;Any person who resides or has a place of business in Saorstát Eireann and is not an alien, and possesses the prescribed educational and professional qualifications and complies with the prescribed conditions, shall be eligible to be registered in the register of patent agents and shall, on application in the prescribed form and manner and payment of the prescribed fee, be so registered.&rdquo; Now the framers of that Act had the intention of establishing in this country a college, if I might use the expression, of patent agents, men thoroughly qualified who should be resident in Saorstát Eireann, men who should have certain educational qualifications, and men who should pay fees.  That section, as I would have thought, was very carefully drawn, and I am sure my friend, Senator Brown, had something to say to it.  It would appear to have been completely and fully adapted to the purposes intended, but in the course of the last two years it was found that it was not so adapted, and the Ministry has found it necessary now to <Col N="209" /> strengthen that section by providing that patent agents shall both reside and have a place of business in Saorstát Eireann.  What happened was this: The London patent agents got around the Act of Parliament. They had a pied-de-terre here&mdash;a room&mdash;and having a room they called it a residence; they operated in the Free State from London, with the result that the patent agents who were qualified in the Free State, who had paid their fees and who are resident, could get nothing to do.  The object of Senator Connolly's amendment is to make the clause more effective.</P>
      <P>There has been a recent decision, of which Senator Brown does not appear to be aware, the effect and the meaning of which is this: that a London agent can prepare the papers, do all the necessary work, apply to the patent all the necessary skill, and instead of sending it to a patent agent licensed and registered in the Free State, he can send it to any solicitor in the Free State, and that solicitor can send his clerk to the office and get the patent registered. Now that is the effect of the decision in Pott's case.  We want to repeal that decision, and to give full protection to the patent agents who have been established in this country. I am sure we will have the support of Senator Guinness, because everything he has said is in favour of supporting the local patent agents.</P>

      <P>Undoubtedly what Senator Comyn has said is a fact, but it was never intended to prevent the registering of patents in the Free State sent in the manner he has described.  I would remind the House that the Act was framed in order to set up a Patent Office here for the control of patents in the Saorstát.  The use of patents and the general application of them have nothing to do with the registering of them by patent agents.  The registering of a patent by a patent agent is a matter that is controlled by the Act, and supervision is exercised <Col N="210" /> over it according to the Act by the Controller of the Patent Office.  Whether a solicitor should be still allowed to do as he did heretofore is clearly defined in Section 62 of the original Act, and although we are prepared, having given this matter very full consideration, to encourage in every way the establishment of patent agents in the Saorstát, I think it would be unwise to prevent solicitors from performing functions which they heretofore undertook.  It is only natural to assume that if an inventor wishes to register a patent in the Saorstát, and if there is a qualified patent agent in the Saorstát, a solicitor who will be employed by him in the ordinary way will employ a patent agent here rather than a patent agent in London, because he will be on the spot.  Our idea is to encourage the establishment of patent agents here, but, at the same time, we do not think we have yet reached the stage when we could give a complete monopoly to the patent agents in the Saorstát, or even if we had reached a more advanced stage in the work of our Patent Office, would we consider it wise to do it.  I think the House would be well advised not to accept the amendment, because it would cut across the general work of the office, and I do not think it would be as easy to administer as Senator Connolly or Senator Comyn seems to think.</P>

      <P>I rather regret the absence of the Minister who had control of the Principal Act when it was going through the House because it seems to me, on reading Section 62 of the Principal Act, it is fairly clear that the object of the Act was to secure what Senator Comyn called a college of patent agents here, and it is set out with a certain amount of circumstantial detail&mdash;and I can see the reason, which is to secure control and jurisdiction, not only of patents, but of trade marks in this country.  It goes a little further than that.  Sub-section (2) goes on to say: &ldquo;If and when the Minister so directs there shall be kept at the office a book called the <Col N="211" /> register of clerks in which shall be entered the names of approved clerks of registered patent agents.&rdquo; The Act not only sets out to secure the establishment of patent agents but of registered clerks of these agents.  As we know, examinations have been held, and a number of men passed, and I believe a considerable number was &ldquo;spun&rdquo; who did not comply with the conditions.  I have been told that, notwithstanding that, patent agents resident in other countries have offices here and employ clerks, in some cases men who were not successful at the examination, completely ignoring men who were really patent agents under the terms of the Act.  We all pay very considerable attention to what Senator Brown tells us in matters of this sort.  I am not anxious to prevent solicitors doing anything they did before, because there was no Patent Office under the old régime. I do not want to limit them unnecessarily, but I think, as the Parliamentary Secretary has told us, that that clearly is not the intention in the section dealing with the matter.</P>

      <P>I presume the object of Senator Connolly in seeking to delete the sub-section is to secure that solicitors shall be prohibited from performing certain duties.  I gathered from Senator Brown that he had considerable doubt whether that particular sub-section in the Principal Act was necessary.  If Senator Brown's view is correct then this sub-section is superfluous for the purpose in view, and the object that Senator Connolly seeks to achieve by means of his amendment would not be secured.  The position, as suggested by Senator Brown, seems to be this: that apart from this sub-section solicitors have power to act.  It seems to me that this amendment will get us nowhere if the contention put forward by Senator Brown is correct.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that there is a good deal to be said for leaving this matter over until the Report Stage.  The case made by <Col N="212" /> Senator Connolly is that business should not be taken from Irish agents by agents residing elsewhere. That, I take it, is the object of the amendment, and as far as I can see everyone in the House is in agreement with it.  The question then arises: will the action of solicitors, in doing all the work which they did before, enable outside agents to take the business from home agents, or will it not?  Senator Brown is clearly of opinion that it will not.  The Senator also doubts very much whether the sub-section in the Bill, which Senator Connolly's amendment proposes to delete, will make any difference.  The matter seems to me to be one that requires to be carefully considered.  We are all agreed, I think, on what it is proposed to achieve.  We may not be able at the moment to find the exact words to do what is desired, but surely some way can be found by which solicitors in Ireland can do their work without virtually acting as agents on behalf of agents elsewhere. I feel sure that if this matter were left over a way could be found to deal with it in the manner that I think we are all agreed it should be dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>A point has been made with reference to the control and working of patents in the Saorstát. The question as to who registers the patents, whether it is a patent agent or not, has nothing whatever to say to that.  That is a function that is definitely exercised by the Controller of the Patents Office, acting under the Minister.  He acts under the definite powers laid down in the appropriate sections in the Principal Act.  I want the House <Col N="213" /> clearly to understand that the question which Senators are discussing is, who shall act, and whether it is right to allow any other person than a patent agent, who has been admitted to our register, to act for an inventor.  The idea of a register, and of allowing qualified persons to describe themselves as patent agents, is clearly defined in various sections of the Bill.  That is for the purpose of protecting the inventor and the public.</P>
      <P>Under the Act, as it now is, the public can be assured, when the Controller admits a person to the register and allows that person to describe himself as a patent agent, that that person is duly qualified and has all the necessary qualifications entitling him to hold himself forth to the public as a patent agent.  The question as to whether the registering of patents in the Saorstát should be confined to patent agents on our register raises a very big question.  It raises the question of the preparation of plans and specifications.  In the case of some patents, which might be registered here, perhaps the local agent might not at present be able to deal with these matters, because these plans and specifications have to be prepared very carefully and is the work of experts. Therefore, the amendment, if carried, might have more far-reaching consequences than the mover of it anticipates&mdash;that is, if it were laid down as a rule that no person could act as an agent for an inventor in the Saorstát except the patent agents on our register.</P>

I would be against anything that would preclude the inventor from getting the best skill that it is possible for him to get, because that is really the beginning of the inventor's interest.  The other interests exist only for him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I move this amendment for the purpose of clearing the ground and of giving Senators an opportunity of considering the subject matter of this Bill very carefully.  This Bill, which I think is not necessary, only relates to the filling of casual vacancies in the Seanad.  We have filled a casual vacancy in the Seanad recently.  I think that it has been admirably filled.  We filled that casual vacancy acting upon our usual and ancient lines.  Should it happen that casual vacancies occur in the future, I think we could fill them quite satisfactorily acting on the method that we have hitherto adopted.  Therefore, it does not seem to me that there is any immediate hurry for this change in our Constitution.  We have been amending our Constitution very liberally of late.  In fact, I think we have been very hurried in amending the Constitution.  The reactions to amendments of the Constitution, which happens to be a written one, may be very far-reaching, as other countries have discovered.  It seems to me that we should be very slow in the matter of amending our Constitution in important details, and this, I take leave to say, is a detail of importance. My idea in moving this amendment is to leave things practically as they are, at all events, until such time as we can fully consider what we really mean to do.  We have acted rather hurriedly, I think, in amending our Constitution.  I do not think that the country itself has kept pace with our Constitutional amendments, and I am not quite sure that the country as a whole approves of <Col N="216" /> some of the amendments to the Constitution that we have hurriedly made.  All these matters are of grave importance, and should be attended to carefully and with every desire to give expression to the ideas that other people may bring to bear upon them.  In this country we certainly have no lack of ideas, but I am afraid that very often on important matters ideas are either absent or people do not express them.  This, however, is a matter on which unquestionably very divergent views prevail.</P>
    <P>I have strong ideas as to the composition of the Seanad.  I think it should be based upon the electoral principle.  Other members of the Seanad may be in favour of an electoral college, while other members of the House may be in favour of other methods.  I think it would be well for us to make up our minds as to what the majority of the people of this country want in the way of a revising chamber.  Since the setting up of the Oireachtas, this House I claim has done very useful work, and there is every reason to hope that in the future we shall continue to render useful service to the country.  I think we owe it to the country that we should take thought in these matters, and should not embark upon an avenue from which later on we may wish to change in another direction. We should not embark upon these avenues without full consideration of what the changes made would entail. I think that we should carefully consider all our plans, and should have an investigation into what the people think is the best in the public interest. I think, too, that when the majority of the people come to a determination as to what their decision is in regard to the composition of the Seanad, that that should be carried out in a constitutional way.  I am perfectly certain that an elected Seanad is the best.  Other people have different ideas on the subject, but what does the country want? That is the important matter.  The country is more vitally interested in a proper solution of this issue than any member of the Seanad or the Dáil.  Time, I think, should be <Col N="217" /> afforded for the people of the country to take thought about their own interests.  That being so, it would be very advisable for us to give the country an opportunity of declaring its intentions.</P>
    <P>My appeal is for time, consideration and reflection upon all these matters.  I think that we should continue to fill casual vacancies in the way that we have been accustomed to do it in the past, and that there is no necessity for this amendment to the Constitution until such time as the country has made up its mind as to what sort of a Seanad it wants.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that I have failed to grasp the meaning of the amendment.  From what the Senator has just stated, I do not know whether the Senator has really read the amendment that is proposed to the Constitution or not. This is a proposal to alter the method of filling vacancies which occur in the Seanad.  The new method proposed is that these vacancies shall be filled by the Dáil and Seanad voting together.  It is provided in the Bill that the voting at such elections shall be by secret ballot and that no elector may exercise more than one vote.  The title of the Bill specifies what its purpose is.  What the Senator means to effect by striking out all after the word &ldquo;law&rdquo; I must say that I do not know, but at any rate it would lack a good deal of the definiteness prescribed in this measure.  I take it from the Senator's speech that he desires to have some information as to what the country wants in the matter of elections to the Seanad. That is another question altogether. This Bill only deals with the filling of casual vacancies in the Seanad. The object of the Senator's amendment, I take it, is that casual vacancies should as in the past be filled by the Seanad itself.  If this Bill is passed, another measure will be introduced specifying the manner in which the election shall take place, and making all the other necessary arrangements.  I do not know what the Senator's intention is in moving <Col N="218" /> the deletion of all the words in the section after the word &ldquo;law.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Perhaps I may develop my thesis further.  In regard to the filling of casual vacancies by law, I gather from a remark that has fallen from the President that a Bill is being prepared to enable casual vacancies to be filled by law under this new Act. But have not casual vacancies that occurred here before been filled according to law?  What about Senator Sir Nugent Everard?  He was elected the other day, and is his election invalid?  There is no doubt that if this amendment is carried, or if this Bill is withdrawn altogether, that casual vacancies can be filled as they have been filled hitherto.  In that case it will not make any difference.  There has been no particular explanation of the reason for introducing this measure dealing with the filling of casual vacancies.  In my opinion it is a Bill that is utterly unnecessary. It will entail the passing of another <Col N="219" /> Bill which has not yet been introduced so as to enable casual vacancies to be filled&mdash;this is the real gravamen of the situation&mdash;by an election with the Dáil and Seanad voting together.</P>

      <P>I submit that it is a matter for the country to decide whether casual vacancies in the Seanad shall be filled by the Dáil and Seanad voting together. We have heard very strong criticisms of the method of election to the Seanad under the new system. It is time for us to take the first opportunity that we can to change it.  If the country desires a change we should make it.  The only way you can discuss these matters is by amending an altogether unnecessary constitutional reform.  I do not think that either the President or Senator Brown has contributed anything to our enlightenment on the subject, nor have they explained to us what the necessity is for the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill appears to have been introduced into the Dáil without any speech being made by the Minister in charge.  The reports of the Second Reading debate and of the subsequent stages in the Dáil have never been printed.  The result is that what took place in regard to this Bill has never been made public up to the present.  Owing to the fact that a new system has been introduced with regard to the publication of the Parliamentary Reports, the debates on the Second Reading and further stages of this Bill have not yet been published.  Altogether, this is a sample of the way that we make laws in this country.  The importance of the matter lies in this: that we are amending the Constitution under which we live.  Surely we ought to have some explanation, or some reason given, for a change in the Constitution under which we have managed to live fairly successfully during the last three or four years.  I have taken the opportunity on these Bills to draw the attention <Col N="220" /> of the public to the facts of the situation. I cannot allow this opportunity to pass without suggesting to the country that, in matters relating to amendment of the Constitution, even in regard to the filling of casual vacancies in the Seanad, it ought to take credit to itself and declare its opinion so that the Oireachtas generally may follow it.</P>

      <P>That is the course I took.  My reason for moving the amendment is that I feel it is a mistake to co-opt persons to fill vacancies, and that the persons so co-opted should go out of office at the next triennial election.  I think it would be very much better if the person co-opted remained a member of the Seanad for the term of office for which the person in whose place he was co-opted would have held office, whether that be one year, six years, nine years, or whatever it may happen to be.  The principal reason why I think that some such principle should be inserted in the Bill, or dealt with in some other way, is that we have at present in each triennial election a number of persons at the tail-end elected for a short period.  Under the old method of election there was no objection to that, because the person at the bottom of the list was presumably the person least desirable.  Under proportional representation that does not work.  It seems to me that an arrangement by which we increase the number 20, as it is now, by all the vacancies which occur during the three years, to, say, 24 or 25, is a mistake, and that it would be much better if we kept to the exact number of 20.  That would be fairer all round.  I mentioned this matter on the Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a kindred matter which could be dealt with at the same time, although I have not specifically referred to it here, and that is at present we co-opt a person, even though it be only three months before the next triennial election, thereby co-opting a Senator for a very short period, and making him stand again for election, which, I think, is very undesirable, as, in my opinion, it would be no great calamity if the House had to do with 59 members in the meantime.  I am satisfied the amendment comes within the scope of the Bill.  The custom has been to make amendments to the Constitution as specific as possible, and to deal with only one subject.  This is a <Col N="222" /> kindred subject, but it is possible it would be regarded as a different subject. I would like the President to look into the matter before Report and see whether an amendment of this sort could be wisely put into the Bill, so that if it meets with approval it could be put into this Bill, or dealt with in another Bill.  It would be better have it dealt with in one Bill in view of the plan carried out by the Government of having constitutional amendments to deal with one subject only.  My difficulty as regards moving the amendment was: I was not sure whether a separate Bill would not be the best way of dealing with the matter.  I think there is a strong case for co-opting a person for the term of office for which a Senator who died, resigned or was disqualified was elected.</P>

      <P>If the amendment by Senator Douglas is in order, I suggest to him to add to it that when a vacancy occurs in the Seanad through the death, resignation, or disqualification of a member three or six months before a triennial election, such vacancy shall not be filled until the time of the triennial election. I think if that suggestion could be adopted it would be a wise proceeding.</P>

      <P>It is rather a pity the amendment had not been produced during the meeting of the Joint Committee.  It looks to be a sensible one.  With regard to the other suggestion, that if a member died three months before an election the vacancy should be left unfilled until the ordinary triennial election, that is not a sound line to go on.  The Seanad, according to the Constitution, is composed of 60 members, and this suggestion is to say that at a certain time it shall consist of 59, 58, or 57 members.  I do not know whether the amendment suggested by Senator Douglas alters the scope of the Bill, but the principle appears to me not objectionable.</P>

      <P>The discussion has gone on as if this was an agreed amendment.  I want to enter a caveat and put in my protest before there is an adjournment of the question. It seems feasible, and would commend itself to the majority Party in the Oireachtas, but there is a serious objection to it from my point of view.  The House is elected on the basis of proportional representation. If the principle of this amendment were accepted, all by-elections occurring between the triennial election would be won by the majority Party.  To that extent the principle of proportional representation is destroyed, and normally people elected in that way and going out at the end of three years enables the balance to be restored, for they have to submit themselves for reelection and then we have proportional representation coming into operation.</P>

      <P>Like Senator O'Connor I desire to support this amendment in the strongest possible manner as, in my judgment, it is a very reasonable amendment.  The matter has been already argued.  When Senator Lenihan proposed it before we understood that the Minister accepted it.  After a while in the course of the discussion, and influenced, I think, by the eloquence of Senator Johnson, the Minister, although at first he said he would, then said he would not, and finally I think at the end of the debate rather late in the day said he could not.  The Minister then asked for an opportunity of considering it, and I am sure that as a result of that consideration he will be so reasonable as to accept the amendment.  I do not join with my friend Senator Wilson in the suggestion that farmers should take off their hats to the Minister or that he would refuse compensation because you happened to be an enemy of his.  I do not suppose the Minister has many enemies, and when Senator Wilson is there he will not have any enemies.  The first argument was &ldquo;Why change it at all&rdquo;; &ldquo;may&rdquo; means &ldquo;shall&rdquo;?  Well, if &ldquo;may&rdquo; means &ldquo;shall&rdquo; why not put &ldquo;shall&rdquo; there?  No harm would be done.</P>

Some men call themselves lawyers and some of them are not lawyers.  There are bogus lawyers and bogus farmers.  I do not say that there are any bogus farmers here and I do not think there are any bad lawyers here.  I submit that it should be put beyond doubt that a farmer whose crop is destroyed should get compensation, whoever the Minister may be.  It was suggested when this question came up for debate before that there might be a case in which a farmer himself would be responsible for the infection or injury to his crop.  That cannot possibly arise in this case, because the section deals with the case of an insect introduced into this country, so that quite obviously that is a case in which a farmer in a remote part of Clare, Kerry, Cork or Wexford could have nothing to do, and could have no responsibility whatever for the events that destroyed his crop.  I support very strongly this amendment, and I hope it will not be opposed from the Labour Benches.  There seems to be an idea that if a Senator connected with farming proposes an amendment it is the duty of some other interest to oppose it.  In the Seanad I think we ought really to consider what is best in legislation for the interests of the country, and support or oppose it according as we consider it fair and reasonable, no matter from what source it comes.</P>

      <P>This matter is largely a technical one, and I suppose a legal technical one.  Senator Comyn has suggested that the question was raised as a matter of antipathy to the farmer.  That is entirely wrong.  The question was raised from the point of view of the order in which Statutes should leave the House, on the one hand, and, secondly for the protection of the public interests.  At present the Bill permits the Minister by the word &ldquo;may,&rdquo; but as a layman I understand there are certain Acts in which in 99 cases out of 100 the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; involves &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;  But there is always the possibility of circumstances surrounding a case which should not throw upon the Department the liability to pay.  If the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is there, it is imperative, no matter what the circumstances may be, that money must be paid&mdash;a sum of money such as the Department may determine.  If that is the intention, I have no particular objection, but, I think, as a matter of proper legislative method, a Department of State should have some protection against a possible malefactor in the shape of a farmer.</P>

If the Minister, having consulted legal advice, makes the position clear that there is no technical objection, I am perfectly satisfied. I have no antipathy to the farmer in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to add to what Senator Johnson said.  He stated the matter fairly accurately. In practice, in 99 cases out of 100, the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; would mean &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;  But I have reconsidered <Col N="230" /> this question, and I do not think Senators should complain because I happen to change my mind.  I think that it is the duty of everybody to listen to a debate and to be affected by it.  I do not apologise at all for changing my mind in this matter, and, having considered it, I ask the Seanad to leave the word &ldquo;may,&rdquo; mainly for the reasons stated by Senator Johnson.  If the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is inserted there, the Department of Agriculture must pay compensation, and full compensation, in every single case, good, bad or indifferent, no matter what the circumstances may be.  I do not think it would be contemplated by any Senator, whether he was a farmer or a lawyer, that that should be the case, because we need not pretend that the farmers have either a double dose of original sin or no original sin at all.  I suppose they are like everybody else, and the farmers are inclined occasionally to break the law if they find it to their interest to do so.  That applies to every class.  Under this Bill regulations will be made, and these will, and must of necessity, set out in detail certain duties which will fall on the farmers in certain circumstances. Regulations will be made somewhat similar to the regulations that have been made in connection with the disease known as Black Scab in potatoes.  It is provided that the Department shall give notice to the farmer affected in certain contingencies, and these are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That all diseased tubers and the haulms (if any) belonging thereto, as well as all packing materials and packages, at any time used for the storing or conveying of such potatoes shall be immediately destroyed on the spot by burning or other effective method prescribed by the Department.</P>
      <P>That no potatoes or potato haulms shall be removed or be permitted to be removed out of the area defined in the notice except with, and subject to the conditions (if any), of a licence signed by an inspector of the Department or other authorised officer permitting such removal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="231" /> That potatoes shall not be again planted or sown on the affected land without the sanction of the Department.</P>
    <P>That no affected soil shall be removed from one part of a farm either to another part of the same farm or to another farm, whether within or without the affected area.</P>
    <P>Obviously every single one of these conditions not only would apply, but would be absolutely essential in a case where the Colorado Beetle was, in fact, discovered in a certain area of potatoes.  This Bill will apply not only to the first case of Colorado Beetle found in the country, if we have the misfortune to find such a case, but will apply also to any subsequent case.  It could well be that in a certain area the Colorado Beetle would be almost endemic, and if we had to take precautions under the Bill to deal with the pest we would have to make regulations that potatoes should not be planted in certain places in the area, or if planted, should be planted under certain conditions, and we would have to make provision so that the stalks of such as were planted were destroyed, that the straw in which they were brought in should be destroyed, that the boxes should be destroyed, and so on.  But can it be said that there is no likelihood that in a rare case a farmer will deliberately disobey these regulations? Everybody knows the trouble we had with the outbreak of Black Scab in Louth.  On the one hand, a farmer wants to get the best price for his potatoes; he wants to get them to Dundalk or Dublin when there is a particularly good price there.  He is quite satisfied to keep the law if there is a good price in England, because we allow him to export to England, but when the prices fall in England and are high in Ireland <Col N="232" /> certain farmers try to evade the law, some in an exaggerated way and others in a small way.</P>
    <P>You can very well imagine a case of a farmer who thinks he is going to get compensation in every case, no matter what he does, saying: &ldquo;Let the officials do what they like.  I am going to take no trouble whatever; I am tired of the Department and their red tape regulations and I am not going to obey one of them.&rdquo;  Of course we can provide penalties, but we do not want to provide penalties, and it is to meet an odd case like that that we want &ldquo;may&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;  I have reconsidered this: I think Senator Johnson is quite right and I would ask the Seanad to support that point of view. In connection with the danger that Senator Linehan foresees, we are not operating in a country where people suffer from a lack of ability to express their thoughts.  Everybody can be fairly vocal.  The Press is at the disposal of anyone who has anything to complain of.  The Dáil is there; the matter could be raised on the Estimates every single year; it could be raised definitely every time a regulation is made, because regulations must be laid on the Table. Moreover, questions could be asked of the Minister responsible; the matter could be raised on the adjournment of the House; the matter could be raised by a motion, and no Minister, except he had a very strong and clear case, could exercise the discretion, which I ask you to leave to me, of refusing to pay compensation. But perhaps there might be a case in which he should have that discretion.  Having thought over the matter I am satisfied that the amendment should not be passed.  The case will never arise if you leave the Minister the discretion, but if you take away the Minister's discretion the case will arise.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 4 (b).  To delete in lines 10-11 the words &ldquo;appointed by the Minister for Agriculture&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;by the Circuit Court Judge.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The section says:</P>
      <P>If such owner is dissatisfied with the amount of compensation so assessed by the Department he may by notice in writing to the Department request that the matter be referred to arbitration, and thereupon the assessment of the amount of such compensation shall be referred to and determined by a single arbitrator agreed upon by such owner and the Department or, in default of such agreement, appointed by the Minister for Agriculture, and the determination by such arbitrator shall be final.</P>
      <P>My amendment proposes that in case of disagreement between the owner of the crop and the Department an arbitrator shall be appointed, not by the Minister for Agriculture but by the Circuit Court Judge.  I think, considering the connection of the Minister for Agriculture with the Department, that it would be a more impartial method of making a selection of the arbitrator by having the appointment made by the Circuit Court Judge.  That is so obvious that I do not propose to say anything further, but to leave the matter to the Seanad to decide.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Seanad to let the Section remain as it is.  This is in no sense a judicial question.  It is really an administrative act that will be done under the Section as it stands, and I do not think the Senator has adduced any reason why people should be put to the trouble and expense of taking legal proceedings in the civil court to have an arbitrator appointed. The arbitrator to be appointed must be someone who has some technical knowledge, who knows the markets and the value of the various kinds of potatoes.  The procedure we adopted here is the procedure that has been adopted in practically all the Acts analogous to this one, such as the Dairy Produce Act, the Live Stock Breeding Act, the Eggs Act, and the other Acts that we have passed, and I have never had any complaint in the Dáil&mdash;and we get complaints quick enough there&mdash;of the actions of any arbitrator.  We have arbitrators appointed for the purposes of the Dairy Produce Act. Everyone knows who the arbitrators are.  There is a panel, someone on it is picked out, and is operating every day.  In fact the principal arbitrator under the Dairy Produce Act is a first-class creamery manager whom everyone knows and on whose judgment everyone relies. <Col N="235" /> He is asked to adjudicate in case of a dispute.  There have been many disputes since that Act was passed, as it effects practically every creamery in the country, and never was it suggested that the arbitrator has not done his work impartially. I think that is much simpler, and much more effective, and certainly an equally impartial way of doing what Senator Linehan wants to do. Moreover, I think it is unsound to bring the Circuit Judge into a business which is purely administrative. It is not a judicial act in any sense; there is no question of law involved. I find it difficult to believe that there is any parallel for the proposal the Senator has made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Seanad considers the number of Bills that have been passed dealing with diseases of animals, tillage of crops, and matters of <Col N="236" /> that sort, including the three Acts I have mentioned, and that up to the present there has been no real question as to the impartiality of the arbitrators, I think there is no case whatever for bringing a county court judge to function in a matter which is not judicial but purely administrative. I ask the Seanad to leave the section as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Seanad has already rejected my first amendment, and as the Minister, if he wishes, need not pay any compensation, it would be useless to get an arbitrator to fix the amount which would have to be paid when the Minister has the power to turn it down after.</P>
      <P>Amendment by leave withdrawn.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7.15 p.m. until Thursday, April 25th, at 3 p.m.</P>
