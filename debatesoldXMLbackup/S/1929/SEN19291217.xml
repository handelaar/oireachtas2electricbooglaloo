    <P>Section 1 put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>(1)  This Act may be cited as the Courts of Justice Act, 1929, and shall be construed as one with the Courts of Justice Acts, 1924 to 1928, and those Acts and this Act may be cited together as the Courts of Justice Acts, 1924 to 1929.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Senator Colonel Moore, I move:</P>
      <P>Section 2, sub-section (2).  To delete in line 5 the words &ldquo;two years&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;one year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The effect of the amendment would be to limit the application of the Bill to one year instead of two years as is prescribed.  I think it was pretty evident from the discussion that took place on the Second Reading that the consensus of opinion in the Seanad was against the principle embodied in the Bill, the appointment of temporary judges.  I think it is due to the country generally, and to the judiciary in particular, to see that the life of this Bill is made as short as possible.</P>

      <P>I am even more opposed to temporary judges than anybody in this House.  I opposed the proposal in the original Courts of Justice Bill as long as I could, and I have opposed it ever since.  One <Col N="394" /> of the judges has already been appointed as chairman of a commission. I do not know if that commission will be over within twelve months or not.  If I was quite sure that by limiting the Bill to twelve months, instead of two years, we would not be doing any harm, I would vote for the amendment, but I am not sure of that.  I do not know what the Minister for Justice will have to say on the matter.</P>

      <P>I would like to repeat what I said here on the Second Reading that I hope within the space of two years&mdash;and that is why I have selected two years&mdash;the Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad will have brought in their report&mdash;that is the committee which is enquiring into the whole working of the Courts of Justice Act&mdash;and that not only will they have brought in their report but that it will have been considered and legislation will have been enacted.  I hope that will be done in a shorter period, but I think it is better to have two years.  Supposing legislation is not brought in, what would happen?  I would like to point out that at the present moment if a judge is sick a substitute can be appointed in his place.  That is the existing state of the law under Section 45 of the Courts of Justice Act of 1924.  But this Bill repeals that section, so that if this Bill becomes an Act, and expires within a year, and there is not further legislation dealing with this subject within the year, if a judge became sick, it would be impossible to appoint anyone in his place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>Section 3, sub-section (4).  To insert after the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(5) It shall not be lawful for the Master or owner of a pack of harriers or beagles or for the owner of a harrier or beagle hound to permit such pack or hound to <Col N="396" /> hunt in a drag-hunt during the period 1st May to 25th September in any year over any meadow or cornfield frequented by hares; and any person who acts in contravention of this sub-section shall be guilty of an offence under this Part of this Act and shall be punishable accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is similar to one that I moved on the Committee Stage.  Objection was then taken to the inclusion of the month of March as part of the year in which hunting would be prohibited.  I have altered the amendment to start from the 1st of May and to end on September 25. I would not move the amendment only that I know that it is absolutely necessary in some parts of the country. I have places in mind where irresponsible people during the summer months lay drag-hunts through cornfields and meadows, and in order to prevent that I submit this amendment for the consideration of the House.  I think that we can very easily have sport and at the same time avoid injuring crops.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WalterNugentBart" hpid="Sir Walter Nugent Sir Walter Nugent">
      <NameTxt>Sir Walter Nugent</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we all recognise the humane motives which inspired the Senator in moving this amendment.  I think his motives were rather impugned the other day, because he is himself a great hunting man, and I am quite sure that his feelings were moved simply in the cause of sport.  But the way I feel about it is this: The amendment is an absolutely innocuous one, because it seems to me inconceivable that anyone would want to do what he tries to prevent&mdash;that anyone would want to run a drag-hunt in the months of May to September.  If there are such people, it is quite right that they should be stopped. But is it not a fact that they can be stopped under the ordinary common law by the owner of the land?  If that is so, this amendment is unnecessary. My point is that all these amendments, unless they are absolutely necessary, are liable to be misconstrued. They will be used as arguments to prevent people from coming here who desire to come here to enjoy sport and to spend their <Col N="397" /> money.  Therefore, I suggest to the Senator that unless he is quite satisfied that the amendment is necessary he should not press it.  I am sure that the Minister for Justice will be able to inform him if the common law of the country is sufficient to meet this case.  If so, it is quite unnecessary to have such an amendment as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>When an amendment similar to this was before the House on the last day, I voted against it, because having lived for fifty years in the County Kildare, where hunting is carried on practically the whole year round in regard to all classes of sport, I doubted if it was absolutely necessary. To my knowledge no drag-hunt was ever run at that period of the year.  But if Senator Linehan states that he knows parts of the country where this drag-hunting takes place at this objectionable time, I will accept his statement. As far as County Kildare is concerned, I do not object to the principle of it if it should be necessary in a part of the country where they have not the sense or the courtesy to avoid it.  If it is not punishable by law, it should be made so.  But as a rule in my district it is the farmers' sons who take an interest in hunting houses who lay these drag-hunts, and the last thing they would do would be to lay a drag-hunt over a cornfield or a newly laid-down grass field.  Of course, in the county of Kildare there is a good deal of grazing across which they can lay a drag-hunt without injuring anything, but they never lay one in the summer at all; they always do so about March, ending by about the 1st of April.  If it was necessary to have such an amendment as this, I would vote for it, but not on the grounds that it is necessary in my part of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is Senator Linehan thinking of greyhound hunting? That is the only case that I can possibly think of.  I never heard of such a thing as harriers and beagles <Col N="398" /> hunting at the time of the year he mentions.  Sometimes irresponsible people go out with a couple of greyhounds and hunt hares, but apart from that I do not know any place where hunting takes place at that time of the year.  I think that the amendment is utterly unnecessary, unless peculiar conditions exist in Senator Linehan's district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney) James Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Sir Walter Nugent that this amendment is quite unnecessary, because anyone who likes can stop anybody else from hunting over his land.  There might be feeling about it and persons might not like to assert themselves as against all their neighbours.  But supposing somebody ran a pack of hounds through a standing cornfield, for instance, on the 1st August, there would be no outcry against a person who sued for the damage to his crop, but there would be a tremendous outcry against the person who ran his hounds, or allowed hounds to be run, through a growing and almost ripe crop of corn.  But I have another objection to the amendment.</P>
      <P>This is a Game Preservation Bill; we are concerned solely in it with game preservation, and I would suggest that if an amendment of this kind were inserted by the Seanad, the action taken might be rather severely criticised, and criticised, let me put it, from a rather humorous standpoint.  The only way in which it can be made relevant to this Bill at all is by the one word &ldquo;hares&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;to hunt in a drag-hunt during the period 1st May to 25th September in any year over any meadow or cornfield frequented by hares.&rdquo;  Does anybody say that hares are going to be injured by a drag-hunt being run in their vicinity?  That is the real question that is before the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a question of making drag-hunting illegal, but that does not arise under this Bill.  We are not discussing under this Bill whether drag-hunting is a good thing or whether it is a bad thing, whether it <Col N="399" /> should be permitted at certain seasons or whether it should be permitted at all.  These are considerations which do not arise under this Bill in the slightest degree, and I think to drag them in here, as Senator Linchan has very ingeniously done, by putting in the word &ldquo;hares,&rdquo; would not be right.  I am not putting it in any way offensively, but if he intended to put his finger in the eye of the Seanad, and to effect his purpose by these words, the Seanad might be regarded in certain quarters as having passed a rather ridiculous amendment. I hope I have not offended the Senator by that remark.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the wording of the amendment, I would like to know from the Minister if the effect of it would be, if passed, that there could be hunting over meadows or cornfields provided they were not frequented by hares.  It seems to me that the effect of the amendment, if passed, would be that one could hunt over a meadow or a cornfield provided it was not frequented by hares. I think that these words should be left out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the point made by Senator O'Farrell, I desire to say that if these words were not in the amendment, the amendment would not be in order at all.  I take it for granted that as a result of this Bill all meadows and cornfields will be very much frequented by hares.  I hope that will be the result of the Bill.  There is no doubt that if a pack of harriers or beagles hunt over a cornfield or a meadow they will certainly do a great deal of damage to the farmer who owns the land, and will make him very resentful, and perhaps turn him from giving permission for hunting over his land at all.  It is quite evident that the game that would resort to these fields will be disturbed by the dogs hunting over them.  It very often happens that the dogs running in a drag-hunt lose the scent, and travel all over the land.  If there are any young hares in the coverts on the land they will surely be killed by the <Col N="400" /> hounds.  I am aware that the farmer has the right to take a civil action for trespass and the damage done to his land, but he cannot always identify the parties who carry on the practice.  Even if he were able to identify them, it might be found that they were not any mark for damages, I think it would be well to make it clear to people who wish to carry on drag-hunts that they are not at liberty to lay their drags over cornfields or meadows, and that they must confine their operations to the pasture land which, I think, would be quite sufficient for their purpose.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Senator the Earl of Granard, I move amendment 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;First Schedule.  To delete the words &lsquo;and partridge&rsquo; in column 1 and to substitute therefor the words &lsquo;partridge and woodcock.&rdquo;&rsquo;</P>
      <P>The object of the amendment is to take woodcock out of the companionship of snipe, at the bottom of the Schedule, for close season purposes, and to put it into the better companionship of pheasant and partridge. The effect of the amendment is to start the close season time a month earlier; that is to start it on 1st February instead of on 1st March.  The close time will end on the same date as it did before for woodcock&mdash;namely, the end of September. The reason for the amendment, as explained to me by Senator the Earl of Granard, is that a large number of woodcock now breed in this country.  That is quite contrary to their habits when I was young. There was then very great difficulty indeed in getting the eggs of woodcock. But such a large quantity of woodcock now breed in the country that an amendment of this kind is considered necessary.  They pair very often before 1st February.  I cannot see that any harm can be done by making the close time a little longer in the case of woodcock and changing the date from 1st March to 1st February.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see that any case really has been made out for this amendment.  The real object of the amendment is to shorten, at the spring end, the shooting season for woodcock.  The statement has been made that woodcock pair earlier than they used to. I do not know that there is any authority for that statement or that there is any evidence that they do. The fact that you see two woodcock together in February does not prove that they have paired any more than it does when you see two woodcock together in October, November or December.  The same thing holds with regard to snipe.  If you are shooting well you might get snipe right and left at any season of the year.  The fact that they are seen together in the month of February does not prove that they have paired.  I do not know that there is any evidence that they do.  In February you have a good deal of woodcock shooting.  I believe that a great number of owners of woodcock shoots would consider that they had lost many a good day's shooting if an amendment like this were inserted.  Of course, we are all out for the preserving of Irish game. Perhaps I am now coming to a rather vexed question, that is, how far the woodcock that are bred in Ireland migrate, and if they do migrate to what extent they return.  I understand that the percentage of ringed birds that have been shot in this country is infinitesimal in comparison with the number of birds that have been ringed.  I do not think that this amendment would really help Irish shooting.</P>

    <P>First Schedule.  To delete the words &ldquo;From the 15th day of <Col N="402" /> February to the 15th day of October, both days inclusive,&rdquo; inserted in Committee and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;From the 1st day of March to the 31st day of August, both days inclusive.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I understand this is the working out of a compromise with the sportsmen in the eastern counties of the Saorstát where snipe prevail and the western counties as regards dates.  If you begin as late as the date in the Bill, the close time is to be the 1st March instead of the 15th February.  Most of the snipe then in the eastern counties have got away to the west, and the sportsmen in the east do not get their chance.  I understand the dates are a sort of compromise.</P>

      <P>I entirely agree that snipe should come in to be shot on the 1st of October and go out on the 1st February.  These are dates I would prefer both for snipe and woodcock.  I think that is the real compromise between the persons who are fighting to have snipe come in on the 15th August and the equally strong body of opinion that are fighting that snipe should not come in until the 1st October.  I think as far as snipe is concerned this is the correct date, but I would like to see the same date applied to woodcock.</P>

      <P>I am in favour of the motion, but I would like to enter a protest against the method that has been adopted of unloading on us here the various stages of Bills and putting them through without adequate consideration.  We have four such motions here to-day, and I submit it is not fair to legislation and not fair to the Seanad that this thing should be done wholesale.  We have had it before, and I am almost certain that we will have it at the Easter recess and the Summer recess. I suggest that is bad for legislation and for the work of the Seanad.  We come to the Committee Stage of a Bill, and then it is rushed through the Report and Fifth Stages.</P>
      <P>I submit that in the Committee Stage and the Report Stage many points are discussed upon which we cannot make up our minds in five or ten minutes, and we should have the opportunity of considering them at a later stage of the Bill.  I submit the present method is not healthy legislation. I want to enter my protest and that of my Party against wholesale and indiscriminate putting through of Bills at the last moment.</P>

      <P>We are all of the same opinion as Senator Connolly.  This has happened very frequently, and it ought not to be allowed to interfere in any way with the mode in which this House does its duty by a Bill. There are three or four Bills on the Order Paper which have been passed <Col N="405" /> by suspending Standing Orders.  The only excuse for that was that to not one of these Bills was there any amendment.  They are Bills which need to be passed hurriedly, but we were not depriving ourselves of the opportunity of considering these Bills.  They have been considered, and there were no amendments submitted. I hope that Senators, when dealing with the other Bills on the Paper, if they come across any amendments which, in their opinion, would be of advantage to the Bill, will not hesitate to give expression to their opinion, notwithstanding that the Bill will have to go back to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I have been asked by Senator McEllin to move this amendment on his behalf.  It reads:</P>
      <P>After the word &ldquo;pigs&rdquo; where-ever it occurs to insert the words &ldquo;or other classes of live stock.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill specifies that certain allowances can be granted either as building or improvement allowances for both pigs and poultry.  Now, one section deals with pigs and our argument is that this should be made to include any other animal on the ground that as the Bill stands nothing but a pig could be kept in an outhouse built under that grant.  I feel that that is an unwise restriction.  It might be desirable for the tenant or owner of such a house to have a cow if he could afford to have or keep one, and I cannot see any reason for the restriction purely to pigs only.  The Minister may have some specific reason.  It may be that he wants the Gaeltacht to be devoted solely and exclusively as far as animals are concerned to the development of pigs and poultry.  I do not know. It may be that there is no feeding for cattle available to the holders of these houses in the Gaeltacht, but I think the section as it stands inflicts an unnecessary inconvenience <Col N="407" /> on the owner who may get a grant under this Bill.  It may be that it would be an inconvenience to prevent him from keeping cows or a donkey in that building.  I cannot understand why the restriction is there.  The Minister may have reasons for it.  I would be glad to know what they are.  In the meantime, I move this amendment and I think the House will agree with me that it is a perfectly intelligible amendment.  The owner should be allowed to keep in his out-house any animal that he is able to keep there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Senator Connolly in this amendment. I think it is a very short sighted policy in reference to these building grants that there should be any exclusion of cattle or donkeys. These are as necessary to the welfare of the people as any other animal, if they can afford to have them.  They should be put in the position of having shelter for these animals.  In my opinion, it would be very nonsensical for the House and would show a very short-sighted policy not to allow house-room or shelter for cows or donkeys.  It appears unwise to restrict the use of the house entirely to pigs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot really understand how Senators can read anything into the Bill that we have put any restriction whatever on anybody keeping cows or donkeys.  There is no such restriction there.  I do not know whether a man can drive a cow into a pigsty or if he can drive a donkey into it, but if he can, we have no objection to his doing so. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent <Col N="408" /> his doing it.  The only restriction we have is that we are making grants as far as the ancillary houses are concerned only for poultry and pigs because we are advised by the Department of Agriculture that for the Gaeltacht these are the types of stock most suitable and the types of stock that requires the least amount of capital.  They require a certain amount of care and attention, and given care and attention they should add materially to the income of the people there.  I would be as desirous as Senators Connolly or O'Connor that the people, if they can afford it, should have cattle in their little holdings in the Gaeltacht, and I would be equally anxious that proper housing should be provided for them.  But in this particular Bill we are giving £250,000.  That money is to be spread over a very considerable area; we hold that the most important expenditure out of that £250,000 should be, first of all, for dwelling-houses for the people.  They must have dwelling-houses first of all, and then the other things must follow.</P>
      <P>There are ways of getting loans for erecting out-houses for donkeys and so on.  There are such facilities already.  The Board of Works has a loan system.  That fact was denied in the Dáil and I made inquiries and found that there is such a system at work; there is a system for the giving of loans for building out-houses. I stated here on the Second Reading, and I stated it in the Dáil, that when giving loans we have to watch that the persons who are applying for them will have some capacity for repaying. We want, as far as possible, to provide for persons who are anxious to build houses; but when giving these loans we want to give them to people who will be in a position to repay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are advised that keeping poultry and pigs will add materially to the possibility of these people being able to apply for loans, and it will put them in the position of being able to repay the loans.  I am opposed to the amendment, because anything that extends the expenditure <Col N="409" /> of the £250,000 provided will mean that you will have fewer dwelling-houses.  I think that is the great argument against this amendment. If you extend the Bill for the purpose of building houses for cattle, it will mean fewer dwelling-houses.</P>

During the debate in the Dáil&mdash;I am not so sure about the debate in the Seanad&mdash;the Minister said he hoped the people in the Gaeltacht would build houses under this Bill and that the old houses would be used as cattle sheds.  In the same debate, he indicated that the Bill provided for the abolition of the old houses.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 7, sub-section (2).  To insert before the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  No building grant or improving grant shall be made under this Act to any person</P>
      <P>(a)  who is in receipt of a salary or pension other than old age pension or disability allowance exceeding £25 per annum, or</P>
      <P>(b)  whose household income exceeds £52 per annum, or</P>
      <P>(c)  the poor law valuation of whose holding exceeds £10.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is merely to secure that the most deserving and poorest people in the <Col N="411" /> area shall be provided for as far as possible.  We realise there is a Vote of only £250,000 involved in this measure.  It is not a large amount, and it has got to cover a fairly wide area.  A good many districts appear in the Schedule, and if one tries to figure out how many homes can be built or rebuilt out of that amount one is forced to the belief that there will be very few indeed in each area. Our purpose is to secure that the most needy and most deserving cases will be attended to, particularly in view of the small amount that will be available.  We realise that the State at the moment has not all the money that we would like to see devoted to the preservation of the Gaeltacht.  We would like to prevent anything in the way of grants being given either under the influence of local politicians or to people who might be most likely to get influence in their areas.</P>
    <P>We feel that if these three clauses are inserted in the measure they will ensure that, at all events, those who are getting grants, either for building or improving, will be genuinely in need.  Obviously, any person who is not in receipt of a salary or pension, other than old age pension or disability allowance exceeding £25 per annum, or whose household income does not exceed £52 per annum will be a needy person.  These clauses would prevent people in fairly good circumstances from getting grants, instead of people who are the very poorest element in the Gaeltacht.  We know something about the way in which grants for labourers' cottages worked out, and we know that at present throughout the country there are many people in those cottages paying very small, or nominal rents, of 1s. 6d., 2s. or 2s. 6d. a week, who are better able to afford ordinary house rent than the poor people in the area.  I refer to postmen and to other officials of that type.  It is to prevent such abuses creeping into the Gaeltacht and to ensure that the really needy people will get the benefit of the measure that we propose to introduce <Col N="412" /> these clauses into the section. They would go a long way to prevent such abuses.  I therefore move the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. Gogarty Dr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>That might be all very well if there were any way of connecting a man's income with his taste in houses.  I do not think that there is the least danger at this time in our history of corruption as regards the allocation of houses.  I can very well see an instance where a man with an income, either visible or concealed, might elect to live in an insanitary house, and the only way to get him out would be to put him into a new one.  Many of the houses in the Gaeltacht are already medically condemned as unsuitable, but inasmuch as up to this no effort could be made to improve or replace them, it was impossible to take a tenant from an insanitary house and put him on the hillside.  On that account one had to wait for a measure such as this.  You must have a suitable house to put a man in before you take him from an insanitary one.  If you make the allocation of grants dependent on a man's valuation or income you will ignore the condition of the house in which the man is living.  It is more important to condemn the house than to condemn the possible tenant of a new one.  If I thought that the amendment would achieve that, I would support it.  There is no place where measures of relief of this kind are more necessary than in the Gaeltacht, but they must march with some other authority than the authority of a particular Department. A large number of other grants would be saved by the provision of houses&mdash;for instance, the utter waste of money, to the extent of £110,000, for domiciliary visits in the case of tubercular treatment. You might as well throw that money into the Liffey.  The Gaeltacht is a breeding ground for tuberculosis owing to the bad conditions of housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The moment that those insanitary houses are removed there will, I believe, be a good deal of economy in <Col N="413" /> other directions.  You will not get rid of insanitary houses by saying that a man is not to get a grant, for instance, if the poor law valuation of his holding exceeds £10.  The grant should be consequent on the medical condemnation of a man's house. There are things in this Bill which will have to be put under some of the Medical Acts.  It is not generally known that there is practically no milk in the Gaeltacht from November to May.  That is why I hold that the extension of the word &ldquo;pigs&rdquo; to cover &ldquo;cattle&rdquo; is so important, because red tape is so capable of entangling and stultifying the intentions of the measure that if a man were found with an animal other than a pig in a pigstye it might be possible to withhold the grant.  These grants should be dependent on the sanitary condition of the houses and not on the income of the tenant. There is no ground for suspecting that there will be any corruption in the allocation of grants.</P>

      <P>I agree with a great deal which Senator Dr. Gogarty has said, and particularly his statement with regard to the £110,000 spent on tuberculosis inspection.  That money is absolutely thrown away unless you go to the root of the matter and provide proper housing, because the main cause of consumption is undoubtedly these insanitary houses.  I commend Senator Connolly's amendment to the Seanad for the reason that the worst houses belong to the poorer classes, speaking generally, and you can only legislate in general terms.  These are the people who should be first relieved.  Senator Gogarty has referred to medical certification as a preliminary to any grant.  I know positively that at least 25 per cent of the houses would be condemned were it not that the medical men know that there is no way of providing alternative accommodation, <Col N="414" /> so that the question of medical certification is really one of academic interest only.</P>
      <P>I commend Senator Connolly's amendment to the consideration of the House and I believe that if the Minister realises the force of that amendment, he will not oppose it. In one sentence it means this: There are houses in a bad condition.  These are the houses that should be first looked after.  They belong to the poorer people, men with less than £10 valuation.  Cut the gad next the neck first and then go on with the scheme for improving houses which are not so badly in need of being repaired or replaced.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Senator who proposed the amendment a question in regard to sub-clause (a).  Does the limitation of £25 refer to salary or pension or does it refer to old age pensions or disability allowance?  As I read it, it might refer to one or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree generally with the amendment, but I think that in regard to clause (b), it is a bit doubtful.  I do not know exactly what the Senator means by &ldquo;household income.&rdquo;  Does he mean what the man concerned is able to knock out of his land?  If it means the entire value of what he is able to produce and sell, then it means that to a certain extent you are penalising the hardworking, industrious man as against the careless, lazy individual. A farmer, for instance, who works throughout the winter draining and improving his land and generally making it more productive, is able to make more out of it than the man who lies up during the winter, takes very little care of his land and never tries to improve it by drainage or top-dressing.  Consequently, the hardworking man would have a bigger household income and the suggestion is that that man should be penalised as against the man who lets his land go partly to waste and who is not able as a result to get the same return out of it.  We have been for a long time advocating the abolition of the income qualification in the matter of old age <Col N="415" /> pensions on the ground that it discourages thrift and encourages a man to be thriftless and almost penniless when he arrives at the age to get a pension.  That principle has been adopted in Great Britain.</P>
      <P>I do not like to insert a provision in the Bill which discourages a man from doing the best for his family and to knock the most out of the small, barren piece of land which he may have.  I am afraid that subclause (b) would have that effect. I know, of course, that in this Bill we are merely touching the fringe of a very big problem.  We can only scrape on the edge of it, as it were, and to that extent it is desirable that the very poor should be assisted first.  I see great danger in this subclause (b).  I think if that were dropped, we could still have an amendment which would be effective and which would achieve the object which the Senator has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to try to explain the point raised by Senator Guinness, and also to make an explanation which perhaps may elucidate the matter for Senator O'Farrell.  Senator Guinness asked what I mean by sub-section (a), &ldquo;who is in receipt of a salary or pension other than old age pension or disability allowance exceeding £25 per annum.&rdquo;  That would mean an income other than an old age pension or a disability allowance exceeding £25 if there was income from property or any source other than an old age pension or a disability allowance exceeding that amount.  I think it is perfectly clear as stated in the amendment.  With regard to Senator O'Farrell's point, I appreciate fully what he says, and it might be necessary or desirable to postpone that portion of the amendment until the Report Stage.  In old age pension cases and in other matters where grants are given, it has been known that the proprietor of the house or the holder of the property has passed on the property to his son so as to secure an old age pension.  You might have the holder of the land without any income, but <Col N="416" /> he might have two sons on Great War pensions or pensions from some other source up to £2 or £3 a week. It is to prevent abuses of that kind creeping in that the amendment is proposed.  We might be able to find some means whereby we would get an agreed amendment to that effect. I do not suggest that nobody in the Gaeltacht should be allowed an income of more than £1 per week.</P>
      <P>I wanted to prevent that sort of thing being done&mdash;the father of a family, say, who had two sons with pensions of £2 or £3 per week either as a result of the Great War or from any other source, getting a grant because he individually was not possessed of any other income.  I do not know what would meet the matter so far as Senator O'Farrell is concerned, whether or not we should leave it aside to see if we can get an agreed amendment, but that is all I had in mind when I put it down.</P>

One family might consist of ten or even more, whereas another family might consist of only three or four, and the latter family might come in for a grant, while the large family would not come in for it.</P>

      <P>I am in sympathy with the general purport of the amendment, but I see a real difficulty in applying it in its present form.  I should like to call attention to the fact that this is a single grant, not a per annum grant.  Paragraph (a) deals with a salary or pension or disability allowance exceeding £25 per annum.  If you give a grant to-day and the person gets a pension tomorrow of £50, you are not effecting the end you are seeking.  I do not know what amendment to suggest to achieve the end, but I am convinced that these two paragraphs (a) and (b) are only valuable as an indication of what is desired, and are not going to be very effective in the <Col N="417" /> statute.  The poor law valuation is something definite and easily understandable. That may go a very long way towards meeting the end sought for.  I am afraid that paragraphs (a) and (b) would be difficult to utilise to secure the end without doing possible harm in directions we do not want.  I am inclined to advise that the Senator should, at this stage at any rate, confine his amendment to paragraph (c).</P>

      <P>An amendment similar to this was introduced in the Dáil and I stated there that the amendment was in complete harmony with the spirit of the Bill.  If I had the slightest doubt that anything like what Senator Connolly fears might occur.  I would have no hesitation in accepting the amendment or some amendment of the kind, but I have not the slightest doubt that it can occur.  There are objections to paragraph (b) that Senator O'Farrell did not refer to, to which I can refer later.  At any rate, I have no doubt that the provisions in the Bill as it stands are sufficient to guarantee that what the mover of the amendment is aiming at will be achieved. Section 3 states: &ldquo;Where, in the opinion of the Minister, a dwelling house in the Gaeltacht is wholly unsuitable for the proper and healthy accommodation of the occupier thereof and his family,&rdquo; the Minister may make a grant.  It is laid down that the existing house must be wholly unfit or unsuitable for the accommodation of the occupier. That is one condition governing the giving of the grant.  Section 11 provides that you must have, in the first place an Irish-speaking household. That is, that first preference must be given to a household in which Irish is the ordinary language. That is a really over-riding preference. After that, there comes the condition that amongst the Irish-speaking household the one which. from the point of view of sanitation and so on, is the worst, must get the preference.  You have, first of all, the Irish-speaking household.  That is number 1 preference.  Number 2 is that the house amongst these with <Col N="418" /> the worst sanitation must get the preference.  Number 3 is that the preference must be given to where the valuations are lowest.  We take the valuation, I suppose, as the Senator would take it, because it is an indication of the economic position of the household.  I feel that these provisions are adequate to meet what the Senator has in his mind. At any rate, in the administration of the Act, naturally these considerations will have to be borne in mind. I do not know whether there could be anything put into the regulations that would tie us down in that way. I could not say that now, because I do not know, as I have not thought of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the point that Senator O'Farrell made, with reference to a household with an income of £52 being precluded, that would involve something that would be rather objectionable if it were inserted in the Bill.  It would impose on my Department a statutory obligation to hold an investigation into the incomes of households in the Gaeltacht applying for a grant.  That is a kind of thing that I should not like to take on.  I am certain there would be a great deal of resentment on the part of the persons concerned.  In fact, I know there would be, because I had occasion to do something of the kind in one particular townland in order to see what I could do to better conditions there, and there was considerable resentment.  There will have to be a certain amount of investigation, for instance, where there is an application for a loan, because there we will have to find out the capacity of the person to repay.  Our principal viewpoint in the matter will be to find out, in the least objectionable way, the conditions of the household, so that we may see what we can do to improve the conditions and enable them to repay the loan.  I have particulars of some cases here which were ascertained in the investigation which I had made in one townland.  There is a case of a father and mother with eight children where the total income was estimated as £57.  Under the Senator's amendment that family would be <Col N="419" /> precluded, and they are living in an extremely bad house.  These cases are in the parish of Carraroe, probably one of the worst in Connemara, or in all Ireland, in fact.  Another case is that of a widow with six children living in an extremely bad house, and the total income there is £84.  Nobody would suggest that a widow with six children, with a total income of £84, should be precluded from a grant under the Bill.  There are various cases of that kind.  For instance, there is a case where the father is 70 and the mother 50; there are ten children, and the total estimated income is £99.  I could not stand over the figures in these cases owing to the way they were gathered. They are not entirely reliable.  They were gathered by a lady official of the Department, whose ordinary duty is the visiting of these houses from week to week.  They are as reliable as they could be in the circumstances, but this official found very considerable resentment at the inquiries she had to make even to glean this information.  I am satisfied the amendment is unnecessary.</P>
    <P>I do not know how any Minister, in administering an Act of this kind, could stand for a moment, for instance, over giving a grant to, say, a schoolmaster, or a pensioner of the R.I.C. or National Army living in the Gaeltacht.  If he had a pension of any substance, first of all he would not be living in an entirely insanitary house.  At any rate, the administration would take cognisance of all the facts.  It would be contrary to the whole spirit of the Bill and what is behind the bringing of it forward if we were to depart from that and give grants to persons for whom the Bill was never intended. Reference was made to things which did not apply, for instance, to labourers' cottages and matters like that.  First of all the labourers' cottages were built by the local authority and they were allotted by the local authorities&mdash;at present the boards of health&mdash;to certain occupiers. I quite agree with what the Senator said, that in many cases these cottages were given to people <Col N="420" /> for whom they were never intended. But under this Bill the grant is given to a man to build his own house.  He is in a different position from the position under the Labourers Acts.</P>

Surely that is quite a different position from that in which, under a local authority, building a string of labourers cottages here and there and everywhere, and were then given out to postmen and blacksmiths and teachers and persons of that kind for whom they were never intended. As I say, I am satisfied that the provisions of this Bill under Section 3 and under Section 11, which I have quoted are sufficiently tight to prevent any abuse occurring.</P>

      <P>I think if Senator Connolly will look at paragraph (b) of this amendment, &ldquo;whose household income exceeds £52 per annum,&rdquo; he will realise a great deal of that, in regard to the part of the country we are legislating for, comes from America.  A great deal of money comes from America regularly to the West of Ireland and I do not think that should be classed as income with a view to preventing a person getting a house.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement has rather convinced me that such an amendment as I have on the agenda to-day is necessary.  We are at present considering the spending of £250,000; that is not a lot of money to spend in housing covering as it does a very wide area, and the object of my amendment is to secure that we ought to treat the most needy people in the area.  The Minister has quoted figures here of people in Carraroe with £57 10s. income and another family with £84 income.  We all admit these are very small incomes, but we all know that there are very much smaller incomes <Col N="421" /> in the Gaeltacht, and my concern is that the people with very small incomes should first get the benefit. Neither the Minister nor Senator O'Farrell desires to see decent incomes in the Gaeltacht more than I do, but we must realise the facts.  I know that there are families in the Gaeltacht whose total income is not more than 10/- or 11/- per week, and it is to ensure that these people will be the first to be considered that I have put down my amendment.  If we figure out the amount available it will not give more than 3,000 houses, and if we take into consideration that grants for outhouses will be paid out of the sum available, it will not even give 3,000 houses.  My point is that the very poorest ought to be provided for, and I think an amendment such as I am moving would be the only means of getting them provided for.  It is all very well for the Minister to say that the Local Government Board did certain things, but how do we know that the Department for Lands and Fisheries will not do equally bad things.  We are asked to trust the Department more than we were ever asked to trust the Local Government Board.  I do not see any reason why we should leave ourselves at the mercy of this Ministry any more than at the mercy of the Local Government Board.  Can he give us an assurance that the people with the least incomes will be the first to be provided for?  With regard to pensioners and other people, they are still liable to come in and to get grants for houses.  I am convinced that my amendment is necessary. While perhaps clause (b) is not ideal, I am willing to consider the possibility of improving it.  I want to feel that those people with less than £1 a week will be the people who shall get houses.  There is not going to be anything like 3,000 built under this particular grant.  At any rate that is the maximum number.  If that is so, we will find there are a lot of people with not more than 10/- or 11/- a week who need decent houses, and they ought to be served first.</P>

      <P>Section 11, sub-section (2).  To delete in line 46 the words &ldquo;five pounds&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;twenty pounds.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not separate the nation from its people and we are hardly <Col N="424" /> going to separate the Gaeltacht from the Gaels who speak Gaelic in the Gaeltacht.  This Bill is intended to better the people, not to beautify the country by improving the houses.  I think the main idea is to help people to exist.  My amendment would enable the people to better their conditions rather than merely to build houses by apportioning a greater amount of money to the erection of piggeries and poultry houses. It would enable the poor farmer to make a turn-over that would help him to exist.  If you were to build even a delectable house you would be merely making a mockery of the man's hunger.</P>
    <P>I think it is more important to give these people an opportunity of bettering their conditions even to the extent of producing more food. I suggest that the increasing the amount from £5 to £20 would be an improvement in the Bill.  After all, the man who is able to get three meals a day would soon take care of the leakage in the roof.  But if he is hungry he will not care a rap about the leakage in the roof or anywhere else.  I think increasing the amount to £25 would help even the housing.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that £5 for a piggery is something in the nature of a humbug altogether.  I find now that the Minister wants to prevent the piggery from being a cowhouse.  I think that Senator Robinson's amendment should be accepted and that the figure should be £20 seeing it is not to be a timber house, because, as the Minister very carefully said when he introduced this Bill&mdash;in the West of Ireland any house except one made of stone or some other heavy material is useless.  You can do nothing for £5 in the way of building. A man would not even come to look after the foundations for the £5.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I think if there is going to be an increase in grants in respect to these various heads I would rather see an increase in the grant for a house. After all, this is a grant towards the cost of building, in this case, a piggery. <Col N="425" /> I do not think it is to be assumed that every case of a new house or an improved house is going to be accompanied by a grant for the building of a piggery.  Really, the need for houses is much greater than the need for new piggeries, and I would suggest to the Senator who moved this that the increase of £15 which he looks for to build a piggery would be much better spent if you made your housing grant £95 instead of £80.  From the point of view of spending £250,000 and getting value in better health and better amenities for the country, it is really more advantageous to increase the sum for the houses rather than for the piggeries. I think it is inadvisable to ask the House to agree to this improvement until we have had a little more information regarding the cost of building houses, which I hope we shall get before this section is through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, I thought this amendment would more or less fall with the amendments dealing with the additions to live stock to the clause.  We do not propose to make a full grant either for the building of the person's dwelling-house or the building of his poultry house, or the building of his piggery.  That was never the intention. We go portion of the way in order to help him, and we anticipate that he will do a great deal of the work himself.  That is the principle underlying the whole Bill.  There is no question as to the point Senator Comyn made that he would not get a man to go to look at the foundations. We anticipate that he will look at the foundations himself, and practically put up the whole building himself, and this Bill is only to come in to enable him to roof the building and put on the door.  The sum estimated for a piggery varies. In three or four counties in the Gaeltacht the sum estimated for the putting up of a piggery of the type we meant would be £9 5s. 0d.  In Kerry it would be £9 16s. 0d., and in Donegal £9 19s. 0d.  We propose that the grant will be something <Col N="426" /> over half the total cost.  We think that is entirely sufficient, and I entirely agree with Senator Johnson when he says it would be far better, if we were to change the present Bill at all, to allocate a further £15 to enable a person to build a dwelling-house than curtail the amount for a dwelling-house by adding to the amount for poultry or pigs.</P>

When he said that, the need for an amendment such as this becomes almost apparent because you cannot build a house for £5 that will house cows.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 10.  The amendment, in my opinion, goes to the basic principle underlying the Bill.  In my speech on the Second Stage, I intimated that this Bill was not to be considered a Housing Bill.  It was merely put forward as a Gaeltacht Housing Bill, so as to provide proper houses in the Gaeltacht.  That, I presume, was prompted by the desire on the part of certain people in the country or by pressure from certain people in the country to preserve the Gaeltacht&mdash;to hold those parts of the western seaboard where there are native speakers of Irish together&mdash; and to prevent the people going abroad by providing them with the means of subsistence at home, under conditions that would at least be Christian.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intimated in my speech that I was not in agreement with the Schedule attached to the Bill, not because I objected to the spending of money in those areas mentioned, but because I felt that the amount of money allocated was too small to make any <Col N="428" /> appreciable impression in the areas outlined.  No doubt, the Minister reserved to himself in the Bill the right to curtail or extend the Schedule, but I felt that although the Bill itself is a Government Bill we must share the responsibility for its administration, and we must endeavour to visualise how it will be applied in the country and its effects generally, not merely in the Gaeltacht, but throughout the whole country.  If the main purpose underlying the Bill is as was stated, I felt that we should concentrate on the relief of those in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, that we should see that those in the areas where Irish is spoken generally should be served first at least.</P>
    <P>I might say that my original idea in connection with the curtailment of the Schedule was a curtailment of the area, and I suggested that probably instead of district electoral divisions it should be per caput 21/- valuation. On afterthoughts I came to the conclusion that it would be advisable to retain all the areas outlined in the Schedule by the Minister, provided that the Minister extended the preference which he has given expression to in sub-section (3), Section 11.  He commits himself in that sub-section to the principle embodied in my amendment.  He asks the Oireachtas to pass a Bill providing for the allocation of money for building in certain areas, giving a preference to those living in those areas who utilise the Irish language habitually as the language of the household.  My amendment is simply extending that preference and guaranteeing that its application shall become more rigid, and consequently more acceptable, and likely to produce the results than sub-section (3), which reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the making of building grants and improving grants the Minister shall give a preference to the occupiers of dwelling-houses in which the Irish language is habitually used as the home language of the household, and amongst occupiers of such dwelling-houses the Minister shall give a preference to the occupiers of dwelling-houses having the greater <Col N="429" /> overcrowding, the worse sanitary conditions and the lower valuation under the Valuation Acts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My amendment simply means that the Schedule attached to the Bill is analysed scientifically.  In passing, I wish to say that I owe a great deal to Senator Johnson for the co-operation he gave me in analysing the Gaeltacht areas.  I think on close examination it will be found that with the statistics at hand the areas outlined in the Schedule and analysed in my schedule will be correct. Column 1 contains the district electoral divisions in which according to the Census of 1926 eighty per cent. or more of the inhabitants are Irish speakers.  All the areas outlined in Schedule 2 have already been mentioned in Schedule I. Column 1 contains the districts where Irish speakers are more than eighty per cent. of the inhabitants. In my opinion, that is the section of the country that should get attention in the first instance under the terms of this Bill.  Column 2 contains the district electoral divisions in which according to the Census of 1926, twenty-five per cent. to eighty per cent. of the inhabitants are Irish speakers and of which the valuation averages not more than 21s. per caput.  In other words, after taking the eighty per cent.  Irish speakers we go to the next Irish-speaking district as far as strength is concerned &mdash;the next Irish-speaking district where some twenty-five per cent. to eighty per cent. are Irish speakers and whose valuations average not more than 21s. per caput.  The needs of the districts in the first column have been attended to.  We desire that those districts outlined in column 2 should have next preference and similarly with column 3. Column 3 enumerates districts which would receive attention after those in columns 1 and 2 have been attended to and those districts outlined in column 3 more or less coincide with the &ldquo;pockets,&rdquo; to use the word of the Minister introducing the Bill, or Irish-speaking districts in the Gaeltacht.  I do not think I can say any more on the amendment.  I am <Col N="430" /> anxious that the Seanad should place itself on record as being in favour of the allocation of the money according to the original intention of those who conceived the Bill or whose enthusiasm forced the measure into being.</P>
    <P>I think that it would be a terrible thing if the Oireachtas committed itself to an expenditure of £250,000 &mdash;a quarter of a million pounds&mdash; over the area as outlined in the Bill, without preference being given to the Irish-speaking districts.  I would ask, therefore, that the Seanad give kindly consideration to the amendment from the point of view of the preservation of the Gaeltacht, which is a much more important thing than the preservation of game.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is probable that I approach this question on somewhat different lines from those of Senator O'Doherty, not very much different perhaps, but with a little change of emphasis.  My way of looking at it is that I would prefer that this question had been dealt with from the point of view of human need as even superior to the need for maintaining the Gaelic tongue.  But the Bill is frankly and openly a Bill for maintaining the Gaelic tongue in the Gaeltacht, and accepting that point of view, I think that the amendment is worthy of support.  To begin with, it accepts the proposition that the Minister has put forward in the Bill, that the Gaeltacht consists of these 658 district electoral divisions which are in the Schedule.  But the Minister has stated&mdash;I will not say admitted because that suggests it was wrung from him&mdash;frankly that he does not expect that the Bill will have any application outside the much narrower area which is included in the Second Schedule which is put forward by Senator O'Doherty; that is to say, that although he has 650 electoral divisions in the Schedule as comprising the Gaeltacht, he does not expect that the Bill will be applicable in more than 100 or 130 of these 650 divisions.  He has taken as the basis of his own Schedule the <Col N="431" /> Census returns of 1926, and in doing that he says that he has followed the advice of the Gaeltacht Commission, confirmed by the Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out that the Report of the Gaeltacht Commission was based on personal inquiry, as well as the figures of their enumeration, compared with the 1911 Census.  But I would like to get some information from the Minister as to how this original Schedule&mdash;the Schedule in the Bill&mdash;was arrived at.  It is based on the number of Irish speakers according to that census.  But the census inquiry consisted of these questions: In the column headed &ldquo;Irish language,&rdquo; the first intimation was &ldquo;(1) Write &lsquo;Irish only&rsquo; opposite the name of a person who can speak only Irish.  (2) Write &lsquo;Irish and English&rsquo; opposite the name of a person who is a native Irish speaker, but who can speak English; and (3) Write &lsquo;English and Irish&rsquo; opposite the name of a person who can speak both languages, but who is not a native Irish speaker.&rdquo; Perhaps the Minister can tell us whether, in his enumeration of the 25 per cent.  Irish speakers, he means those who speak Irish only, those whose native tongue is English, but who speak Irish also, or if it comprises the three?  If it does the last, and I expect it does, then it will be obvious that it is not a correct description of what has ever been known as the Gaeltacht, because many of the juniors of a family who do speak English normally but who can also speak Irish, would be included in the 25 per cent.  As I said before, we have not had access to the Census figures, so that the Minister has an advantage in that respect. But as a suggestion of the additional schedule which is contained within the larger Schedule, but which really defines these areas which the Minister has indicated that he intends shall be dealt with, I think the amendment really is more honest, that the people who are likely to be interested in the Bill <Col N="432" /> will be more fairly dealt with if you intimate to them in the Bill itself&mdash; not in the Minister's promises&mdash;that those who will get first preference in this matter are those who speak Irish wholly in their families and are also poor, and that those who will get second preference are those who are not to the same degree Irish speakers, but who are living in districts that are poor as well as being Irish-speaking, and that those in the third column of the Schedule are less likely to get assistance than the first two, and in effect that the remainder, to keep the Minister's assurance, are not likely to get any benefit at all by the Bill.</P>
    <P>My chief concern in this matter is to refrain from misleading the public, and I believe that the Schedule as it stands in the Bill at present is calculated to mislead very large numbers of people, because it contains 500 district electoral divisions to which the Minister has told us he does not expect the Bill to have any application at all.  The amendment, therefore, would go far to remove that possible misunderstanding and deception, and I think it is worthy of support.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding the very obvious earnestness of the Senator who has moved this amendment, I feel that I cannot support it.  No doubt he has taken great pains and has got all the available data to compile this Schedule and to secure that essentially Irish-speaking districts, or almost exclusively Irish-speaking districts, should be put into the First Schedule, districts with a smaller percentage into the Second Schedule and so on.  Incidentally I may remark that though Cork is one-eighth of the whole area of the country, there are only three areas in Cork in the Senator's schedule, whereas there are twenty-three from Donegal.  Looking at the second column of the proposed schedule, I see Bealanageary, Macroom Rural District, and Bealanageary in the Dunmanway Rural District, in the third column.  Anyone who knows anything at all about it knows that, if anything, the part of Bealanageary <Col N="433" /> which is in Dunmanway Rural District should be in the first column.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">

      <P>I know that there are two.  One is in the first column, the portion of Bealanageary that is in the Macroom Rural District area. I am speaking of the part of Bealanageary that is in Dunmanway.  Anyone who knows the districts knows that that district is almost exclusively an Irish-speaking district. English is spoken and understood there, but it is almost exclusively an Irish-speaking district.  I hope, as I think all those who support the Bill also hope, that this is only an original measure to deal with the Gaeltacht.  As I said, I welcome it, and I would suggest that probably when an extension of this Bill in a future measure is before us, a more scientific schedule might be prepared in advance.  But at the moment I am opposed to this substitute Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>It does seem curious that under this Schedule, which is scientifically drawn up, Cork for a wonder is not doing well, while County Clare is doing even worse. At the same time I would ask the Seanad to support this amendment. When introducing this Bill the Minister said that the object, as indeed its terms proclaim, was to do something for the Gaeltacht.  There is the idea of preserving those communities that still speak the Irish language.  The object was two-fold, no doubt; there is the human need that Senator Johnson referred to, and there is also the national need to preserve the Gaeltacht. I think from the Minister's speech, and from the sentiments expressed in all parts of the House, the prevailing idea in this Bill, which deals only with a quarter of a million of money, is to foster and to preserve the Irish language.  If that is so, the more scientific way of dealing with the matter would be to give a special preference to those areas in which Gaelic is spoken by the great majority of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has put into the Schedule a great number of townlands. Senator Johnson said there were 650 townlands, and while he <Col N="434" /> was speaking I tried to enumerate them.  I think they come to that number.  If 650 is divided into £250,000 it will be found that there is only £400 for each district electoral division, not for each townland or group of townlands, but for each district electoral division.  That is a large and expansive gesture, but it cannot be anything more than a gesture, and in including all these townlands in the Schedule, I suggest the House is holding out promises to the ear but breaking them to the hope.  I would ask the House to accept the much more scientific schedule proposed by Senator O'Doherty. It does not exclude any of the townlands to which the Minister holds out his gesture, but the Minister has indicated, in the section referred to by Senator O'Doherty, that certain preferences are to be given.  Senator O'Doherty, with the assistance, as he has acknowledged, of Senator Johnson, has given in a scientific way an arrangement whereby that preference can be carried into effect.</P>
    <P>The sentiment that was in every mind during the progress of this Bill is put into language in the amendment suggested by Senator O'Doherty, and I would suggest to the Seanad, and to the Minister and his Department, that the amendment is worthy of close study and of acceptance.  It is really an efficient instrument for marking out the intentions of the House and the declared intention of the Bill.  In the First Schedule consisting of the really Gaelic-speaking people, there are 80 district electoral divisions, although there happen to be only three in Cork and one in Clare. When you come to see how small your cloth is, consisting of £250,000, I think the 80 district electoral divisions of the purely Irish-speaking districts, ought to absorb most of that and ought to get first preference. The amendment then goes on, when the needs of the real Gaelic speakers are provided for, to provide that any balance can go to the second class of people, who perhaps speak some Irish but whose mother tongue may be English.  They will absorb a considerable portion of the amount. <Col N="435" /> Then you come to the third part, which embraces all the remaining townlands to which the Minister's bounty will extend, if he has enough money, but which cannot be touched at all considering that he has only £250,000.  That is the scientific and honest way of dealing with this £250,000.  Let the people know what they are to get; let them know whether they have a real chance of getting anything.  If you adopt Senator O'Doherty's amendment that people in 80 townlands will know that they have a fair chance of getting something, the inhabitants of the other 200 townlands will know that their chances are slender, and in regard to the great mass of the townlands enumerated in the Minister's Schedule, there is no use in raising hopes that are sure to be disappointed.  I suggest that the amendment moved by Senator O'Doherty ought to be accepted, and that it is the only honest way of dealing with the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Schedule to this Bill is I think the most scientific available.  It is based on the latest census returns, taking into consideration what were the Gaeltacht Commission's recommendations to the Government, which the Government adopted in their White Paper. The Gaeltacht Commission's recommendations were that 25 per cent. Irish-speaking and over should be called Breac-Ghaeltacht; from 25 to 80 per cent. were designated as Breac or speckled Ghaeltacht; and 80 per cent. or over the Fíor-Ghaeltacht or practically entirely Irish-speaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well to talk about the enumeration of 1925 which was made by the Gaeltacht Commission&mdash;and which in fact is not in the first place a statutory document&mdash;and in the second place, when comparing the figures resulting from that enumeration with the figures of the 1911 Census, and the figures of the 1926 Census.  I believe they were very wide of the mark in many cases. The figures of the 1911 Census and the figures of the 1926 Census bear some relation to each other, but in a <Col N="436" /> great number of cases the 1925 enumeration is entirely away from either the 1911 Census or the 1926 Census.  I do not say that the census is the perfect way of getting at who is an Irish speaker and who is not. I believe, if people knew that such a Bill as this was coming along, that a great many persons in many electoral areas would put themselves down as Irish-speaking, and that you would have a much wider Gaeltacht than you have now.  At any rate, the Census is the only satisfactory document on which I could base the Schedule as to its width.  As to the raising of false hopes, I think that sufficient publicity has been given to the fact&mdash;I have stated this over and over again&mdash;that there are electoral areas mentioned in that Schedule which are there simply because the Census returns put them there.  In fact, only about 100 electoral areas will probably be affected by the Bill. I think that is sufficient to prevent the raising of false hopes but even if it were not, the provisions of the Bill itself, with the over-riding clauses to which I referred on another occasion to-day, dealing with the most insanitary habitations as regards Irish-speaking households, and those again with the lowest valuations, should, I think, confine the thing sufficiently low without going any further.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Doherty, I think, said that column 3 of his proposed schedule would cover the pockets to which I referred.  I am absolutely convinced that it would not.  Column 1 in the proposed schedule refers to &ldquo;district electoral divisions in which, according to the Census of 1926, 80 per cent. or more of the inhabitants are Irish speakers.&rdquo; Column 2 in the proposed schedule deals with &ldquo;district electoral divisions in which, according to the Census of 1926, 25 per cent. to 80 per cent. of the inhabitants are Irish speakers, and of which the valuation averages not more than 21s. per caput.&rdquo;  That is simple enough, but that would deny the benefits of the Bill to any of the places that became Breac-Ghaeltacht in the Gaeltacht <Col N="437" /> Commission's report unless they were included.  Take column 3 of the proposed schedule.  It deals with &ldquo;district electoral divisions not in column 1 or 2 which, according to the Census of 1926, contain less than 80 per cent. of Irish speakers, yet are denoted in the report of the Gaeltacht Commission as &ldquo;Irish-speaking Districts.&rdquo;  If that is what the Senator was referring to in regard to Irish-speaking pockets, it is not what I had in mind. What I had in mind was that in the breac-Ghaeltacht, exclusive of the places to which the three-fifths apply under Section 11, sub-section (4), you would have places where the per caput valuation might be over 21s.  That is because a big number of the valuations range just under £20, £9, £10, and so on.  You might have a very small pocket of Irish-speaking households.  Suppose you had only one that was a normally Irish-speaking household badly housed, that is the kind of case that I would not like to preclude from getting any help under the Bill, but I believe amendment 10 would preclude such a person from getting help.  Presumably, Senators realise that if you continue this preference it would entail further amendment, that is the removal of Section 11, sub-section (4).  I think that would be a corollary to the acceptance of the amendment.</P>

      <P>What I mean is that if the Senator continues his preferences he is making a new alignment so far as Section 11, sub-section (4) is concerned.  The Senator refers to first preferences in column 1, second preferences in column 2, and third preferences in column 3.  Senators must take into account that three-fifths must be allocated under Section 11, sub-section (4).  But Senator O'Doherty goes further, and wants to make this division.  As I understand it, it would be an almost necessary corollary that Section 11, sub-section (4) should go.</P>

      <P>Senator Johnson said he preferred that the economic need should be the overriding principle. The Senator, of course, admits that this is a Gaeltacht Bill, and that the whole purpose of it is to help to retain in decent comfort in the Gaeltacht the persons who are at present living in the Gaeltacht.  In fact, we are frequently faced with the difficulty of holding the balance between the economic outlook and the language outlook.  I feel that the method adopted in the Bill, with its overriding clauses governing the Schedule, is really the best arrangement. That is not dealing with the situation as between economic outlook and language outlook.  The Irish-speaking households, as I have mentioned already, are to get the first preference.  Three-fifths of the money available is to be devoted to places where the valuation, divided by population, is 21/- or under.  I am just as anxious as the Senator that the Fíor-Ghaeltacht should get some special recognition, but I think any Senator who examines the matter will find that in fact the three-fifths clause will apply almost entirely to the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.  As I said on the Second Reading of the Bill, there is nothing to preclude us from spending the whole of the money in the areas specified in Section 11, sub-section (4), but we are obliged to spend three-fifths of it there.  I would not like to tie myself so that I would not be able to deal with any special cases in any of the district electoral areas mentioned in the Schedule which the Census of 1926 says is 25 per cent. Irish-speaking or over.  We tie ourselves down to spending three-fifths of the money in the most uneconomic areas, and these happen to coincide almost entirely with the Fíor-Ghaeltacht. I am not prepared to accept the amendment.  I feel that it would tend to weaken the Gaeltacht rather than help towards its enlargement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister, with his knowledge of the Gaeltacht <Col N="439" /> and the Irish language movement, state that Drummullagh in the County Louth is part of the Gaeltacht? He said the proposed new Schedule would disentitle him to make provision for a single person, or for ten people, who may be living under bad housing conditions and who need new houses.  Would any person, ordinarily speaking or writing, refer to Drummullagh, or Newcastle in County Tipperary, or one or two of those places in County Limerick, as being part of the Gaeltacht because they happened to be put into the 1926 Census?  Undoubtedly, the acceptance of the amendment would confine these district electoral divisions to very doubtful utilisation of this Bill.  But once you have accepted the principle of the Gaeltacht Housing Bill, that its purpose is the perservation of the language in those districts normally Irish-speaking and to encourage them by giving them better houses, would it not be more honest and fairer to the people concerned to define these areas in the Bill?  The Minister has spoken of the Report of the Gaeltacht Commission as being unreliable in its enumeration. In the amending Schedule, the enumeration of the Gaeltacht Commission has been thrown aside entirely.</P>
      <P>Reference is made in the Gaeltacht Commission's Report to the fact that there were numerous places which were called &ldquo;Irish-speaking,&rdquo; but which had not been reported as being 80 per cent.  Irish-speaking by the enumerators.  If the Minister will refer to the Report of the Gaeltacht Commission, he will see that there are numerous places marked &ldquo;a,&rdquo; which are Irish-speaking, and &ldquo;b,&rdquo; which are partly Irish-speaking. Those two designations are not at all in accordance with the percentages, but are due to observation and general knowledge, and to comparison with the 1911 Census.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be found that in numerous districts marked &ldquo;a,&rdquo; where Irish was the language normally used by the people in their households, there are less than 70 per cent., in some cases, and as low as 60 per cent., <Col N="440" /> Irish-speaking, even in the enumerators' return.  The point the Minister made in comparing the Gaeltacht Commission's report with the census returns falls at once when one takes account of the observations made when passing through the districts, and the general knowledge of the Gaeltacht areas, by members of the Gaeltacht Commission.  Quite frankly, the Minister's claim means that you must trust the Minister and his Department absolutely in making a selection of those who shall receive benefits within this rather wide area &mdash;a much wider area than anyone has in mind when speaking of the Gaeltacht. It may be quite satisfactory to trust the administration so that you may not have any jealousies or discords created or envies aroused, but it is much easier and much more satisfactory to have the intention set out in the Bill, to accord with the intention of the Minister, and not to have it as widespread as it is, with the intimation that the great majority of the places are not going to be touched by the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Senator Johnson has touched the kernel of the situation with regard to this Bill.  We are anxious to define the specific area that is entitled to benefit.  In my opinion, it is ridiculous for a Minister to refer to the fact that he would like to see an Irish-speaking household in any district dealt with under the Bill, for surely he cannot regard an Irish-speaking household, say in Dublin, as forming part of the Gaeltacht?  I have met Gaelic-speaking households as far away as Springfield, Massachusetts. Are such places to be regarded as Irish-speaking districts? It is pretty hard to define these areas, I admit, but we have outlined the areas in accordance with the statistics placed at our disposal by the State.  I regret that Bealanageary in the County Cork has been omitted, and that a comparison has been, I do not say purposely, made by Senator Dowdall between Cork and Donegal.</P>

We say that these areas should get first preference in the way of treatment.  I think the Minister would be glad if in that rather restricted area where 80 per cent. are Gaelic-speaking the £250,000 should be spent, and that he could come to the Oireachtas and ask for a supplementary <Col N="442" /> grant to deal with the areas in columns 2 and 3.  The Minister says that he is relying absolutely on the Census of 1926, plus the consideration of the Gaeltacht Commission's report.  We exclude no area included in his Schedule from consideration under the Bill.  We simply ask that those in column 1 should be treated first, and then those in the second and third columns respectively, and if he has any surplus, let him treat the remaining districts outlined in his Schedule.  If he has no surplus, then I would support him in any requisition for a supplementary grant in order to deal with the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  How does the Minister arrive at the amount of the grant?  He has intimated that he expects the standard house to be valued, if it were being built in the ordinary contracting course, at £275. Such a house, again in the ordinary course of trading, might be divided into 50 per cent. labour and 50 per cent. material.  If we take that basis of calculation, we will assume labour at £137 10s.  I do not know how much is to be paid for skilled labour, for roofing and certain other work in which skill will be required; I do not know how much is allocated for that.  We are also expected to allow £137 10s. for the materials, minus such of the materials as will be obtained on or near the site&mdash;such as stones, sand, etc.  There will still be required an amount of material which must be purchased. such as roofing, iron work, and other materials of one sort and another.  I think we ought to have some idea as to what is in the Minister's mind. One may assume that the material to be purchased will cost £50.  I do <Col N="443" /> not know whether that is too much or too little, but it would leave £87 10s. as the value of the material which the man is likely to gather in his own neighbourhood&mdash;sand, stones, etc.  Similarly, with regard to labour, the amount to be paid for skilled labour does not seem to be likely to be much less than £50.</P>
      <P>If one is to assume a standard house, one can see that the person receiving a grant of £80 will be obliged to get the balance either by way of loan from the Minister, from a bank, from somebody else, or otherwise draw upon neighbours for a considerable proportion.  It seems to me the probabilities are that unless we are deceived as to the resources available for these residences in the Gaeltacht, there will not be many of these standard houses, and the class of houses likely to be built will be very much poorer than the standard house the Minister has in mind.  If one thinks of the £80 grant and the £80 worth of labour that is to be provided by the applicant, you have a total of £160.  Is that to be the value of the house? How much of the £160 are we to assume the applicant is going to raise on his own account?</P>
      <P>The indications are that we are going to have a number of poor houses replacing very poor houses, and that most of the money is going to be spent in improving houses that ought to be demolished.  It was with this in view that I suggested it would be better to have a larger grant than £80 if we are to expect anything like a decent scheme of housing in these districts.  Perhaps the Minister would assist us in coming to a right conclusion in the matter if he would tell us what is the estimate, roughly, of the amount that will be required to be spent in materials apart from such materials as can be gathered by the applicant and his friends, and what will be the cost of the skilled labour that will have to be paid for?  We might then be able to arrive at some view as to the ultimate value of the houses anticipated.</P>

      <P>I would like to know what was in the mind of the Senator when he put down this amendment as regards the class of house that is going to be built and how he hopes to get any benefit by a consultation between the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Fisheries.  It seems to me that one Minister would be just as good as another in a matter of that kind.  For the information of the Senator, I might mention a little experience of mine in the matter of the class of houses that suit the people in these districts.  I was engaged in the construction of light railways in the West of Ireland.  They were constructed more or less as measures of relief.  The work involved bringing labour from one part of the Gaeltacht to another.  Some charitably-minded people came along and declared that as these poor people were being removed from one place to another it was only right to provide decent accommodation for them. These people subscribed money and built some nice little houses.  Of course, they were only temporary buildings; they were what are generally known as Humphrey's houses. They were composed of a timber frame, a timber floor, a corrugated iron roof and they were supplied with good beds and a stove.  The people who were to occupy them would be also supplied with coal.  The labourers from the Gaeltacht were brought up and offered the use of these houses free.  They refused absolutely to go into them.  They said they were nasty, cold places and that they were not as comfortable as the houses they were accustomed to. They built what we call a lean-to against the Humphrey's houses. What they erected was a sort of sod cabin.  They used the coal as a sort of fire on the hearth and they were far more comfortable in these, they declared, than they would be in the other houses.</P>

      <P>I have something to say on this question.  Senator Johnson has pointed out that there is only £80 to be advanced for the house, and that the utmost limit of the loan was £80 also.  It is perfectly obvious that no house can be built for that money.  The Minister, in introducing the Bill, said that he expected that the person applying for the loan and grant would get employment in the building of his own house.  I presume he intended that such persons were to get some remuneration for themselves in respect of their own employment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, if that is not the case there is the greatest possible danger that the Bill will be a failure, because the only person who can avail to the full of the facilities provided by this Bill will be persons who have a little money of their own.  <i>Prima facie,</i> these are the people in the Gaeltacht with the best houses at present.  Therefore, you are not dealing with the very poor at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Comyn seems to have missed the whole point behind the Bill.  The idea behind the Bill is to help the persons who are <Col N="446" /> prepared to help themselves, to help them to improve their present houses or to build for themselves new houses of varying patterns.  The provisions under the Bill are an £80 loan, and an £80 grant for a £180 house.  These are the standard houses.  That £180 excludes the material and labour to be supplied by the man who is to get this grant and loan.  There is also £20 to be found somewhere by the man who goes in for such a house. We believe that in most cases, with that £80 grant and £80 loan, the £20 will not be needed in practice.  The man who applies for this grant and loan will so manage his £80 grant and his £80 loan that, with his own labour and material, he will be able to put up a standard house.  At any rate, the difference as far as cash is concerned is a figure of £20 and no more.</P>

      <P>As a very rough assumption, we believe that the man's labour plus the material he will be able to collect locally will amount roughly to about £95, so that in fact the standard house will be worth about £275.  I do not think, myself, that it would be reasonable to expect the State, when they are giving a grant of £80 and when they are prepared to give a loan of £80, to come along further and pay the man for his help in building a house for himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has at the back of his mind all along a wrong principle.  He has in mind an idea that these poor men are to employ skilled tradesmen for the whole job. The Senator ought to know and does know what is a fact, that throughout the Gaeltacht, nearly all these small holders have, from time to time, put up little outhouses for themselves. They are all handymen to a certain extent as far as the work of stone-masons is concerned.  There is a certain time in the building of the house when the man who has got a <Col N="447" /> loan and a grant will require the services of a handyman.  The handyman is again an institution in the Gaeltacht which you do not find in other parts of the country.  The man there is generally Jack-of-all-trades. He roofs, puts in windows, puts in doors and he is a bit of a carpenter.</P>
      <P>That man's services are usually available at £2 a week, and no one can object to the utilisation of such a man under the Act, because that type of worker does not compete with the skilled tradesman.  Skilled tradesmen could not get employment on jobs of that kind.  The man who is building could not afford to pay them.  We estimate the labour of the handyman at £50, that is £2 a week for 25 weeks.  We estimate the cost of the material that has to be bought for the house, outside the local material, at £130.  That makes £180, including what is paid to the handyman.  That estimate of £180 is worked out in detail, and may be regarded as almost the figure.  We believe that £90, which includes the cost of local material and the man's own labour, is a rough estimate. Senator Johnson suggests that this will mean nearly all improvement grants and the building of very few standard houses.  It may be that not many houses of the standard type will be built, but the virtue of the Bill is its elasticity, inasmuch as a man may go in for a somewhat worse type of house than the standard type, but a type far superior to that in which he is living, and there is provision in the Bill that a grant and loan may be given for any such type of house which he is prepared to put up and which has been approved. Deputy Johnson says that it would mean that a great many houses which should be destroyed will be improved.  As to the conditions of giving a grant, a great deal will depend on the administration of the measure.  If a house is so bad that the particular inspector who is dealing with the application is satisfied that it is not worth improving, he can tell a man to apply for a grant for building a new house.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 16, sub-section (1).  To add at the end of the sub-section the words:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Provided that before making any regulation affecting the design and construction of dwelling houses the Minister shall consult <Col N="449" /> with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The object of the amendment is to try and secure that there will be a certain amount of collaboration between the Department responsible for public health and that responsible for the Gaeltacht.  I am quite aware that by-laws, building rules, and so on, that are appropriate to the towns will not be appropriate to the Gaeltacht.  Notwithstanding what Senator Barrington has said, I do not expect that you are going to have even miniature palaces built for the residents of the Gaeltacht, but I protest against any suggestion that because for generations a certain section of the population has, through one means or another, been led to accustom itself to bad houses, we should therefore not seek to improve such houses.  Expression has been given to that kind of philosophy whenever any kind of suggestion for social reform or social improvement has been made by anybody anywhere, that the people prefer to remain in dirt, not to have fresh water, not to have baths, that they are accustomed to such conditions and do not want them improved.</P>
    <P>The Senator practically suggests that because certain people whom he named or indicated preferred to occupy a lean-to rather than the house provided for them, no attempt should be made to improve their conditions. I resent any such suggestion. The proposal in my amendment is very simple, namely, that the Minister for the Gaeltacht should collaborate or consult with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health when he is issuing regulations affecting the design and the construction of dwelling-houses.  I draw attention to the fact that several areas in the Schedule are abutting on town areas and&mdash;I am not speaking with any definiteness&mdash;there are already regulations and by-laws possibly applicable to those districts.  If there is to be any change, that change should not be made without consultation with the Minister who is primarily responsible for public <Col N="450" /> health.  I have no doubt that the Minister for Lands and Fisheries will have regard to requirements from the sanitation point of view, but it is obvious that his Department is not equipped with the knowledge essential for such regulations, and I do not think that he should object to provision being made for some collaboration between the two Departments. That is the intention of my amendment, and I hope that it will have the support of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. Barrington Mr. Barrington">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrington</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator who has just sat down has completely misunderstood and misinterpreted the remarks which I made.  I said that it is absolutely absurd, in connection with housing which will involve the small expenditure that the Minister has available for the purpose, to be adding to the difficulties by insisting on his consultation with other Ministers.  I know that the Minister in charge of the Bill has an intimate knowledge of the Gaeltacht and knows exactly what will be required there.</P>
      <P>I cannot see the slightest object in hampering him by consultation with other people whose notions might not agree with his.  I simply mentioned the class of house which I was aware people themselves had put up, not, as Senator Johnson has been kind enough to suggest, to show that they preferred dirt, but to show what line they would be likely to take in building houses.  It is obvious from what the Minister has said that there will have to be a certain amount of give and take.  It is obvious that the amount of the grant will be very small, that they will have to do the work themselves, and it will only result in an attempt to attain an utterly impossible standard if this amendment is adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer if Departments were entirely water-tight. It may be necessary to bring in an amendment of this kind, but I might state, for the information of the Seanad, and particularly for the information of the Senator who proposed the amendment, that this Bill <Col N="451" /> originated with an inter-Departmental Committee known as the Gaeltacht Economic Committee.  The Committee consisted for the most part of heads of Departments. or of senior officers of Departments. It met fortnightly, under my chairmanship, to deal with all matters connected with the Gaeltacht.  One of the first questions which the Committee approached was the question of housing, and one of the members of the Committee is Secretary of the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  During the framing of the whole Bill, very naturally, the Department of Local Government and Public Health was in constant consultation with us, and the head of the Department was present at all these meetings in the framing of the Bill.  Through all its stages this consultation has gone on, and I can see no reason why it should stop in future.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health is normally the Minister who would deal with the question of housing, apart altogether from any question of public health.  It is only because this Bill refers to the Gaeltacht that I am placed in charge of it.  If it were an ordinary Housing Bill, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health would be dealing with it.  Naturally, that is the Department which is most intimately concerned with a measure such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture, the Department of Finance, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Board of Works Department, have also representatives on the Committee.  All these representatives were present at the framing of the Bill but the sub-committee which took the liveliest interest in it was representative of the Department of Local Government and Public Health, the Department of Agriculture and my Department.  If I saw any necessity for embodying such an amendment as this in legislation I would have no objection to it, but in fact that consultation goes on, and has gone on from the beginning. <Col N="452" /> The Minister for Local Government had as much to do with the framing of the Bill as we had.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to realise that the amendment is not proposed in any spirit of antagonism to him.  The section says &ldquo;The Minister may by regulation made under this Act with the consent of the Minister for Finance prescribe all or any of the following matters, that is to say (a) the design and construction of dwelling-houses or poultry houses and piggeries towards the erection of which grants are made under this Act, etc.&rdquo; That is to say, that the other regulations, by-laws, etc., shall not apply.  I think it is generally agreed that in matters concerning public health and housing, there should not be a conflict of authority.  All I want to see is something like uniformity in the legislation we are framing. While it is no doubt true that the Minister has to consult, after all this is a Bill that goes from the Oireachtas eventually and we ought to ensure, so far as we are capable of doing it, that there be this consultation with the Department primarily responsible, the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  That is all that the amendment seeks to secure.  This is not a Bill that is going to cease within a year.  It is a Bill that will probably be carried on even after the £250,000 is spent.  There will be new Ministers for Fisheries and new Ministers for Local Government, and I think that we ought to ensure that the two Departments concerned should work uniformly.  That is all I seek.</P>

      <P>This is the section which deprives a society of power to expel a member.  The amendment is to increase the pecuniary penalties which a society can, under the present Act, impose on a member for gross misconduct.  If you are taking away the right of expulsion it would appear that you ought to give a society the right of imposing a heavier penalty than it has power to impose at present for gross misconduct. I understand that a similar amendment was proposed in the other House, and that as far as these pecuniary penalties are concerned the Minister was quite willing to accept them, but the amendment was ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle.  Of course, I cannot ask you, sir, to give a different ruling from the ruling given in the other House, and I do not for a moment suggest that you should.  For that reason, I would be obliged to withdraw the amendment.  I understand, however, that further legislation is contemplated in the near future on this subject, that this is not the final Bill, and I have no doubt that the Minister will see the justice of giving this increased power of pecuniary penalties to societies from whom is taken away the right to expel a member.</P>

      <P>As regards the first part of the amendment, we would have been willing to accept that, but intrinsic in the Bill itself there is a latitude which would enable the penalties to be increased, if <Col N="455" /> the circumstances warrant that.  For instance, the scale of penalties is between ten and twenty, and perhaps the fines will tend towards the higher side of that particular scale in future rather than towards the lower side.  But, intrinsic in the position itself, there is the possibility of dealing more strictly with delinquents.  As regards the second part, I would have been prepared to oppose that.  There is power to deal with that under regulations.  But the penalty as expressed there would work out too severely.  However, we have power to deal with it under regulations and, if it is necessary to do so, it can be done.</P>

    <P>This section deals with the deferring of right to benefit in certain cases.  I wish to delete the discretionary power there given to the <Col N="456" /> Commissioners.  I am quite aware that it may give rise to some hardship, as, for instance, when an employer has an employee who is insurable and the employer is either too negligent or too mean to stamp the card until that person is likely, through illness, to apply for benefit. Then he stamps the card, and the person wants to become a member of an approved society.  That is a hardship. Nevertheless, I think it is better that the administration of the Act should be tightened up and that this hardship should be got over by a more rigid scrutiny of those whose cards should be stamped and are not stamped.  The form of legislation which gives a certain discretion to an official is, I think, undesirable.  It is better to have the law uniform in all cases and apply the same rule to every case that comes along.  Sometimes, even with the best-intentioned officials, cases come along which do not hang together.  One case where a hardship exists may be turned down, and, in another case, when the official is in a more relenting mood he will yield in the circumstances. That subjects the whole administration to criticism, which, to my mind, ought to be avoided.  I am aware that the Commissioners have a discretion now, but I think it is better, as we are proceeding with a Bill to consolidate the whole principle of insurance, that that discretion should be omitted.</P>

      <P>The provision in Section 8 is intended to secure that, a period being prescribed of three months inside which persons make up their minds as to what approved society at the earliest possible moment.  It is intended to prevent non-compliance.  It is intended to prevent a person who actually does get his cards stamped going round with his cards for a year or a year and a half and then when he gets ill, putting his cards into an approved society and wanting to <Col N="457" /> join.  It is desirable to force people to join a society at the earliest possible moment.  There are three months given in which to do it.  It is also desirable to have some discretion where cases of real hardship arise, such as the case the Senator mentioned.  There might, for instance, be a case of a young girl going into service where the mistress does not want to go to the expense of paying the insurance.  The young girl possibly gets ill and the mistress dismisses her.  The girl then goes to the National Health Insurance Commissioners and complains about the case and the Commissioners have to take up the matter with the mistress to see that she does comply with the Act.  Simple compliance with the Act would merely mean the moneys being paid into the Commission. There is also the girl's side of the question, as she has to get some benefit. In a case of hardship on an appeal like that to the Commissioners, the Commissioners go into the matter and have the right to decide after the money is paid in that the benefit shall not be denied to the party in question.  All the cases are dealt with in a most systematic way and come up to the Commissioners for final decision.  I think the question of discrimination really does not arise at all.  I suggest to the Senator that that appeal should be left in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To delete the section.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section is really a code dealing with the case of married women. The Minister, in introducing the Bill, said that the funds of the societies might be seriously depleted if he continued to married women the advantage they derive from the earlier Act.  If I have misunderstood the Minister, I am sorry, but he certainly, either in reply to a question in the House, or in the course of his speech, said that the <Col N="458" /> provisions of this new section would help the fund in some way.  I understood from him that the position of a woman who gets married after this Bill comes into operation will be somewhat worse than her position at the present time.  In view of that, I have made a comparison of the two sections&mdash;the section which it is proposed to abrogate and the section that it is proposed to enact.  I find there are a good many advantages which married women still have under existing legislation which they will not have under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In the first place, under the Act of 1918, marriage does not disqualify a woman from continuing to be an insured person.  The next advantage she has is that she is entitled to sickness benefit of five shillings a week, to maternity benefit of thirty shillings a week, and to medical and sanatorium benefit for twelve months; and there is in the Act which it is proposed to repeal this very important proviso to sub-section (3): &ldquo;Provided that no woman shall by reason only of so becoming employed be deprived of any benefit to which she would but for the provisions of this sub-section have been entitled unless and until she becomes entitled to corresponding benefit by virtue of her new insurance.&rdquo; The thing is very complicated, but in the Act which it is proposed to supersede care is taken that in no circumstances will the married woman be worse off by reason of her marriage or of her reemployment.</P>
    <P>Then there is another provision in this Bill before the House which seems to me to be objectionable.  It is sub-section (5) of Section 15, which states: &ldquo;The amount of a marriage benefit shall be such amount as is prescribed by the Insurance Commissioners, and in prescribing such amount regard shall be had to the effect of arrears, the duration of insurance and the number of contributions paid.&rdquo;  Under the old Act, the whole thing is regulated by law.  A married woman knows exactly what she has to get. There is no discretion, so far as I can <Col N="459" /> see, left to any Minister or to the Department.  But here you have a case of discretionary power such as Senator Dowdall objected to in connection with the previous section. Here, again, discretion is given. That power may be used, and the sentiment of the Minister would be to use it to the advantage of people, but still it could be used and must be used to the disadvantage of other people because there is only the same fund to draw upon.</P>
    <P>Senator Brown, in moving his amendment, intimated that this, perhaps, would only be in effect a temporary measure, because the whole scheme of insurance has to be taken up.  I think that the Minister should very seriously reconsider Section 15, or rather that code of law which it introduces in respect to married women.  There may be cases where the moral sentiment of individuals might be touched. There are certain cases where a woman might have a certain urgent need for getting married and where she may be entitled to maternity benefit very soon after getting married. Cases of that kind may occur and they become a charge upon the fund, of course, but I do not think it is really worth while legislating for that one kind of case.  If they are so unfortunate as to be in that position, they ought not to be put to the added misfortune of having their insurance benefits curtailed.  I submit for the consideration of the House that the section of the Act of 1918 is a better section from the public point of view, and certainly from the point of view of the unfortunate working women who have become wives and mothers, than the present section.  Of course, I understand how difficult and dangerous it is in a Bill of this description, which has been carefully thought out, to ask the Minister to strike out a vital section, but it seems to me it ought to be struck out and the existing law retained if it is at all possible.  In any case, the spirit of the existing law should not be departed from merely because there may be a case of an unfortunate woman who gets <Col N="460" /> more than her share of insurance, but I leave the matter to the consideration of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I do not quite understand the Senator or the Senator does not quite understand the proposals under Section 15, and he probably is imagining something in Section 15 arising out of some of my remarks on Section 19 (1) the other day.  I direct the attention of the Seanad to the Interim Report of the Committee of inquiry into the National Health Insurance Act, page 9, Section 33, where it says &ldquo;A large body of evidence shows that the administration of the special benefits in class K to insured women who cease insurable employment on marriage is a source of considerable trouble and difficulty to societies.  Whilst the evidence is not unanimous all the witnesses who represented purely Irish societies have with one voice proclaimed the difficulty of administering Class K scheme.  The only witnesses who favoured its continuance were representatives of societies the parent body of which was outside Saorstát Eireann.  We are therefore forced to the conclusion that a case has been made for the simplification of the changes which on marriage take place, and we recommend that in lieu of the present benefits under Class K a cash endowment be paid to every insured woman on marriage. The normal amount of this should be actuarially determined, the actual amount paid being, of course, subject to a deduction in respect of arrears of contribution.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to married women, under the Act the position is that if a woman during the first year of her marriage is unemployed for a period of eight weeks, she automatically becomes, instead of an ordinarily insured person, a person under class K and becomes entitled then to these benefits:&mdash;certain retained benefits under the sanatorium scheme for a period of two years; for a period of eight weeks sickness she becomes entitled to a payment of 7/6 and she becomes entitled to her <Col N="461" /> maternity benefit inside that two years.</P>
    <P>As far as her being an insured person before marriage, when her Class K benefits wind up, after a period of two years her insurance history is finished.  If after passing into Class K she comes back into employment again, she re-starts insurance. The administration, as it was pointed out, of Class K benefits has been difficult.  An administrative change is proposed here, by which, instead of having these different benefits allocated to her over a period of two years, automatically, on marriage, a woman's history as an insured person for that particular period, at any rate, ends, and she is given a gratuity which actuarially will be the equivalent of maternity benefit which she would have got if she drew maternity benefit within two years, or sanatorium benefit, and a benefit of eight weeks' pay. It is simply from the point of view of a woman herself and administration ending her history on marriage. If after marriage she comes back as an insured person, she re-enters as an insured person and continues to draw all benefits which would have been payable if she had entered insurance at that particular time without any question of marriage at all. So there are no benefits a woman was entitled to under previous Acts that she is to be deprived now of under Section 15, but a different way of giving her benefit is being instituted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Comyn is wrongly advised when he speaks of a woman on marriage being in a less advantageous position.  I think the chances are that her monetary position would be at least as good as it would have been if this had not been passed, but there are other sub-sections which seem to me to require explanation, and I would be glad if the Minister directed his attention to them in the course of his reply.  He said that the position of a married woman on re-entering employment, and, therefore, on re-entering insurance, is the same as an <Col N="462" /> unmarried woman who has remained in insurance.</P>
      <P>I am advised that in Section 8 and in the further sub-section that the married woman re-entering insurance is not in as advantageous a position as the unmarried woman. For instance, in the case of a married woman I am told if there are arrears she will be obliged in these circumstances to pay up all arrears before she can come into benefit, whereas in the case of an unmarried woman there is a certain limit&mdash;she may pay&mdash;up to three, four or five shillings, sufficient to bring her into benefit, not necessary to bring up all arrears.  That is to say, there is a distinction drawn between an unmarried woman who has remained in employment and therefore in insurance, and the married woman who has gone out of insurance but reentered on becoming an employed person again.</P>
      <P>I have also been advised that the effect of sub-section (12) is to continue an undesirable practice in the case of a married woman.  She may call upon the society in five or ten years' time for benefit which she did not claim at the time she was entitled to it, and there ought to be some limit to the period during which a woman who is entitled to benefit should claim for that benefit, because societies are not always in the habit of keeping their books, records and files for an unlimited time.  There ought to be a limit inserted during which a claim should be made.</P>
      <P>My chief point is, there is a distinction drawn, or will be in the future, between the position of an unmarried woman and a married woman re-entering employment.  If the Minister could correct me in that I should be glad.  If not, I would like him to take it into account in the hope that in any new legislation coming there will be a reconciliation of the two positions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the position of a woman who, on marriage. <Col N="463" /> continues in her employment?  I would ask the Minister this: whether the gratuity on marriage to the working girl is of the same value to her as the advantages which she derives under the old section, the maternity benefit and the sanatorium benefit, and I ask the Minister again whether the object of this section is not this&mdash;to give to these women who get married in general less out of the insurance fund than they have been getting up to the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no intention in this Act that married women will get less out of the insurance fund than they have got in the past.  The gratuity that will be given to them on marriage will be actuarially an equivalent of what they would have got under the other system.  Assume that a woman marries on the 22nd May, having been at work up to the 21st, or, if you like, having been at work on the 22nd, and suppose she turns in again on the 23rd, her history as an insured person ends on the 22nd May by the paying over to her of her gratuity under this section, and she re-starts as an insured person on the 23rd May as if she was never in insurance before.  That is the position with regard to the woman who was in insurance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Her gratuity is intended to enshrine the possibility of maternity benefits and the possibility of sickness and sanatorium treatment, expressed actuarially in cash.  In reply to Senator Johnson, there is nothing in sub-section (8) that is going to prejudice a married woman as against an unmarried woman.  Sub-section (8) says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing contained in the foregoing sub-section shall operate to prevent a married woman who has been employed for at least the <Col N="464" /> prescribed number of weeks in any period being deemed to be a voluntary contributor for the purposes of any regulations made under the Acts with respect to benefits of persons in arrears.</P>
    <P>Married women are not entitled to be voluntary contributors, but it may be that they have only a certain number of contributions paid up.  In that way they may find themselves entitled to decreased benefits at a particular time.  All insured persons have power to pay up contributions that are in arrears, in order to put themselves into full benefit with the insurance societies.  In the case of a married woman who has less than forty contributions in a particular year, at the end of her insurance year she is reminded that she is in arrears and she can pay her arrears up to forty contributions or more if she desires.  Persons who want to put themselves into full benefit, if they have less than forty contributions paid in each of two consecutive years would not be allowed to pay up arrears at the reduced rate, but would have to pay the full voluntary rate.  There is a regular arrears table set out, and persons who are in arrears can pay certain amounts that are not necessarily the equivalent of the exact stamps that would ordinarily be paid.  These provisions apply to ordinary insured persons as well as to married women.  So that there is nothing in sub-section (8) of Section 15 that is going to operate against the married woman.  What Senators probably have in mind is Section 19 (1).</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only connected in this, that Section 19 (1) prevents the paying up of qualifying contributions by the woman herself in respect of employment commenced inside the first year of marriage, because it is pointed out that in the first year of marriage certain illnesses and disabilities are likely to arise, and for purposes of <Col N="465" /> receiving benefits a married woman may enter into insurance for two or three weeks with the connivance of a particular employer and then, becoming sick, would want to pay qualifying contributions herself which would give her a claim to benefit to which she was not really entitled.  Here you want to avoid a woman coming into insurance for a short period only in a particular year of her married life and coming into benefits simply by paying contributions herself.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 6:</P>
      <P>Section 23, sub-section (4).  To add at the end of the sub-section the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided that in the case of an official who has fifteen or more completed years of service with such committee his actual period of service may be increased by the addition of such number of years not exceeding seven as may seem just, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case; and thereupon his gratuity shall be calculated upon such increased period of service.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is merely a permissive one, enabling the years for the purpose of calculating the amount to which a secretary or an official of an insurance company would be entitled to be increased in certain circumstances, with a maximum of seven years.  The existing arrangement is that redundant officials <Col N="467" /> with less than ten years' service get a gratuity calculated at the rate of one-eighth of their annual incomes from their position, whilst those with over ten years' service get a gratuity calculated at the rate of one-sixth. My amendment merely provides in the case of an official who has fifteen or more completed years of service with the committee that his actual period of service may be increased by the addition of such number of years, not exceeding seven, as may seem just having regard to the particular circumstances of the case and thereupon his gratuity shall be calculated upon such increased period of service.</P>
    <P>The people I have in mind are those who may be found to have had this as their only means of livelihood. They are mostly people who were appointed when these committees were first formed in 1911 or thereabouts, so that they would have seventeen or eighteen years' service. They helped to bring the organisation into operation.  There fell on them all the heavy work consequent on the war in administering sickness and disablement benefits to discharged soldiers.  I understand they got no additional remuneration for this work, although their pay was originally fixed when work of this kind was not contemplated.  They entered the service because of special qualifications and at a time when they had reasonable expectation of permanency.  I agree that they were liable to dismissal on three months' notice, but I think they might reasonably be said to have had a good prospect of permanency provided they discharged their duties capably.</P>
    <P>Some of these men must now be at least over forty years of age.  They are at a time of life when it is exceedingly difficult for them to get employment elsewhere, and the amendment would enable special consideration to be given to cases of hardship, so that where the officials concerned had no other means of livelihood or no other means of any consequence. <Col N="468" /> something might be given to them. There is nothing compulsory in it; it is left absolutely as a matter of discretion, and I hope that the Minister will see his way to accept the amendment, because he will probably find a few cases where it might be found very desirable that there might be some years added.  It is to enable him to exercise that discretion that I move this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Senator to take into consideration what has happened since the introduction of this Bill in the Dáil, and I will ask him not to press a purely permissive amendment.  In discussing this matter in the Dáil I pointed out that as far as the Local Government Department was concerned the type of persons who, taking into consideration their duties with the duties here would be analogous in respect of pensions, would be the employees under the school attendance committees, whose compensation for loss of office under the 1926 Act was fixed at not more than one-tenth of their annual salaries and emoluments for each year of service.  However, in the Dáil an increase was made on that to the extent that persons with less than ten years' service were to get a gratuity based upon one-eighth of their total salary and emoluments for each year of office, and those with ten years or more service were to get a gratuity based on one-sixth.  I also explained that the amount of work falling on those officials since the introduction of tuberculosis schemes in a more general way throughout the country has been comparatively small.  It would be like this: the amount of funds available through the insurance committee in one particular county was £902.  That £902 was handed over in a lump sum to the secretary of the board of health or the secretary of the county council; the names of persons entitled to sanatorium benefit were submitted subsequently, and the clerk of the committee received a total salary of £157 10s. in respect of work that was certainly part time.  In twenty-three of the counties very little work <Col N="469" /> was being done.  Even where schemes were administered by the committee this position was a part-time one.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Even in Dublin the secretary of the Committee had other employment, and he was part-time to that extent.  Under the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1925 a standard was laid down as to compensation for loss of office in respect of full-time pensionable officials of local bodies, and the position of such officials whose services were dispensed with, due to loss of office is, in the case of persons with less than ten years service, that they get a gratuity of one-sixth of their total emoluments for every year of service, and persons with ten years or more get a yearly allowance based in practice on the adding of some years to the total amount of their years of service, based upon one-sixtieth of their annual salary and emoluments.  If we compare what is being done in respect of part-time officials of sanatorium committees and what would be done under our scheme in respect of pensionable full-time officials of local bodies we can get a measure of the fairness with which the officials of the sanatorium committees are being treated.  If we take the secretary of an insurance committee with fifteen years' service and approximately forty years of age, under the proposals in the Bill for every £100 of salary and bonus he gets one-sixth for fifteen years, a total gratuity of £250.  If we take his work as one-third of full time it would work out that he would be entitled, with fifteen years' service, to a sum, the present value of which would be only £175 as against the £250 we have here.  If we take the value of his work as half full time, he would be entitled in the first instance to an annual allowance of thirteen and two-thirds pounds, the present equivalent of which for a man of forty years of age at £175, would be £230.  So that if you take them as pensionable and find out the <Col N="470" /> value of their services in terms of a fraction full time, and even if you say that they work half time, you will see on that basis they are getting more than they would get if their compensation was figured out on the basis that is set down in the Local Government Act of 1925.  We have gone as far as we reasonably can, and I would suggest to the Senator that the insertion of a purely permissive clause such as he suggests would not be of any use.</P>

      <P>The amendment which stands in my name is a long one, and I do not intend to read it to the House, because I am not going to propose it as an amendment to the present Bill.  But perhaps the House would bear with me for a few minutes while I explain its nature. Section 23 abolishes tuberculosis benefit, and it puts an end to the insurance committees which carried out, as far as the societies were concerned, the collection of the funa that was the finance of this tuberculosis benefit.  The way in which tuberculosis benefit was worked and financed was this: a sum was paid by each insurance committee to the county council or the board of health, or whatever the body it was &mdash;it was either a county council, a council of a borough or a board of health.  A certain sum was paid by the insurance committee to that council.  Out of each 1/3 making up that fund the sum of 9d.&mdash;that is, three-fifths of the 1/3&mdash;was devoted to paying for maintaining people in sanatoria.  Out of the other two-fifths the salary of the tuberculosis medical officer and his travelling expenses were deducted and the balance was expended under a definite standard agreement which 22 out of the 27 districts had entered into, that it was to be available for domiciliary treatment for people who could not get into a sanatorium, or for dispensary treatment.  That was the agreement between 22 out of the 27 districts.  The others were slightly different; one of them at least being much more favourable as far as sanatorium benefit was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Bill sanatorium treatment is abolished, and instead of the contribution paid annually by the insurance committees to the councils or boards of health, an annual grant <Col N="472" /> of £27,500 is paid by the Government. It is to be divided in proper proportions between each of the county councils and the boards of health.  Each is to get a contribution from that grant in lieu of what they got from the insurance committees. Section 24 (4), to which my amendment applies, provides for the application of the three-fifths of the 1/3 out of the annual grant.  In sub-section (4) of this section two-thirds of the money that goes out of the annual grant to the county councils or the boards of health is to pay for tuberculosis benefit in sanatoria. I should have said that before that happened the whole amount is first carried to the credit of the general expenses account of the tuberculosis fund, the whole system of tuberculosis relief in this country.  Out of that two-thirds is taken for sanatorium benefit, but nothing is said in the Bill about the other two-fifths. Under the contracts they had with the county council the other two-fifths was allocated, one-fifth for the salary of the medical officer, plus one-fifth for expenses, and the balance went quite definitely towards the relief of insured persons in their own homes or through a dispensary. Now there is no provision for that two-fifths at all, and the persons who are responsible for the administration of these societies are afraid that they will not get the same benefits from the contribution which is now coming out of the annual grant as they were getting out of the moneys formerly paid by the insurance committees to the councils and boards of health.  They may be right or they may be wrong.  It is rather a serious question.  I am prepared to withdraw this amendment, because it is a very arguable and difficult subject, asking the Minister to take into serious consideration the case that can be made for the persons who are responsible for the administration of these societies&mdash; and for whom I am speaking&mdash;for an amendment of this kind, and if they can persuade him that they are right, that he should introduce it in subsequent legislation.</P>

      <P>The sub-section which Senator Brown proposes to substitute by his amendment is really introduced to persuade doubting Thomases that they were losing nothing.  The position generally is that tuberculosis schemes throughout the country under boards of health have developed enormously since sanatorium benefits came to be involved in the National Health Insurance scheme.  When sanatorium benefit was included in the National Health Insurance scheme there was no provision by which State assistance could be given to schemes throughout the country.  When the Act was passed it was seen that it would be necessary to provide for non-insured persons, and the Act of 1912, I think, made an arrangement whereby fifty per cent. of the expenditure on tuberculosis would be State borne.  Whereas in 1922-23 the amount given in State grants as part of the tuberculosis schemes was £21,000, implying an expenditure out of public and local funds of £42,000, the expenditure in 1928 from the State was £41,000, implying an expenditure of £82,000.  The estimate for the current year is £59,000, implying an expenditure of £118,000, so that we have gone from an expenditure of £42,000 in 1922 to £118,000. I pointed out that in the development of the schemes the amount of State money provided swamps completely the whole amount provided by the National Health Insurance schemes.  I want to point out whereas receipts from patients who were able to pay are recoverable under the Act. that comparatively speaking is a dead letter.  In Monaghan where the amount expended for the year ended 31st March, 1929, was £3,051 nothing was collected; in Co.  Waterford where £2,040 was expended only £10 was collected; in the Country Borough of Dublin where £35,308 was expended only £330 was collected from private persons so that the amount collected is negligible.  The stipulation that money can be collected from private persons might well remain as a deterrent to people from entering in the tuberculosis scheme <Col N="474" /> when they are perfectly well able to pay for their treatment.  So that insured persons need have no fear good, bad or indifferent that they are going to get less treatment than they got in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, less free treatment than they got in the past. I am not able to give particulars as regards insured persons who have been charged anything.  I would like to ask if anyone knows any insured person who has ever been charged anything?  If there are any such cases, the number would be very small.  I think the Senator is completely safe in withdrawing his amendment, because, under the scheme, as already put into operation, two-fifths was more or less completely absorbed in the salaries of tuberculosis officers for dispensary and domiciliary treatment, while three-fifths was available for institutional treatment.  The facilities for institutional treatment are growing more and more every day.  In nearly every county now you have local facilities for the treatment of advanced cases.  If, at any particular time, it did transpire that any very serious wrong was being done, I certainly would be prepared to deal with it and give sympathetic consideration to the matter.  I suggest that the money available for National Health Insurance people is really swamped in the other public funds that are being provided, and that there is no insured person who need have the slightest fear that he is being wronged under the present Bill.</P>

      <P>I know the intention of the Minister was that there should not be any injury inflicted by a change in the administration of the tuberculosis fund.  I know that is what he stated in the Dáil.  What I have asked him to do is to take up any case that is put up to him in regard to sub-section (4) of Section 24 and to give it his careful consideration. If the Minister is willing to do that, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I want to know from the Minister whether under Section 24 any existing rights that insured persons have are being interfered with.  I draw attention to the following words in sub-section (4): &ldquo;So long as the total cost of institutional treatment afforded by them to such persons in such year does not exceed three-fifths of the sum distributed.&rdquo; What is going to happen to a person who is in an institution at any period when that sum of three-fifths is exhausted?  Can the Minister, the local authority or the institution demand a payment from the insured person out of his own purse, out of the family purse or from some source other than that of the insurance fund?  If insured persons are to be deprived of any of their existing rights, I think the Minister ought to give an assurance to Senator Brown that if such cases are brought to his notice he will go into them and see that the Bill is amended at a later date.</P>

      <P>Yes, but the figures that I have quoted show that generally, and not altogether from insured persons, the powers which local authorities have under Section 11 of the 1908 Act to get payment from persons who they think are able to pay, are practically a dead letter.</P>

      <P>Though the question may not be altogether relevant to the Bill, I would like to ask the Minister if there are any returns published showing the result of the tuberculosis campaign?

      <P>The matter is dealt with generally in the annual report of the Local Government Department. Reports have been published in two volumes, one dealing with the period 1922-25 and another with the period 1925-27.  As Senator Johnson pointed out, there has been a steady decline in the death rate from tuberculosis for a number of years.  I think the Senator will find the graph in the last report of the Registrar-General.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister say if there are people who would feel that tuberculosis treatment was a legal right for which they were paying their insurance contributions but who would not claim the benefit of the tuberculosis scheme because they might feel they were getting State charity?  Would there be a psychological element which would prevent people applying for tuberculosis benefit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say that.  Sanatorium treatment for people suffering from tuberculosis was provided for in the National Health Insurance Act without any idea that the finances of the scheme actuarially would bear that.  That was taken out of the British scheme, I think, in 1920 and now we are taking it out of our scheme for the reason that actuarially the finances of the National Health Insurance cannot carry it, and because of the fact that the money that is being distributed to the local bodies does not cover the amount of tuberculosis expenditure on insured persons. Considering the very great expense in treating tuberculosis cases, I do not know there would be a feeling on the part of people that they would rather not take advantage of the institutions set up all over the country for the treatment of tuberculosis. The system is very much cut away from the poor law; particularly as a result of changes in the poor law system that have taken <Col N="477" /> place here.  I do not think we have anything to fear that way.  We have the figures I mentioned to show that people are increasingly taking advantage of the facilities provided for tuberculosis treatment.  I have not had the matter brought before me.</P>
