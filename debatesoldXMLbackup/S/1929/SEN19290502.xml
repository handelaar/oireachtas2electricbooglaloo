      <P>Before I report from the Joint Committee on Standing Orders (Private Business) as to the nomination of Senators to serve on the Joint Committee on the Bank of Ireland Bill, I wish, in pursuance of the general powers of supervision over Private Bills in this House entrusted to me, to inform the House that, in my opinion, the Bank of Ireland Bill, 1929, which is an Unopposed Bill (in the sense that no Petitions have been lodged against it), should be treated as an Opposed Bill so that a verbatim report of the evidence before the Joint Committee on the Bill may be taken and be made available.  If the Seanad makes the Order I suggest, it will be possible for a member of either House, on application, to get a copy of the report of the speeches and evidence made and taken before the Joint Committee on the Bill, and in that way to ascertain the scope and purpose of the Bill as outlined by counsel for the promoters, and also to follow up the proceedings of the Committee in reference to the Bill.  If the Seanad does not make the Order, there will be no verbatim report of the proceedings, and beyond a formal report from the Committee, no further information will be available for the members.</P>

      <P>The Joint Committee on Standing Orders relative to Private Business report that <Col N="420" /> they have nominated the following Senators to serve on the Joint Committee to which the Bank of Ireland Bill, 1929, is being referred:&mdash;Senators O'Hanlon, Moran and Molloy.</P>

      <P>I do not agree to that selection.  Senator Connolly is one of the members of this House who has gone into this matter and spoken on it at some length.  I think that he should be a member of that Joint Committee.  If he is not selected as a member of that Committee the selection that has been made will not be acceptable.  It is most desirable, I think, to have agreement on a matter of this kind.  I mention the matter because the question has already been raised.</P>

      <P>The Private Bill Committee is most anxious to have this Bill thoroughly investigated by discussion in the Seanad.  If the House would agree it might be as well to leave the selection of members who are to act on the Joint Committee stand over until the next day the House meets.  Meantime, an arrangement might be come to between the two Houses as to the personnel of the Joint Committee.  Perhaps it would be agreeable to the House to take that course.</P>

There is no doubt that the House at all times, and at every stage of its proceedings, has control over the Committees that it appoints.  I think that nobody can controvert that proposition.  Senator Moore is opposing this.  I did not know that it was going to be opposed, but having regard to that, I think the most reasonable thing to do would be to follow the course that you have suggested.</P>

      <P>This Bill has been certified by the Ceann Comhairle as a Money Bill.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: That this Bill be now read a Second time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make certain points which may not be said to deal with the principle involved in the Bill, but are incidental yet important to the Seanad and I think to the general question involved. According to the statement which we have just heard, this Bill has been certified as a Money Bill. While it is too late, I think, to make any formal protest in regard to that, or to raise the question in a formal and effective manner, I do make the point that sub-section (1) of Section 3 goes so far outside the purport of a Money Bill as to deprive it of that particular classification.  That sub-section states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  The Minister may be order authorise the grant of pensions, allowances, or gratuities to widows to whom this section applies and may by any such order regulate and appoint the rates and scales of such pensions, allowances, and gratuities, and the conditions under which the same are to be payable, and may by <Col N="423" /> any such order prescribe the penalties for any fraudulent conduct in relation to an application for any such pension, allowance, or gratuity.</P>
    <P>I submit that that goes beyond the definition of a Money Bill in the Constitution.  Article 35 of the Constitution states:</P>
    <P>A Money Bill means a Bill which contains only provisions dealing with all or any of the following subjects, namely, the imposition, repeal, remission, alteration or regulation of taxation; the imposition for the repayment of debt or other financial purposes or charges on public moneys or the variation or repeal of any such charges; supply; the appropriation, receipt, custody, issue or audit of accounts of public money; the raising or guarantee of any loan or the repayment thereof; subordinate matters incidental to those subjects or any of them.</P>
    <P>Now it is only possible to bring in the provision in the last sentence of the sub-section I read as &ldquo; a subordinate matter incidental to&rdquo; the subjects which precede. When you speak of an order imposing penalties for fraudulent conduct in relation to pensions as a subordinate matter incidental to it goes beyond, I think, what ought to be brought within the classification of a Money Bill.  I make a formal submission that this Bill ought not to be considered as a Money Bill, because by the fact that it prescribes penalties for fraud to be imposed by order of the Minister it goes outside the scope of a Money Bill as defined in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The next point I want to raise, which, as I said before, is incidental to the Bill, is of some importance.  I refer to sub-section (2) of Section 2, where reference is made to an order made by the Minister under Section 5 of the Principal Act as amended by this section.  &ldquo;The Royal Irish Constabularly (Resigned and Dismissed) Pensions Order, 1924, made by the Minister under the said Section <Col N="424" /> 5 shall, with the necessary qualifications, extend and apply to every person to whom the Minister is authorised by the said Section 5 as amended by this section to grant a pension, allowance or gratuity,&rdquo; and so on.</P>
    <P>I want to point out that that Order of 1924 is not readily available for Senators or Deputies.  I ask the Minister to take special formal notice of this fact, that up to now there has been no collection of Statutory Rules and Orders made up in bound copies and available for Deputies or Senators or lawyers outside this House.  That is to say, that though those Rules and Orders have statutory effect, and are in fact in many cases revisions and alterations of the law, there is no means readily at hand whereby Deputies or Senators or the public outside can put their hands upon those Orders in any bound or collected form.  I am submitting this point in the presence of the Minister in the hope that he who is responsible for the Department will take such steps as will ensure, just as has been done in the past in the case of British enactments, that there ought to be available in bound form all those Statutory Orders and Rules which are, in fact, part of the statute law of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Johnson for the reasons that he has stated, and for the further reason that in its main provisions this is not exclusively or essentially a Money Bill.  I had occasion some time ago to make a suggestion of that kind in connection with another measure.  I believe that this House ought to be much more careful of its privileges than it appears to be, and although I do not wish to divide the House on this question, at the same time I cannot let it pass without comment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking for a full discussion on this question.  In so far as I am concerned myself I do not wish to allow this to pass without at least calling attention to it, so as to preserve in their entirety the privileges of this House should the occasion ever arise for other men to defend them.  There is another matter connected with this Bill that I would like to call the Minister's attention to.  This is apparently dealing with what I may call the remnants of compensation in respect to events that happened in the last ten or fifteen years, and as the Minister is dealing with remnants I think that he ought to deal with all of them.  There is one small lapse, I think, and that is in regard to the dependents of soldiers in the Connaught Rangers who were concerned in the troubles of the past ten years. I would make a suggestion to the Minister that it would be just as well to consider that matter in this Bill. To do so might entail a slight amendment of the title of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the first point raised by Senator Johnson, I have nothing to say. I have given the matter no consideration. The question as to whether a Bill will be certified as a Money Bill or not is a matter for the Ceann Comhairle.  No application is made to the Ceann Comhairle to certify a Bill as a Money Bill.  He examines a Bill when it reaches the final stage and determines for himself whether it is a Money Bill.  If he is satisfied in his own mind that it is a Money Bill he so certifies it, and if he is not satisfied he does not certify it.  There is no representation made to him.  I am not at all sure that Senator Johnson is right in saying that the particular section to which he refers has the effect that he seems to indicate. The intention of that particular passage in the Act is certainly to enable penalties in the matter of pensions to be inflicted on persons guilty of <Col N="426" /> fraud&mdash;that is to say, some deduction from the pension or something of that nature.  That is the intention, but whether, in effect, it gives wider powers I do not know at the moment.</P>
      <P>With regard to Statutory Orders being printed and issued in volume form, I am inclined to think that there is a good deal to be said for that.  We issue an annual volume of statutes, and I think that probably it would be a good thing to issue an annual volume containing the Orders made under the various statutes.  No doubt these Orders are all available in the library of the House, and that they can be found in other places Individual Orders can be purchased from the Stationery Office, and I am sure that they are kept in stock, but, of course, that is not as convenient as having the bound volumes available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to what Senator Comyn said about the Connaught Rangers, that matter was raised in the Dáil, and I have had some representations made to me since.  I am looking into the matter, but it is really outside the scope of this Bill. This Bill deals solely with the ex-R.I.C. and their dependents, and if we were to go outside them and proposed to deal with all cases that had a claim, we would have to look further afield.  I am not, at the moment, saying that the Connaught Rangers' claim should be admitted, but, if it were admitted, there would probably be other people with somewhat similar claims.  I could not undertake to accept any extension of the Bill by way of including a class who have not hitherto been included without a great deal of further consideration. As I said in the Dáil, a Committee was set up some years ago to look into the case of the Connaught Rangers, and while the majority of the Committee found that the Connaught Rangers had carried out the action that they did carry out in India out of patriotic motives, the Committee was of opinion that they were in no way urged to do it by any organisation.  Their case was different from that of the R.I.C. in that way, that no promises of any sort, either general or particular, <Col N="427" /> were held out to them, and that consequently their case was a parallel case to that of civilians who made sacrifices of a pecuniary sort in great numbers of cases for the national interest. The Committee held that because of those circumstances the Connaught Rangers had not a claim on the State.  The matter was left there and was not further examined, until, as I have said, it was the subject of discussion recently in the Dáil.  I undertook that I would look into the matter again.  I have had one or two conversations with people since, but I did say that I could go no further than that at the present stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. MacEllin Mr. MacEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 3, sub-section (1).  To add at the end of the sub-section a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(e)  to any person being the tenant or owner of an agricultural holding which constitutes his sole or main source of livelihood and the poor law valuation of which does not exceed £15, erecting on the said holding a house to which this Act applies a grant not exceeding £60 in respect of the said house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That applies to a section of the community who are a very hardworking and industrious people. Under the existing economic conditions of agriculture they find it very hard to make ends meet.  Their income naturally is very small, and at the very outside would be only in or about £80, out of which they have to pay rents and rates value for at least £20.  They have to pay for artificial manures and feeding stuff for their stock, which means that eventually they have only about a pound a week to live on.  Consequently it would be very hard on these poor people to embark on building houses for themselves. Under the Bill as it stands a grant of £45 would be no inducement to them whatever.  These houses have to be built to a special standard. The houses they are living in at present are undoubtedly in a very poor condition, as I am sure most of the Senators are aware.  They are low-lying, as a rule, thatched cottages with mud floors.  As the Bill stands it seems to me it is only intended to benefit cities or larger towns, that is judging by the facilities or grants that have been given to utility societies or town-planning bodies.  I have no doubt those societies are doing good work in the cities and are deserving of that special consideration, <Col N="429" /> but the farmers cannot make any use of these organisations or societies, for they do not exist in the country at all.  Another important aspect is that State aid should be confined to the poor.  As the Bill stands the most well-to-do people in the land have an equal claim with the small farmer, and very little consideration is given to the small farmer class, in view of the fact that they can never vacate the houses they are living in unless they get special consideration from the State to which they are entitled.  I would ask that they be given the assistance they require to enable them to build houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to support the amendment.  It has been very carefully drafted with the object of securing that the people who are intended to have the special benefit of this should only benefit to the extent of £15, which would be given to people who are really working men. The only distinction between them and the ordinary wage-earner is that they have the means of constant employment. My notion of the grounds upon which State grants can be justified is that in addition to the benefits which they confer on the individual the work to be done is also a benefit to the public.  You provide houses for the poor working people in order that healthy families may be brought up and the State advanced in that way.  If that is the principle, and I think it is, and I think the Minister will agree with me that is the principle, then there is no class more deserving of special consideration than the small farmers, working men who live on holdings of less than £15 valuation, and whose sole or main source of livelihood is their farms.  For the information of Senators who may not be very well acquainted with the conditions of rural districts in the west and south of Ireland, I would like to say that assistance for the rebuilding of the small country farmhouses would be of the greatest possible national benefit.  A great number of them are thatched houses&mdash;sod-roofed, covered by thatch&mdash;with crevices and rat <Col N="430" /> holes.  They have existed for hundreds of years.</P>
      <P>I have often heard of and seen families wiped out by tuberculosis, and the reason always given to us was: &ldquo;Oh, consumption was in the family.&rdquo;  I am speaking in the presence of a very eminent medical man and I offer the opinion with all respect that the consumption was not in the family but in the house. Therefore, I think it would be of the greatest possible benefit if some special encouragement were given to the small farmers, workmen who work on land&mdash;which is their true description.  I think it would be of the greatest possible advantage if some encouragement were given to them to build new houses.  It would be an advantage not merely to themselves in greater comfort, but an advantage to the country, because we would escape the scourge of consumption which is ravaging this land.  In this amendment we do not seek to make any serious inroad on the small sum of £200,000 which is available.  What we want is to call the attention of Parliament to the fact that these people are in a special class, and to bring them into the queue so that they may be considered by the Minister and by Parliament in a particular way, and that due care and thought will be given to the peculiar necessities of their case.  When larger measures are introduced by the Minister they would then be in a favourable position for special consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that those who occupy the larger farms are entitled to any special consideration in respect of free grants.  They may be entitled to special consideration in respect of loans, but, speaking as one of that class myself, I do not think that the larger farmers are entitled to free grants, as distinct from loans and other facilities, but I do think that the smaller farmers, not merely for themselves but in the public interest, should be considered. For that reason, I ask the House to accept this amendment, not because it means an expenditure of money, not because it trenches on the <Col N="431" /> artisan class&mdash;we do not expect very much out of this £200,000&mdash;but because theirs is a special case deserving of special consideration and special legislation.  It may be said they are entitled to £45.  What we ask for them is £60, and the reason for that is that the house of a small farmer must of necessity be a somewhat larger house than that of an artisan, for portion of the work of the farm has to be done in the house.  That is the reason why I ask that this little concession should be given to the small farmers.  Some of them are inarticulate at the moment. How long they will so remain is another question, because the people for whom Senator MacEllin speaks in this motion are really the Irish nation.  I would submit the amendment to the consideration and, if I might use the expression, the indulgence of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. Gogarty Dr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion with one or two provisos, and in doing so I am in the unfavourable position that I am not able to catch any votes because of my support of it.  I consider it has sufficient merit to deserve support, and to get it disinterestedly. I think it is very difficult to confine the valuation to £15 as that is too high.  The Minister knows that in the Gaeltacht there are houses which are unhygienic, built under the level of the roads, with cesspools emptying into the houses, and the medical officers are unable to condemn them though they are richly deserving of condemnation, because if they were condemned their occupiers would have nowhere else to go.  If you reduce the valuation to £10 it would give a chance to those people whose houses the medical officer would condemn if he could afford to condemn them. It is sad to think there are houses unfit for human habitation but the medical officer cannot condemn them because it would mean putting the people out on the roadside, though they would be far healthier on the roadside than in these cesspools and tuberculosis-breeding homes.  In these districts good houses can be <Col N="432" /> built for £60.  These people do the work themselves.  Some of them are all-round men.  Their forefathers built the houses, and if they had an overseer to direct them in making the foundations damp-proof, and raising the houses from the level of the manure heaps, I think a remedy could be found without much expenditure.</P>

      <P>This is an ordinary Housing Bill and not a Bill to deal specially with congestion in the country, or to deal with any special public health problem in the country.  With regard to Senator Gogarty's references, the special housing legislation promised for the Gaeltacht is entirely separate from this.  I want to be clear on that.  If there are specially congested housing districts in the West special legislation has been promised to deal with that.  I want to dispose of things that have been brought across the discussion so that we can get down to the main question.  I want to dispose of the Gaeltacht question involved in that.  That is a special matter in regard to which the Minister for Lands and Fisheries is at present in discussion with the Department of Finance.  In connection with proposals dealing with the sanitary side of things, the sanitary authorities have their own means and responsibilities for getting rid of insanitary conditions.  This is a pure housing matter, and the objection to the Senator's amendment is that the persons for whom he proposes to increase the grants are the persons who if people are to be hit at all will be least hit by the reduction of any grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Experience in house building, so far as the administration of the Acts goes, shows that owing to the economic circumstances to which the Senator refers, such building is cheaper in those areas than in other areas. There is no site value involved, and stone, sand, and often lime can be conveniently got, and without paying for them.  In addition to that the unskilled labour involved in the building of a house is often provided <Col N="433" /> by the recipient of the grant, so that the people for whom this increased grant is asked are the people who can best get on with the reduced grant.  The question as to whether there ought to be a grant of £45 for such people in those circumstances is arguable in view of those facts. We have a very special housing problem to deal with, practically all over the country.  We do not want to put the country up against the towns in these matters, but from the sanitary and social point of view there is a burning problem in the towns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point I would like to put before the Senator who moved the amendment. There is nothing to prevent seven or more persons of the class whom he wants to benefit from forming a public utility society and receiving in respect of one house £60.  It is a very desirable development that instead of an individual seeking the assistance of the State for his own house independently of everybody else, that a group of people should <Col N="434" /> form a public utility society even for country houses.  It is a very simple matter to form a public utility society.  That society could make a claim for a subsidy under this Act.  I submit it is a very desirable procedure, and the Senators who are backing this amendment should promote it.  There is nothing whatever to prevent any association with which Senator MacEllin is connected from forming a public utility society without expense and getting the grant of £60 for the building of houses.  If there is only one house needed in a locality under the jurisdiction of the society, then they get £60 for that house, but you would have this advantage, that there is a group of people showing an interest in housing and that that group is exercising some sort of supervision over the way the grant is expended. In every way it is desirable that the public utility society system should be encouraged even for the class of houses the Senator seeks to promote. You get not only the £60 subsidy, but you have got the co-operative effort, which the Senator will probably agree is a desirable one, to encourage, particularly in that part of the country in which a Senator is interested.  Co-operation takes many forms, and this is a co-operative effort for housing.  It is a mistake to assume that public utility societies could only operate in the towns.  It is perfectly open to them to operate in the country as well as in the towns and cities.</P>

      <P>Section 3, sub-section (3).  To insert before the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  Whenever the Minister is satisfied that a house in respect of which a grant may be made under this Act was erected for occupation by a particular person in substitution for another house which, while occupied by such person, was rendered uninhabitable by coast erosion, the grant (if any) made by the Minister under this Act in <Col N="435" /> respect of such house may exceed the appropriate limit specified in the first sub-section of this section, but shall not exceed such of the limits specified in Part I. (exclusive of the Note appended thereto) of the Second Schedule to the Housing Act, 1925 (No. 12 of 1925), as is appropriate to such grant.</P>
    <P>This amendment has reference to the damage done by coast erosion. On the Second Reading the Minister was good enough to promise that he would consider an amendment by which the grants under the Housing Act of 1925 might be applied to the particular class of people who have been deprived of their houses by the action of the sea.  The amendment applies only to the occupiers of the houses&mdash;that is, an occupier can build a house, or a public utility society can build a house for him, but it does not apply to the owner of a house unless the owner of the house builds a house for the person who occupied a house destroyed.  I hope that the House will favourably consider this amendment so as to enable an increased grant of £60 to be given to those people who have suffered.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in the City of Dublin is this, that under the first two schemes the Commissioners, in assisting private persons, gave both remission of rates and grants.  Under subsequent schemes they gave a choice to the persons concerned <Col N="437" /> as to whether they would take a grant equal to the Government grant or take the remission of rates.  After the first two schemes, when building costs had gone down to a certain extent and when there was more of a demand for the limited amount of money available, they decided to give either the one or the other, and the houses to which the Senator has referred came in under the third scheme, so that there is no prospect of that situation being reviewed.  The persons who got houses under that scheme must have known exactly the terms on which the houses were built, and the terms under which they were obtaining them.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the case of houses built in Cork under the same Bill and at the same time the Commissioner, appointed by the same Minister, gave the full benefit, while the Dublin Commissioners gave the people concerned the choice of one or the other?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of being under the one Department and being under the one Act; it is a question of the administration in Dublin by the people who are responsible and who were dealing with Dublin problems.  In the same way, Cork has its own problems and its own administration.  I am not aware that there is the difference that the Senator spoke of, but I am aware that certain definite conditions were arranged by the Commissioners in Dublin for assisting house-building and that these conditions have been carried out in respect of people who knew what the position was.  The amount of money at the disposal of the Commissioners is such that they can only afford to give to private persons a sum equal to the grant the State gives, or to give them the remission of rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I had better try to make the position clear to the Seanad. <Col N="438" /> A building scheme was started in the City of Dublin five or six years ago, and the first persons to avail of it got grants and the remission of rates. Then there was a  for a period. Some other houses were then built by the same builder in the same district and on the same plan.  These houses got grants, but the people who bought them got no remission of rates.  Since that remission of rates was refused that building scheme has gone on further, and the further houses are getting the remission of rates, with the grants that were given in the case of the early buildings. Those unfortunate people who stepped in the middle and who bought their houses through banks, through public utility societies and through insurance societies find themselves in the centre of a big block of houses, and their houses, which number twenty-two, are the only houses in Dublin that are not getting the benefit of the Act.  On my advice these people wrote to Cork and found out that the Commissioner there gave both the remission of rates and grants to people building or buying new houses.  Is it fair that the Local Government Department, which has control of the finances of this Act and of the previous Housing Act, should say that these people in the Phibsboro&rsquo; district should get no remission of rates, while the people around them, who came there both before and after them, are getting the remission?  I want to know why that mean type of economy is indulged in in the case of people who were enterprising enough to step in and buy houses, and why they should be deprived of what everybody else is getting.  I ask the Seanad if that is fair.  If the Minister wishes I will produce for him letters from Cork stating that a remission of rates was granted in the case of houses there.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the Senator has made statements which suggest to the Seanad that certain things are true, and now he asks me if these things are true.  In the City of Dublin to persons building private houses the Commissioners gave, as they were entitled to do, a grant equal to the amount given by the State, plus the remission of rates in respect of the earlier schemes.  But after a certain period they stopped that, and in the case of all schemes that came on after, as well as in the case of private persons who wanted to build, they gave the choice of taking a grant or a remission of rates. If the Senator wants to suggest that, having adopted the system by which they simply gave an alternative, subsequent to that they went to other people and gave them grants plus remission of rates, I would like him to state that definitely as a fact, because he has been simply suggesting it.  From my knowledge of it that is quite untrue, and if that impression is to be created in the minds of Senators I think it ought to be created by a very definite and considered statement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="441" />&ldquo;2.  Article 34 of the Constitution shall be and is hereby amended by the deletion of all words from &lsquo;shall retire from office' to the end of the section, and the substitution of the following words &lsquo;shall, unless he sooner dies, resigns or is disqualified, hold office for the residue of the term for which the member, whose death, resignation or disqualification occasioned the vacancy, would have held office if he had not died, resigned or been disqualified.&rdquo;&rsquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know whether you propose to take the Title now or to leave it to the end, as is usual, but there is no point in that, because the whole matter will have to be discussed on one or other of these amendments which I am proposing.  To take these two amendments together, their object is to change the term of office of a member who will be elected to fill a casual vacancy, and I propose that the member so elected should remain in office for the remainder of the term for which the person whose place he fills would have remained in office.  I have argued this matter here on two occasions.  My object in putting down these amendments is to have the matter discussed, and I think it would be a mistake for me to put forward my point of view again. I formally move the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entirely in favour of Senator Douglas's two amendments, and also of the amendment which appears in the name of Senator Mrs. Wyse Power, because it deals with the same matter.  Under the old system of co-option to fill a casual vacancy in the Seanad there was a very good reason why the term of the person co-opted should end at the end of the current triennial period.  It was because such a member was elected solely by the members of this House, whereas the constituency which elected all the other members was the whole country. Now the electorate has been changed, and it is the same for the filling of a casual vacancy as for the triennial election, and there is no reason why a person who is elected <Col N="442" /> to a casual vacancy should not hold office for the remainder of the term of the person who was originally elected.  You have the same constituency and the same electorate. It would simplify the triennial elections very much.  I am also strongly in favour of Senator Mrs. Wyse Power's amendment.  Perhaps I would be out of order in discussing that now, but there is no reason why we should have an election to fill a vacancy that occurs within a month of the triennial election. These are very important amendments to the Bill, and I am not sure that the House has had sufficient time to consider them, or has really grasped the importance of them.  If there was a general feeling in favour of these amendments, and if we had any assurance from the President that he regarded them favourably, I think it would be well, as they involve an amendment to the Title of the Bill, a further amendment of the Constitution, and perhaps amendments to another Bill or two which will have to come before us, before we discuss them finally, that if the general feeling of the House is in favour of them, they should stand over for some little time until we could get the Parliamentary draftsman at work, because the matter is a very complicated one, and I am not quite sure that the amendments in their present form would work out properly.  I suggest under these conditions that it would be better that this should stand over for some little time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing that I can imagine that can be said in support of Senator Douglas's amendments is that they tend to simplify the triennial election.  When that is said, I think all that could be usefully <Col N="443" /> said in support of them has been said.  The Oireachtas generally is elected on the basis of proportional representation, and to the extent that this amendment allows a bare majority in the Oireachtas to fill all vacancies occurring between two triennial elections the amendment is in conflict with the principle of proportional representation.  Supposing four or five vacancies occurred between two triennial elections. Now, a combination of Parties having a majority in the Oireachtas could fill all these, and they would be filled for the period for which the original members would have sat. Then there would be no opportunity of adjusting the balance when a triennial election comes along.  The chances of minority Parties would be considerably and fairly materially altered if there were always twenty vacancies instead of perhaps twentyfour or twenty-five.  It might mean a difference to a Party of one representative, or it might conceivably mean two in certain circumstances. If there could be an understanding that vacancies occurring between two elections would be filled by a representative of the interests to which the outgoing member belonged I feel I could support this.  But if there was such an understanding, how can there be any guarantee that it would be honoured?  In the first place, it would have to be put into a Bill.  You would have to make it really illegal or impossible for anybody, except representatives of the particular interest concerned, to make a nomination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the first couple of years of the life of the Seanad there was a tacit understanding of that kind, and it was fairly generally observed.  But it was broken away from, and I cannot see, particularly under the new system, any possibility of restoring that understanding and of making it a practical and binding one.  Then there is, of course, the consideration that a general election for the Dáil might completely alter the complexion of the representation there, but for the next triennial election of the Seanad that change could not <Col N="444" /> make itself fully felt, inasmuch as by-elections occurring might not come under review.  Of course, when a Dáil vacancy occurs the person elected to fill it fills it for the remaining period, but he has to go out at the next election.  There is an opportunity of adjusting it.  He must submit himself to the electorate at the first available opportunity.  I think that is a good principle to adopt.  If a person gets in here, I think it is fair enough that he should submit himself to the electorate at the very first available opportunity.  Regarding the point as to redrafting and so forth, if the House does agree to the principle of this amendment, which I hope it will not, I think the amendment, or the whole Bill, should be brought in in a new form, so that it would be put in a much better shape, as it is fairly hard to adjust the amendment to the Bill in its present form.  But in any case I oppose the principle of the amendment for the reasons I have stated.</P>

      <P>I was not present to hear the case that the proposer of the amendment made for it, and I have a good deal of sympathy with Senator O'Farrell's attitude.  We want to guard against anything like procedure which would involve an apparent or a real injustice to any section, and I can see the possibility of this amendment having such an effect unless safeguards are provided. If a vacancy occurred in the Labour Party, I certainly think it would be desirable that that vacancy should be filled by a Labour man.  The same would apply to the Fianna Fáil Party, and the same to the Party with which I am associated.  But in practice there is no guarantee that that would operate.  As a matter of fact, the last casual vacancy that occurred here was filled by a very estimable gentleman, but he was not a representative of the Party which suffered a loss by the occurrence of the vacancy.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact there was no Party nomination, because <Col N="445" /> the peculiar circumstances of that election did not permit of any kind of considered arrangement. However, I am not making any grievance of that.  I simply mention it to illustrate what might happen. Senator O'Farrell has referred to a kind of tradition that was established that maintained for a time this idea to which he referred.  I think that that tradition was broken by every Party in the House.</P>

      <P>It was broken by the Government Party in filling the first casual vacancy that I can recall; it was broken by the Labour Party when Senator Johnson went forward for a vacancy that was not a Labour vacancy, and it was broken by, I think, all Parties except one at the last election.  In any case, Senator Douglas and his colleagues may wash their hands of guilt, but the net result of that election was an added recruit to their ranks.  But there is one Party, so far, which has nothing to complain of in regard to the carrying out of these elections, and that is the Labour Party.  So far as they are concerned in regard to the vacancy that occurred in their ranks that understanding was scrupulously observed.  But, as Senator O'Farrell pointed out, we cannot always count upon such a tactful attitude towards that Party, and it may be that growing Parties would only observe it as long as they find themselves unable to make any effective assaults upon the vacancies of their opponents.  Certainly if this amendment is carried the majority Party would be able to capture all casual vacancies that occur, no matter what Party these might have belonged to, and unless there is some definite understanding&mdash;I do not know how it could be made workable&mdash;and unless this amendment is accompanied by some safeguard against that, I am afraid that later on there will be grounds for grievances amongst different sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there was a vacancy in the Party to which Senator Douglas is attached I would like to see it filled <Col N="446" /> by one representative of interests similar to those of the Senator who had ceased to hold office.  If there was a vacancy in a seat held by a representative of the farmers I would like to see that vacancy filled by a representative of agriculture, and the same in regard to the Labour Party.  But there is no guarantee in this amendment that that will be done.  I do not know whether Senator Douglas has already dealt with this point, but before the matter is disposed of I would like to know whether he has in his mind any means whereby this could be secured. If so I would certainly favour the amendment, but as it stands I would have considerable reluctance to supporting it.  I know that it would be a sensible arrangement provided that other things were secured, but without those I think it is fraught with possibilities of an undesirable nature, and I would like to know from the mover if he has anything in his mind that would obviate that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points involved in this amendment. The first is as to whether or not you agree with the principle of it.  So far as the principle is concerned, speaking for myself I think I would have no objection to it.  The second point that arises is as to how you are to carry that into effect.  An examination of practically every amendment to the Constitution which has been introduced to the Oireachtas will show that each amendment to the Constitution proposed to deal with a certain specific matter, and this Bill deals with the alteration of the franchise.  That is one matter. But the purpose of the amendment is to deal with another matter, to deal with the term of office of a person elected to fill a casual vacancy.  So that you have present for consideration really two matters proposed in the one measure.  I presume that there are certain Deputies and Senators who might subscribe to an alteration of the franchise but who might not subseribe to this, and the position then would be that they would be called upon to give a decision, weighing up what advantages <Col N="447" /> would be derived from the acceptance of one of the principles and considering whether they would counteract the disadvantages that are in the other proposal.  But I think it will be generally agreed that in amending the Constitution itself the more satisfactory method is to have simply one specific proposition to be dealt with and to have that voted on.  Then, if other changes have to be made each of them should deal with one matter only.  I would suggest, as practically all these amendments to the Constitution have been fathered by a Joint Committee of both Houses, that Senator Douglas's suggestion with regard to the term of office of a member who filled a casual vacancy should be considered by the next Joint Committee which would consider amendments to the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In making amendments to the Constitution I agree with Senator Brown, who speaks with very much more experience than any of the rest of us as regards these matters, that they call for a most exhaustive examination of the intricacies which are inseparable from alteration of the Constitution.  These two amendments are, perhaps, not as good examples of those complications as the other amendment.  It so happens that elaborate machinery has been devised to deal with elections to the Seanad, and under the Seanad Electoral Act there is a provision for filling vacancies other than the ordinary twenty vacancies which will fall to be filled only every three years.  There is a provision for casual vacancies, and this is a matter which naturally would have to come under review by the draftsman in amending the Constitution. So that my opinion is that we ought to adhere to the policy in dealing with one matter only in an amendment of the Constitution, and concentrate our minds on that particular phase.  It would then have complications and no balancing as to whether the virtues of a particular amendment outweigh the vices of an alternative amendment that may be embodied in the same measure.  In <Col N="448" /> consequence I would strongly advise the Seanad not to pass the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty expressed by the President, I think he will agree, was expressed by me on the last occasion, and I fully share it.  I still feel that this Bill furnished a suitable opportunity for having the principle discussed, and if the House agrees, I am quite willing not to press the amendment at this stage, but I would like to deal with a suggestion made by the President. Out of this discussion has arisen a kindred matter of very considerable importance on which a good many Senators feel strongly. That is that as this House agrees that if the present method of election for three years of one-third by proportional representation is continued it will be a matter of very considerable importance that some method should be evolved, whether by consent, by good-feeling, by cooperation or by legislation, by which groups or parties should, as far as possible, be maintained in their strength during that period.  I think that that would be impossible by legislation.  That is a principle which I believe is not only important but, if it could be adopted, would add greatly to good feeling among the different groups and would add to the efficiency of the House as a whole.  I was going to make a suggestion that as Senator Milroy who, I think, is Chief Whip of the Government Party, which has thrown its wing over the old Progressive Association, has approved of the principle, as we know that the Labour Party has strongly approved of it, and I gather from the nods behind me that the Fianna Fáil Party has accepted it, we might have a small committee of this House to discuss the matter and see whether general agreement could be arrived at.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to refer to that.  I was going to suggest that <Col N="449" /> if Senators got together it might be possible to make some definite suggestion. On previous occasions we were not in the happy, or unhappy, position, if you like, we are in now. We had definite representatives of the two large Parties in the other House, and presumably, as certain Senators were elected by them, and expect to be re-elected, they will have some interest in them.  That being the case, if we got together and made some really sensible proposal we could hope that the leaders of the Parties in the other House would be prepared to respect it. After all, two of the large Parties in the other House are in a minority. I hope they will not be always in that condition.  All Parties expect some time to be in a minority, and it is to their interest to get some satisfactory solution of this.  I accept what Senator O'Farrell said, that if the largest Party is simply going to ride roughshod and carry every single vacancy, it does not matter whether you put this in or continue as at present.  There are six members of the Labour Party here.  If by a stroke of ill fate these six were to retire, and in each case a representative of another interest was put in, you could not right that even at the triennial election.  At present the matter is not satisfactory.  I suggest that if I get leave to withdraw the amendment that the suggestion I made would not be futile.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to deal with the larger question raised in the amendment regarding the suggestion made that a Committee should be set up to consider the possibility of agreement in the filling of future vacancies.  If that is agreed to, I would like it to be remembered that there are some people in the House who do not belong to any Party.  Of course that number will be diminishing, but as long as they are in the House I think their rights should be considered.  If a Committee be appointed, I suggest that a representative of these Independent members be put on it.</P>

      <P>Section 1.  To add at the end of the section the words &ldquo;Provided that should such death, resignation or disqualification occur within one calendar month prior to the conclusion of the three years' period then running, the vacancy thus created shall not be filled until the conclusion of such period and shall then form one of the vacancies to be filled pursuant to Article 32 of this Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not think there is anything in this amendment that could be turned or used for any particular purpose. It is entirely unlike the other amendments. Senator Brown was kind enough to say that this was a good amendment, and I am sure the President will agree.  The suggestion in it is, I think, a good, common sense one.  It might not be permissible under the Constitution, but if the Committee, as the President has suggested, sits again to consider amendments I would like to have this one considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment, unfortunately, raises many more complications even than the previous ones.  Under Article 32 (a) of the Constitution there is already a provision dealing with this, and the adoption of this amendment would not remove the other.  Even an amendment to remove this particular Article out of the Constitution would still leave us with this extraordinary complication: As the amendment stands it says &ldquo;death, resignation, or disqualification&rdquo; occurring within one calendar month.  The panel for the election of the 20 members falls to be made on the 13th November. That is the final date in respect of which the second of the two Houses completes the panel.  An earlier date is arranged for the formation of their portion of the panel by the other House.  The panel is formed on 13th November, after which no addition can be made to it.  The amendment pre-supposes a vacancy arising between the 13th November and 8th December, and you would then have the extraordinary situation that the panel had been completed according to law, but according to the Constitution it would require to be reconsidered and an additional name added.  So far as I can judge it would be impossible to work this amendment if it were inserted.  It is in conflict, as I said, with Article 32 (a) of the Constitution, and it is further in conflict with the provisions that have been made for the formation of the panel upon which the two Houses will vote.  In the light of that I think the Senator ought not to press this amendment. I believe it would involve reconsideration of some Articles of the Constitution, and I think any amendment of the Constitution ought to get very careful consideration by expert legal advisers to see that you would not have in one Article of the Constitution a direction as to how a vacancy should be filled, and in another Article of the Constitution a direction prescribing a different method of filling it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point I want to raise a question that I raised on the last occasion.  If this Bill becomes law before the Seanad Electoral Bill, which we have not yet seen, becomes law, there will be an interregnum during which there is no provision made for filling vacancies, and it would seem to me to be an obvious procedure that the two Bills should come into operation at the same time.  If the present method of filling vacancies is abandoned by the passing of this Constitution Amendment Bill, and no other provision is made, such as is referred to in the Bill itself, our position will be one of emptiness. There is a void, and it would be my view that the House should keep this Bill from its final passing, so that if a vacancy happened to occur before the new legislative provision is made for filling it, the House will be able to fill it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the practical effect, in the absence of any untoward circumstance, will be nil, but there is the possibility&mdash;I hope it is a bare possibility&mdash;that the Bill now under consideration in the Dáil will not pass, or will be held up for some reason <Col N="453" /> or other.  Then what is the position with regard to filling vacancies? This House will have passed the Constitution (Amendment) Bill, and the existing method for filling a vacancy is not allowable.  Therefore it seems to me to be essential that the present method should continue until legislative provision is ready for a new method of filling a vacancy, and that the two Bills should pass through this House concurrently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Much the same situation arose when there was an alteration in the franchise in connection with the triennial election.  An Article of the Constitution was removed which prescribed that the whole country should be one constituency, and if a corresponding Bill had not been introduced there would have been no method of filling the 20 vacancies, and there would be no Seanad.  In this case I think it would be undesirable to run the chance of having the amended Bill prescribing the method of election passed without this Bill being passed.  It might so happen that the Bill prescribing the method of election by the Dáil and Seanad will not pass, but it is unlikely that there will be any undue delay in its passage.  It has been introduced in the Dáil, is ready for Second Reading, and there is no reason why its passage should not be expedited.  I should say that it is in the nature of an uncontroversial measure, the Constitution having already been altered, to make provision for filling a vacancy, and it is possible that in a fortnight after the passing of this measure the other measure will become law.  To my mind, it would be inadvisable that the risk should be run of having an Act of the Oireachtas passed without having the Constitution amended of which the Act was a complementary part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHooper" hpid="Mr. Hooper Mr. Hooper">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hooper</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support Senator Johnson in this matter. The point raised on the Second Reading of the Bill, and to which I still adhere, is that we ought not to allow this Bill to pass until we have got the other Bill.  Otherwise there would be no machinery for filling <Col N="454" /> any vacancy that might arise.  I might say that the analogy drawn by the President is not quite true with regard to the triennial election and the filling of casual vacancies. I admit that if the situation described by the President occurred there could be no triennial election until a certain fixed date in the future.  It is quite clear that the interval would be sufficient to fill the hiatus.  In this case it is quite difficult, because a vacancy might arise unfortunately at any time and we would not have machinery to fill that vacancy if this Bill was passed and if the other was not with us.  I think the right course would be to defer the Fifth Stage of the Bill for a little time, and in the meantime we will probably get the other Bill. Once we have the other Bill in our hands it will be for us to say how soon it will pass.  Once we get the other Bill I do not see any objection to the passing of the Fifth Stage of this Bill.</P>

      <P>With regard to this Bill, Senator Sir John Keane and Senator Dowdall, who are very interested in it, have intimated to me that they would desire that the remaining portion of the Committee Stage would be held over until next week.  Some amendments of considerable importance are down to the Bill in their names, and if the House agrees I would suggest that the remaining portion of the Committee Stage of the Bill should be allowed to remain over until Wednesday next.</P>

    <Title>Public Business. - Unemployment and Home Assistance.</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion in the name of Senator Alfred Byrne:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That in the opinion of the Seanad the existing provision for the relief of unemployment is inadequate, and the method of administering <Col N="458" /> home assistance to the wives and families of the unemployed and those in distress calls for investigation without delay.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move as an amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the motion the words:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and that it is expedient that a Special Committee consisting of seven Senators, of whom four shall form a quorum, be appointed to consider and report whether any legal disability exists to prevent the Commissioners acting as Guardians of the Poor in Dublin from giving adequate relief to persons who are in need or distress through unemployment, or incapacitated through sickness or accident, or to the families of such persons, or to necessitous widows with dependent children.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary at all to deal with the evil that was discussed on the previous occasion, or with the difficulties or problems that were outlined by Senator Byrne and supplemented by other speakers.  It will be remembered that the motion, as moved by Senator Byrne and seconded by Senator Sir Edward Bigger, was supported by other Senators representing different sides of this House.  There was, it seemed to me, agreement that some practical steps should be taken to find out whether any difficulty of a legal kind existed to prevent these evils that were complained of being dealt with.  We have not, I think, the duty imposed on us to deal with the administration of affairs, but we have a duty imposed on us in respect of the state of the law in such things as this covers, and it is, therefore, my duty to ask the House to approve that the House should make some inquiry as to what it is, that prevents the evils, of which complaints are made, being remedied.  It is believed that the state of the law is such that it deprives the Commissioners of the power to do what they would like to do.  Whether that is so or not may be questioned, but at any rate it is <Col N="459" /> desirable that the House should be made aware of the facts in regard to this matter, and that it should endeavour to bring about such an amendment as is necessary if it is a question of amending the law.  I think Senator Byrne is willing to accept my amendment as an addendum to his motion, and I ask the House to approve.</P>

      <P>I do not want to offer any opinion as to the merits of this proposal.  I desire to ask the proposer of the amendment in what way this Committee would operate. Would it have power to call official witnesses, such as witnesses from the Department, or would it depend upon voluntary evidence, and if so, from what source would that evidence be extracted?  I think you could get a Committee to operate that would secure authentic evidence on these matters, and that a useful public purpose would be served.  I approve of the proposal, but I want to know if Senator Johnson could give us any indication as to what the position of the Committee, when set up, would be, whether it would have any power to call witnesses, or by what means it would carry out its operations.</P>

      <P>There may be some question as to what the powers are, when using that word in a literal sense.  When I speak of powers I mean the powers of compelling.  I do not think there would be any necessity to exercise such powers, but I think it will be quite within the competence of that Committee to call witnesses and its request would be acceeded to by any officials who might be called into question.  I have no hesitation in saying that the Commissioners concerned would be very willing to give any information that is necessary to the Committee on this question. I think also the Department of Local Government will be quite willing to assist the Committee, also any other authorities or persons who might be called in to give assistance.</P>

      <P>What occurs to me is: the question involved in Senator Johnson's amendment is apparently a very serious legal question.  A Committee of seven members of this House is not the best kind of tribunal to decide the question of law. Is it suggested that they should be addressed by counsel?  Surely a question of law ought to be decided in some way in which law can be decided, either by the opinion of the Attorney-General or counsel.  A Committee of seven of this House is not the kind of Committee to do this work.  I may say that I am entirely in sympathy with anything that can be done to get rid of the awful distress which I know is prevalent in the city.</P>

      <P>If the word &ldquo;legal&rdquo; before &ldquo;disability&rdquo; were removed the amendment would still cover what it is intended to cover and would remove Senator Brown's objection.  With regard to the Senator's point, Committees have been set up not composed of legal people primarily to consider questions that involved changes of law.  The Liquor Commission set up to inquire into the administration of the poor law was not composed of lawyers, so that I think it is quite competent for a Committee of the House to inquire into a matter in which legal difficulties or disabilities may be involved without its being necessarily a purely legal Committee.  One or two legal members of this House might be appointed on it.  Certainly if the House would do a work of the kind specified in the amendment it would be an exceedingly meritorious work, and one that, I think, would commend itself to everybody concerned.</P>
      <P>Motion put and declared carried, with one dissentient.</P>
      <P>The original motion, as amended, was then put and declared carried unanimously.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.5 p.m. until Wednesday, 8th May.</P>
