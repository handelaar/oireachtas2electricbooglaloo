      <P>Might I make a little explanation?  I would like to point out that a Committee was appointed by the Selection Committee since the new Seanad met.  Previously when such committees had existed only for a short time, the procedure has been to reappoint them.  I was going to suggest that perhaps that course would meet the view of the House, but, of course, I would hear Senator O'Sullivan on the matter.</P>

      <P>Senator Johnson has asked whether there were any references to the Committee defined in Standing Order No. 111.  There is practically nothing defined in Standing Order No. 111, but it has been the custom to commit many things to the Committee on Procedure.  At present we have a revision of the Standing Orders, and in the ordinary course that would be submitted to the Committee on Procedure.  Various other matters which arise during the course <Col N="239" /> of the year are also referred to the Committee.  Of course, what Senator Moore has referred to is another matter. But there are very important matters that may come before the Committee for consideration.  There is nothing absolutely defined in the Standing Order at present.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 3, sub-section (4).  To delete in lines 35-36 the words &ldquo;not being later than one month before the appointed day.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment has been rendered necessary by the delay in passing the Bill through the Oireachtas.  Under the Bill as it stands a period of not less than one month must elapse between the election of the new councillors and the appointed day on which the new Council shall meet.  It is desirable that the new Council should be responsible for the rate for the year commencing at the beginning of next April, and for the Estimates upon which that rate will be based, but owing to the delay in the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas, it seems improbable that the election of the councillors can take place before about the middle of March, and a further delay of a month between that election and the first meeting would, it is considered, postpone unduly the making of the rate for the year.  For that reason it is considered advisable that this amendment should be moved in order to enable that month's interval to be dispensed with and the Council to meet as soon as possible after the election takes place.  For that reason I move the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 9.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3.)  An officer of the Corporation shall be entitled to make representations to the Council in respect of any action of the Manager in exercise of the powers conferred on him by this section and by Section 14 by which the officer is aggrieved, and the Council shall have power to consider the representations when made, and whenever a two-thirds majority of the Council are of opinion that the representations are well founded, to rescind or vary the action of the Manager giving cause to the grievance as from the date it took effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a proposal to safeguard the rights of the officers of the Corporation under the new dispensation.  Section 9 (1) gives the power which at present resides in the Corporation&mdash; that is to say the Council&mdash;over to the manager in respect of the appointment and removal of officers and servants of the Corporation.  The amendment seeks to give the right to an officer of the Corporation to make representations to the Council in respect of an action of the manager which the officer considers to cause a grievance, and if the Council considers it desirable, after such representations have been made, and if the Council by a two-thirds majority decides that the representations are well-founded, the action of the manager may be varied, without the necessity, of course, of taking the extreme decision of removing the manager.  I think that there always ought to be some action possible other than that of dismissal.  One can readily conceive of a manager being appointed at some date in the future who is arbitrary in his decisions and who has little regard for the rights and the usages of the officers of the Corporation.  In such a case, as at present under the Bill, the officer has no locus standi at all; he has merely to obey the manager, no matter what the manager may order, and if there is any real grievance, which in the ordinary course of things would be presentable to the Council by the <Col N="243" /> aggrieved officer, at present under the Bill the officer would have no rights whatever, except subterranean approaches to the members of the Council.  I desire that that should not be necessary, that there should be, clearly stated in the Bill, the right of officers, if aggrieved by the action of the manager, to make representations to the Council.</P>
    <P>This amendment is moved at the request, not merely of officers of the Cork Corporation, but of officers of high positions in the services of towns and cities, having regard to the probability that this Bill is merely the prelude to a series of Bills appointing civic managers. They feel that it is necessary to safeguard the rights of, let us say, the town clerk, or the city treasurer, the town surveyor, or whatever the position may be, that the official will have the right of approach to the Council, if the manager acts in an arbitrary fashion and overrides by steam-roller methods the practices and, if I may say so, the privileges, or certainly the rights of the individual officer.  It may be said that the individual officer has an approach to the Minister.  I am not sure that he has; I am very doubtful whether he has.  But I think that the Council, which has, or is presumed to have, ultimately a deciding voice in the government of the city, should be approachable by an officer who is aggrieved by the action of the manager.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. DOWDALL Mr. DOWDALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOWDALL</NameTxt>
      <P>On the face of it, this amendment is very plausible, and one reading it might regard it as reasonable enough.  I have one specific case in mind, where a subordinate officer of a department, with powerful friends and a pull in the Council, was able to flaunt and to thwart the work of a very important and responsible chief of a department in the Corporation in the old days, and by reason of his pull and his influence, which was largely political, was able really not only to put his titular chief&mdash;because that is what he actually was&mdash;in a most humiliating and embarrassing position, to the utter loss to the city and the <Col N="244" /> efficient carrying on of the department. I believe I am right in saying that officials of the city have a right of appeal to the Local Government Department, or to the Minister, and if this is passed I take it that the appeal to the Minister will be largely nullified. Frankly, I prefer an appeal to an outsider who is not pulled by local influences or by local prejudices in the decision on a matter as between the official and the city manager.  Senator Johnson has referred to dismissal, but what is stated in his amendment is &ldquo;aggrieved,&rdquo; and anybody who has had to deal with any number of employees knows that there are people of a querulous and cranky disposition who feel aggrieved, or suspect grievances, in every conceivable circumstance that crops up.  I think that the official is very much more effectively and usefully safeguarded for the carrying on of the administration of the city by the Bill as it stands, and I will oppose the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. GUINNESS Mr. GUINNESS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GUINNESS</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can see the amendment suggested would cut into all the responsibilities of the manager.  In almost every place officials have the power to appeal to the body under which they serve, that appeal being put forward in a regular and recognised manner.  It would doubtless have to pass through the manager, but still the manager would be bound, I take it, under his appointment to note and to send on to his council any petitions from these people.  If what Senator Johnson wishes to do is carried out everybody &mdash;every boy in the place&mdash;would be appealing, without any reference to the manager, to the council, if aggrieved in any small and trivial matter.  I think that that would cut into the whole power of the manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>The case put by Senator Dowdall, I think, assumes an extreme case.  What is suggested in this amendment is really only what operates in practically all business concerns.  I think a general manager is invariably appointed with powers of appointment, promotion and dismissal. Still, every employee knows that he has a right, if necessary, of <Col N="245" /> appeal to the board of directors.  Yet this privilege is very rarely availed of, because it is only in a very extreme case that any employee with an ounce of intelligence or tact will think of appealing against a decision of his own general manager.  He realises the extent to which that would estrange relationships between himself and his chief for the remainder of his time in that employment, and he will not lightly make an appeal to a higher authority.  In this case, of course, the viewpoint of the manager is safeguarded to the extent that any decision of his can only be rescinded by a two-thirds majority.  It is possible that some other type of procedure in that respect might be devised, but the principle to me seems to be really only to adopt what is in operation in all business concerns.  Senator Guinness himself has admitted that that is the case, and I think he will find from his own experience that it is not availed of to any extent; but it is a source of confidence and creates confidence in the minds of the employees that no grave injustice can be perpetrated by one person without at least the right of an appeal to some other authority.  I cannot fancy any man who happens to be merely a crank repeatedly appealing to the Council. In the first place, if he is turned down once he will not be encouraged to go there again, and if the Council does rectify what he considers is a grievance, two-thirds of them must be convinced of the fact, and two-thirds of the elected representatives are hardly likely to become convinced that there is a grievance if there is no grievance. If there is a grievance I think that it should be remedied.  I see no argument in principle against this.  This is a procedure that operates in business concerns and has not been abused, and I fail to see that there is any undue tendency on the part of the employees in the Cork Corporation to abuse it, any more than in the case of employees in any industrial concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Dowdall spoke of the plausible look of this particular amendment, but I do not see <Col N="246" /> very much plausibility in it.  I think it is too patent and clear to be regarded as plausible.  There is a lot more plausibility in what Senator O'Farrell said in support of it.  In the first place this amendment is not what Senator Johnson suggests it is, simply a kind of charter to the officer dealing with the question as to whether he will be dismissed or put to some other class of work in the public service.  It provides that where an officer&mdash;and an officer may be regarded as any person who does not do manual work&mdash;is aggrieved, whether, as far as that particular amendment is concerned, he is aggrieved because he does not get an increment, whether he is aggrieved because he is put to serve elsewhere, whether he is aggrieved because he does not get his holidays in June as against September, he has the right of appeal to the Council.  The whole atmosphere of the Council can, under this particular amendment, be invaded by one of the most important classes of things that we want to take out of the sphere of the Council, in order that they may apply themselves to the real spheres in which they can most usefully give the best service.  The Senator says it may be suggested&mdash; although it is not clear&mdash;that the officer has the right of appeal to the Minister.  The officer has most explicitly the right of appeal to the Minister because the manager, no more than any local body, cannot override the Minister, where the Minister takes up a particular attitude with regard to remuneration, conditions of service, or conditions of superannuation and the main details of any officer's employment. Attention is directed to sub-section (2) of Section 14 which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Subject to the provisions of any regulations made by the Minister under any Act and for the time being in force in relation to the service, remuneration, privileges or superannuation (as the case may be) of the officers and servants of a local authority the Manager shall consider and decide all such questions as may from time to time arise in relation to the service, remuneration, privileges and superannuation of the officers and servants of the Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="247" /> The amendment would take the officers of the Cork Corporation from under the protection that the Minister has over these particular matters.  My own experience is not so long, but the experience of the Department is that we have very many more appeals to the Minister to protect employees from arbitrary, or alleged ill-considered, actions of local bodies, with regard to their employees and officers than we have the other way round.  There is no comparison here with the business firms that Senator O'Farrell speaks of. I do not think the Senator could show us any charter in any company which says that an employee shall have the right of appeal to the Board of Directors as against the manager, or any statement of the manager's position saying, &ldquo;You shall conduct this business as manager, but any employee who has a grievance against your decision shall have the right of appeal to the Board of Directors.&rdquo;  This is a charter, and we have to take it on all fours with the charter of a company.  I suggest you do not find those things there. The employee in any business firm has not the same kind of appeal against the manager's decision that the officer of the local body has&mdash;to the Minister &mdash;when the Minister is in a position to review the whole circumstances.  He harmonises the whole statutory provisions and regulations which he has, so far as they can be usefully harmonised with the terms of service under local bodies, giving the protection that is desirable, so as to preserve efficiency, contentment, and harmony of the machinery, so that no injustice is done to these officers.  This amendment would do an injustice to the officers, because it would do an injustice to people in a responsible position, such as the manager, if he was not able to keep his machine in the effective and disciplined way that Section 9 and Section 14 of the Bill intend he should, so that he will bear effectively the peculiar responsibility that is placed on him.  The Council has its own particular sphere of action, and it is only dissipating and prejudicing the proper work if a grievance of any officer can come up for discussion, because where there is the <Col N="248" /> question of a two-thirds majority a grievance can be brought under discussion in the Council.  That is what we do not want, and what, I am sure, Senators do not want.  As far as the officers are concerned, the most satisfactory way for their own protection is that they would be subject to the immediate control of the manager in the discharge of their duties, and that their appeal should be to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I make my case, in the words of Senator Guinness, that there is assumed to be in all such concerns, and in all public business, the right of appeal by employees to the body under whom they serve.  That is all I desire.  Is the body whom these officers serve the manager or is it the Corporation?  The Corporation under the new regime consists partially of the manager and partially of a Council. Should they not have the right of appeal to the body whom they serve? I would ask the Seanad to bear in mind especially what the Minister said, the intention of the Minister when drafting the Bill.  In the original draft of the Bill there was a certain word which was ultimately deleted, but which indicated the intention of the Ministry, and when Senators realise this they will understand how light the value of an appeal to the Minister would be in such a case.  In the original Section 13 the manager was given absolute control and full supervision of all officers.  The word &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; was deleted, but the intention is there still.  Now, if you give over to a manager, whom in the first instance this House appoints, the absolute control of the doings and activities of the officers of the Corporation, many of whom have long and responsible service, who are more experienced in the work of local government than the present manager&mdash;and this must be almost certain to be repeated in respect of future managerships&mdash;the position of those servants is a very, very unsatisfactory one.  They have no right of appeal from the arbitrary action of the manager to the body whom they serve. The Minister says there is right of appeal to the Minister, but the Minister drafted the Bill which gives to that manager absolute control.  He is going to make provisions in regulations.  These <Col N="249" /> regulations will be drafted in the spirit of the word &ldquo;absolute,&rdquo; and I want to protect the officers of the Corporation against the possibility that a manager, with these absolute powers, is going to use them in an arbitrary fashion, unjustly towards the servants of the Corporation.  I think that is a reasonable proposition.  I do not think the officers of the Corporation are unreasonable in asking that they should be protected, at least in this way, against the possibility of such injustice or arbitrary action.</P>

      <P>I wonder if the Minister could tell us if the real object of this Bill is not to take care that the business of Cork city is run by one competent man, and that all political influences of every description are to be removed.  Is not the real danger of the amendment that it gives the right of appeal to a political body, or a body that is capable of political influences? If we being again to give a new life to political influence as against a manager, a man who must be of very high calibre, who, in any ordinary business, would be given control of the whole thing, then surely we would be perpetuating the thing that the Bill is designed to eliminate.  I am only talking as an individual.  That is the way I look at the matter.  I look upon the amendment as giving individuals working under the general manager a right of appeal to a body that could be influenced by political considerations to do certain things.  That would seem to me to weaken the whole Bill.  If you are going to appoint a bad manager, tyrants and all sorts of things&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 10, sub-section (6).&mdash; After the word &lsquo;as&rsquo; in line 8, to delete the words &lsquo;the Council with the sanction of' inserted in Committee.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The section as passed by the Dáil provided that the remuneration of the manager should be such as the Minister shall from time to time determine.  The amendment passed in the Seanad in Committee provided that the amount should be determined by the Council with the sanction of the Minister. Now that makes a very material consideration, and one which I am sure that at least Senator Johnson was not fully cognisant of when he moved the amendment, because in doing so he used the words: &ldquo;The Council should have at least a voice in what the salary of the manager might be and to prevent the Council making a fool of itself and paying either too little or too much the Minister will have the right to veto.&rdquo;  As far as I can see, the only veto left with the Minister under the Section, as amended by Senator Johnson's amendment, is that he will have power, if he considers the remuneration high, to veto it.  But, where the Council fixes inadequate remuneration the section, as altered by Senator Johnson's amendment, gives the Minister no effective remedy.  The deletion of these words that were inserted in Committee and giving the Minister the power that was originally assigned him is not investing him with any new powers.  In regard to many services the Minister already has full power to decide the remuneration of officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the information of those who have not studied the matter closely I would like to call attention to a few sections of various Acts.  Section 31 of the Poor Relief (Ireland) Act, 1838, gives him such power in regard to <Col N="251" /> officers concerned in the administration of poor relief.  Section 8, Poor Relief (Ireland) Act, 1851, gives him the power in regard to all medical officers of dispensary districts.  The latter section is extended by Section 21 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, so as to apply in the case of all sanitary officers, including the County Medical Officer of Health.  By Section 15 of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, the Minister is enabled by order to acquire in regard to any officer powers similar to those which he has in regard to the remuneration of officers of Boards of Guardians under Section 31 Poor Relief (Ireland) Act, 1838.  That section has been applied by the Local Offices and Employments Orders, 1924, to practically every office except those of minor importance by the Order issued in 1924.  The effect, it appears, of the amendment inserted in Committee is this: that a specific provision in an Act of this kind passed after the Act of 1923 would be taken as overriding the provisions of the latter Act, so as to prevent the Minister from himself determining a salary which the new Act expressly requires to be determined by the Council.  Under the amended section, therefore, the Minister's power to fix the manager's remuneration certainly ceases when the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, ceases to be in force and almost certainly does not exist even under that Act if this section passes.</P>
    <P>I referred in the beginning to Senator Johnson's statement in moving the amendment that the Minister should have power to veto, if the Council make a fool of themselves, by paying either too little or too much, and it appears if this section as amended in Committee stands, it would only be in the case of the payment of too much that the Minister would have power to act, and that unless and until that situation would arise the Minister would be powerless to secure that adequate remuneration would be paid to the manager. I think that there is an opinion in existence, which is becoming more and more articulate, that seems to consider that while the services of public <Col N="252" /> servants should be rigorously exacting, the remuneration should be merely nominal.  That opinion seems to be very much in existence at the present time.  I have before me a couple of cases where the remuneration of public servants was deemed by the Minister to be inadequate, and where the public bodies concerned disagreed with the Minister.  I am not going to argue which was right or which was wrong, but I say that it is conceivable that in matters of this kind the public bodies might be wrong, and might fix salaries or remuneration which were inadequate for the positions, and for the duties of the officials.  Under the circumstances, where such an inadequate scale of remuneration was decided on, it is right and equitable that the Minister should have power to veto the action of the Councils concerned.  I do not like mentioning cases, but there are a couple of specific ones in which this matter has been recently brought to a very definite issue between the public bodies and the Department. Members of public bodies are not immune from certain human weaknesses, and it is quite possible that, for political or other reasons, they might be actuated by niggardly ideas with regard to the remuneration of their servants, and on the idea that it would be popular and secure strong support at some impending elections they might attempt to insist upon an inadequate remuneration to the official concerned, and it would certainly be bad, at this first attempt at setting up city management the success of this scheme, which has met with commendation from practically every section of the Oireachtas as a great step which is deserving of the support of the whole community, to risk the success of such a scheme by not making provision for the contingencies that I have referred to, and which almost are bound to arise, if the section as amended in Committee is not revised now.  For these reasons I move the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. DOWDALL Mr. DOWDALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOWDALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment.  It would be idle to pretend that there are not a great many in various districts who sincerely wish that this experiment in city management <Col N="253" /> might fail.  This Bill, which makes Cork city one electoral area, to some extent minimises the chances of such men being returned; but, unfortunately, all over this country the apathy of the electors in not going to the poll for the election of councillors is very widespread, and has been the cause of a great deal of evil.  If sufficient interest were taken in the discharge of the duties, possibly it would not be necessary to have a City Management Bill at all.  But the condition of affairs is such that the number of electors that normally go to the poll gives the nominal title of elected representatives to those people who in actual fact are not representatives of the people at all.  Those people who were really the cause of a good many of the abuses which it is sought to remedy now sincerely hope this experiment will be a failure.  For that reason I see the force of what Senator Milroy says, that they would put every obstacle in the way of fixing the proper remuneration of a good man, whereas a man who was independent and who really worked as he saw fit and proper in the interests of the duty with which he was charged might not get such remuneration as his services would entitle him to.  I think, if the House saw the importance of the amendment at the time, that it would not have passed it.  I support Senator Milroy's amendment, which proposes to delete what was inserted in the Bill in Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I was somewhat disappointed at the manner in which Senator Milroy moved his amendment.  He gave us a lot of arguments as to why the Minister should have certain powers, forgetting at the same time that the Minister already has those powers.  He did not deal with the question at issue in the amendment at all.  He deliberately refused to deal with the principle embodied in that amendment.  The Senator's amendment means exactly this, that it wants the House to take out from the Bill the important amendment inserted in it on the Committee Stage.  The effect of that amendment was that the remuneration to be paid to the City Manager was to be fixed by the Council, <Col N="254" /> with the consent of the Minister, but there was no suggestion in it that the powers already vested in the Minister, and which are being exercised every day as occasion demands, should be taken away from him.  What was maintained in the amendment inserted on the Committee Stage was that a body of people who were ratepayers themselves, as well as being the representatives of the ratepayers, people with an understanding of local conditions, should be allowed to say when a City Manager was being appointed that, in their opinion, the position was worth a certain salary.  If it were found after one, two or three years that the man holding the position was rendering great service to the Council, and that the Council wished to mark their appreciation of his abilities, who would be in a better position to judge of that than the people on the spot?  Surely they ought to be as good judges of his capabilities and of his administrative powers as the Minister sitting in the Local Government Department in the Custom House in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The elected representatives of the people ought to be entitled to say to the Minister &ldquo;we believe that the City Manager is entitled to increased remuneration for the services that he is rendering.  We are ratepayers ourselves and representatives of the ratepayers who will have to pay him.&rdquo; That was all that the amendment inserted in Committee asked.  It does not make it mandatory that the Council shall fix the salary, and that that shall be the last word.  Senator Milroy went back almost to the time of the flood for his authorities.  In the Act of 1838 the Minister already possesses the powers referred to by the Senator.  The Minister got enlarged powers under the Act of 1923.  What is proposed here is, that when the Council is fixing the remuneration to be paid, in this case to the City Manager, they shall make a recommendation to the Minister that the person occupying the position be paid a certain salary, and they have to get the consent of the Minister to pay that salary.  That is all that the amendment inserted in Committee asks. If the salary fixed by the Council is considered by the Minister too large or too small, the Minister has ample power <Col N="255" /> to say it is not sufficient or that it is more than enough.  I have not looked up the authorities, but I am satisfied that the Minister has that power, and that he is exercising it every day.  All that the amendment inserted in Committee asks for is that there ought to be some semblance of authority left to the elected representatives, representatives who are ratepayers themselves.  I hope that the House will not stultify itself by going back on the amendment which it inserted on the Committee Stage.  No case has been made against it.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Milroy told us that if the amendment passed in Committee is not deleted the Minister will be unable to prevent a reduction of salary by the Council.  The position that we are face to face with is this: that though the Minister thinks the salary is not a sufficient one to secure the right kind of man for the work to be done, he will be unable to stop a reduction in the salary if we leave that amendment of ours in.  I would ask the Minister, when replying, to say whether that is so or not, because it is quite evident, if the Council can reduce the salary so as to prevent a right man being properly paid, then our amendment is not going to work in the way that we thought it was going to work.</P>

I have no great confidence in the ability of these local bodies, but I thing it is humbug to set them up and give them totally inadequate powers, to keep them bottled up in every way and keep them as a sort of figurehead, a sort of lip-service to representative government with no real essential power.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>The legal position, therefore, would be this: to give power to the Council to suggest what salary should be paid, but that the power of fixing the salary ultimately should rest with the Minister.  Senator Sir John Keane wants the local body to fix the salary and that the Minister shall not have anything to say to the matter.  The position is as Senator Jameson suggests.  I am not administering any Act in which it is said that the remuneration of certain officers shall be fixed by the Council with the sanction of the Minister.  Acts that do give me power to override a local body, where they do fix the salaries, are framed in quite different words.  I am informed that if this amendment remains, that while I can refuse sanction to the payment of a salary that I do not agree with because it is too low, I cannot effectively secure that a high salary shall be paid, even though I consider that a high salary should be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Farren has argued against dropping the amendment which, as Senator Jameson has pointed out, was put in owing to a misunderstanding on the Committee Stage.  Power is not taken from the local body of suggesting to the Minister that such a salary shall be paid, but to remove friction <Col N="257" /> arising in the relations between the Department and the local bodies what is prevented is this&mdash;making it possible for the local body to pass a resolution saying that the salary of the Manager shall be X pounds, and that when the Minister says the salary shall be X plus £100 the local body can turn around and say: &ldquo;We will not accept that; we have passed a resolution that says X pounds shall be paid to this Manager, and it requires a majority of two-thirds of the Council to rescind that resolution, and we cannot get that majority.  The Minister can go along and take out an order of mandamus against us and force us in that particular way.&rdquo; If the power which rests in the hands of the Minister of fixing an adequate salary, where for one reason or another a low salary is fixed for a responsible officer, was taken away, then you cannot have the type of person that should be appointed a City Manager.  The City Manager would be prejudiced by the fixing of a low salary by the Council where the Minister had no say in the matter, while the relations between the Manager and the Council would be prejudiced by a state of affairs in which you had differences arising between the Minister and the local body as to the form of the resolution adopted by the local body.  The deletion of the amendment inserted in Committee would give the Minister the power that he has with regard to any other officer of a local body, to fix a salary, but it does not take away from the Council of the City of Cork any power of suggestion that they might wish to put forward.</P>

      <P>I ask the Seanad to read the section as amended before and form their own conclusions.  &ldquo;There shall be paid by the Council to the Manager such remuneration as the Council, with the consent of the Minister, shall from time to time determine.&rdquo; That is what is in the Bill at the present moment, and that is what the Seanad decided, on the advice of Senators Brown, Jameson and other Senators. Surely it is clearly a case of either giving the Council such powers as those or of abandoning the Council altogether.  This is merely a matter of pretence.  If we are going to set up a <Col N="258" /> Council presumed to have certain authority, and not to give it authority, and if the question of the remuneration of the Manager is to be taken entirely out of the hands of the Council, I suggest that it would be far wiser to abandon the notion of the Council altogether. I dare say that will satisfy the Minister, but I think it would be much more honest to the community if that were done than to pretend to give power with one hand and really to deprive them of power, except ornamental power, with the other.</P>

      <P>The Senator who moved this motion referred us to a certain number of Acts and to certain powers which the Minister has under the poor laws.  This purports to be an Act setting up a new form of Corporation, a City Manager to administer the work of a municipal body.  I think that differentiates it from the poor law system. He also referred, and I ask the House to take note of this, to the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act of 1923, and the powers that were given in that Act to the Minister to do anything he wished by order.  They were simply temporary provisions.  We are now asked to take this as a guide, the governing authority.  These temporary provisions are to be the test by which we are to legislate in the future. Some of us have been reminded of the powers that have been given in recent legislation, not only in Ireland previous to the Treaty which covered Ireland, to Ministers to legislate by order.  I think that probably the most outrageous example of that method of governing was the legislation which was introduced in this 1923 Temporary Provisions Act which was to cover over certain difficulties that arose during the war period in this country and which it was absolutely necessary temporarily to pass.  It has never yet been annulled, and it is still temporary, but <Col N="259" /> surely we are not going to take that as a guide for permanent future legislation. No doubt the Minister has enormous power.  As a matter of fact he need not have brought in this Bill at all.  He could do anything that he proposes to do under this Bill by order if he wished.  I wonder sometimes when I hear him speak why he does not do these things by order.</P>
      <P>I now ask the House to stand by its earlier decision and to insist that the Council shall have the power to fix the remuneration of the Manager with the sanction of the Minister.  If he refuses sanction it is not fixed, and the real effect of that is that there will, within certain limits, if the Minister will consider it fair, be power in the hands of the Council to decide what shall be the remuneration of the Manager whom they pay.  Bear in mind that this is not a case where the payment of the Manager comes out of the funds of the National Exchequer.  The Manager is to be paid by the Council.  Senator Dowdall calls attention to the fact that the powers over local finance are the powers of the Council, but are you going to allow the Council to exercise power in the case of the Manager? That is the real point that I want to insist upon, that some of the powers in regard to the Manager should remain with the Council.  If the City Manager is not to be a real boss in Cork, Dublin, Waterford or Limerick, as he will be under the provisions of the Bill, then you must make some attempt to modify his powers in relation to the Council.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared carried.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move Amendment 4: Section 14.  Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Whenever a responsible officer of the Corporation as defined in Section 61, sub-section (1) of the Local Government Act, 1925, makes an objection</P>
      <P>(a)  to the doing of any act, matter or thing by the Manager in consequence of which an illegal payment is to be made out of the funds of the Corporation or a deficiency or loss is likely to result in or to such funds, or</P>
      <P>(b)  to the doing of any act, matter or thing by the Manager on the ground that it is ultra vires or otherwise illegal,</P>
      <P>the Manager shall cause to be prepared and furnished to the Lord Mayor forthwith and to each member of the Council within fourteen days particulars of such objection.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is another attempt to safeguard the position of the officers of the Corporation. I confess that I prefer this method to that which I sought for in Amendment No. 2.  Under the Local Government Act of 1925 provision is made that, &ldquo;whenever a proposal is made at a meeting of a local authority to do any act, matter, or thing in consequence of which an illegal payment is to be made out of the funds of the local authority, or a deficiency or loss is likely to result in or to such funds, it shall be the duty of the responsible officer of the local authority to make objection to the doing of such act, matter or thing, and to state the grounds of such objection,&rdquo; and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The responsible officer referred to means the secretary, clerk, resident medical superintendent or other chief executive officer at the meeting.  The amendment is to throw upon such responsible officer who may be the treasurer, town clerk or surveyor, who is aware of a proposal or an intention on the part of the Manager to do something which, in his opinion, is ultra vires or illegal, the responsibility of making his objection to the Manager just as he would have done in the case of a Council, and that such an objection having been made shall be made known to the Lord Mayor and to the members of the Council.  If such a provision as this is not inserted in the Bill it appears to me that in view of the relations between the Manager and the other officials he is absolute.  Notwithstanding the deletion of the words &ldquo;authority over these officers,&rdquo; they will have no right to make known to the Council the Manager is in the way of doing something which is illegal, or beyond his power, and there is incumbent on each of such officers of the Corporation the duty of informing somebody that the Manager is exceeding his authority or doing something which <Col N="263" /> may involve the Council in liabilities to which they ought not to be subjected.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is clearly to ensure that if a responsible officer by virtue of the duty thrust upon him in the 1925 Act has to inform the Council he will continue to perform that duty by informing the Manager, and if in doing so, and when doing so, he shall also acquaint the Lord Mayor with the fact that the Manager has done or is about to do something which in the opinion of this responsible officer is illegal and beyond his authority.  I think it is due to the Council that they should be aware of the fact that they may be involved in liabilities through the indiscretion, or perhaps ignorant misuse of his powers, or perhaps obstinacy of the Manager, and the Lord Mayor should have the right to know when any responsible officer has that objection to an action of the Manager. Do not forget that under the Bill these officers are entirely subordinate to the Manager, and yet they are carrying out certain statutory duties.  They have statutory obligations, and this Bill may be said, possibly, to over-ride their statutory obligations.  Whether that is so or not I am not lawyer enough to say, but at any rate the relationship between the Manager and the town clerk and the city engineer is one of master and servant, and the servant is bound to obey the master.  I wish it to be made clear in the Act that if the servant is aware the master is doing something beyond his authority, or contemplates doing something beyond his authority, which is likely to lead to illegal expenditure, the Council and the Lord Mayor shall be acquainted of the fact that the responsible officer has put in such an objection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (1) of Section 61 in the Local Government Act of 1925, to which Senator Johnson referred, deals with the relationship of the clerk to the council when the Council is considering matters at their meeting. Members may not be conversant with the work of the Council or the regulations that control matters and should guide them in taking decisions. <Col N="264" /> It was found very often decisions were taken inadvertently by councils that gave rise to expenditure that was not statutorily correct, and therefore the councils rendered themselves liable to surcharges by the auditor when their actions came to be reviewed.  The section quoted by Senator Johnson puts the onus on the secretary, or principal responsible officer attending the meeting, to draw the attention of the Council to the fact when they propose to do anything illegal that relieved the Council of the responsibility that fell on them, and which they were not completely equipped to deal with, and placed the responsibility on the shoulders of a paid official to keep the Council right regarding what they were going to do.  The Manager is different from that point of view, being a responsible officer versed in matters and with a thorough knowledge of what he is doing, and of the statutes and regulations. It is proposed in the amendment that it shall be possible for the Manager to shed some of that responsibility on to the town clerk, so that he could say: &ldquo;When I was doing that the town clerk did not tell me that I could not do it.&rdquo; The Manager, in every act he does, is the responsible officer, and to pass such an amendment as Senator Johnson proposes is to diffuse responsibility, and that is undesirable.  The Manager must be completely responsible for his actions in so far as he may take actions that bring him under the ban of the auditor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the suggestion is made that the Manager may be doing things which the Council ought not to allow him to do, the proposal is that everyone of the subordinate officers would be in the position of setting himself up in judgment as to whether the things proposed to be carried out by the Manager were ultra vires or not.  The Manager is shouldering a big responsibility and he should be made answerable for that responsibility in a complete way.  The whole work of his management is a thing he must stand over, and if there are any illegal actions he has taken at particular times he shall be answerable for them in due course.  To twist a section such as that which was brought in for the protection of an ordinary lay <Col N="265" /> council in such a way as to put the Manager in the position of a lay council by saying he was not completely responsible for his acts would be to undermine his responsibility, and to create a certain amount of irresponsibility about whether there was negligence and where responsibility lies.</P>

      <P>Senator Johnson seems to me to be down on the Manager, to use a common expression.  If the amendment is carried I can conceive a situation where the Manager would be surrounded by an army of detectives.  All his officers would be there to report on his acts and his position would be an impossible one.</P>

      <P>As I understand, any official would have the power to report practically any action of the Manager to the Council, or to the Lord Mayor representing the Council.  If that is not tell tale, to use a schoolboy expression, or detective service, I do not know what it could be called.  As I have said, I think it would put the Manager in an impossible position in relation to the Council.</P>

      <P>I think it is very necessary to protect members attending a meeting of a council.  Farmers and others cannot be expected always to know whether a thing is ultra vires or not, and I think it is necessary that they should be informed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  It is necessary in my opinion that the Manager should inform them what the law is in matters.  If there is something about to be done which is irregular the Manager should inform himself as to <Col N="266" /> that, and should get some legal person to inform the Council as to whether the matter proposed is legal or not.  I think it is important that should be so. A Senator has made an appeal to the Minister to state his opinion on this matter.  It seems to me that the Senator has no opinion of his own, but follows the opinion of the Minister, so that the Minister is not only the dictator of the Cork Council, but the dictator of the Seanad.  That is an extraordinary position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is trying to have it specified that the Manager is to take legal opinion and forward it to the council.  It would be for the Lord Mayor or the Council if they want to take legal opinion, but there is no question of the Manager wanting to take legal opinion.  That is my reading of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has tried to dilute the value of the section, but in the 1925 Act it is merely to protect an innocent councillor by giving him advice as to when he was inadvertently going to do something illegal, and to make the Council responsible if in spite of that advice they were prepared to vote for a particular proposition, so that they would be liable and make them pay any surcharge that may arise.  We have not been told whether this Act overrides the Local Government Act of 1925 or not.  Are we to understand that it will no longer be the responsibility of the principal officer, the city accountant, the city treasurer, the city surveyor, or whatever his position may be, to inform the Manager, who is taking the place of the Council, that he is about to do an illegal act? Is there no more responsibility, and can we have it quite definite that any legal liability there is at present on these high officers is nullified by this Act?  I do not think that is so.  There is still liability on the officers to prevent an illegal act being done, as far as they can do so, and they should inform the City Manager when he is about to do an illegal act.  Let us assume that is possible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Senator to sub-section (1) of Section 61 in the 1925 Act.  &ldquo;The expression &lsquo;responsible officer of a local authority&rsquo; means in relation to any meeting of such local authority, the secretary, clerk, resident medical superintendent, or other chief executive officer of such local authority if he is present at such meeting, or in case such secretary, clerk, superintendent, or chief executive officer is not present at such meeting, any other officer of such local authority acting in his stead at such meeting.&rdquo;  Notwithstanding the amendment put down by Senator Johnson, there is no such thing as a responsible officer except at a meeting.  The Manager will not do his work at meetings in so far as he is responsible for a certain part of the Corporation work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not go very far.  Certain responsible officers of the local authority have statutory responsibility.  Are these annulled by this Act?  I am advised that a medical officer of health has certain statutory liabilities, and the city treasurer has certain statutory liabilities.  Are those annulled by this Bill in respect of the City of Cork?  If they are still liable under the statute, and the City Manager orders them to do certain things which they say are beyond their authority and illegal, I want to protect those officers.  The Council will ultimately have to pay, for talk of a surcharge means nothing.  If the Council are left liable to pay £10,000, and the Manager's whole worldly <Col N="268" /> possessions amount to £5,000, the Council will have to bear the loss of £5,000.  When we speak of liability to surcharge it may be very important in respect of the personal feelings of the man, but it does not relieve the Corporation of ultimate liability.  If this Bill removes all statutory responsibilities from these high officers of the Corporation, then there is nothing in my amendment, but if those liabilities still lie with them, then I want to make it clear that once they have put down their objections to certain actions, that the Council should know of the fact that they may be led into very heavy liabilities, and, on the other hand, that the officers have discharged their duty and are no longer responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Senator would come down to definite details and show us where in this Bill any statutory obligation resting on a particular officer is interfered with in any particular way.  As far as I am concerned there is no officer at present bearing statutory responsibility who does not still retain that statutory responsibility.  Section 14 says that the officers and servants shall perform their duties as set out in accordance with the directions of the Manager. Where in the amendment is there anything bearing on the carrying out of a responsible officer's work in any other way than that under Section 61 here, according to which responsibility rests upon the officer only by reason of the fact that he is attending a meeting of the local body?</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 15.  Before sub-section (4) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  At the beginning of every month the Manager shall furnish to each member of the Council copies of every order made under this Section during the previous month.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter was discussed in a slightly different form in Committee. It is sought to ensure that the Council shall have some powers and some responsibilities and shall be equipped with the material necessary to fulfil such responsibilities.  The objection was made on the last occasion that to give the Council information as to what the Manager was doing would mean a <Col N="270" /> volume, that the printing bill would be increased, and that therefore it was better that this should not be done. The Council, in fact, can trust the Manager; the Manager is going to do all things rightly and properly and need not have any fear of interference by the Council, and therefore it is better the Council should not be made aware of what the Manager is doing. That more or less was the case made against the insertion of the amendment on the last occasion.  Now what is it is sought?  In Section 15 sub-section (1) it is provided that every act or thing done and every decision taken by the Manager in respect to matters which, under the existing system would have to be done or taken by resolution of such Council, shall be done or taken by the Manager by a signed order.  The amendment seeks to secure that every such action that will have to be done under the present law by resolution of the Council, in fact the more important acts of the Manager, will be made known monthly to members.  It seems to me that that is the least we could expect to be done.  If people are to meet and discuss matters and to be aware of what is happening leading up to the fixing of the rate, the members of the Council at least should be periodically informed of the course of events, of what the Manager is doing, and in particular the important things which have to be decided by resolution of the Council.  I find that at the present time the Commissioners who act for the Dublin Corporation, even though there are only three of them, receive printed copies of the proceedings.  Apparently it is not thought an exceptionally heavy liability to circulate and print three copies for the edification of the Commissioners and to enable them to carry on the business of the Corporation.  If that is found possible and desirable in the case of the City Commissioners in Dublin surely it ought to be required that members of the Council of the city of Cork should be made aware in a similar fashion of the events of the previous month, of the decisions taken by the Manager in respect of all those matters which, under the present law, are required to be taken by resolution of the Council.  It is a simple thing but it seems to me important if you are going <Col N="271" /> to expect of the Council reasonable and reasoned attention to the business of the Corporation.  If you only expect them to go there once a year and fix the rates as advised by the Manager then nothing need be said, but if the members are really to take an intelligent interest in the work of the city they ought to be advised periodically of the decisions of the Manager, and that is all that is sought to be secured by the present amendment.</P>

      <P>This is not a very important matter, but I am rather opposed to the amendment, because it will necessitate an amount of expense and trouble, and will produce results not at all commensurate with the expense and trouble.  Do we not all know, who are members of any public body or members of the Dáil or Seanad, that we receive an amount of printed matter which, in three cases out of four, is thrown aside and never even looked at.  Anybody who wants to know anything that was done by the Manager can do so under this Bill.  That is provided for in the Bill.  The amendment says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At the beginning of every month the Manager shall furnish to each member of the Council copies of every order made under this section during the previous month.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every act or thing done and every decision taken by the Manager for the purpose of or in connection with the exercise or performance by him under this Act of any of the powers, functions, or duties,&rdquo; etc.</P>

      <P>Senators can read it for themselves.  I will come down to the real matter dealing with the amendment.  Sub-section (3) says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The town clerk shall keep in the prescribed form a register or registers in which he shall enter or cause to be entered a copy of every order made under this section by the Manager, and a record of the time when such order was so made, and <Col N="272" /> the said register or registers shall be produced by the town clerk at every meeting of the Council for the inspection of the members thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Accordingly any councillor who is interested in any or all of the matters done by the Manager during the month has ample access to a record.  What more is wanted?  If a person will not go to the trouble to take that precaution he certainly will not look at printed matter and circulars.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it too much to ask that the same procedure should be followed under the Cork City Management system as is being carried out in Dublin under the Commissioner system? As far as I understand it, the object of Senator Johnson's amendment is to furnish to the members of the Corporation information with regard to procedure and the carrying out of the business of the city.  I have here reports that are printed by the Commissioners in Dublin and that are circulated.  There are three Commissioners in Dublin.  The Commissioner in charge of each department prepares a report which is printed and circulated to the other two Commissioners informing them what is being done in his department. In the old days there were printed reports of the Corporation, and each Committee of the Corporation issued a quarterly breviate indicating the work performed.  I see that practically the same procedure is adopted by the City Commissioners.  These reports might simply state that contracts have been placed, for instance, for tar macadam at such a figure.  It is not too much to ask that the people who are elected on behalf of the ratepayers of Cork or any other city to act as their custodians should be furnished with these reports so that they could see how the business of the city is being carried on, and that they should know something about the work of the Manager. Surely it is not good enough that they should attend meetings, hear reports from the City Manager about certain matters, and discuss whether a certain housing scheme should be carried out, whether a drainage system should be extended to a certain area or a water supply given to another area.  Surely <Col N="273" /> it is not too much to ask that a breviate should be printed and circulated.  That is what Senator Johnson has in mind. I have a printed report here indicating the work done in the Public Lighting Department, showing that 2,272 fitters' reports were attended to.  Senator Johnson is not asking for anything more than that.  That is the purport of the amendment, and I think it ought to be passed.</P>

      <P>The position of the Commissioners in Dublin is that they are carrying on the continuity of the system that existed when the Corporation was there.  It is not accepted by the Commissioners and cannot be accepted by them until the Bill dealing with Greater Dublin is passed, that a different class of machinery is going to supersede that, and the continuity of everything that went on before as far as the keeping of records is concerned is preserved.</P>

      <P>I could not say why it has to be printed, but, in so far as the form and the matter is concerned, it is being continued.  What we do not want to do in the Cork Bill is, by statute, to hang around the neck of either the Cork Council or the Manager an unnecessary amount of printing, an unnecessary amount of circulation of documents.  I suppose no one can hope that the new arrangement in Cork will not provide a certain amount of wastepaper baskets and of waste paper, but, in so far as that can be avoided, the work of both the Council and the Manager will be better done.  It is clear that there will not be the same voluminous amount of matter to be provided for under the new arrangement as there is at present in Dublin.  I believe a lot of it is unnecessary.  Under the arrangement in Section 11, the Council will be able to get the information required. They will receive documents relating to their own particular class of work, but this is making a statutory provision by which a certain amount of very detailed matter shall be circulated, that nobody is quite clear serves any particularly useful service.  I do not know what particular useful purpose it might <Col N="274" /> serve to have new members of the Cork Council receiving, whether they wished it or not, what Senator Farren thinks is good for them to receive, and to know that certain thousands of matters were attended to.  I suggest to the Seanad that under the provisions by which orders are available for inspection at meetings, by which, under Section 11,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Manager shall, whenever requested by the Lord Mayor so to do, provide all information as may be in his possession,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>that in the working out of the arrangement between the Council and Manager there is provision by which all the information desired by the Council can be obtained in the most suitable form.</P>

      <P>The Minister has confounded the Lord Mayor with the Council.  I can quite conceive the Lord Mayor and the Manager being very friendly and in collusion to deprive the Council of information.  If you are going to give the Council any authority at all, surely they have a right to receive the information requisite to enable them to carry on their business.  Senator Dowdall talked about a man having sufficient interest in the matter going to the register and finding out what was done.  Of course such a man would do so if he was sufficiently interested or if he was intensely interested.  But supposing he is only normally interested, say as much as a Senator here would be interested in the work of the Oireachtas. How often do we look at the papers that are laid on the Table?  I have asked that question before.  We know that we do not read these papers because they are not sent to us.  If they are sent to us there is a definite responsibility lying on us.  If you are going to make the members of the Corporation realise that they have undertaken responsible duties, then at least they ought to be equipped with the materials to enable them to carry out those duties.  There is a provision in Section 11 to which one might apply, if one accepts the argument of Senator Dowdall, just the same statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>at the beginning of every month the Manager should cause to be prepared and shall furnish to the <Col N="275" /> Lord Mayor a statement showing as nearly as may be the actual financial position of the Corporation at the end of the previous month.</P>
    <P>That is a very necessary proposition, but on Senator Dowdall's proposition the Lord Mayor might have been required to go to the register or go to the accountant to find out.  Here we have a definite provision that he shall be furnished with the information. I think the members of the Council should also be furnished with the information requisite to enable them to carry on the business intelligently. They cannot do that if you are going to leave it to the option of the Manager to do so if he wished, or if he is content to do it.  I think the result is that you place the Manager in a position of superiority in relation to the Council, and that is a primary evil that you cannot very well get over.  In this amendment we will do something to get over that evil, if we throw on individual members of the Council the liability of taking an intelligent interest in the Council, which the provision of the information I suggest would ensure.  As it is we were going to ask them to be lackadaisical more or less to come up occasionally to formal meetings of the Council, and once a year strike the rate as recommended by the Manager.  That is about all you are asking the Council to do.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That it is expedient that the Seanad should appoint from amongst its members a number of Standing Committees to which may be referred proposals for legislation or Bills, or other matters within its jurisdiction, for examination, and, where necessary, report; and with this object that a Special Committee consisting of ten Senators (to be selected by the Committee of Selection) be appointed to consider and report upon the number of such Standing Committees that should be appointed, their powers, duties and composition.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention is to follow the example of every Parliament in the world, I think, as to the efficient conduct of the business of the legislature. So far as I can find out, it is becoming universal in Parliaments that very much more of the work should be done in Committee than is done in the Parliament of which this Seanad is one House, and my object is that there should be established a number of committees consisting of members who would apply themselves to the special consideration of work that would be put before them and to whom Ministers, or Deputies, or Senators, as the case might be, might refer matters for advice and special consideration.  There are two classes of committee which one might have in mind, a committee which might have special powers, the powers <Col N="277" /> of a Select Committee, to call for persons, papers and records and to take evidence, and an Advisory or Consultative Committee.  What I have in mind is rather committees which would combine these two functions, a committee which would be advisory and consultative, or when specially empowered, which would act as a Select Committee to deal with special questions. I do not think that anybody dissents from the proposition that there is need for special consideration to be given to special subjects by people who have an interest in those subjects and have a more definite responsibility in respect of matters than the general responsibility of members of the Seanad. For instance, I referred casually a moment or two ago to an important feature of our procedure.  In a very large number of Acts of Parliament, both old and new, powers have been given to Departments to make orders which have the effect of law.  In some cases these orders may go a considerable distance in altering the statute, and these become effective law, provided that they are laid upon the Table for twenty-one days and no action is taken by the Dáil or Seanad in respect of them.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of light thrown within the last two or three weeks on the growth and power and the development of this power of the bureaucracy in effect to legislate, and to alter statutes by order, and there is a real responsibility thrown upon the Dáil and Seanad by the fact that these orders are laid upon the Table and become law, provided that there is no adverse resolutions passed in respect of them.  I think it is a responsibility that the Seanad at any rate ought to have in mind, and one of the committees that I think should certainly be set up is a committee to which would be deputed the responsibility of examining these new laws, as that is in effect what they are, and where they think it is necessary, to report upon the effects of them to the Seanad, so that if the Seanad desires definite action should be taken to disapprove of them by resolution. In this respect it is interesting to read a notice that has been put forward by Senator Milroy in regard to <Col N="278" /> a particular decision in respect of a certain letting or leasing of property that has been laid on the Table.  In that case some interested person has thought that a grievance exists, or that something untoward has been decided upon, and therefore the attention of the House is to be brought to it.  But in the absence of any grievance in respect of a particular person, if we are only dealing with general questions of law that affect no individual present but that do affect the general body of individuals, surely it is incumbent upon somebody to have the responsibility of examining the effect of these Orders in Council, as they may be, or Executive Council Orders, as they are now called.  I would say that such a committee as that should certainly be set up to have the duty of examining such orders and of reporting to the House as to their effect.</P>
    <P>I think another committee of very great importance would be one which would have special care in regard to matters of external affairs.  I believe that it would be approved of.  In fact a similar proposition was put forward several years ago and approval was given to the idea that a committee, whose special care would be external affairs, would be welcomed by the Minister, because it would be a body with which he might consult, knowing that it would have knowledge and discretion and would give him support in actions that he would be taking.  As it is at present, unfortunately, I think, neither the Seanad, the Dáil nor the public are at all familiar with the business of the Department of External Affairs.  Such a committee as I suggest would take upon itself the responsibility of keeping itself informed as to matters that arise from time to time.  It would be a body which the Minister might consult when he desired and which he might keep informed, so that the House indirectly would be kept well aware of what was happening.</P>
    <P>There are other proposals that might be considered in regard to the necessity for committees.  There might be a committee whose special duty it would be to deal with transport or local government, or agriculture.  I have in my hand <Col N="279" /> a copy of what is the Official Report of the New Zealand Parliament, and I find that there are Select Committees of the Legislative Council&mdash;which is equivalent to the Seanad&mdash;for agriculture and pastoral questions, education, gold fields and mines, labour Bills, local Bills, native affairs, public petitions, statute revision, and so on.  I have a list of standing committees of the Reichstag, and I find that there are special committees there in connection with foreign affairs, national economy, social affairs, housing, education, transport, population, and various other minor committees, and also committees dealing specially with matters that affect the taxation chamber, such as taxation, civil service accounts and redemptions. Most of us are aware of the fact that under the Constitution of the United States of America, and also under that of France, a great deal of the work of these Parliaments is done by committees, but these committees are not the kind I am thinking of.  I am thinking of committees which would have a clear liability to take special care of certain classes of subjects, which might be matters of legislation, to which the House might well refer Bills for closer examination than they would otherwise receive, and also which Ministers of various Departments could approach to consult with in respect of matters on which they desired to have consultations.</P>
    <P>I am not seeking at this stage to go very far into this committee system.  I prefer that the proposition should be dealt with tentatively, that a small number of committees&mdash;I have mentioned two, but perhaps one or two others might be decided upon by the House eventually&mdash;should be appointed. It seems to me a very desirable thing that Senators should feel that there is a clear responsibility lying upon them in respect of legislation and in respect of the general system of government. Immediately after this motion was put on the Order Paper two or three months ago, it happened that in the House of Lords a motion in these terms was tabled: &ldquo;That it is desirable that a Standing Joint Committee on Indian affairs of both Houses of Parliament be <Col N="280" /> appointed to examine and report on any Bill or matters referred to them specifically by either House of Parliament, and to consider, with a view to reporting, if necessary, thereon, any matter relating to Indian affairs brought to the notice of the Committee by the Secretary of State for India.&rdquo;  I refer to that specially, because I know that there are a good many members who have thought of this Chamber as one rather commensurate with the House of Lords, and who would not like to go very far away from the procedure of that august chamber, and I bring that forward to show that even in that very conservative institution the system of special committees to deal with special subjects is in vogue. They have, of course, as most of us know, a number of other standing committees, but here you have a committee specially appointed, not only to deal with Bills or matters that might be referred to them, but which the Minister might approach and consult in respect of the affairs of his Department.</P>
    <P>The question that I have raised was raised in this House in the early stages of its career, and from the reports of the discussions that took place I think the principle was thought well of, but it was decided not to do anything until more experience had been gained; it was felt that there was not sufficient experience as to what would be required and that it might be dealt with at a later stage in the history of the Seanad when more experience had been obtained.  That experience has now been gained, and I think that it shows that there is need for the adoption of a committee system more or less extensively. Therefore, I move the motion, in the hope that the Seanad will consider it and will approve of it, subject to a later decision as to the number of such committees that might be appointed. Personally, I would be quite satisfied if the committee that I have suggested, which is to report upon the number of such standing committees, their powers, duties and composition, would advise that not more than two or three such committees should be set up in the early stages, and I would urge that there would not be more than two such as I have suggested, one to deal <Col N="281" /> with legislation by the Departments, and the other to deal with external affairs.  At least those two committees are required, and I think it would probably appear in the course of the discussion on Senator Kenny's motion that there is need for a committee to have regard specially to matters of external affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAGWELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to speak against the motion.  I seem to recognise in it a great deal of what was considered by this House not very long ago and decisively decided against. But however that may be, I am against it now, because it seems to me to be founded upon an entire misconception of what the main functions of this House are and the part which it is intended to play.  One of the first things which it is proposed to refer to such a committee is proposals for legislation or Bills.  Now, the Senate is a second chamber and its main function is to put aside general legislation and not to originate it.  I contend that it can do that perfectly well, as we have done with a great measure of success in the past, without subordinating ourselves to committees which would only be replicas of this House.  We can do it just as well and just as efficiently when we are all here together and with a great deal less waste of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind Senators that we are not directly elected by the people, as are the members of the Dáil.  That very fact disqualifies us from taking the same part in politics that members of the Dáil take.  It also qualifies us better than the other House, I believe, for reviewing legislation in a calm, judicial spirit.  I reckon that this House would make a great mistake if it took steps in the direction of setting up committees as a sort of imitation of the Dáil.  In my humble opinion the utility of this House is very largely commensurate with the extent of its removal from the forefront of party politics.  Those of us who are allied in the matter of politics have more sympathy with one party than with another if we think about things at all. Nevertheless, I think it is a very healthy sign in this House to see that <Col N="282" /> there is a great deal of cross-voting, because it shows that people here are using their own independent minds on things, and that they are not binding themselves up with the policy of a particular party.</P>
    <P>It is suggested by the mover of the amendment that we do not take, as a House, a sufficiently serious view of our responsibilities in the matter of legislation. Personally, I entirely disassociate myself from that, and I think that most people would.  It is not necessary for us to divide ourselves up into a number of committees to take matters seriously. Everybody has an opportunity of reading the Bills that come before us, and of making up his mind as to whether they are desirable, or whether they should be altered in certain respects, and I do not think that the utility of this House would be improved by a great deal of committee work of this kind, while I do say that it would occupy a great deal more time and would mean a waste of time.</P>

      <P>It will be remembered that when the Seanad first assembled this matter was brought before it&mdash;I think it was by myself.  A committee sat on the question, which was discussed a good deal, and not unfavourably, but as Senator Johnson has said, it was disposed of finally because we were not at that time fully cognisant as to how matters would work out.  There were other reasons given, but I think that was the one which most impressed Senators.  The last Senator who spoke took the view of Ministers, who want to stamp us as being nothing but just a registering department.  I do not take that view at all, and I do not think that many other Senators do so.  Certainly they have not hitherto taken that view.  As has been said, they have acted with a certain amount of independence, and they have, as far as they were able, criticised different Bills and different matters that came before the House as best they could. But they were very much handicapped by not being able to consult together, and to avoid that difficulty certain associations were formed in the Seanad almost immediately for the purpose of considering Bills and motions, and for reviewing them before they came to <Col N="283" /> the Seanad, because it was found that it was impossible for a man to come up from the country, walk into the Seanad, and proceed to discuss very difficult questions without knowing anything, or without knowing what the friends or opponents of the matter thought about it.  That put them into a great deal of difficulty.  Those who lived in Dublin and were very much in touch with matters were, to a certain extent, able to carry out their duties effectively, but those coming from the country were not able to do so, and associations were formed for the purpose of enlightening them.  These things have changed a good deal.</P>
      <P>Since the last Seanad election people have formed themselves into rather close corporations&mdash;closer than I think is wise.  In any case, that has removed us somewhat from the position we were in before.  I think we would certainly be very much improved if we could form committees or groups on certain subjects in which certain people had particularly taken an interest. As a matter of fact, there was a Farmers' Party&mdash;I do not know how active it is at present; not very, I think&mdash;but if those farmers were formed into a committee to consider questions of farming they could do a great deal of very useful work, and so on throughout the whole list of things.  Of course, anything done by such bodies would not mean very much more than consideration; they would have all to come before the Seanad for final decision.  But I certainly think that this proposal is very desirable and very necessary.  We cannot blind ourselves to the fact that the Seanad has been accused of inactivity, and so on, and it was probably inactive because there were no such committees.  I hope it will be less inactive in future, and certainly it would be much less inactive if committees were set up, consisting of people who were particularly interested in certain matters, to discuss various questions beforehand.  Senator Johnson has elaborated this matter very much, and I do not think it is necessary for me to say any more on it, but I certainly propose to vote in favour of the motion.</P>

      <P>There is too much haziness about this proposal.  I am afraid that the motion is not a very practical one.  I cannot see, if a subject arises on which the House considers a committee should be appointed, why that committee could not be appointed, as we have often had committees appointed to deal with certain subjects.  But Senator Johnson seems to wish to have committees appointed about hazy subjects.  If he is anxious to have a committee appointed, let him take a specific case. He has mentioned two.  Let him bring a motion before the House asking it to appoint a committee to examine every one of those Orders in Council, or whatever they are called, and report to the House on the matter.  The House would consider the matter, and if it wanted to, it would appoint a committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether Senator Johnson meant that we should take an interest in Indian affairs.  I do not suppose that the Senator intended that we should follow the House of Lords in that respect.  It would be very difficult for us to do what is suggested. There are very few Senators who believe that, even if they did spend a great deal of time at it, they could do very much in foreign affairs that would pay them for the time they had spent at the matter, and I doubt if there are many Senators who, if appointed to such a committee, would think it worth while attending.  But in a particular case, if a Senator brings a proposal before the House to appoint a committee to deal with it, that has always been done if the House considers that it should be done.  But to pass a resolution to say that certain committees should be appointed to deal with certain unspecified things, to establish talking shops, is a different matter.  I agree with Senator Bagwell that if we come here and wish to speak sensibly on any Bill, we have got to study that Bill, and I believe that we do so.  Some Senators seem to think that we do not do any work, but I think that we do good work.  I think the speeches delivered in the Seanad show that members consider matters, and they will do that whether there are committees or <Col N="285" /> not.  These committees would be little replicas of the whole House, and with them we would not get our business put through at all.  If the Senator would bring up a proposal for any specific committee, the House would decide, and if it thought fit, would appoint the committee, but do not let us waste our time with committees to deal with matters of a general character about which we will probably not know very much.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator who has just spoken agrees, I think, in principle with the motion; he merely disagrees with the procedure suggested in the motion.  If carried, the motion will mean that we can approach the question in the way in which Senator Jameson suggested it should be done, but that we will do it in a more scientific way than has been the case in the past.  We have set up ad hoc committees to consider particular questions and they have been discharged when their particular task was done.  But we have, I think, failed to give committee work to subjects that we might have given that work to because it was nobody's business to take up such questions. If you set up a committee such as that suggested in the motion, it could go into the whole question in a serious way, consider what type of committee was actually necessary, and see in what way that committee might do its work.  It might perhaps help us to do our business a little more effectively than we have in the past.  We have had numerous private complaints about the manner in which business has been arranged, precedence given to business, and so forth, and it is obviously impossible to please all sections when that sort of business has to be left in the hands of a couple of people, where in the other House they have the Whips of the various Parties and can thereby have the views of all sections.  That is only one aspect of the difficulty under which we have been working, due to the fact that there are here no Ministers to initiate business or to direct the House as to a certain mode of procedure.  If this committee is set up, I think it could go into these matters.  It may come back and suggest that no committees are, in its opinion, necessary, or it may suggest that one or two or <Col N="286" /> more committees should be set up. External affairs is a subject on which, I think, it would be always well to have a committee in existence.  It may not be meeting every week or it may not take up much time, but its members will at all events feel that it is their duty to keep themselves fairly well informed in regard to external affairs. The position would be this, that we would always have a number of trained people in the Seanad when any matter in regard to our external relations arose who would be able to speak with authority on them.  They would have informed themselves and could state their views in regard to international affairs to the House.  It is desirable, I think, that we should encourage members to specialise in matters of that kind as well as in other matters like transport reorganisation which is an important feature in our economic life because of the transport revolution that we are passing through.  If we could get a number of people interested in that and in other matters such as education, the new developments in agriculture, the possibility of electrical development and so on, it would I think be a good thing.  At present none of these questions is really the particular business of anyone.  It may be said that there is no real encouragement for people to study them.  There is no responsibility upon the majority to inform themselves in regard to them.  I think at least we might explore the possibility of having a more informed House in matters of that kind.  It would be of assistance to the Oireachtas and would be a help and a guide to the country on important questions.  There is nothing revolutionary about it.  It is merely an intelligent business-like method.  I hope that no alarms will take possession of Senators or make them think that we are going beyond duties or responsibilities not intended for us.  The proposition is a business-like one, and I think it is at least worthy of the favourable consideration of the House.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the observations of Senator O'Farrell have clarified the atmosphere or the subject very much.  Listening to him one would infer that all that this <Col N="287" /> motion of Senator Johnson's asks for is the setting up of a committee to investigate certain subjects.  I do not know whether Senator O'Farrell has read the motion or not, but this is what approval of it would commit the Seanad to: &ldquo;That it is expedient that the Seanad should appoint from amongst its members a number of standing committees to which may be referred proposals for legislation or Bills or other matters within its jurisdiction.&rdquo; The adoption of the motion would commit the House to the setting up of all these independent committees. You would also be committing the House to the acceptance of very important and comprehensive implications. Senator Johnson referred to a couple of countries that have committees in connection with their legislatures. I have been supplied by a colleague of Senator Johnson's with a list of select committees in the Parliament of New Zealand, and I have found a similar list in the rules of the Senate for Canada.  The fact that these Committees are in existence in these countries is not conclusive proof that it would be advantageous for us to follow the practice here.  Senator Johnson might have been helpful in this particular matter if he had shown us that the operations of those committees tend to more expeditious and satisfactory legislation, or that similar circumstances which in those countries warranted the constitution of such committees exist here, and that it would be wise for us to follow them.  I have not been able to ascertain, and Senator Johnson has not informed us, whether these committees are legislative committees or merely committees like what, say, the Committee of Public Accounts is to the Ministry of Finance. I have tried to ascertain if these committees have any legislative functions, and I have failed to find any such function appertaining to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The more I consider the whole question, and the particular circumstances of the Saorstát, the less I am inclined to favour this motion, and the more I am inclined to think that the ordinary procedure with regard to legislation here, namely, initiation in the Dáil <Col N="288" /> with Bills going through their various stages there, and then reconsideration, review, and if necessary revision in the Seanad, would be very difficult to improve upon.  I do not think that the capacity of this House to thoroughly discharge its duties as a revising or reviewing body in regard to legislation passed in the Dáil is going to be increased if the time of Senators is seriously encroached upon by a series of committees, the functions of which, if this resolution is any guide to their duties, would be to initiate legislation in this House.  Unless that particular task was entered upon, or unless there were sufficient grounds to assume that serious work would be the outcome of this resolution in the shape of the initiation of legislation, there is no justification for its adoption.  If, however, it be granted that that would result in any considerable degree, that is the initiation of legislation in the Seanad, then what it means is this: that you will have, as Senator Bagwell has stated, this assembly in its functions resembling the Dáil more and more, and you will have less and less of that detachment from the initial stages of legislation which, in my opinion, is necessary for the final review of Bills before they become statutes.</P>
    <P>Another objection that I have to this particular process of initiation from committees is that it reverses the recognised and wise procedure in operation here.  First, the general principles of measures are discussed in open session and then referred, if necessary, to a Select Committee.  Then you have the principles discussed before the public. If you were to agree to the process suggested here of having these matters discussed, first in committee and behind closed doors, you would have less publicity attaching to that work than there is under the present system when the general principles of the Bill are discussed in public on second reading.  The position would be this, that you would have things that should be discussed in the open before the public with the greatest publicity, the main lines of the proposed measures, discussed behind closed doors.  The setting up of permanent standing committees, so far as legislation is concerned, is calculated <Col N="289" /> to secure in advance the approval of provisions which may be extremely doubtful.  Certain proposals are made and certain heads of measures are indicated. It may then be urged that the House has not time to discuss these, but it will be pointed out that we have got a committee to which we can refer them.  In that way you will get a body of legislators to examine these things before the principles on which they are based have really been subjected to an analysis.  It is necessary, I think, that they should be subjected to such analysis before the Committee Stage of a Bill is reached.  I think procedure of that kind would be a blunder, that it would impair the prestige of this assembly, and would tend to duplicate the work of legislators.  In the end, where is it going to lead us to?</P>
    <P>We will assume that there is a standing committee set up in this House to consider certain proposals.  A Senator introduces certain heads and they are referred to a committee.  After a time that committee produces a measure which is brought in here and discussed. What is to become of it when it is finished in this House?  It is only a Private Members' Bill.  You cannot expect Ministers who have responsibility for seeing that the finances of the State are in accordance with the resources of the State to sponsor measures that emanate in that particular way.  If measures so devised, when they reach the Dáil, have not a responsible backing from Ministers and others to carry them through, it is extremely doubtful that private members' time, which is of rather brief duration, will be sufficient to enable them to make any headway.  The time of members of this House will have been spent on measures of that kind.  It will have been spent on what in all probability will be a very cumbersome futility. The preparation of measures of the kind will involve a good deal of official assistance.  As far as I understand the legislation that is at present pending before the Oireachtas is requiring all the time and attention that the staffs of the different departments can give to it.  If you have committees operating for the purpose indicated in this resolution you cannot expect that they <Col N="290" /> will make much progress without that official assistance, and you cannot expect to get that official information without increasing the staffs of these departments.  Neither can you expect to carry this proposal through without doing violence to the great outcry at the moment for economy in Government departments.</P>
    <P>A Senator referred to a previous effort on his part to do something of this kind.  On going through the reports of the debates I discovered that Senator Moore had practically suggested a series of shadow Ministers on that occasion.  He had practically appointed a series of shadow Ministers.  I do not know if he would now confirm those appointments.</P>

      <P>He had as Minister for Finance.  Senator Jameson; as Minister for Home Affairs, Senator Sir John Keane; Minister for Education, Senator Mrs. Costello; and Minister for Defence, Senator Sir Bryan Mahon.  I do not know whether the worthy Senator would now make the same recommendations if he was forming his cabinet.  I think myself that the probability of that danger arising is very remote.  On the general question as to whether we should embark on the appointment of standing committees in this House, Senator Johnson, in the course of his remarks, dealt but very slightly with that aspect of it.  He said he was quite satisfied if this committee would report.  He suggested the setting up of a couple of committees, but I suggest that this was an oversight on Senator Johnson's part, and that what he really wishes is approval of this motion under the belief that it is an innocuous thing. I suggest that he has not made it perfectly clear that he means this committee to be something much more than a special committee to consider this matter.  Even if that were the case, I suggest that this is not the correct way of moving for a couple of standing committees on specific matters of that kind.  I think that a previous Senator emphasised that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="291" /> I want to make one observation with regard to external affairs.  I believe that if this State was normal, if all its citizens or at least all the members of its legislature accepted the State and that the State was their common denominator&mdash;that the idea of setting up a committee of the Seanad to discuss our external affairs was one which the Minister responsible for that department of the State could approach with confidence, knowing that he was approaching citizens and members of the legislature who believed in the State and were determined to stand by it&mdash;if circumstances such as these prevailed, I would be inclined to think that the setting up of such a committee would be a very good thing.  There is no use, however, in our blinding ourselves with the idea that that is the case at the present time.  I think it would be premature to appoint a committee at the present time.  I think it would be dangerous when the probability is that to deal with a matter vitally affecting the status, the prestige and security of this State, you would have upon the committee members who stand in with the implacable opponents of this State and all that it means.  When the State is the common denominator of all those who have the privilege and honour of being elected to make laws for it, then we can conduct business on the line that we know where we stand. That time, apparently, has not come. I would be very glad if any speaker who follows me would be able to assure me that it has come, that every member of the Oireachtas at least stands determined to maintain this State and its institutions so far as it lies within his power to do so.  If we had that assurance fully and without reserve, then I for one would be very glad to support Senator Johnson's motion.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I suggest that the adoption of the motion is not calculated to lead to better business.  It is not calculated to help this assembly or to help this House to perform its real functions.  In my opinion, if adopted, it is calculated to render the work of this House liable to be confused with <Col N="292" /> the work of the other House.  If given effect to, it would involve a further drain upon the resources of the State. I have already indicated that I think that, in the interests of economy, of good business and of sound legislation, the motion should be rejected.  Senator Johnson and all his friends who believe that there is something in this matter will have ample opportunity of bringing forward definite proposals dealing with any subject within the sphere of legislation, and of convincing the House that the proposals they submit are deserving of the support of the House and should be embodied in statutes.  Let them do that instead of, as one Senator stated, bringing before us resolutions in a hazy way with no definite objective.  If we passed this we would not know what precisely we were committing ourselves to.  All we would know was that we were committed to something of rather large dimensions, but what exactly it is even Senator Johnson could not tell us.  For these reasons I think his motion is unwise and unnecessary, and I am going to vote against it.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a couple of comments in reply to Senator Milroy's speech.  Senator Moore referred to one.  Senator Milroy in his speech attempted to invest the question with an importance which neither his speech nor the occasion justifies.  His argument, and that of Senator Bagwell, was based on a certain contention, which, in my opinion, cannot be justified except on the hypothesis that this is a revising or reviewing chamber.  Is that so?  We must be perfectly sure and certain as to the hypothesis on which we base our argument.  If we fail <Col N="293" /> in respect of the hypothesis the argument fails, and the hypothesis on which Senator Milroy based his argument has been blown sky-high by the Article of the Constitution, which states that this chamber has the power to initiate legislation.  If this chamber has this power then it also is an initiating body, and is not necessarily confined in its functions to being a revising body.  If there are useful functions we can perform outside our revising and reviewing legislation in the other House, then I think we ought to face the position. Senator Milroy referred to Senator Johnson's comment that most Parliaments had deemed it advisable to set up committees on the lines suggested in Senator Johnson's proposal.  I think it would be a very sensible thing in a country like ours, where, in a sense, we are new to Parliamentary procedure, to take due cognisance of the practice and procedure in the Parliaments of other countries.  That would be a reasonable line to follow, and one which we can follow with perfect safety. When Senator Milroy asked Senator Johnson whether that practice of appointing committees had been useful in the Parliaments of other countries, I thought Senator Milroy would have made his argument more useful if he had attempted to demolish Deputy Johnson's point about the setting up of these committees by the Reichstag, New Zealand and other countries, and had shown that these had failed.  Had he done that his argument would have had a weighty effect.  When the Parliaments of other countries set up these standing committees we may accept it that they serve a useful purpose.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That, pursuant to Article 21 of the Constitution, Seanad Eireann hereby resolves that, as and from the date of the adoption of this resolution, the remuneration of the Cathaoirleach shall be at the rate of £750 per annum and that of the Leas-Chathaoirleach at the rate of £400 per annum.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal with regard to the reduction of the remuneration of the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach was already before the House, and we are all aware of the purpose of it.  There has been a good deal of discussion and talk with regard to economy.  I, personally, and my colleagues in the Party that I represent, feel that the practice of economy ought to begin at the top, and that it is desirable an example should be shown by the higher officials, and by those who are remunerated on a very generous scale indeed.  They should show a spirit of sacrifice, and we in this House should bring the remuneration of the <Col N="295" /> Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach more into proportion to the services they render in the House.  Looking back on the past six years, and reviewing the services of these officers of the Seanad one is struck by the fact that the Seanad is a very costly organisation indeed.  However we might wish to dignify the occupants of the positions we have to remember that economy in the strictest sense is now being preached.  It is not easy to preach economy to the people of the country, or to civil servants or members of the teaching profession, if we do not practice it with our officers in both Houses.  Various rumours are going about as regards economy that is going to be effected.</P>
    <P>The teaching profession suffered a reduction some time ago of 10 per cent. in their salaries.  It has now been discovered that the 4 per cent. of their salaries which go to their own pension fund is not adequate to make up the pension fund to the desired amount, and that there is, in addition, a very serious deficit.  I do not know what truth there is in the rumour, but I believe it is suggested that a further cut of 8½ per cent. is intended in the teachers' remuneration, which, with the original 10 per cent. and the 4 per cent. already contributed by the teachers to their own pension fund, will, I think, make a total reduction of 22½ per cent.  I submit that is one service where we simply cannot afford to economise if we are going to have citizens who will be competent to think or act intelligently and be educated either for home use or for export abroad, which is one of our main industries. We must be prepared to remunerate the teaching profession properly.  It is rather significant of the outlook of the Executive at the moment that one of the first efforts as regards economy is going to be applied to a body which might give us some reason to hope for the future.  If we have no reason to hope from our educational machinery and organisation, then I cannot see where we are going to turn for hope. I mention this because it is a cynical sidelight on the economy spirit.  There are many services, no doubt, which can <Col N="296" /> be reduced, and there are many officials that might be dispensed with, but we cannot afford to dispense with the educational forces in this country, nor can we afford to risk a position whereby we would not induce the best elements in the country to follow that profession. I leave that for a moment and I come to the other proposal, namely, that economy is going to be practised by the abandonment of continuation or night schools.  That suggestion has been definitely made and has been announced in the Press.  I am afraid there is a great deal of reality behind both suggestions.  There, again, we are striking at what is absolutely necessary for the country.</P>

      <P>I am trying to show that wherever economies are being practised they are practised in the wrong directions.  I am trying to show that in the educational forces of the country economy is being practised. I argue that we in this Seanad ought to practise economy at home.  I feel that the moral value of our example to the people of the country will be very appreciable.  I feel also that the services rendered by the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach are adequately compensated by the amounts specified in my motion&mdash;£750 per annum for the Cathaoirleach and £400 for the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  In my original proposal, made before the Christmas recess, I suggested that the office of the Leas-Chathaoirleach should be an honorary one, but I discovered that might create a difficulty, and that as a result of the proposal he might not be entitled to his remuneration as an ordinary Senator.  That is the reason for proposing now that the amount be fixed at £400 per annum.  I have already gone over the ground and I do not want to labour it unduly.  It is a simple proposition.  I would like to economise in speaking in the House as much as possible, just as I would like to have economy practised in the administration <Col N="297" /> of the country.  I leave it at that.  I put the proposal believing we are doing something that is right, just and essential before we start preaching economy outside.</P>

No doubt we are living in abnormal times.  If we were able to balance our Budget we could compensate the Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach for their services by giving them a remuneration up to the full figure, but the position is that our expenditure is greater than our income and it is our duty to make a beginning in the way of economy.  We do not want to belabour this matter.  I think if we continued the discussion on this subject to the end of the session we could not arrive at any conclusion other than that which we could arrive at in ten minutes.</P>

      <P>When this matter was before the Seanad in September I said what I am now going to say, that it should be a question as to how much the Seanad as an entity should contribute towards balancing the Budget.  A Bill has been introduced in the other House dealing with the remuneration of Senators.  I consider that the procedure which I see on the Order Paper of that House might be availed of to deal with this question.  The terms of the motion on the Order Paper of the Dáil are:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That it is expedient that a Joint Committee consisting of five members of the Dáil and five members of the Seanad, and of which the Chairman of each House shall be ex-officio members, be set up to consider and report on the question of the amount of the allowance which should be paid to members of Seanad Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this question might be referred to that joint committee which it is proposed to set up.  It will deal with the whole question, including the cost of the Seanad.  Might I point out to Senator Connolly that the main cost of the Seanad consists of the salaries paid to the 60 members who constitute <Col N="298" /> it?  If he has in view retrenchment and the saving of money for the benefit of the State, I believe the proper course would be to refer this question of the remuneration of our officers to this joint committee.  I beg to move that this question be referred to a joint committee which is being set up in the Dáil to consider the question of the remuneration of Senators, and that the joint committee should also deal with the question raised by the other motion.</P>

Accordingly, if we are to inquire into the privileges, prerogatives and allowances of Senators and Deputies, I think it should be done in a whole rather than a piecemeal manner.  Consequently I am opposed to Senator Connolly's motion. There is no use in taking this question as a matter apart.  The policy preached in this country for the last year or two is a policy of sacrifice in others.  When we are dealing with these people let us deal with the question of our own allowances and the allowances of Deputies.  If we are not competent to deal with that, and if there is a motion on those lines from the other House let us wait and see what consideration is given to that motion by the other House.

      <P>The House will remember that I tried to get Senators to <Col N="299" /> agree to a Committee to consider this question.  The debate, so far, shows there is a great deal to be found out about the duties of these officers which Senator Connolly has not dealt with. I do not think he can have studied the matter carefully enough to know the duties of these two officers.  Apart from the duties which we see them perform in this House they have other duties to which to attend.  Without a committee considering what are the duties of the Chairman and Deputy Chairman, and what their duties in the future are going to be, it would be impossible for this House to settle their remuneration.  We are asked here now to settle their salaries in total ignorance of what the two gentlemen concerned have to do.  I do not think the House ought to do that.  I do not agree that the salaries now suggested are commensurate with their duties at all.  I will vote against the motion because I do not think we are in the position to give a considered judgment on it.  I listened to Senator Connolly's speech.  Every word of it could be applied splendidly if we were going to consider our own pay.  I think Senator Wilson struck the right note when he said we ought to talk about our own pay when talking of economy.  I think it is a difficult question for us to consider, but we will have to consider it, for I believe we will get a Bill here dealing with the pay of Senators.  It is a question as to whether we will bring in the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman at the same time. Perhaps we will.  In the meantime we will have acquired more knowledge of their real duties and be in a better position to decide as to what their remuneration ought to be.</P>

I do not know whether Senator Connolly is aware, but I think income tax was taken off the allowance of the Leas-Chathaoirleach. I do not think he wants to bring the allowance to £400 <Col N="300" /> with income tax taken off.  I hope that something will be done, not to the Chairman alone, but to everyone in the Senate.

      <P>I suggest to Senator Connolly, in all seriousness, that he should not ask the House to vote on his proposal.  I am afraid it has an air of unreality about it.  We know the Senator's ability sufficiently well to realise that if it had not a sense of unreality he would have made a much more able case than he has made, and as he is quite capable of doing.  If one wants to spoil a good object the best way of doing it is to try to overdo it.  It is like killing something by faint praise.  Certainly neither the terms of the motion nor the speech made in favour of it appeal to me as a serious effort to deal with this matter.  I hope the Senator is not going merely to put it as a test of the sincerity of the House to approach problems of this kind.  I find that when the matter was on before Senator Connolly's colleague, Senator Comyn used these words:</P>
      <P>The office of the Chairman of the Seanad is the highest office in the gift of the people of this country.</P>
      <P>I suppose it is higher even than that of the President, and for that we offer £750.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The office of Vice-Chairman is <Col N="301" /> only second in importance to that of the Chairman.  That is my view of the dignity of the office from a constitutional point of view, and also, I am happy to say, from a personal point of view.</P>
    <P>That is the value placed by Senator Comyn on the positions, although he, perhaps, has slightly over-estimated their importance, comparatively.  He has certainly gone a long way from the value placed on them by Senator Connolly. He also said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All things considered, it is better to debate this question fully in the House, but better still, I say, to leave the matter over, to leave it to the consideration and discretion of the two able gentlemen whom we yesterday appointed to the respective offices.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the Dublin jarvey's suggestion: &ldquo;I leave it to yourself, sir.&rdquo;  I do not think that is the proper way to deal with it, because the Seanad has responsibility in regard to the matter, and if a Party is committed nationally &mdash;theoretically, at all events&mdash;to wholesale economy, I do not think they fully discharge their national responsibility by throwing a motion like this on the House and saying: &ldquo;You have got to take it or leave it,&rdquo; knowing very well that if the motion is rather an irresponsible one it will be rejected, and then, theoretically, the duty of the Party responsible has been discharged. Very good arguments might be made for a reduction in the remuneration of each of these positions, but I suggest that a meeting of a full House, with the public and the Press present, is not a proper or a business-like way of approaching it, and is not the way in which the original remuneration of either the Chairman or Vice-Chairman, or members of the House, was considered. A special committee was set up and it made a report which was accepted, but which also could have been amended or rejected.  That is the course that was adopted in the case of the Government and that is the course that should be adopted here, I believe, if we are serious about the matter.  If we are not serious we should say so. I do not believe this is a serious proposition, or if Senator Connolly meant <Col N="302" /> it seriously, he did not give me that impression, because I do not think he went into the case in the manner in which he should have gone into it, if he thought he was going to convince the House that it should make what was a very drastic alteration in the existing condition of affairs.  For that reason I suggest to the Senator that he should withdraw the motion for the time being, and we will have, through an incident in the other House, an opportunity of discussing it and setting up, what I believe we will have to do eventually, a committee to discuss this matter by itself or in conjunction with the remuneration of Senators, if that course is thought desirable. Otherwise I would be compelled to vote against the motion as it now stands because it has not been put in a way that it could get that consideration it deserves.</P>

      <P>I want first to protest against Senator O'Farrell's suggestion that I would, for one moment, think of detaining this House discussing a matter in which I did not seriously believe.  Probably my remarks suffered from two causes, one that I had laboured the matter considerably in the Session before the Christmas Recess, and I suppose I have a sensitive objection to covering the ground again to the same people.  It is a sensitive objection that I would like to see shared by more members of the House. I have what I call a subconscious feeling that this has been all thrashed out before, a subconscious feeling that you are boring people.  To suggest for a moment that I am not serious is quite wrong.  A further explanation is perhaps necessary.  I may have misinterpreted the conditions under which a proposal like this should be discussed. I understood the remuneration of the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Seanad could only be fixed by the Seanad itself.</P>

I believe the gesture ought to come from this House, and in spite of what Senator O'Farrell says, I hold if economy is to be practised in the country we ought to set the example, and should not be discussing railwaymen's wages or civil servants, without setting the example ourselves.  Senator O'Farrell took the liberty of suggesting that I was not perfectly serious.  Other people complain that I am too serious about some of these things.  However that may be, I am merely explaining that I am perfectly serious about this, and that I have thought over my proposal, and if it receives only my own vote, or that of myself and my seconder, it is going to a vote.  I want it to be considered as a serious proposition.</P>

      <P>I hope Senator Connolly will not press his motion.  I believe that a number of Senators would be inclined to support Senator Connolly but to a great extent they believe he has not gone about the matter in the proper way.  I agree that this is a serious matter and requires serious consideration, and that we should not treat it lightly, as in the motion before us.  I would be sorry to have to vote on the motion, because I feel very strongly that something must be done, that expenses must be cut down, and that we must economise.  I will vote against the motion if it is put now.  I think the Seanad should go into all the particulars, duties and responsibilities of each office, so that when we have done <Col N="304" /> that we will come to a fair and a reasonable decision.  I do not speak for the purpose of side-tracking the motion in any way.  To a great extent I agree with it.  I realise that it is necessary we should economise and make reductions in salaries.  I have no hesitation in saying that, but as to the correct amount that we should reduce them by we are not in a position to decide this evening.  I think an important motion of this sort would not get the consideration it deserves from such a small House as this.  I hope that Senator Connolly will see his way not to press the motion to a vote this evening, but agree to a short adjournment for the purposes of investigation.  The proper thing to do is to set up a Committee of the Seanad to go into the particulars and to find out exactly what the duties and responsibilities are.  I hold that we are not in a position to decide the matter this evening.</P>

In the first place I brought this matter up two months ago, and surely it was perfectly clear then that the matter was going to be discussed, either at the end of January or at the opening of this session?  That is two months ago, and surely those who think, if any of us think at all, have had an opportunity of thinking about it. There is a perfectly easy way of getting over the difficulty.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us know exactly <Col N="305" /> what that means.  We have now discussed this matter for the second or third time.  If this motion is defeated to-night by a vote it will not finish it. It is very unseemly and very undignified every time that this assembly meets to have this matter thrashed out over and over again.  The reason I objected to the matter being referred to a committee was merely in the particular circumstances that seemed to surround the whole situation at the time.  I am not going to make an appeal to Senator Connolly to withhold his sword.  I think there is a tremendous amount of mock economics about this motion.  If it is passed and given effect to it would mean that Senator Connolly could tell the citizens of the Saorstát that he had saved them the fraction of ¼d. per head per year. He referred to the last six years and said that the Seanad was a costly business. There have been other things that have been costly for the State besides the Seanad, and I do not think it wise or calculated to help to the clear consideration of matters to enter into them, but they are just as pertinent to the position of the country as the existence of the Seanad.  The point I would like to get at is this: We want to get to some finality in discussing this matter, or to some approach to finality.  We are not getting to anything near finality by simply taking a vote on Senator Connolly's motion.  It may be defeated; I expect it will.  I certainly will vote against it, because I think it leads nowhere. But what is going to follow? I understood that the Cathaoirleach ruled as unconstitutional the suggestion made by Senator Wilson to refer this matter to the joint committee which will probably be set up.  Is that so?</P>
