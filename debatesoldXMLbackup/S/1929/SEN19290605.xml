      <P>That this House do place on record the expression of its regret at the death of Senator Mrs. Stopford Green.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be possible, in a long speech, to give a detailed account of the work which the late Senator did for this country.  One might refer to her work for Irish history, and one might refer to her work in London during the difficult days in the past. It would be impossible in a few moments in any way to do justice to her service, but what I would like to refer to briefly is to her character and her absolute and passionate love for Ireland: to her pride in its past and to her faith in its future.  Many of us, and none probably more than myself, mourn the loss of a personal friend, and I think I can truly say that there were few in Ireland in the past few years as free from any thought or feeling of bitterness as the late Senator. Everyone who has endeavoured to serve this country, and who knew her, was her friend, and she sought the help of all alike.  I would like, with the permission of the House, to read again the latter portion of the message which she sent on the occasion on which she presented the casket to this House.  She did me the honour of asking me to read that message, and she told me then that she never expected again to be able to take part in the proceedings of <Col N="678" /> this House.  She was, however, spared for quite a number of years longer, and although not able, owing to the state of her health, to take an active part in the proceedings of the House, she remained a member.  But that message was sent in the belief that she could no longer take part in our proceedings.  I think nothing could express her spirit and her belief in this country better than the whole of that message.  I would ask Senators who may not have read it, and who were not members of the House at the time, to read it through. I think it is one of the finest things that has been written in recent years in this country.  The latter portion of it reads:</P>
    <P>Through the long record of wars and assaults, in every generation in turn, men who came as warriors, even the roughest of them, remained as men of Ireland. They took their share in defence of their new home, and endured, if need were, in evil times outrage, ruin and death in the cause of Irish freedom and independence. No real history of Ireland has yet been written.  When the true story is finally worked out&mdash; one not wholly occupied with the many and insatiable plunderers&mdash; it will give us a noble and reconciling vision of Irish nationality. Silence and neglect will no longer hide the fame of honourable men. We shall learn the ties which did in fact ever bind the dwellers in Ireland together.  Whether we are of an ancient Irish descent, or of later Irish birth, we are united in one people, and we are bound by one lofty obligation to complete the building of our common nation.  We have lived under the breadth of her skies, we have been fed by the fatness of her fields, and nourished by the civilisation of her dead.  Our people lie in her earth, and we ourselves must in that earth await our doom.  We have shared our country's sorrows, and we expect her joys. &ldquo;The mother that has nursed us is she, and when you have looked on her she is not unlovely.&rdquo;  To <Col N="679" /> Ireland we have given our faith. In Ireland is our hope.</P>

      <P>It is necessary for us now, under our Standing Orders, to fix a date for the holding of an election to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Mrs. Stopford Green. That date must not be less than one fortnight from to-day.  I suggest to the House that it should fix Wednesday, 19th June, which is a fortnight from to-day, for the filling of the vacancy.  Nominations for the filling of the vacancy will close at 5 p.m. on this day week.  Is the House agreed on that?</P>

      <P>I also regret to have to announce to the House that I have received a letter from Senator the Marquess of Lansdowne tentering his resignation as a member of the House.  This causes a second vacancy in the membership of the House.  There is no power under our Standing Orders to hold a combined election for the filling of the two vacancies on the one day.  In some ways, perhaps, it might be undesirable that the two elections for the filling of these vacancies should be held separately on the same day. Therefore, I suggest that we should hold the elections for the filling of the vacancies on two successive days; that we should hold an election for the filling of the first vacancy on Wednesday, 19th June, <Col N="680" /> and the election for the filling of the second vacancy on the following day, Thursday.  The nominations in both cases will close a week from to-day.  Is the House agreed?</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the Censorship of Publications Bill be recommitted.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will remember that, at the end of the Committee Stage on this Bill, the suggestion was made that it would be convenient if, when the Report Stage was reached, the Bill was recommitted to Committee.  The only object of that is that in Committee <Col N="681" /> each section can be taken, and any possible consequential amendments considered, whereas on Report only the actual amendments on the Order Paper can be considered.  I may say that, in moving this motion, my object is not to delay the Bill.  In fact, I should say that in following the course which I now propose, it may be possible to take the Report Stage earlier than otherwise would be possible. At the conclusion of the Committee Stage, it was suggested, I think by Senator Brown, that there were several consequential amendments which the Minister would probably wish to consider.  I do not know whether the Minister has gone into that or not.  At all events, I think there is only one consequential amendment on the Order Paper, and that appears in the name of Senator Johnson.</P>

      <P>I have gone through the Bill since, and I do not think there are any consequential amendments necessary.  As far as this motion is concerned, what I would submit to the House is this: that if it is carried and you have the second Committee Stage taken to-day, and if nothing arises necessitating a Report Stage, that then the Report Stage should also be taken to-day.  That, of course, would be a matter for consideration after the Recommittal Stage of the Bill has been concluded.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="682" /> Sections 1, 2, 3 and 4 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 5 (3).</P>
    <P>(3) The Board may act notwithstanding one or two (but not more than two) vacancies in their membership.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 5, sub-section (3), to delete in lines 36-37 the words &ldquo;one or two (but not more than two) vacancies&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;a vacancy.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment, perhaps, is not technically consequential, but it does follow, I think, as a reasonable consequence on the reduction of the membership of the Board from nine to five.  In the Bill, as originally printed, the number of the Board was to be nine.  Sub-section (3) of Section 5 reads: &ldquo;The Board may act notwithstanding one or two (but not more than two) vacancies in their membership.&rdquo;  It would seem to me, and I think to the House, that a Board of five should not be competent to carry on if there are two vacancies in its membership.  Consequently the amendment which I have put down is to bring the Bill in this respect back to its original form &mdash;as it was printed in the first instance. As the Bill was introduced in the Dáil, the Board was to contain five members, and the Board would then be able to act notwithstanding the vacancies in its membership.  The effect of my amendment is to bring the provision of this section into the position in which it was when the Bill was introduced by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment, if adopted, would be to cut across the arrangement arrived at on the Committee Stage of the Bill in regard to the constitution of the Board.  It was then decided that if the Board consisted of five members, four of them should agree with <Col N="683" /> regard to the prohibition of a book before a book could be prohibited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>Three members can constitute the Board as the Bill stands at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangement that we arrived at on the Committee Stage was that if three members of the Board were unanimous in their verdict that then a decision of the Board could be carried into effect. If the Senator's amendment is carried the Board cannot act if there is more than one vacancy in its membership.  How could a Board of three act?  I take it that if this amendment is carried it will cut right across sub-section (6) of the next section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHooper" hpid="Mr. Hooper Mr. Hooper">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hooper</NameTxt>
      <P>As the mover of the amendment referred to by Senator Wilson, I would like to point out that the proposition is not as he states.  It is provided in that amendment that if three members of the Board are unanimous in respect to a complaint that they should be able to present an effective report, but it does not mean that the Board can act if there are only three members of it.  There might be a normal Board of five with one vacancy, leaving four members of the Board still to act.  They may all get a book to consider, but only three of them may send in a report on the book. The purpose of the amendment was to secure that these three would have to be unanimous before a recommendation would be effective.  Senator Johnson's amendment does not, in my judgment, alter that amendment at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest to the House to accept the amendment.  As Senator Johnson has pointed out, this is not strictly a consequential point at all, because the Board, if it had three members, could still function.  The question is as to whether a Board of five should carry on even for a short period when there are two vacancies on it and only three persons able to act. I suggest to the House to accept the <Col N="684" /> amendment, because I think the Board should never have more than one vacancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in the Bill which compels the Minister to fill up a vacancy on the Board within any particular period of time. With a Board of only five, it is most important that even a single vacancy should be filled up as quickly as possible.  There is nothing in the Bill to do that.  I have no doubt that is the intention of the Minister himself, that it is most important that the small Board should not be left in the position of having a vacancy on it unfilled for any considerable time.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared carried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHooper" hpid="Mr. Hooper Mr. Hooper">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hooper</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 2:</P>
      <P>Section 5.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) The minutes of all meetings of the Board shall be forwarded to the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter dealt with in this amendment is one that perhaps could be more appropriately dealt with in the regulations, which the Minister will have to draw up for the guidance of the Board.  If I have an assurance that these regulations would contain a provision of this kind I would not be anxious to press the amendment.  But we are in a difficulty inasmuch as we do not know what these regulations will be. That being so I think it is important that this point should be raised on the present stage.  What I am anxious to secure is that the Minister shall be placed in possession of all necessary information with regard to the proceedings of the Board in respect to a complaint made.  I am anxious to secure that in the case of a report from the Board recommending the prohibition of a book, he should know exactly how that decision was arrived at: whether it was a unanimous decision of five, or a decision of four against one, or three against one, or whether it was a unanimous <Col N="685" /> decision of the only three members acting.  Similarly, I would like him to know, in the case of a complaint having been turned down by the Board and the Board refusing to make a recommendation of prohibition, how that decision was arrived at.  At present the Bill seems only to contemplate one kind of report, that is a report recommending the prohibition of a publication.  There is no mention of any other kind of report in the Bill.  I think that in the circumstances the minutes should be before the Minister at the time the report reaches him, because we must remember that even when a report recommending prohibition is forwarded to the Minister, he still has a discretion as to whether he will give effect to that recommendation or not.  I think that when he comes to exercise that discretion, it is desirable that he should have all the information necessary to help him in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to oppose this amendment as strongly as I possibly can.  I presume that when the Minister appoints members of this Board he will do so having full regard to their qualifications, their fitness and knowledge, for the positions to which they are nominated.  It is, as Senator Hooper says, a fact that in the event of those members sending on a recommendation condemning a book it is within the option of the Minister not to put that into force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHooper" hpid="Mr. Hooper Mr. Hooper">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hooper</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill says so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, of course, but it is desirable that the Executive Government or the political chief at the head of a Government Department&mdash;I do not say that in any offensive way whatever, because you must always have in these offices political chiefs&mdash; should be divorced as far as possible from the work of the Censorship Board, and that the members of it should be placed in an independent position.  They should be put in an independent position so that they will be free to exercise their judgment on the complaints submitted to them.  If this amendment were carried <Col N="686" /> it would to my mind vitiate the spirit in which this Bill should be administered.  In my view the Board should be free to control its own procedure. They are really being put, in a way, in a judicial office, and as such should be as independent as possible.  I do not think it would serve to make them independent if they had to give reasons for everything they do to the Minister, who in all probability would not be as well qualified to exercise the functions which the members of the Board will be appointed to exercise or to carry out the duties which they will be appointed to discharge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is a matter of very much importance whether or not the actual minutes of the Board are forwarded to the Minister.  While I agree in the main with Senator Dowdall, I do not think that the actual seeing of the minutes by the Minister will have very much effect, nor do I think it will achieve what Senator Hooper thinks it will. I do not think that the minutes will give any detailed reasons as to what was in the minds of the members of the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHooper" hpid="Mr. Hooper Mr. Hooper">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hooper</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not ask for reasons at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. The minutes will probably not contain such reasons at all.  My principal reason for rising is to ask that the Minister when dealing with this will make clear a point raised by Senator Hooper.  I take it that there are two kinds of reports, not one, as the Senator suggested, outlined in the Bill.  One is that when a complaint is made about a book or a periodical it should be submitted to the Board.  The Board will make a report to the Minister if they are of opinion that that book or periodical should be censored. That report must be, as I understand it, assented to by three, and not dissented from by more than one.  You have two principles in that, the assent and the possible dissent. If two dissent the assent of the three would not be sufficient to have a report recommending the <Col N="687" /> prohibition sent to the Minister. There is also another possible kind of report, and that is one recommending the withdrawal of a book from the list&mdash;the withdrawal possibly in partial form.  It may again be submitted.  A newspaper perhaps which has been censored might change its character, and as a result its name might be withdrawn from the prohibited list.  I take it that the report withdrawing the prohibition in that case would also have to be assented to by three members of the Board, and not dissented from by more than one.  I think that this cuts both ways.  As far as the actual amendment is concerned, I do not think it does very much one way or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to emphasise a point which I think vitiates some of the discussion.  Sub-section (2) of Section 6 makes it clear that wherever a book is submitted to the Board by the Minister the Board is bound to make a report of one kind or another.  It is only when a book is condemned that a report has to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>If they did not make the report the Minister would naturally ask what had happened.  When a complaint is made by the Minister the Board has to adjudicate on that complaint, and it has to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no.&rdquo;  Otherwise, the Minister's files would be always open in his office, and would never be closed if there was to be no reply.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely this is a departmental matter?  One might think from the discussion that the public were being defended, but it is merely a matter between the Minister and the Board.  Whether the Minister requires a report or not, as far as the general public are concerned the thing is superfluous.  The author is not entitled to an appeal in what is tantamount to a confiscation of his private property.  My difficulty is, what is the value of the report to the country or to the people concerned?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Although it may <Col N="688" /> not be stated exactly, the fact of referring to the Minister means referring to the officials of the Minister. What the amendment really means is transference of the final authority from the Board to the officials of the Minister, I think that is very undesirable. I agree the Board ought to be entirely independent, and not be too much bound up with the Minister, who has, of course, the final say in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of submitting minutes and making a report are two quite different things. The report is merely the final decision of the Board, whatever that may be, and the minutes are a record of the proceedings by which that report was arrived at.  It would contain the proposals, the amendments, and so forth, and show how members voted.  I would strongly oppose any such proposal.  If I were a member of the jury I would strongly oppose a submission to the judge or anybody else, of the names in the case of disagreement, as to how members were prepared to vote.  I think the members of the Board have a perfect right to regulate their own procedure, and merely make a report saying there are three or four in favour of a prohibition, for instance, and so many dissenting, and so on.  The object of the amendment, as admitted by the mover, is so that the Minister will be like a schoolmaster with his stick, standing over the Board to see how they voted.  If the individual members of the Board do not vote to please him, or as his advisers advise they should vote, then he could change the Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator did not say that, but the only inference that could be drawn from his remarks is that the Minister should be always fully acquainted with how members conducted themselves, and for that purpose the minutes must be submitted to him.  This is to be a voluntary Board, and no self-respecting member of the community would act under circumstances of that kind.</P>

What I am thinking of is the position of the Minister himself.  I can speak on this subject with an open mind, as I am never likely to be a Free State Minister.  Suppose any member of the Seanad were a Minister for Justice and were entrusted with the very responsible business of censoring literature, surely it would be of great assistance to the Minister for Justice if he were able to know the views of his Board of Censors?  I think, in the Minister's own interests, this is a very good amendment, and I will vote in favour of it in the Minister's interests.</P>

      <P>There seems to be a misconception in the minds of Senators who have spoken against the amendment.  It must be remembered that for good or ill the Bill does provide that when a report reaches the Minister he is not bound to act on it.  He has still discretion, and unless Senators want to remove that from the Bill they must bear that fact in mind.  My amendment is intended to help the Minister when he is exercising that discretion by giving him information regarding the division of the Board, if there is a division in respect of any complaint. I do not ask that the reasons that animated members of the Board should be given to the Minister.  Neither do I ask that any information should be given as to how the members of the Board voted one way or the other.  My idea is that these minutes would disclose in respect of a certain complaint that a certain number of the members of the Board voted one way and a certain number another way.  For instance, in the case of a Board of four, three might be in favour of prohibition and one against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister himself might have some knowledge of the book, and he might come to the conclusion in that case he would like to have further information and get a fifth opinion, <Col N="690" /> or he might think, having read the book himself, that he would not wish to be bound by the opinion of the Board.  That discretion is with him whether we like it or not.  Taking that for granted, I say it is desirable he should have this information. There must be some regulalations governing the procedure of the Board, and it seems to me to be a very natural thing that the Minister would put down as one of these regulations a condition that the Board would report to him on a point like this.  As I said in the beginning, if I had any assurance that the regulations would cover what is intended by the amendment, I would not press the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not think we have stressed enough the care that should be taken for maintaining the independence of the censors. I do not think censors would be found willing to act if they know their names are to be returned as to whether they were for or against prohibition in every case.  I am a member of the Film Censorship Board, which has a duty somewhat similar to that with which the Censorship of Publications Board will be entrusted, though it is not as important. There is no such thing as recording the names of the censors who are for or against the production of a film.  In fact, the Board at an early date made a strong protest against any such record being put on their minutes.  I believe that is right, for I think the independence of the censors is very essential. I think the Minister will know all about it, and about the report, but I object to the names of the censors, whoever they may be, being recorded as being for or against any book, no matter what it is.</P>

      <P>The Minister could make an amendment under Section 20 which would have the effect of disclosing to him what number of persons had assented or dissented, and their names.  The Minister in this case is really a Court of Appeal from the Board of Censors, and as a Court of Appeal he ought to get the information for himself.  I do not see that he can avoid reading the book.  I do not think he ought to be in any way influenced by the Board of Censors, or by who went one way or the other when the book was being considered by the Board. It should be an independent judgment both by the Board and by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Brown.  It seems to me that this Board will be a judicial or quasi-judicial Board, and I think it would be quite wrong it should be compelled to give any information to the Minister as to the course of their proceedings.  I am quite satisfied that if the Minister did purport to make regulations requiring them, or compelling them, to supply minutes of the proceedings that these regulations would be ultra vires.  I am, therefore, opposed to this amendment, and I think it ought not to be carried for the reasons stated by Senator Mrs. Wyse Power, who has experience in matters of this description as a member of a Film Censorship Board.  I think we ought to <Col N="692" /> be guided by her in this matter and not accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Seanad to reject this amendment, because I think the Board of Censors ought to be an independent body, and to exercise their judgment themselves. I do not see what advantage would be derived from the sending in of the minutes, but I would like to point out that before the Minister makes an order condemning a book it would be necessary for him to see that the provisions of the Act are being carried out, and it would be necessary for him to ascertain in the report which reaches him the number of censors who have condemned the book.  Suppose three out of four had condemned the book, it would be necessary in the form which he receives to set out, that such and such a book was considered by the Board of Censors, that three of those present considered the book should be censored, and the fourth that it should not.  That information the Minister should have.  If four out of five take a certain view, or if the five are unanimous, it is exactly the same.  If the report that comes to him shows there is not the necessary majority then, of course, the book is not condemned.  You cannot, as Senator Douglas has said, lay down any strict rules as to how persons must vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of a book not condemned what you must look at is how the book is voted on.  If there is sufficient to condemn it, it stands condemned, but if not, it stands uncondemned. The Minister must have all information before him as to how the censors were divided.  It does not follow he knows their names.  He need not necessarily know each member voted, but he must know how the division went.  Otherwise, he would not be justified in condemning the book, for before he condemns a book he must know the provisions of the statutes have been carried out.  I do not think the Minister need require the minutes. Further, I think they would be worthless, because they would simply show him how the Censor's <Col N="693" /> Board was divided, or else they would be interminably long, showing how this passage and that passage was debated, and that some said a particular passage was objectionable, and others that it was not.  It would be an impossible situation, and it would mean very heavy clerical work.  That, of course, is only a mechanical objection, but I do not think it is in itself advisable the Minister should know all that.</P>
    <P>I cannot agree with Senator Brown that if the Minister gets a unanimous report of five members that the book is objectionable that there is any obligation on him to read that book so as to satisfy himself.  That is not in the framework of the Bill.  The way we expect the Bill will work, that is the normal case, is if the Board condemns a book it will stand condemned, and it will be only in abnormal cases the Minister will reverse the findings of the Board.</P>

      <P>Section 6, sub-section (2).  To add at the end of the sub-section the words:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It shall be the duty of the Board to inform the author and <Col N="694" /> publisher of a book of any complaint received under this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Just now Senator Gogarty said that, as the Bill stands, the author or publisher of any book which was the subject of complaint would be tried in secret.  I am sure it is not the wish of the House that that should operate to that extent.  The object is to ensure that the author or publisher shall receive notice of the fact that a complaint against a book in which they are interested has been made.  I think the Minister promised this would be part of the rules.  Am I wrong?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the official record here and I will look it up before I come to the further amendment. In any case, it is only reasonable that an author or publisher should have notice.  When this point was raised before in another form the objection appeared to be that the author might be resident in America, and that it would be quite impossible for him to be summoned in time to appear before a Board of Censors to give an explanation of his book.  That argument appeared to weigh, but I think the whole of the Seanad were in favour of the principle that an author should be heard before an unfavourable report was made.  I realise the physical difficulty in regard to an author being summoned from America being able to appear in time before the Board, but I think it is at least reasonable he should receive notice of the complaint, and especially for this reason, if a book is liable to be prohibited it will obviously affect the commercial aspect of the transaction.  It is very unfair that while a book is being tried in secret the publisher should have no opportunity of regulating his stocks in the country where the book is liable to be prohibited.  Even if he cannot be heard in defence of his book he should at least receive such a notice as will enable him to take precautions to minimise his loss. If a book is liable to be prohibited obviously a publisher would reduce <Col N="695" /> his stocks in the country.  I ask the Seanad to accept this as a reasonable amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to prevent the operation of the Statute altogether. Senator Sir John Keane says that some of the authors may be in America.  I may add that some of them may be dead.  It would be quite impossible to carry out the Act if this amendment is inserted, because you will have, before you went into the consideration of the book, to serve a notice on people whose addresses were unknown to you.  That would be quite impossible. I think Senator Sir John Keane's recollection is not quite correct when he says that the Seanad, or any great body of opinion in the Seanad, was of opinion that the author should be heard.  My recollection is that the Seanad distinctly and by a overwhelming voice decided that the author should not be heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>That it was not mandatory on the Board to hear an author, and I think there are very good reasons given for that, because instead of being an advisory Board, as is now contemplated, the Board would become a battle-ground as between the author and the members of the Board.  Moreover, if an author was heard he would have the opportunity of knowing what were the opinions of the respective members of this advisory Board, and having such an opportunity he would be in a position to launch against the individual members what I described on the last occasion, and what I repeat now, will be a campaign of calumny.  You would get no man to act on an advisory Board on that condition, if they were to be exposed to dangers of that description.  I think Senator Sir John Keane must see the force of some of the observations I have made.  There is the absolute impossibility of serving a notice on a man who is dead, or on a foreign author, or on an author <Col N="696" /> whose address is unknown.  Senator Douglas in a later amendment is more circumspect.  He appreciates the difficulty that arises.  I think Senator Sir John Keane's amendment ought not to be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to see what the remarks of Senator Comyn have to do with the amendment.  The Senator dealt with my amendment as if it gave an author or publisher the right to appear before the Board.  The amendment is merely to try and ensure that the author or publisher shall receive notice.  In the case of a clever lawyer, as Senator Comyn is, I can quite understand the difficulty he raises.  The arguments he used would also apply to notices as regards income tax assessments.  The person on whom notice is served might be dead.  I notice that the Senator, with all his ingenuity, did not deal with the case of an anonymous author.  I wonder he did not think of that. Obviously, if you want to make a thing ridiculous you can do so.  If the House wants to do it it can be done.  If an author is dead he is dead, and there is an end of it.  As practical men we know that 99 per cent. of the notices sent out arrive. If the principle is accepted the draughtsman could put it in proper form, and where the principle is not clear the Minister could make it clear in drafting.  The Senator did not deal with the argument that you are possibly placing a very serious commercial loss on an author or publisher by reason of the fact that you do not give notice that a complaint has been registered against him.  All the amendment asks is that such notice should be given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>There is certainly an aspect of this by which Senator Sir John Keane is influenced&mdash; namely, the publisher would take the precaution of not increasing his stock if he gets notice, and, may I point out, that if a publisher has in stock a book which he thinks may be found objectionable, he may do serious injury to a great many booksellers up and down the country by <Col N="697" /> forcing the sale of it on them, and letting them hold the baby, as it were.  As the lesser of two evils, I think it is better that one individual should suffer rather than a number should suffer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to Senator Sir John Keane that Ireland is not the only book market in the world, and that if there are books in this country which are prohibited here, there is nothing to prevent the bookseller making them up in a parcel and returning them to the publisher, who can dispose of them in other markets which have not such a high standard of morality.  I would like also to point out to him that this amendment would not achieve its purpose, because he asks that as soon as the Board receives a notice it should send it on to the publisher.  I take it that when the Board receives notice they will inquire into the book.  Of course the Board must act as a board.  If they meet and consider the book, they are then to send notice to the publisher.  There is nothing in the amendment to say that they shall stay or stop deliberations, and in most cases the deliberations would be over and the publisher would receive notice&mdash;&ldquo;Your book is being considered,&rdquo; probably a day or two after&mdash;that is, if he were a foreign publisher&mdash;the verdict had been entered up by the censors, so that I do not think the amendment would in any way achieve its purpose, and I do not think that the arguments which he put forward are strong enough to support it.  The only sub-section in the Bill dealing with this matter is sub-section (4), and in my judgment sub-section (4) goes far enough.  If Senator Sir John Keane has taken me up as stating that I wished the Bill to go further than sub-section (4) goes, he took me up wrongly, and I venture to think that, if he reads through the reports, he will see that I made it very clear, especially on Senator Douglas's amendment, because Senator Douglas's amendment was to confine the right of appearance <Col N="698" /> to persons who were resident in the Irish Free State.</P>

      <P>Section 6, sub-section (6).  To insert before the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6)  A report prepared under this section or under Section 7 which has received the assent of three members of the Board shall be sent by registered post to any member of the Board who has not signified either his assent or his dissent and the report shall not be forwarded to the Minister until seven days have elapsed from the date of posting.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment has been put down because of the change made by this House in, shall I say, the method of report.  When the Bill came to this House the principle was that a certain number should assent. The question of dissent did not arise. When the Bill was introduced here it said that seven out of nine should signify assent, and now it is four out of five.  This House has introduced the principle that there shall be the assent of three, but it is provided that if there is a dissent of two, it would have the effect of preventing the assent of three from being effective.  Under the old plan, if there was one member absent from a meeting of the Board, or ill in bed, when the report was being prepared he would have no grievance because a sufficient percentage would have assented, and if they did not assent, no report could be made. I suppose we might now conceivably have meetings at which, through temporary absence because of illness only three would attend, and three would give their assent.  I suggest that where that assent is given by the three, a short time should elapse during which the other two could, if they thought fit, exercise their right of dissent.  It is only a matter of a few days&mdash;I suggest a week.  I think that there should be some such provision so that the right of dissent could be exercised.  As I <Col N="699" /> pointed out before, that might work both ways.  Dissent might be dissent against withdrawing a prohibition. I think an opportunity should be given by which that dissent could be exercised.</P>

      <P>I had a definite reason for not putting that down, because as far as I can read the Bill, while it will probably be generally done at meetings, there is no absolute provision for meetings, and it is possible that the Board might meet and discuss a book or that the secretary or the chairman might draw up a report which would be sent around and that there would be no actual meeting in connection with the report, a procedure which often happens with other bodies.  It is for that reason that I did not say, &ldquo;at the meeting.&rdquo;  I recognise the difficulty of the wording, and I think the Minister understands the object.</P>

      <P>Personally, I do not see any objection to this amendment, but I would prefer to have this put into the rules than actually into the Act.  I think it is rather a matter of detail than of procedure.  I consider that it would be better to have the procedure put in the rules and the principle in the Statute.  I will undertake to put into the rules a provision somewhat of this nature, not exactly in the same wording, but rather carrying out the spirit of the amendment.  But if the Senator would prefer to have it in the Statute I will not ask the Seanad to oppose it, though personally, as I say, I think it is a matter which is more suitable for the rules than for the Statute.</P>

One realises <Col N="700" /> that rules are not as carefully watched, even though they may be laid on the Table, as a Statute itself, and variations can be made in the rules from time to time.  But in any case, the principle is important.  The Board is now to consist of five, and we are to presume that the five will be active and regular attenders, or active participators, in the work of censorship.  But one can conceive, too, the possibility arising of a member having personal relations either with the author or with the publisher of a particular book, who would prefer not to enter into judgment on a book for one reason or another, who might be unwell, who would prefer not to declare himself on a particular book.  That might apply to the two persons, and I think the onus should be put upon them of a definite refusal or a definite assent and that that should be contained in the Act.</P>

      <P>I think it is desirable that this amendment should be put into the Statute, and not into the rules, because it is legislation, and if I am opposed to anything it is legislation by a Department. There is a clear principle involved in this amendment.  The Senate has expressed its view that signature by three does not carry the same weight as a unanimous verdict.  I think it is only reasonable that when there are only three members of a Board signing a report, it should be hedged around by certain formalities, and the formalities suggested in this amendment are not very onerous.  It involves a delay of only a week.  As the Minister has accepted the substance of the amendment, I think it is desirable that it should go into the Statute rather than into the rules.</P>

      <P>The point I wanted to make is that if the Minister likes to add words dealing with such a case I have no objection, but I suggest that it is not really necessary, because in the event of a complaint the Board might make a report to the Minister saying that they are not recommending a prohibition.  But surely there would be nothing to prevent them at a later date recommending the prohibition if there was a sufficient number in favour of it.  If a report saying that they were not recommending the prohibition of the book would prohibit them from sending another report, I think Senator Hooper's point should be met.</P>

      <P>Senator Hooper's point is only one thing that may occur; various other things may occur also, and that is the reason why I would prefer this put into the rules, because questions of this nature will inevitably arise.  After all, the real masters of what is the wisest procedure and what is most effective will be the Board of Censors themselves, and I think it would be highly advisable on matters like this that the Board of Censors should be consulted, even if they are not the rule-making authority, before the rules are made, to see how those responsible persons can best achieve their object.  Questions like that put up by Senator Hooper and other questions will inevitably arise, and it would be rather dealing with it piecemeal to do it by Statute, because you will have to do other things in the rules, and it would be rather a pity to have one in the rules and the other in the Statute.</P>

      <P>I am opposed to that view.  Here we are proposing to make a provision in the Statute dealing with a particular form.  My point and Senator Douglas's point are absolutely on all fours.  Senator Comyn proposes to deal with them in two different ways.  My point would be met if after the words &ldquo;three members&rdquo; were added the words &ldquo;or is dissented from by one member.&rdquo;  The amendment would then read: &ldquo;A report prepared under this section or under Section 7, which has received the assent of three members or is dissented from by one member of the Board shall be sent by registered post to any member of the Board who has not signified either his assent or his dissent.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It seems to me that both Senator Hooper and Senator Douglas are laying a great deal of stress on the number of members of the Board.  The principle in the thing which I think Senator Comyn wants, and which I take it the Seanad wants, is that members who <Col N="705" /> have not expressed an opinion about a report should receive a copy of the report, that there should be a week given for them to get a copy of the report, and that no report should be published or acted upon until each member who had not given a decision upon it had due notice of it.  That is the principle. If you leave out the second line of Senator Douglas's amendment, it would read.  &ldquo;A report prepared under this section or under Section 7, shall be sent by registered post to any member of the Board who has not signified either his assent or his dissent, and the report shall not be forwarded to the Minister until seven days have elapsed from the date of posting.&rdquo;  I believe that that would cover every case that would arise.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;New Section. Before Section 8 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;8.&mdash;The Minister may at any time after the receipt of a report by the Board in respect of any book or periodical publication return such report to the Board for further consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment really deals to a certain extent with the point we have just been discussing.  There is a provision in the Bill by which &ldquo;the Minister may at any time after consultation with the Board by order revoke any prohibition theretofore made by him under this Act.&rdquo;  I do not quite know what &ldquo;after consultation with the Board&rdquo; means, whether the whole report will be referred back to them or not, or whether the Minister will merely ask an opinion in an informal way of the Chairman or of any other member he may wish <Col N="706" /> to consult.  It does not give him any power to refer back any report which is not a report recommending prohibition. We are not told that a report will come up in the event of a complaint being turned down by the Censorship Board, but if such a report does come up there is no power for the Minister to refer it back. Assuming that only three members of the Board are acting, that two of them recommend the prohibition of a book or a newspaper and that one is against it, that one member of the Board is sufficient to hold up a recommendation for prohibition. From the fact that power in one direction is conferred in this section and that power in another direction is not conferred, it seems to me that it is not intended that he should have power to refer back a report of the kind I speak of.  But in the event of that kind of a report coming up, the position will then be that one member of the Board will be able to hold up a recommendation in favour of prohibition, although all the other members of the Board might be in favour of prohibition, that is, the two who would not have reported on the book in the first instance and the two who would have reported in favour of prohibition.  But the opinion of the whole four would be rendered nugatory by the fact that one of the three who did act was not in favour of prohibition.  I believe that we ought to put both sides on an equality, and that the Minister should have the power to refer either kind of report back for reconsideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather opposed to this amendment.  After all, the Minister, no doubt having consulted those who are in a position to give him an opinion as to the qualifications of certain men, selects a number of men to act on this Board for their qualifications.  I have met barristers and doctors, very astute in their own particular way, but singularly innocent of any knowledge as far as general reading is concerned, who are so very busy at their own duties that they have very little opportunity to read.  It is quite possible <Col N="707" /> that one of these men might become Minister for Justice, and if he took it on himself to override the views of five men selected on account of their qualifications for a certain position, really in effect it would make the Minister a censor rather than the five men who were selected by reason of their qualifications to be on such a Board.  I will vote against the amendment in any case; but if it is at all necessary to have such an amendment, I suggest that this one should be substantially altered.  &ldquo;The Minister may at any time&rdquo;&mdash;that is very indefinite.  It would keep men who are interested as authors, publishers or booksellers in a state of suspense.  If the amendment is to be considered by the Seanad, I would suggest that it should read: &ldquo;The Minister may at any time within thirty days of the receipt of a report by the Board in respect of any book or periodical publication return such report to the Board.&rdquo;  The amendment goes on to say &ldquo;for further consideration.&rdquo; I would suggest that he might return such report to the Board, &ldquo;giving reasons for such reconsideration.&rdquo; I hope the amendment will not be passed: but if it is passed.  I hope that it will be amended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that in this amendment you will do a very great injustice to a considerable number of people and at the same time place the readers of books in an invidious position.  Presumably after the Board has considered a book or a periodical and has given it a clean bill of health, the publisher, booksellers, and readers can consider it free and innocent of any offence of any kind.  Then the amendment presupposes the possibility that, having been found innocent, the book may stand another trial in a week, or a month, or twelve months, or any time afterwards, possibly without any new facts being brought before the court, because the book is there, and new facts of a condemnatory character, new charges in the indictment, shall I say, cannot be brought forward, <Col N="708" /> because the whole book was there at the time of its first trial.  To put an amendment of such a kind into the Bill, to allow the book, its author, its publisher, its reader and the booksellers to be subject to the possibility of being condemned as participators in the dissemination of obscene literature, would surely be an injustice to everyone.</P>
      <P>On the point that the Senator raised regarding the power to refer again to the Board after a time.  I think it should be noted that there are two classes&mdash;there is the periodical and there is the book.  In the case of the book, the reference in Section 8, sub-section (2) clearly presupposes the possibility that a new edition of the book may have deleted and omitted the objectionable portions.  I think one could cite instances of books which, were these portions deleted, would be entirely innocent, and I take it that Section 8, sub-section (2) has reference to that kind of book.  In the case of periodicals it is clearly contemplated that if a periodical changes ownership, let us say, and its character, then under the same name it may be admitted freely and without prohibition, and it is in such cases as that that an order for prohibition might be revoked.  But surely the Senator will not ask the House to agree that the publisher of the book, the seller of the book and the reader of the book must stand in awe, in doubt and in hesitation as to whether they are going to be liable to the discredit of helping to sell and disseminate obscene literature of the kind which has once had from this Board a clean bill.</P>

      <P>I think that this amendment can very well be construed as being in favour of the writer and the publisher of the book, I can quite understand the Minister receiving a report condemning a book, signed by three members of the Board.  He might be reluctant to put that report into execution, and at the same time he might be unwilling to refuse assent to the report. In that case the Minister may say: &ldquo;Well now, three members of <Col N="709" /> the Board have signed this report.  I am not exactly satisfied with their view, and I would like to send the book back again.&rdquo;  That case would be covered by this amendment as well as the case suggested by Senator Johnson, and I really think the amendment is a reasonable one, assuming, of course, always that you have a reasonable Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that what is really in Senator Hooper's mind is that the Minister should know the real mind of the Board.  That is to say, he does not want a small minority or a very small meeting of the Board to express finally and for all time the considered view of the Board.  I think that is what is really in the Senator's mind.  As I have already stated, that can be carried out by rules governing the procedure of the Board.  But I do not think that this amendment could be accepted in its present wide form; in fact, I do not think it could be accepted in any form.  For instance, it is not contemplated by the Bill, and I do not think it ought to be contemplated by the Bill, that if a book has passed the Censorship Board and has got, so to speak, a clean bill of health, it should not end there.  The powers which are given the Minister in this Bill are meant to be further safeguards to the writer and further safeguards to the publisher.  They are not meant to be further dangers, so to speak, to the writer or publisher. If the Censorship Board says that a book is all right, then that should be final and the Minister should not intervene.  It is only in a case where the Censorship Board has given too harsh a decision that the Minister should interfere, and I do not think it is right that the Minister should send back, as it were for a new trial, a book which they have acquitted. As far as a book which they have condemned is concerned, if he is doubtful about the condemnation, of course there is nothing in the Bill which should prevent the Minister saying: &ldquo;It does not appear to me to be quite clear that this book ought to be condemned.  Will you <Col N="710" /> send me in further detail your reasons?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I do not think it applies.  It is rather analogous to a verdict of &ldquo;Not guilty.&rdquo;  For instance, if a person is found not guilty there can be no new trial on the part of the State. I think it should be very much the same in this case.  The Minister, after all, is not a specialist.  He will not be able to give an enormous amount of time to considering books, because occasionally he has a little other work to do, and I do not think he should be empowered to condemn a book, or even ask the Censors to reconsider and condemn a book which they thought ought not to be condemned.  The real condemnation ought to be carried out by them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case I think Senator Hooper is mainly concerned with the danger to the prisoner going free.  We should treat, as the Minister has suggested, the book in this case as the prisoner in the dock, and if it is acquitted then it cannot and should not be tried again on the same charge and by the same court. If it is found guilty, and if a prohibition order is issued, then the Minister is in a sense a court of appeal that can either reverse it or make it effective.  It is the same procedure as in the case of the trial of a prisoner for any offence.  Senator Hooper seeks to reverse the whole position in one respect and to send a book which has been found not guilty back for retrial by the same court.  I do not think there is any necessity for that, and there is certainly no justification for it.  If Senator Douglas's amendment is carried it will mean that before the <Col N="711" /> report goes to the Minister every member of the Board will have had an opportunity of giving his assent or expressing his dissent.  If any member refuses to do that no one has a right to assume that he is in favour of prohibition or that he is against prohibition.  At all events if two members fail, notwithstanding the opportunity to give assent or dissent, that must not be quoted against the book, and the position would arise that these members were not doing their duty.  It would certainly be no justification for the insertion of such an amendment as this.</P>

      <P>I would be quite willing to accept the time limitation suggested by Senator Dowdall.  I think it is a reasonable suggestion, and in my judgment it would meet the point made by him and by Senator Johnson that authors and publishers should not be unduly held in suspense with regard to the position of their books.  Senator Johnson said that once a book had got a clean bill of health it should not be questioned again.  Let us see the clean bill of health that it gets.  I am contemplating a book that has been before three members of the Board, one of whom is opposed to prohibition, and two of whom are in favour of prohibition.  The report goes to the Minister, and the single individual who was opposed to prohibition is the individual who gives this book a clean bill of health.  By Senator Douglas's amendment I do not think it goes to the other two at all.</P>

But the general principle of what is in Senator Hooper's amendment is that the Minister can refer back every case, no matter what the decision may have been.  That is to say, if there is a unanimous finding in favour of refusing to censor a <Col N="713" /> book that the Minister can send it back.  I think that is quite wrong.</P>

When moving an amendment on parallel lines to this I ventured to suggest that the Minister, in principle, was in favour of the proposal, and he shook his head.  I stated that I would try to find out my authority.  I am quoting from the Official Debates, May 15th, Col. 556, where I am given as saying:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising out of Senator O'Hanlon's remarks, there is a very important point involved which I do not think that either House has yet fully regarded, that is, whether the publisher or the publishing trade should not be immediately informed when a complaint is lodged.  The bookseller goes on in perfect innocence importing books and increasing his stock while the <Col N="714" /> complaint is pending.  He probably will not have any indication of the Minister's attitude.  I intend to put down an amendment for the Report Stage to ensure that the publishing trade will be informed when a complaint is made, so that they can take precautions and save themselves the heavy losses that would be involved by getting in supplies of a book which might be prohibited.</P>

There will have to be a code of rules drawn up, but if the Senator would like to see it in the Bill I would accept an amendment to that effect.</P>
    <P>I had, at least, justification for my belief, and, after all, are not the Minister's first thoughts the right and proper ones?  Surely it is reasonable, proper, and only just that those who are liable to suffer commercial loss by prohibition should receive ample warning in advance that their case is under consideration.  After all, they are not allowed to appear at the trial. They are going to be tried in secret. All they will know is that one fine day a notice will appear in the Official Gazette saying &ldquo;Your book is prohibited,&rdquo; and all the stock will be tied up.  The Minister will say that there is no injustice in that and that they can export it to England and elsewhere.  But what assurance is there for the owners that the stock will be taken back by the publishers or the wholesalers, whoever they may be?  Possibly they might be sold elsewhere, but very probably at a loss.  I ask the House to look at this matter from a common-sense point of view, and to safeguard those who, I suggest, are being unjustly treated by a secret trial, and who may be further penalised by a commercial loss, that might by due notice have been avoided.</P>

      <P>As far as that is concerned I do not think it <Col N="715" /> is at all feasible.  The suggestion is that every complaint made shall immediately be published in the Official Gazette.  On a previous amendment I already pointed out that complaints will be sent forward immediately to be dealt with by the Board of Censors.  As the Senator is aware, what I might call the first line of defence for authors and publishers has been swept away, that is to say that at one time it was contemplated that only level-headed sensible persons would be allowed to make complaints.  At the present moment anyone who likes can make a complaint.  I am quite certain that we will receive a great number of very, very foolish complaints.  I think that is almost certain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think some gentleman with a mistaken sense of humour suggested that someone will probably send up a copy of the Bible, of Shakespeare's works, or something of that kind, and say that it should be condemned &mdash;books which are probably quite harmless.  I am not quite sure if it was here or in the Dáil, but it was mentioned somewhere that in a library in the South of Ireland some books like Stanley Weyman's &ldquo;Under the Red Robe&rdquo; were withdrawn from circulation. That is a different matter from complete censoring of a book, but it is quite possible that complaints of that nature may come pouring in from persons of ill-balanced judgment on questions of literature, because now we are not confined to a select body of complainants who would have to be careful of the complaints they sent in.  Any man in the street can now make a complaint, and you would have to publish in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> almost certainly and absolutely long and ridiculous strings of complaints.  I do not think there is any danger of any material injury being done to booksellers.  There is another matter which must be borne in mind.  If a book is complained of, the complaint should not be made public, because as long as the book can be got, and it is known it has been complained of, it is very likely there would be a rush on that <Col N="716" /> book.  It would be an advertisement for that book, and possibly <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> would increase its circulation, or certain papers might copy from it, and people would see what type of book is considered dangerous, and might make a run on it if they think it is likely to be censored.  I could not accept the amendment.  One of the evils which come from censorship, I completely admit, is that you have a list which serves by way of index of nauseous publications.  You cannot help it when these books cannot be purchased here, but it is quite a different thing to have a list of that nature at a time when such books can be purchased.  The amendment would, I think, do great harm. I cannot accept it.</P>

      <P>Senator Sir John Keane in moving his amendment, challenged the lawyers to find any shortcoming in it.  Probably because there is a shortcoming in it none of the lawyers discovered it.  Senators will notice the way the section as amended would read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Every complaint made under Section 6 of this Act and every prohibition order and every order made by the Minister under this Act revoking or amending any such prohibition order shall be published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> as soon as may be after it is made and shall come into operation and have effect as on and from the day on which it is so published.</P>
      <P>In other words, the complaint shall come into operation and shall have effect &ldquo;as on and from the day on which it is so published.&rdquo;  I think from that point of view the reading of the section would be nonsensical, and that is probably the reason none of the lawyers discovered it.</P>

      <P>I am glad that a layman has outwitted the lawyers in this case.  But really I am rather <Col N="717" /> surprised that the Minister made no reference whatever to his change of front, if I might so call it.  There is no question at all that he either spoke hurriedly on that occasion, which is not his practice, or else he has thought better of it, because he certainly said then that he preferred to put it into the rules.  Now the Minister says he is not prepared to consider it at all.  However, I leave that.  We all say things in haste sometimes and repent at leisure. But I really cannot see the objection of the Minister that because there may be a number of complaints, therefore the injustice of the present practice should continue.  Surely the matter is not determined by the quantity of complaints, but by the principle of right and wrong, and the fact that we have complaints made easier by an amendment is surely no convincing reason.  I do not think individuals will make complaints at all.  They will be made by associations, at the instigation of individuals. I am amazed to hear the Minister refer to the danger of advertisement. Once books are considered to be really bad that will be an advertisement, and they will be read&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I think Senator Brown said it would be a most dangerous thing to try and define the word &ldquo;distribution,&rdquo; while the Minister, I think, took another view. I suggest that it is not taking legislation seriously, in a case like this, where you have three legal luminaries not clear as to the meaning of a word in a Bill before Parliament. It is no wonder that judges speak in rather scathing terms of loose drafting and of the conundrums they very often have to propound owing to the slack way in which the work of Parliament is carried out.  Here we are erring against the light of previous knowledge and warning.  This word &ldquo;distribution&rdquo; is undoubtedly a vague word, and it is up to us not to allow the Bill to pass into law with the knowledge that a word in it is vague in the opinion of lawyers.  I understood the Minister to say that if I have a prohibited book on my shelves and that if I lend it to my brother I am not distributing.</P>

      <P>Where is the line to be drawn?  I suggest that we should take our legislation a little more seriously, and that where there is an obvious doubt about the meaning of a word, we should make an honest attempt to define it.  I have made an honest attempt to define the word in the amendment.  I have moved, and I suggest that, roughly speaking, in most cases the definition which I have suggested will stand the test in the courts. The definition I have suggested, &ldquo;lending or hiring for profit or reward&rdquo; will, in most cases, I think, stand the test of the courts.  I quoted the case of a certain book being hired out at 2/6 to each reader.  That, I take it, would be called &ldquo;distribution,&rdquo; and would be an offence under this Bill as it stands.  Am I to understand now that mere casual lending would not be an offence?  I hope the Seanad will accept this amendment, so that the definition of the word may be made perfectly clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>This word &ldquo;distribution&rdquo; does not cause me the slightest difficulty, and I do not think, when it comes to be interpreted by the courts, it will cause any difficulty.  To say what actually amounts to distribution is impossible, because you cannot define very strictly the limits as to what amounts to distribution; but whether you distribute to relatives or to strangers does not enter into the matter at all.  I could not follow <Col N="720" /> Senator Sir John Keane's argument in the least bit, because if you distribute to a hundred relatives it would undoubtedly be distribution. If you lend to one you cannot be said to distribute.  To distribute means to scatter fairly widely. That is the plain ordinary meaning of the word.  Whether there are a sufficient number of lendings to amount to distribution will, in every case, be a question of fact.  As far as the Senator's definition goes, that the word &ldquo;distribution&rdquo; shall mean &ldquo;lending or hiring for profit or reward&rdquo;&mdash;I am entirely against that.  Distribution means distribution, whether it is for reward or not for reward.  There is one section which says that the book shall not be sold.  The other section, which is a completely separate section, says that it shall not be lawful for any person, &ldquo;otherwise than under and in accordance with a permit in writing granted to him under this section</P>
      <P>(a) to import into Saorstát Eireann for sale or distribution, or</P>
      <P>(b) to sell, or expose, offer, advertise or keep for sale, or</P>
      <P>(c) to distribute or offer or keep for distribution.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sale and distribution are kept perfectly distinct all through these sections, and distribution there plainly means and is meant to mean and intended to mean distribution, whether for reward or not for reward. What would happen if Senator Sir John Keane's amendment were carried?  Let us suppose that you have a free circulating library. Any book, no matter how indecent, could be kept in that free circulating library, and the librarian could not be prosecuted.  That would be one effect of the amendment.  Another effect would be that a considerable number of paper-covered documents, worth about a penny possibly, could be freely distributed.  They are being distributed at present.  There is a certain amount of money obviously being made by the persons who are selling birth control appliances. I have seen myself a copy of what is alleged to be an almanac. <Col N="721" /> Every single page of that was simply an advertisement for this class of stuff.  These almanacs were being distributed freely.  They could be handed to people all over the city and all over the country, and that would not be distribution if this amendment were carried.  Again, they might be scattered about as handbills and left where people could pick them up.  All that would be distribution.  That would be one of the results if this amendment were carried; that these paper-covered documents, that cost very little to produce, could be circulated.  As a matter of fact they are being distributed in this country and are doing harm here.  I ask the Seanad to reject the amendment.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister. I think if Senator Sir John Keane's amendment were accepted it would leave not merely a loophole in this Bill but a chasm.  I would like to assure Senator Sir John Keane that the section as drafted really provides for the case that he has in mind.  A person lending a book to a friend, or handing it around within a reasonable circle, is not hit by this section as it appears in the Bill.  But if the Senator's amendment were accepted the evil which has made him a convert to the principle of the Bill would be perpetuated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has expressed very clearly what I had intended to indicate to the House, and that is, that the most pernicious literature that is distributed in this country, and which purports to be an almanac, is distributed for next to nothing.  I think the Minister must have in his mind the actual publication that is in my mind at the moment.  It purports to be an almanac and is distributed for a penny or twopence.  It contains in every page the most atrocious advertisements.  It is distributed by people who do not receive in money for the books they purport to sell as much as would keep them in boots.  Therefore, there must be some sort of purpose behind that distribution.  I think <Col N="722" /> that Senator Sir John Keane is the last man in the world that would sanction anything like that, and yet if his amendment were accepted that would be sanctioned.  Therefore, I ask the Seanad not to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 16, sub-section (1).&mdash; After the word &ldquo;publish&rdquo; in line 23 to insert the words &ldquo;or import.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The class of books dealt with in this section are not printed in Ireland at all, so far as I am aware.  At least, I have never heard of any case of the kind.  They are all, or practically all, imported.  Yet in the section the word &ldquo;import&rdquo; does not appear at all.  I am not sufficiently well versed in the law to say whether actual importation is covered by the other words used in the section.  It seems to me that, in the particular circumstances, it would be advisable that we should expressly insert the word &ldquo;import.&rdquo;  I am confirmed in that view if I turn to Section 10, which is a similar kind of section.  It deals with an offence in relation to prohibited publications, that is, publications which are subject to prohibition orders.  The words in that section are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>It shall not be lawful for any person, otherwise than under and in accordance with a permit in writing granted to him under this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  to import into Saorstát Eireann for sale or distribution, and so on.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that, if the word is necessary in that section, it is equally if not more necessary in Section 16.  While on this subject, may I put this point to the Minister? There are three of these sections.  I suppose they would be called penal sections.  They are of a similar nature and deal with a similar class of offence.  The wording in all of them is different.  I have already referred to Section 10, which makes it illegal</P>
      <P>&ldquo;to import for sale or distribution or to sell or expose, offer, advertise or keep for sale or to distribute or offer or keep for distribution.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If one turns to Section 14, which deals with a slightly different kind of offence, we find it is provided&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="724" /> It shall not be lawful to print or publish or cause or procure to be printed or published in relation to any judicial proceedings,</P>
    <P>and so on.  Of course, that deals with newspapers.  There, again, a great many newspapers sold in this country are imported.  Yet the word &ldquo;import&rdquo; is not in that section at all.  Then we come on to Section 16.  This section makes it unlawful &ldquo;(a) to print or publish or cause or procure to be printed or published, or (b) to sell or expose, offer, or keep for sale, or (c) to sell, offer or keep for distribution.&rdquo; As I have said, the section does not include the word &ldquo;import&rdquo; nor does it include the word &ldquo;advertise&rdquo; which appears in Section 10. I really think that the word &ldquo;advertise&rdquo; should also come into this section.  I suggest to the Minister that he should consider the advisability of bringing the wording in these sections into some kind of uniformity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference which Senator Hooper has in mind is a difference which arises from the inherent difference in the subject matter.  When a book is put upon the censorship list, then it is perfectly clear and distinct that that book is condemned.  There can be no doubt about that.  You know it.  There is a more difficult case in Section 16.  A person may order a book without completely knowing what the nature of the book is.  If an attempt is made to bring it in, it would be stopped by the Customs authorities, but the individual importing it will not have the same sense of certainty as he would have in the other case.  With regard to a later amendment in the Senator's name, where he proposes to insert the word &ldquo;import,&rdquo; I think the word ought to be inserted there, but I do not think that in this section the word is necessary or is advisable.  There is considerable difficulty about it.  A person, say, coming into this country is committing a criminal offence if he has a book of this nature in his possession though he may not know it. Section 16 is a very drastic section. <Col N="725" /> The books will not even be on the published list, and if a person coming into the country had a book of this nature in his possession it would be very hard that he should suffer, not only the confiscation of the book, but that he would also be liable to prosecution.  In the other case, it will only be importing for sale or distribution.</P>
      <P>Under Section 10, if a person brings in a book as an ordinary reading book he only suffers the loss of the book.  I think if you were to insert the word &ldquo;import&rdquo; under Section 16, and that it then became a criminal offence to import, such a provision would be too drastic.  If a person had a book innocently in his possession, that he was simply bringing it in for his own reading and not for sale, and did not know that it was an offence to do so, it would be very hard, I think, if he were to be subjected to most drastic penalties.  I think that the confiscation of the book ought to be enough.</P>

If it is to be permissive for any person to bring in books of this nature, then it will be possible, for anyone who wants to do it, to bring in large numbers of them by giving a number of his friends a copy each.  A person engaged in the sale of this class of literature who wants to get books circulated through the country, could give one copy to one person and another copy to a second person, and so on, and get a large number in in that way.</P>

      <P>There is another aspect of this to be considered. Senator Hooper presumes that every book is a book which palpably and clearly would come under this condemnation, but there will be books in the region of doubt&mdash;a book which advocates, &ldquo;or which may reasonably be supposed to advocate,&rdquo;&mdash;and that immediately raises questions of doubt.  The importer of the book not knowing that it was likely to be condemned here, and that is not palpably and obviously of a character condemned by the section, would nevertheless make the traveller a criminal in the eyes of the Free State law.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 16, sub-section (1).  To add at the end of the sub-section the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided that no book or periodical publication shall be deemed to offend against this sub-section solely by reason of the fact that it contains an advertisement relating to a book or periodical publication the sale of which is unlawful under this Section.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had this amendment down on an earlier reading.  A similar amendment was moved in respect of Section 10.  The objection that was raised, and which the House accepted, was that the word &ldquo;advertise&rdquo; in sub-section 1 (b) could not be interpreted in the way my amendment presumed <Col N="728" /> with respect to Section 16.  The possibilities, and I think even more than the possibilities, are that journals of the kind I quoted on that occasion &mdash; the &ldquo;New Statesman,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Nation&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Spectator&rdquo;&mdash;might be reasonably supposed to advocate the unnatural prevention of conception by reason of the fact that they occasionally contain advertisements of books which are dealing with this subject and that quite clearly advocate the practice.  I feel it is desirable that the reading public in this country should not be prohibited from receiving and reading these very reputable journals because a magistrate may come to the conclusion that these journals may reasonably be supposed to advocate the unnatural prevention of conception by reason of the fact of these advertisements appearing in them.  I quoted an article in the &ldquo;New Statesman&rdquo; a few weeks ago by a well-known writer of social and medical topics, specially dealing with health, sunlight, and so on.  That article, while not dealing with this subject as a whole, in one paragraph of it did advocate this practice.  That article was in the body of the journal.</P>
    <P>In respect of that same issue there was published an advertisement of a series of books, one or two of which were dealing with the subject of birth control.  There is not the slightest question that any of these journals would, by the ordinary reader, be presumed to be pornographic, or susceptible of condemnation because of their advocacy of this practice.  I want to safeguard the reading public of this country against the prohibition of these journals. Therefore, I am asking the House to agree that &ldquo;no book or periodical publication shall be deemed to offend against this sub-section solely by reason of the fact that it contains an advertisement relating to a book or periodical publication, the sale of which is unlawful under this section.&rdquo;  In respect of books it is known that publishers do publish at the end of their books a list of other books that they have published in connection with <Col N="729" /> their business, and some of those books that they have in their lists may deal with and advocate this practice which is condemned by this Bill.  The mere advertisement of that should not be a sufficient cause for condemnation, and yet it is not at all unreasonable to suppose that a magistrate would decide there was an advocacy by virtue of the appearance of an advertisement of the kind I have named.  I want, therefore, as I have said, to safeguard the serious reading public of the country from a prohibition which is not intended by the Minister, and yet I think is liable to be effected if the Bill passes in its present form without some safeguard such as I have in my amendment.</P>

      <P>I have already expressed my view as to how the Act should be administered, and while I would not care to accept Senator Johnson's amendment precisely in its present form, I would suggest to him that he would consider the following amendment which I have drafted, and which I think would probably meet his views, and at the same time carry out the view I myself have expressed as to the way in which I think the Act ought to be administered, and putting explicitly what is implicitly in the Bill.  It would run:</P>
      <P>Section 16, sub-section (3).  To insert before the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  A book or periodical publication containing an advertisement relating to a book or periodical publication which advocates or might reasonably be supposed to advocate within the meaning of sub-section (1) of this section one or more of the matters mentioned in that sub-section shall not, by reason only of its containing such advertisement, be deemed itself to advocate any of such matters, provided such advertisement is inserted for reward and is not and could not reasonably be supposed to be itself an advocacy of any such matter.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="730" /> I think that no matter what the advertisement is like it would come under Senator Johnson's amendment. The amendment, I suggest, carries out my intention, and I think it meets what Senator Johnson requires.  If the advertisement is simply an advertisement, and not an advocacy, it would be covered by the words which I have inserted in the amendment: &ldquo;Provided such advertisement is inserted for reward.&rdquo;  I have considered the matter carefully and I shall explain the reason for these words.  If there is a bona fide advertisement, and the paper is acting bona fide in putting in the advertisement, that is one thing, but if you discover through the paper what appears not be a real bona fide advertisement, and if it is put in on every page through the paper, that might be said to be advocacy, but that could not be said if it is inserted in the ordinary way of business for reward and if it appeared only in one place in the paper.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it is fortunate that on the last occasion, in my opening statement on this Bill, the House was not sufficiently well attended to allow me to proceed to the Second Reading Stage.  I may repeat that the Bill is not a Party measure.  It has the assent, in its general purport, of representatives of various sections in the House.  I think it is one which will not excite violent opposition to its general principles.  I am very ready to admit the necessity for considerable amendment at later stages.  The Bill owes its origin to the Association of Architects of Ireland and the Royal Institution of Architects in Ireland, and is godfathered, if I might say so, by the Civic Institute of Ireland.  It has been on the stocks for several years, and, as a matter of fact, it is in some respects a little out of date, particularly in regard to the definition of local authorities.  There are one or two other matters which would require to be amended; but in its general purpose, and I think it is necessary to deal only with the general purpose and principle on this stage, I think the Bill ought to receive the assent of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill follows closely the British Act of 1925, which itself was a consolidating <Col N="732" /> Act embodying the provisions of two Acts, parts of Housing and Town Planning Acts of 1909 and 1919.  Neither of those Bills was applicable to Ireland.  Because of the non-applicability to Ireland of these Acts the position in this country is that there is no power in the hands of the local authorities, and none even in the hands of the Local Government Department, to control the course of development of our towns, the form or character or the shape they will take, or to insure that healthy growth will not be frustrated owing to the thoughtless or selfish anti-civic act of some shortsighted citizen or company.  The power of our local authorities with regard to control of building undertakings is limited to their compliance with public health requirements relating to sanitation, and to their structural stability.  Even the Corporation of Dublin, the Metropolitan City, except for the special provisions relating to the reconstruction of O'Connell Street, has no power to control the design or type of buildings in any of the streets.  I do not know whether Senators have read a number of articles recently published and signed &ldquo;H. T. O'R.&rdquo;, initials which will be recognised as those of a very responsible official. In one of these articles he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no power to prevent a ground floor on Fitzwilliam Square being converted into a butcher's shop.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And again:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no guarantee that a refuse destructor would not be built on the borders of a projected pleasure ground, or that smoking factories might not be erected inside a residential area.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Corporation of the future will see that the growth of the amenities of this city, or of any city, are entirely determined by the owner of the ground property, or the builder in the plan and design of the building.  I think there are very few who cannot point out instances where there have <Col N="733" /> been developments entirely nauseous and of an unpleasantly ugly character, and where there should have been provision made to preserve the amenities of the district.  I wish to emphasise that it is not merely to preserve amenities we desire in this Bill, perhaps at the loss of some valuable industries.  A town plan will set out to make the best provision possible for encouraging industry under the most economic conditions in the most suitable localities.  It would be a sad mistake if and when we are trying to popularise town planning, and are seeking the active co-operation of business men of all kinds, that by over insistence on the artistic values&mdash;the necessity for preserving amenities&mdash;we should create an impression that we might be retarding industrial activities. The contrary is the truth.  Town-planning may be said to be simply the exercise of thought and reason in the utilisation of a given area for any desired social and economic services, paying due regard to the maintenance of public health and social amenities, the progress of industries, and all other factors which help or retard the healthy growth of a civic community.</P>
    <P>I suppose we are all willing to admit that our towns have grown up in quite a haphazard way without regard to future development, and quite regardless as to whether there is a future convenience safeguarded, or whether future development in the way of industry, or shopping centres, or public parks, or residential areas are going to be affected by any particular action on the part of the builder or prospector. Some consider that town planning schemes are only necessary in the case of towns and cities growing, or which show signs of rapid development.  That may be the reason why the British Town Planning Acts did not apply to Ireland.  There is something in the point, but I want to emphasise that irrespective of whether a town is growing rapidly, or is likely to grow rapidly, it is very desirable we should have power placed in the <Col N="734" /> hands of local authorities, or in the absence of effective action taken by local authorities, ultimately in the hands of the Minister, to prevent towns and villages being made ugly.  Even though they are not developed, we should preserve whatever amenities there are and seek to remove excrescences which militate against the attractiveness of the countryside.  I think one might also point out that in respect of the larger towns a great deal of the present charges upon local authorities are consequent upon the improvements that have been decided upon, and which are made necessary by the absence of foresight in the years gone by.  If there had been such foresight and planning much of the compensation charges, which on the necessary changes that had to take place and that had to be paid for, would have been unnecessary.</P>
    <P>I take it that the House in the main will be agreed that we are likely to see certain developments in various parts of the country following upon economic changes, that is changes which will follow electrification, and which will necessarily follow upon the use of motor traction. These factors are undoubtedly going to influence one way or another the growth of towns&mdash;large or small&mdash;in various parts of the country. We must hope for the utilisation of electric power as a result of the development of the Shannon.  In some of the towns, to say the least, and perhaps in many of the towns, we will find enterprising men starting factories, large or small.  We desire that in such cases there shall be some provision, some kind of control, as to where these factories shall be built, and the kind of structures that will contain their machinery. It is obvious that there must be some check on the indiscriminate activities of enterprising men.  That would not mean militation against their enterprise, but rather a guiding of their activities.  With regard to the small towns, I think it is clearly desirable that any action taken upon the lines of this Bill should be of a very tentative kind indeed, and <Col N="735" /> should be simply restrictive, and not necessitating big schemes or even wide surveys.  In the larger towns there would be something more requisite than that.  It is presupposed that in the case of Dublin, Cork and Waterford, and perhaps in Limerick, you will have something in the nature of a survey before any town-planning scheme can be adopted.  In respect of Dublin and Cork surveys have been made, and the lines of the town plans are pretty clearly fixed in the minds of those who are active and thoughtful in these matters.  One knows that in Dublin they have gone a considerable distance in the direction of a town plan.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to explain at very great detail the various sections of the Bill.  It will be seen that a memorandum has been printed which summarises the sections, and that will shorten my task in explaining them on the Second Reading.  I would like to explain that the Bill is not obligatory on the local authorities, unless the Minister considers that circumstances warrant that he should order the local authorities to prepare a town planing scheme, but before issuing such an order to a public local authority an inquiry must be held.  In all these circumstances the initiative is left to the local authority, to local associations, business men and others, to encourage them to take steps to associate themselves with any scheme that is proposed.  As I have said, in respect of the larger towns a town planning scheme ought to be preceded by a civic survey.  That has been done in the case of Dublin and Cork.  A civic survey is necessary before any comprehensive plan for future development can be drawn. Such a plan must take into account every factor, social and economic, including the tendencies, and even the possibilities, of industrial growth or decline.  The Minister may direct that such a survey shall be made by any local authority within three years from August, 1929; but except in such cases as the Minister may <Col N="736" /> think well to use this power, the option lies with the local authority to make the survey.</P>
    <P>In practice I think it is likely to happen that the surveys that have been made for Dublin and Cork will be the basis of the town plan in respect of those cities.  In respect of the other large towns, Limerick and Waterford, possibly surveys may be taken before the three years will have expired.  That would be left to the Minister's discretion.  A local authority is defined in the Bill as &ldquo;the council of any borough or district council of any urban district or rural district, or the town commissioners of any town not being an urban district.&rdquo;  That is quite a faulty definition.  It might exclude the county borough councils of Dublin and Cork, which is obviously not intended.  There would need to be a definition bringing in the county council.  The faulty definition arises owing to the fact that it was drawn some years ago before the last Local Government Act was passed.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill a town planning scheme may be made in respect of land in course of development, or likely to be used for building purposes, and in respect of any area which has already been developed or built upon.  The original English Act was restricted to lands in course of development or likely to be built upon in the future.  An amendment to the English Act was made to conform to the United States practice and the practice in other countries, to extend it so as to cover areas already built upon.  It is provided later, in Section 7, that compensation shall be paid for losses consequent upon giving effect to a scheme.  On the other hand, where by the making of a town planning scheme any project is adjudged by the Commissioners of Valuation to be increased in value, the responsible authority shall be entitled to recover from any person whose property is so increased in value one-half the value of that increase.  That is not a novel provision. It is contained in the British and United States Acts, and other Acts in operation in the Dominions, <Col N="737" /> and I think also in continental countries. The betterment provision ought to be subject to alteration, but that is a Committee point.  A town planning scheme in respect of lands to be built upon, or already built upon, may be made with the general object of securing proper ways and communications, sanitary conditions, open spaces, amenity and convenience in connection with the laying out and use of land, and the scheme may provide for the demolition or alteration of any buildings within the area to be developed in so far as may be necessary for carrying this scheme into effect.</P>
    <P>Where the Minister for Local Government believes that on account of natural beauty or special architectural, historic or æsthetic interest attaching to a locality it is expedient to take steps to preserve the existing character or features of the locality, a town planning scheme may prescribe the space about buildings, the number of buildings, and the height and character of buildings; and in the first section there are numerous provisions regarding matters, which the Minister might prescribe as coming within the scope of the scheme.  There is also a provision that where two or more local authorities desire, they may act jointly in scheming for future development. That is an important provision, and it leads to a provision which I think should be inserted at a later stage, for what is called regional development, or regional planning, which may be more necessary where there was a growth of a district, where special factors affect the district.  Let us say in the County Wicklow, where something was required to deal with a particular area, the local authorities in that area could act together and plan for its regional development.  I emphasise this point, that no town planning scheme should have effect until it is approved by order of the Minister, but that, when approved by the Minister, it should have effect as if it were enacted in the Act.  There ought to be provided in the Bill, but I think it is omitted and I hope it will be inserted later, that any order <Col N="738" /> of this character made should be laid on the Table for discussion by the House.</P>
    <P>I again point out that the general control of procedure relating to town planning schemes lies with the Minister, including the power to proceed with a scheme in the case of default or of unreasonable delay on the part of the local authority.  He may also make regulations to secure the co-operation of owners of property and other persons interested in land proposed to be included in a scheme, and to secure that other councils which may be interested are duly informed of any proposals. The general plan is to endeavour to ensure local co-operation and local initiative in regard to town planning. It is also proposed, as is natural to a Bill promoted by the architects' profession, that the professional status of architects and engineers employed in the execution of schemes shall be safeguarded by prior consultation with their respective societies, the Association of Engineers on the one hand, and of Architects on the other.  That is a kind of trade union clause which may be a very good headline for future Bills of a similar nature, but which may not mean only professional associations.</P>
    <P>A valuable power is given by Section 6 to the responsible authorities in respect of advertisements which offend against the amenities of a district, or where open spaces are injured by the display of such advertisements.  In my opinion this section is rather too gentle in regard to advertisements on land relating solely to the trade carried on upon such land.  It does not allow interference for five years with any hoarding which existed at the time of the approval of the scheme. That, I think, is rather overgenerous to the offensive hoarding.</P>
    <P>I think I need not go into the provisions in very much more detail, but I would point out that there is a little doubt which has recently come to my notice as to whether the small towns would be able to make regulations in the absence of a formal town plan, and I would hope that <Col N="739" /> the House would agree to insert as an amendment a provision whereby, even in the absence of a formal town plan, a local authority would have power to prescribe the space about new buildings and such like things, and particularly to deal with obstructions, such as ruined houses, that are offensive to the locality and that clearly are detrimental to the general amenities of the district.  I think that anyone who travels through the country will have noticed very numerous unsightly destroyed areas.  Even a single destroyed building in a town through which a motor car is going gives a bad impression of that whole district to a visitor, and I think it could be very simply proscribed against and some improvement made in that respect.  So also in regard to unsightly advertisements and to that kind of ramshackle, jerry-built corrugated iron structure placed at the end of a rather handsome bridge, utterly destroying the beauty and attractiveness of the locality.  Power to proscribe that kind of thing ought certainly to be given to the local authority, and such power ought to be given, even without the necessity for a formal survey and a town plan. If it is found on examination that the Bill does not include these powers, I hope the House will agree to insert them.</P>
    <P>I ask the House, therefore, to give formal approval to the Second Reading, and I hope that the Minister for Local Government and his Department will give sympathetic approval, criticism, and perhaps co-operation in the final drafting of this Bill.  If the Second Reading is passed I would ask the House to send the Bill to a Special Committee for close examination.  I might express here the thought that if our proposal of some months ago to have a draftsman made available to the House had been carried into effect it would have eased the work of drafting and making water-tight and satisfactory a Bill of this kind. In the meantime, I think the Bill is a foundation upon which a good town planning Act can be built.  I <Col N="740" /> hope that the House will give it hearty approval and will set itself out to make a workmanlike job of a Bill dealing with this very important subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. Gogarty Dr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second the motion.  I must congratulate Senator Johnson on bringing forward this Bill, which is a very great need to this country, and particularly to our own city.  This is a Bill that may be considered from two aspects. The objection to it, of course, from the local authorities' point of view, and from the point of view of the Central Fund, would be that there is no money at our disposal to carry it into effect.  But it will not cost any money to prevent the erection of unsightly buildings and the removal of modern unsightly ruins. This country seems to preserve the most uninteresting remains and to allow those which are of historic interest to fall into decay.  When one goes down streets in this city one sees that progress is represented by the improvements of the shops, but from a certain point of view a city is a shop, and anything that prevents its development raises the price of food by reason of the cost of distribution.  Therefore the planning of Dublin according to the needs that have arisen from modern conditions, such as making convenient the port of collection and embarkation for cattle, the straightening of streets, the clearing of dilapidations and the possible linking-up of railways or linking them up with buses, is very necessary.  But it is absolutely necessary to make a law in order to bring any improvement into effect, and I pity the country if it is to be left to the unguided aesthetic sense of any of the local authorities, because there is nothing more terrible than local taste.  This city represents the most varied architectural experiments and the most unvaried failures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want some centralising, first of all from the point of view of the city's utility; secondly, from the point of the city's health; and, thirdly, from the point of view of aesthetics.  It will be very difficult <Col N="741" /> to combine these three things.  The greatest of these is, of course, health, because it may be considered that if you put people to live in certain overbuilt sites, you are putting humanity into a kind of mincing machine out of which neither good health nor good citizenship can come.</P>
    <P>I did not read the whole Bill, nor was I present for Senator Johnson's exposition of it, but it is very necessary that a good deal of power should be relegated to those who are to carry out any town planning.  I had the pleasure of sitting on the Greater Dublin Commission, and many things arose before it which showed the need that exists for a central directing authority.  There is not the least chance for this city to develop on any lines other than those already laid down by the position of the sewers. the light mains and the water mains.  If you want to be prophetic, you take the map and you ask: &ldquo;Where is the drain? Where is the electricity supply? and that is the way the city must go&mdash;in the shape of a forked stick.</P>
    <P>To direct the preparation of virgin land for building means that the authority will have to provide public utility services first before the houses are built.  That is a very simple thing, but it is very important because it is putting the horse before the cart.  Up to this the other way was the usual way.  If the city is to develop you will have to prepare land for housing before the houses are built, because there is not the least chance that any speculative builder will build houses where he has probably a mile to go to reach the water supply or the sewerage system.  It is too great an expense, and it would fall on the private experimental builder.  The central authority and town planner must provide the roads and the mains in those parts of the county into which it is proposed to extend the city.</P>
    <P>A decision should be arrived at to prevent certain parts of this city carrying any more structures.  I suppose there has been no reputable building in the city since about the <Col N="742" /> time of the Seven Years' Wars of Pitt, when structures like this House were built, structures in which we perhaps take a pride but for which we honestly cannot take credit. There was once in this city a sense of citizenship, and it was expressed by one of the most magnificent plans of any city in Europe, because when old Dublin was laid down between its North and its South Circular Roads it was then the seventh city in Christendom.  It was a finer city than Paris, which was not built as we know it now before Napoleon's time.  But the grand old Dublin has fallen away.  The old houses of the people who had a sense of pride and continuity have now become a mockery, because each room in them has to shelter a family or two families, and in some cases each corner of a room is sheltering a family.  There are 52,000 people in this city at present sheltering in what were the salons of the eighteenth century, in rooms which are worse than any other slum dwellings in England or Scotland, simply because where there are slum dwellings in Scotland or England they exist for the most part in houses which were built for that purpose&mdash;tenement houses with water and sanitary accommodation on each floor.  So that I think, urgently to relieve existing conditions, it is very necessary to pass such a Bill as this rapidly and to put it into effect without delay.</P>
    <P>I am not going into statistics of public health, because there are people here more competent to do so than I, but they largely depend on the fact that if you consider the subsoil as one of the factors in influencing health, there are certain parts of the city in which buildings should be prohibited and where any human beings should not live.  Proper subsoil is a very important requisite for health, and there are certain parts of Dublin where no dwellinghouses ought to be.  This city was founded by Danish merchants whose boats could not go up the river any further. There was a Danish stone erected where College Street joins Brunswick Street.  That was the beginning <Col N="743" /> of the city, and it was a haphazard maritime experiment.  Up and down the river the commerce came.  The city was founded because it was the only avenue for merchandise by water, and into the river the effluvium of the city went.  And idiot man went on thinking it was a very satisfactory way of draining.</P>
    <P>The first consideration of a city is the health of the city.  Secondly, the city as a market or a shop.  The reason there is a city at all is that populations tend to concentrate about a market, but if the city is not planned adequately to meet modern requirements of transportation, on which, after all, the success of production depends, that production is useless if it cannot be transmitted. It raises the prices of commodities and the cost of living to everybody in the city and in the surrounding country which is served by the city. Therefore, from the second point of view it is very necessary to have the city well planned.  If the findings of the Greater Dublin Commission are considered together with this Bill and we make up our minds to hand over to some competent authority drastic powers, which will involve the destruction of buildings, the making of assessments dealing with land misers who live near the city and who will sit tight when there is a possibility of a building future on their land, we will have to hand over to the town planner, if this is to be effective, the power to strike rates in view of the possible enhancement of these lands.  This was in an English Bill, but it was not put into effect.  It was provided that if one were to take land at such a place as Cabra, or out towards Raheny, where there is a good deal of development, or on the Naas road, all that empty land would be rateable as if it had been already built upon, so that no man could hold up the development of the city by asking a preposterous price for his land.</P>
    <P>In the city there are many places covered by hoardings where demands for completely uneconomic <Col N="744" /> and unreasonable prices are preventing the development of street corners.  I need not name them, because it might be invidious and the landlords might be known, but there are two or three corners in the very centre of the city which cannot be developed because the landlords have become land misers. So that we must be prepared to give extremely drastic rights to those in authority if the Bill is to be effective.</P>
    <P>As the Bill could be employed to destroy ugliness and remove plague centres, money difficulties cannot be pleaded against such a highly necessary thing.  This Bill is a good Bill, even if it were only used to take away and not to build.  As one of the people who may be looked upon as foolish to risk a prophecy, I will confine myself merely to stating what has happened in other countries fifty years ago.  By that means I will become a prophet in this country&mdash;while remaining a backwoodsman in others.  I think it will be necessary to make a rule that every modern house that is built to house a family of over two or three must be surrounded by a certain amount of ground&mdash;one-fifth of an acre as a minimum&mdash;that we will no longer economise at the expense of the health of the children by building half a street, say, out in Rathfarnham. Children are taken out now and compelled to live in a half slum stuck out in the country.  In Germany one realises that the two greatest civilising factors are the cheapness of timber and the cheapness of light.  The cheapness of timber provides a house of five or six rooms; it gives the mother of the house a drawing-room where her household gods may be kept; it permits the segegration of the sexes and gives children rooms to be taught in, and for the price we are haggling over in Dublin we could provide homes that would produce enlightened and healthy children, with ground for gardens, which would be cheaper and let at an economical rent if built on virgin soil than on the expensive and congested central sites in the city.  If there is anything in <Col N="745" /> the Darwinian question of the influence of environment on character and health, a Housing Bill such as this is the very beginning of usefulness and enlightenment for this country. You can always make an assessment of the future capacity and the worth of any citizens by knowing whether they live in a hovel or in a house.</P>
    <P>Through no fault of our own, this city is criticisable on account of the condition of its slums.  This condition arose because householders who used to live in the cities now prefer to live outside, and Dublin is at present going through a transitional period; it is empty at the heart on account of the ease of transportation. I think it will be realised by anybody who is given authority that unless this Bill becomes only a pious aspiration, it will be necessary to limit the number of people dwelling in certain areas, and that means zoning.  I am not going to forecast what the Bill will be; I am only going to ask the House strongly to support it as a very excellent measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a principle in this Bill to compel local authorities to carry out a civic survey of their areas, and the expense will be provided altogether by the local people.  We have often heard complaints that the liberties of local authorities in transacting the business they have been elected to transact have been very much restricted lately, and that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health practically has power to compel them to do what he likes.  Section 1 of the Bill makes it practically mandatory on the local authority to prepare a civic survey scheme on an order from the Minister.  There is a clause in the Bill by which he can by mandamus compel them to do so. I think we are acting on a wrong principle in bringing compulsion into this Bill.  By leaving it voluntary to each local authority to make a civic survey or not as they think best would be quite sufficient for the present.  If I agree to a Second Reading for the Bill, I will certainly <Col N="746" /> put an amendment down to strike out the compulsory clause.  I also fear that all these restrictions will have an effect on building operations, that people inclined to erect buildings in towns will seriously consider the provisions of this Bill, and as to how they might be affected by them.  I find that there is even power in the Bill to demolish buildings if they stand in the way of a scheme.  Mention has been made of smoke from factories.  In my opinion we have not sufficient smoke from factories.  No matter where they are situated, I think no obstacle should be put in the way of people promoting industries.</P>
      <P>As regards the erection of ugly houses, I maintain that there are not sufficient houses being erected, no matter whether they are ugly or otherwise.  In the Preamble of the Bill it is proposed to provide reservations in towns for agriculture.  I was at a loss to determine what that means unless it refers to markets for agricultural produce.  That might be the intention, but my experience of cities is that markets for agricultural produce are generally closed up whenever there is an opportunity to do so.  A cattle market is regarded as a nuisance.  I know towns where cattle markets have been done away with.  In other places, people living near shipping yards have objected to the bellowing of the cattle going to the boats in the morning, and if they had their way there would be no shipping at all.  Instead of removing their residences from the quayside to some other part of the city, they want to prevent cattle from being driven to the boats.  Different people have different ideas as to what scenery and beauty are.  I think nothing should be done to do away even with smoking factories or any other buildings that would give employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a new definition in the Bill of potential building ground which ought to be studied very carefully, as we have another Act whereby certain tenants were deprived of the benefits of land purchase owing to their lands being described as having <Col N="747" /> a potential value as building ground.  Section 2 (7) says:</P>
    <P>The expression &ldquo;land likely to be used for building purposes&rdquo; shall include any land likely to be used as, or for the purpose of providing open spaces, roads, streets, parks, pleasure or recreation grounds...</P>
    <P>Under the Land Act of 1927 it was provided that unless the owner appeals within a certain number of years land that has been reserved as having a potential value as building ground will revert to the occupier.  Under this Bill if he converts a field into a pleasure-ground, it might be a pleasure-ground for himself only, because it is not stated that it should be a pleasure-ground for the public.  He might keep cattle in that field and say: &ldquo;This is building ground,&rdquo; and under the definition of building ground in the 1927 Act the land could not go back to the tenant.  Even in the appointment of an architect to prepare a civic survey the local authority cannot appoint anyone they like.  They must appoint someone who will be sanctioned by the Society of Architects.</P>

      <P>I think that Senator Linehan has really expressed the view of the social backwoodsman in opposition to the Bill.  I do not imagine he is expressing his own views, but possibly the views of the opposition which he feels will exist.  In effect he says: &ldquo;We have only a few factories.  Therefore, why not put them into the principal streets, or if they do not want to go to the principal streets, by all means let them go into residential areas.&rdquo;  I think the answer is that we have so few factories that there is absolutely no justification whatever for dumping them down in residential areas when we have in most cities proper places for such factories.  He says that we have so few houses that we are entitled to have them as ugly as we like.  I think the scarcity of houses is no justification for deliberately inflicting <Col N="748" /> on us ugly and insanitary houses.</P>
      <P>The Senator sees a grievance in the fact that while fairs are now held in what are called the main streets of the towns, they may in future have to be held in fields outside the towns.  I would like to see that proposal developed. I know towns and some fairly important towns outside of which there are fair greens, good sized fields, where the fairs could be held, but the townspeople insist that at least every alternate fair must be held in the main streets, because if held in the field one section of the publicans will have an undue advantage, so that they bring the cattle to their very doors and have filth all about them.  I had the experience in a town on one occasion of having a two-year old heifer walking into a room.  The shop doors and the hotel doors are open and, in the crush the cattle sometimes run behind counters and even make their way upstairs. That is the state of affairs that the Senator wants perpetuated. It is a relic of barbarism, and I think that any Bill that would help to get rid of conditions of that kind should be encouraged.  The suggestion that no compulsion should be put on local authorities is also one that I could not agree with.  If local authorities would pay more attention to matters of this kind, and devote less time to debating snowball resolutions about things that do not concern them at all, it would be better for the local authorities and better for the districts concerned.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Johnson's adaptation of the British Town-Planning Bill, which I understand this Bill to be, is a necessary piece of legislation which has been deferred all too long, and which can only in part rectify the many atrocities which unconsidered construction has produced in our towns in the past, and which are being produced at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are various points in the Bill which seem to be either capable of amendment or improvement, or which are not entirely clear, and which the Senator perhaps may be <Col N="749" /> able to explain to us.  For instance, the Preamble and Sections 1 and 15 refer to the development of municipal areas by local authorities, and define these bodies for the purposes of the Bill.  No development plan appears to be contemplated for smaller towns.  I mean the smaller towns slightly bigger than villages that serve as agricultural distributing centres and are directly administered by the County Council.  Many of these are a hundred years behind the times, and are a disgrace to any civilised country from the artistic point of view.  They are lacking in sanitation and other amenities.  I wonder whether the Senator meant that their development was to be left to the County Councils.  In the hands of a great many of these bodies, I think these places will remain as they are, and I think that some special provision for that particular class of town should be made.  Section 2 (3) seems to me to be rather drastic, and indicates access to the Minister by any person prior to action by the local body. Sub-section (6) of the same section is a very necessary power, but variation is a very dangerous thing.  It leads to delay, and again I think the Bill will not go as far as it is expected to go.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to see that Section 9 refers to the character of the building to be erected.  The want of imagination on the part of individuals, on the part of the Board of Works, and on the part of the Local Government Board in the past was deplorable, and even to-day we see under various loans financed by the Government good houses being built, good houses, but entirely inartistic, when, without any appreciable increase in cost, quite picturesque dwellings might be erected that people would look at twice instead of saying, &ldquo;How very ugly they are.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 12 (3) deals with cases where County Councils are to act in place of other local bodies.  In theory that is correct, but when you come to put it into practice little will be done, and whatever is done <Col N="750" /> will be done by the permanent officials. In the same sub-section the Senator is creating an advisory committee.</P>

      <P>Section 12, sub-section (3).  The Senator is creating an advisory body, and I think it is of such importance as possibly to merit a section to itself.  I feel that its enlargement to something of a great national character should be considered before we have finished with this Bill.  I think this is a very important piece of legislation, because I believe that the mode of living of the people, or of any section of the people, is a most important factor in the development of a civic spirit. When it becomes law, if this measure is energetically worked, I think it will take this country a long step forward.</P>

      <P>I wish to express my hearty desire that this Bill should be carried through at the earliest possible moment.  It is of such supreme importance to the country that it has my most cordial support.  I think that no one can move about Ireland without feeling that legislation similar to this is absolutely necessary, not only in the interests of our large communities, but in the interests of the villages. We have only to look about our own suburbs to see the need for control. I do not wish that anyone outside Ireland would imagine that town-planning is an entirely new operation here.  We have a very remarkable example of town-planning in Dublin itself.  One hundred and seventy years ago, I think, the Wide Streets Commission was formed by the Irish Parliament.  It was given really town-planning powers, and the results, which are known to us, are remarkable.  Parliament Street was their first great operation, connecting Essex Bridge with the present City Hall.  Then followed Dame Street, what is now called O'Connell Street, but which was formerly known as Sackville Street, Westmoreland <Col N="751" /> Street and D'Olier Street, all constructed by this independent body, formed by Act of Parliament, an unpaid Commission, which, for some sixty years or so, carried on operations through the city to its very great advantage.  The source of their revenue, as most of you know, was a tax on imported coal, which ceased about the free trade period, and they then ceased operations. I think 1/- a ton was charged, and that was one of the chief sources of revenue for the reconstruction of these streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I wish specially to draw the attention of the promoters of this Bill to is that I think it is not merely a question of the architectural adornment of the city and so forth, but that there is a more difficult problem involved.  I missed reference to it in the Bill.  I hope that the promoters will see that any authority which may be set up to carry out these great powers will also keep in view the question of lines of communication.  One blot that occurs to me is a striking one which may also have occurred to others.  It was my privilege some fifty years ago to be engaged on the design of the present O'Connell Bridge.  Long negotiations proceeded before it was decided to remove Carlisle Bridge, which was about sixty feet wide.  For some years it was recognised that we were dealing with a problem which the Wide Street Commissioners had left, as it were, unfinished, and it was finally decided that O'Connell Bridge should be the full width of O'Connell Street, that it should embrace the two great streets, Westmoreland Street and D'Olier Street, and that the bridge should be divided into two roadways, as continuations of these streets.  That I believe to have been a thoroughly sound proposition from the town planning point of view, and for many years it has worked well on those lines.  But now we see parts of that great bridge utilised for parking motor cars.  I submit that that is a traffic proposition which must be dealt with in any town <Col N="752" /> planning.  Questions of bridge accommodation and so forth must be brought under the same control as the mere buildings in the streets.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that this Bill will pass, amended very considerably, I have no doubt.  I hope that whoever is put in authority will keep in mind the two great problems, not merely the ornamentation of the city and its architectural features, but also the question of traffic, which are now involved.</P>

      <P>As an ideal to be aimed at, I am sure that all Senators will approve of this Bill and will hope that it will receive its Second Reading.  But there are certain points that I think we shall have to consider if we are not to allow the ideal to override the practical.  When I heard Senator The McGillycuddy refer to some central body that is going to lay down canons of taste, I must say that I felt rather appalled, because my recollection goes back to our Victorian grandparents, who put priceless articles of Chippendale into back rooms, where they were badly treated, and which have only been recovered in comparatively recent years.  There are no greater offenders, in the opinion of some people and in the opinion of subsequent generations, than architects themselves, and I will never be persuaded that because an architect says a thing is beautiful it is beautiful.  I should be very sorry to see any architect, however eminent, being allowed to dictate to any individual what design or what type of building he should spend money on.  I am rather alarmed lest we should run away with the opinion that there can be any simple rule as to what is good or bad.  I am also a little alarmed lest in their enthusiasm the promoters of this Bill force the pace.  I think that Senator The McGillycuddy thought it would not be at all satisfactory to leave the matter in the hands of the local authorities, that he considered <Col N="753" /> the county councils not to be suitable. There again I cannot agree.  They may be slow, but they are the elected representatives of the people.  If they are slow, educate them to act more quickly, but you should not say to them from the Olympian heights: &ldquo;Out you go.  We will do it better; we will do the work that you yourself should do at less expense.&rdquo;  Perhaps I am unduly suspicious.  I do not know if the compensation clauses in this Bill follow in every respect the compensation clauses of the English Act&mdash;not that that would satisfy me entirely&mdash;but I know that they have been fairly generous in the matter of compensation, and rightly so.</P>
      <P>What is the point of recovering in the case of improved property half the increased value?  Picture what that will mean.  A house may be improved to the extent of £200 or £300 in the opinion of an arbitrator. That house is probably the owner's only asset.  It is not liquid, but you are to recover £100 from the owner of that house.  He may have no liquid assets at all, and it may be impossible for him to pay except by selling his house.  That is a proposition which I would not stand for, and which I hope the House will not assent to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is requisite that I should deal in detail with any of the points raised, as they are mainly Committee points which will undoubtedly be subjected to a great deal of consideration.  I think Senator Sir John Keane will be satisfied, if he refers to the British Town Planning Act of 1925, that the provisions of this Bill are very much the same as those of that Act.  They may require to be altered here, one way or the other, to suit Irish conditions and Irish views in regard to the amount of compensation that should be paid for disturbance, and so on, but that again, I think, is a Committee point. The only point that I think I need refer to is one raised by Senator The McGillycuddy, who appeared to overlook certain statements that I made with regard to the power of <Col N="754" /> the local authority, and certain defects which I think are in the Bill as drafted regarding the local authority.  Rural councils do not exist outside County Dublin, and the county councils have taken their place.  I am not quite sure whether the Bill is properly drafted in that respect, but it is undoubtedly desirable that the local authority, whether it is the rural council, as in County Dublin, the urban council in the smaller towns, or failing them, the county council, should be empowered&mdash;and I would go so far as to say required, if the Minister can make a case, after public inquiry&mdash; to remove certain local defects and local obstructions&mdash;shall I say scabs on the face of the town?&mdash;and that something like decency and attractiveness should be sought for.  But I do not want to lead the Seanad astray by the assumption that the design of this Bill was to take powers out of the hands of the local authorities; the desire is rather to stimulate the interest of local authorities. It may be necessary to do that by means of some kind of central body, and I hope that that central body will largely be a voluntary body, stimulating public interest in these things.</P>
      <P>The very fact that Dublin and Cork, our two largest cities, have already shown sufficient interest to have civic surveys made with a view to town plans is an indication of what is desired, but notwithstanding that desire, that obvious earnestness in the matter, they have no power at present.  What we want to give is power to complete the work which voluntary and local enthusiasm has initiated, to stimulate similar initiation in other places, and to have power to give effect to the schemes which local initiation has provided. I thank the Seanad for the interest it has shown and the support it has given up to this to the Bill.  I hope that a serious effort will be made to remove defects and to make the Bill a perfect piece of legislation in Committee and in further stages.</P>
