    <P>The Seanad went into Committee.</P>
    <P>Sections 1 and 2 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 3 (1) AND (2).</P>
    <P>(1) The Minister may by order authorise the grant of pensions, allowances, or gratuities to widows to whom this section applies and may by any such order regulate and appoint the rates and scales of such pensions, allowances, and gratuities, and the conditions under which the same are to be payable, and may by any such order prescribe the penalties for any fraudulent conduct in relation to an application for any such pension, allowance, or gratuity.</P>
    <P>(2) No order made under this section shall come into operation unless and until it has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and approved by resolution of Dáil Eireann, and when considering any such resolution Dáil Eireann shall duly consider any recommendation which shall have been previously made by Seanad Eireann in respect of such Order.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 3, sub-section (1).  To delete all after the word &ldquo;payable&rdquo; in line 16 down to the end of the sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The words referred to are as follows: &ldquo;and may by any such order prescribe the penalties for any fraudulent conduct in relation to an application for any such pension, allowance, or gratuity.&rdquo;  It is announced that this has been certified as a Money Bill.  Sub-section (1) gives power to the Minister to do certain <Col N="462" /> things by order in relation to pensions to widows of ex-R.I.C. men.  It is possible by the words which I have read out for the Minister by such Order to prescribe penalties for fraudulent conduct.  It seems to me that to allow an order to be made by the Minister to prescribe penalties for fraudulent conduct is going beyond the limits of what should be done by order.  Senators are familiar with the very considerable dissatisfaction that there has been of recent years, not only in this country but more particularly elsewhere, as to the growth of legislation by order, and this is an illustration of the way in which the practice grows of allowing what are, in fact, legislative enactments to slip through by the order of a Minister.  One cannot consider this particular amendment without having regard to the next sub-section. I would point out that the order the Minister may make in sub-section (1) to prescribe penalties for fraudulent conduct, by sub-section (2) would not be subject to consent, approval or ratification by the Seanad, so that, in fact, if the Bill passes in its present form the Minister is in a position to make an order prescribing penalties for fraud, without any assurance&mdash;the mere possibility, but certainly no assurance&mdash;that the order will be ratified by the formal approval of the Dáil.  It will be noted&mdash;I do not want to enlarge upon this part of it &mdash;that in the latter part of sub-section (2) the Seanad may have an opportunity of making a recommendation to the Dáil in respect of such an order, but I am contending that an order which prescribes the penalties for fraudulent conduct should come within the range of legislation, that it should not be even possible for it to pass into legal force without at least the formal approval of the Seanad.  It is pointed out that this is a Money Bill under the Constitution, and it may be pointed out&mdash;I am sure it will be pointed out&mdash;that the Principal Act, of which this is an amendment, also contains similar provisions, and that the provisions to which I am now drawing attention are merely repetitions <Col N="463" /> of such provisions, which are contained in the Principal Act.  The Principal Act was passed in 1923, and I may say, in passing, that it came to the Seanad, and with a few words of explanation by the President, passed, without any consideration, through all its stages in about five minutes.  But it happened that quite by accident I noted that in the discussion on the Committee Stage of the Principal Act I adverted to the point I am now drawing attention to in respect to making provision by order prescribing penalties for fraudulent conduct.  I said:</P>
    <P>That, I think, goes beyond what should be allowed by an order.  I would imagine that the ordinary law against endeavouring to obtain money by false pretences is quite strong enough without empowering the Minister for Finance to prescribe such penalties in an order.  I wonder whether sufficient consideration has been given to this sub-section.  I think it is too much power to authorise in this way, to give the Minister power to make an order prescribing the penalty.</P>
    <P>It is not particularly my own statement, which was evidently made without very much pre-consideration, that I wish to call attention to, but to that of the President, who said:</P>
    <P>In the absence of any particular information from the Attorney-General, I should say that in such cases there are prescribed penalties for infringing any pensions laws, but this is a new pensions law, and it is quite possible that, owing to the peculiar circumstances of it, that it might be open to abuse, and as such there might be a difficulty in prosecuting a person who had taken advantage of it and by fraudulent misrepresentation made a case for a pension, so that I take it the reason was that, it being special legislation dealing with a special class, unless provision were made for imposing such penalties, it would not be possible to prosecute a person for making <Col N="464" /> fraudulent representations in connection with it.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone will assert that that was a very satisfactory or convincing explanation of the reason for this provision being inserted. The fact remains that it was inserted, and that no further discussion took place upon it.  The matter was not pursued.  I draw attention to the fact that that was in 1923, when a great many things were occupying the minds of Deputies, Senators and Ministers, and that many things were allowed to pass which, in normal times, would have been objected to. Now that we are in normal times, I hope, here we have an attempt to repeat what I consider to be an extension of the powers of the Minister beyond what is reasonable, and I am, therefore, moving that the sub-section should be amended by the deletion of these words.  I will reserve any further comment in regard to the effects of sub-section (2) until the amendment in that regard is moved. I should say that while that particular provision in the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923, was inserted, a later Act, the Gárda Síochána Act, Section 8, dealing with pensions, also contained a provision of a similar kind, and this is the point I want to note, that Section 8 (2) of the Gárda Síochána Act, 1924, provides that no such order shall come into operation until it has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and approved by resolution of each of such Houses.  That makes a very considerable difference in the position of the Seanad in regard to such an order.  Whatever we may say regarding the advisability of giving powers to prescribe penalties to a Minister, it, at least, secured that such order would not come into effect until it had the formal approval of both Houses.  In the case in question there is no provision suggesting that formal approval will be required before an order of the kind comes into effect.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to resist the passing of this amendment.  I am not sure that <Col N="465" /> we could let the Bill pass without any penalty provisions, but I am inclined to agree that, at any rate, the wording of the Bill, as it stands, is wider than it need be, and, if this recommendation is passed by the Seanad, and I find it possible to devise a different wording, I could have that adopted as an alternative in the Dáil.  For that reason I do not resist the recommendation.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister is taking the attitude that he has just stated towards this amendment. I think this amendment taken with the section raises a pretty important point.  This House has, to the best of my recollection, maintained as far as it possibly could the principle that it claims the same right as the Dáil in the matter of orders, except where the order is purely a money matter.  If a Bill has been certified as a Money Bill we have not objected in the only way that was open to us.  If we see something in it which provides for the making of orders by the Minister on matters which are not strictly money matters, this House should have the same powers of refusing the order as the Dáil.  I think the two amendments taken together raise a question of considerable importance, and I am in substantial agreement with Senator Johnson, but I think, at the same time, if the Minister had not adopted the attitude that he has towards the first amendment we could hardly have pressed him, as I think some such provision with regard to penalties is essential.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Senator who has just spoken.  I would like to impress further this argument on the Seanad that the section as it stands is framed so as to authorise the Minister to pass penal legislation.  I am glad the matter has been adverted to, because I think it enables us to call attention in a very pointed way to a very great defect in modern legislation, namely, that it tends towards bureaucracy, towards giving legislative power to Ministers and secretaries of Ministers and officials in the <Col N="466" /> offices.  I think that when a citizen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am surprised at Senator Gogarty pulling his shield over the Minister.  I think it is highly undesirable that any person should be brought before a court of justice and tried in respect of disobedience of a regulation made by a Minister, even though it is a regulation under an Act of Parliament. That is what would happen if this section stands.  I am glad the Minister agreed to reconsider the matter, and when he does reconsider it, I hope he will be able to put into the section the exact offences that are contemplated, so that persons who break the law may be tried under the words of the statute, and not of any regulation.</P>

      <P>Whatever the Minister for Finance does with the wording of the amendment, that can be discussed on the Report Stage, but Deputy Johnson has raised a very important issue, and I think it well that the Seanad should take note of the fact.  The position is this: that whenever a Money Bill, in the opinion of the Seanad, interferes with the liberty of the subject, the Seanad is bound to take whatever means it can to defeat that object. Senator Johnson has raised this point at a very appropriate time, and I hope that the precedent we are now setting will be borne in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>Section 3, sub-section (2).  To delete all after the word &ldquo;of&rdquo; in line 22 down to the end of the sub-section and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;both Houses.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to bring the provision into line with <Col N="467" /> legislation in respect to the Gárda Síochána pensions, under the Gárda Síochána Act, rather than into line with the provisions of the Superannuation and Pensions Act: &ldquo;That is to say, that no order made under this section shall come into operation unless and until it has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and approved by resolution of both Houses.&rdquo;  That would be the effect of the sub-section as amended, and it seeks to delete the provision in the draft which says: &ldquo;that such order shall be made by resolution of Dáil Eireann, and when considering any such resolution Dáil Eireann shall duly consider any recommendation which shall have been previously made by Seanad Eireann in respect of such order.&rdquo;  I am afraid I am not content to accept the view of Senator Douglas, that the provision of the Constitution regarding Money Bills must be held to apply to orders made in respect of money matters.  Unfortunately the powers given to the Minister to make orders empower him to include many things.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, I did not say that.  What I said was that this House, to the best of my recollection, insisted in every case, except where it was a matter of money, where they were not in a position to insist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it, then, that Senator Douglas is not necessarily approving of the contention that an order which is consequent upon a Bill, which has been declared by the Ceann Comhairle to be a Money Bill, must necessarily be removed from the jurisdiction of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Not necessarily.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>An order made while purporting to affect the imposition of taxes, if that were possible, but certainly the appropriation of moneys, might also bring conditions, and certainly these conditions ought not, in my view, be removed from the jurisdiction of the Seanad simply because the original Bill under which <Col N="468" /> the order was made was declared to be a Money Bill.  If one reads sub-section (2) carefully one will find that in addition to the objection I have mentioned it would be quite possible for the Dáil to approve of an order before the Seanad had an opportunity to make a recommendation, and in such a case the Seanad recommendation would be of no effect whatever.  I am seeking to delete all the words in the last four lines of the sub-section, and to ensure that any order, before it comes into effect, made under this Bill, shall be approved by resolution of both Houses.  That would bring the provision regarding this class of pension into exact line with the provision regarding the pensions of the Gárda Síochána under the Gárda Síochána Act of 1924.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the comments of Senator Johnson in reference to this section are deserving of serious consideration.  I think both these amendments, from the point of view of liberty and constitutional right, are very valuable.  I do not wish, on a Bill like this, to raise any great question of controversty, but I would like the Minister to understand that sub-section (2) of section 3 is, in my opinion, very bad from a constitutional point of view.  I do not know whether Senator Johnson wishes to press his amendment.  I imagine that it would be best, having made that recommendation, and having made our protest, to leave it to the Minister to consider this matter very seriously before the Bill comes on again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not as much influenced by what Senator Johnson has said on this amendment as by what he said on the other.  It seems to me that when we are dealing with an order or a regulation which is a financial order or regulation, and which is of such a character that if the substance of it were embodied in a Bill it would be a Money Bill, it is not desirable, on the whole, that such an order should require the positive concurrence of the Seanad before it would become effective.  As a matter of fact, I think it would be <Col N="469" /> a somewhat absurd position if we had legislation which, for convenience and for the saving of time, enabled certain things to be done by order, that it should be possible for the Seanad to impose an absolute veto on these matters, whereas if the same things were done by way of a Bill the Bill would be a Money Bill, and the right of the Seanad would be the right only to make recommendations.  I do not think that any very definite line has been taken in framing legislation on matters of this sort.  In certain cases it has been provided that the order or regulation must be approved by the Seanad.  In other cases, certainly in the Principal Act, which this is amending, it was provided that the order should be approved by the Dáil, but that recommendations made by the Seanad should be considered.  It seems to me that matters of this character are very closely analogous to the voting of supplies, and are the kind of matters for which the Seanad need not take responsibility.  I do not think that any good purpose would be served by the adoption of the amendment suggested by Senator Johnson.  I certainly think that, so far as these regulations that are contemplated under this Bill are concerned, it is most desirable that they should be made in the same way as the orders made under the Principal Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister has missed the essential feature of this.  There is nothing in any legislation, or in any Standing Order, so far as I know&mdash;and Standing Orders have not the effect of legislation &mdash;to ensure that the order will only contain matters dealing with money under the definition of Article 35.  If the Minister were to insert in this Bill, for instance, a provision such as is in the Constitution regarding the certification of the Ceann Comhairle, I could understand the logic of his case, and I think I could agree with it.  But we have no assurance but that the Dáil would approve of an order made by the Minister for Finance which went outside the definition of a Money Bill, and yet <Col N="470" /> the Seanad would have no right, and certainly no authority, to disallow it. The important thing is to know that the order will deal purely with a Money Bill under the definition in Article 35 of the Constitution.  If we could be assured that that was the total content of the order, then I think the Minister's case would be pretty sound.  But there is no such assurance, and I do not know how it is to be supplied by the provision in the Bill.  I do not know whether it would be quite in accordance with precedents to insert in a Bill of this kind a provision requiring the Ceann Comhairle to give a certificate of the money character of the order to be made by the Minister after it had gone through the Dáil.  It seems to me that something is required to ensure that the order that the Minister speaks of is, in fact, concerned only with money provisions, as defined in Article 35 of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty I see is that we have inserted an amendment by way of a recommendation which leaves the order to be made one which fairly well comes within the Minister's definition.  We know that he is likely to insert other words in the other House, and if these other words deal with penalties, then the first part of the order he would make would be a Money Bill if it were in a Bill by itself, and the second part of it would not be a Money Bill if it were in a Bill by itself.  That is the difficulty I see. Technically, at the moment, as the other amendment has been accepted. Senator Johnson's case is not so good, but we know that other words are to be put in its place, and that creates a difficulty, to my mind. Surely this matter of penalties in an order is a matter in which this House should have a say.  If it is a matter as to what pensions ought to be paid under an order, then I do not think it is a matter to which this House ought to have anything to say.</P>

Number 1 was rather an alternative, and I am not sure that I would press Nos. 2 and 3, although to be consistent, the Principal Act ought to be amended in accordance with the recommendations that have now been agreed to.  But as I think the chief work contemplated by the Principal Act has already been accomplished, it is perhaps hardly necessary to press these amendments to amend the Principal Act, and therefore I do not propose to move them.</P>

      <P>I did not wish to bring in an amendment on the other stage, but I would like to ask the Minister a question upon a subject in which I am interested.  It was raised on this Bill in the Dáil from all sides of the House, and the Minister gave an expression of opinion on it, hostile in the beginning, but favourable, I think, in the end.  I would like him to say if he has since then considered the question of the Connaught Rangers.  This is a subject that I suppose I know more about than anybody else for many reasons.  I was not at all pleased by the statement the Minister made on <Col N="472" /> one occasion when he said that the Connaught Rangers, in the action they took, were influenced by ulterior motives rather than motives of patriotism.  I sent him some papers and asked him if he could manage to get employment for some of these men.  I got a very civil letter back informing me that if I would supply him with the names of people he would see that they got employment.  I supplied him with about twenty names, but I heard no more about it.  As far as I know these men got no employment. I do not think that that is a satisfactory way to deal with this matter, and perhaps the Minister would say something now, having had time to consider it.</P>

      <P>I stated in the Dáil that this was a matter which had been given a little consideration, at one time at any rate, to the extent of having a committee appointed to make a report.  While that report found that the Connaught Rangers had carried out the particular actions they did in India on account of national and patriotic motives, it also was to the effect that they had not a claim for pensions.  As I said in the Dáil the matter was laid aside, and it was not given any subsequent consideration.  As a result of a number of speeches made in the Dáil I undertook to look into the matter.  I have not yet had an opportunity of doing this.</P>

      <P>If my amendment were taken before Senator Milroy's, it would clear the air.  It is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="473" /> Section 3, sub-section (1).  To delete to the end of the sub-section paragraph (e), inserted in Committee, and to substitute therefor a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(e) to any person being the tenant or owner of a house which is certified by the Country Medical Officer of Health as being insanitary and unfit for human habitation and who erects on the same site a house to which this Act applies, a grant not exceeding £60 in respect of the said house.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I regret the necessity for inconveniencing the House by moving an amendment which ought properly to have been suggested on the Committee Stage of this Bill, but the Cathaoirleach called upon the Minister in charge to reply to the debate before I could screw up sufficient courage to rise to address the House.  I do not think that the House saw this matter in the correct perspective, and as a result they have, without due consideration, given preference to a particular class of the population of the Saorstát.  I have an intimate knowledge of, and a deep sympathy with, the small farmer, and if injustice were not done to others, I would desire to advance his cause, but I think that he has some advantages over the artisan.  The latter has only his hands, and when they fail he has nothing to fall back upon; on the other hand, the farmer, however small, has an abiding place in the country districts; he can exist where the artisan is starving, and he gets, for reasons which I do not intend to explain in detail to the House, credit which will tide him over a bad time and which the artisan can seldom command.</P>
    <P>Experience gained in local government leads me to believe that a scheme based on poor law valuation is difficult to administer by reason of the fact that valuation is by no means a correct method of estimating a man's real wealth or poverty, and I have often seen it discarded and for that reason alone I consider the amendment unsound <Col N="474" /> and liable to give rise to injustice. The speakers in support of the amendment laid stress on the necessity for this concession on medical grounds, and that being so, I suggest that the substituted wording which I have submitted to the House meets the case better than the original, and makes provision for all classes instead of one.  In view, however, of Senator Johnson's remarks on the Committee Stage I very much doubt whether an amendment to the Bill is necessary at all.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 3, sub-section (1).  To delete at the end of the sub-section paragraph (e), inserted in Committee.</P>
      <P>There are, I think, a considerable number of reasons for the amendment which is tabled in my name, and I think that we should consider this amendment which was proposed by Senator MacEllin, and which was adopted by the Seanad last week, before we make up our minds on the matter.  I take it that Senator MacEllin had in mind a desire to give a special benefit to a special class, that he believed the particular circumstances merited special consideration, that, in other words, they had a claim to the extra grant of £15 which people of a similar status in other walks of life could not make. In opposing that amendment, the Minister very effectively pointed out that this particular class is one which could afford the reduced grant better than other classes; that no site value was involved; that stone and sand, and often lime, can be conveniently got by them without payment, and so on, so that these people in these respects&mdash;and they are very important considerations&mdash; are better able to bear a reduction in the grant than people living in urban areas.  Now, I understand that the purpose of this Bill is to induce the investment of money in house building, and that if that is not achieved one particular purpose of the Bill is not achieved.</P>

      <Col N="475" /> Senator MacEllin described these people in a way which would lead one to believe that they have very little money to invest for this purpose. But there are one or two considerations which seem to me, without discussing the merits or the intentions of the amendment, to render it unworkable.  I read the report today, and it struck me as very curious that Senator Comyn, who seconded the amendment, said that it had been very carefully drafted.  I may be wrong, and in this matter I speak subject to correction, but it seemed to me that instead of being carefully drafted, it was quite the reverse.</P>
    <P>There were several serious defects in it, I think, which would raise considerable obstacles if the Bill became a statute.  For instance, take the term &ldquo;agricultural holding.&rdquo;  I have tried to ascertain if there is any statutory definition of an agricultural holding, and so far as my investigations went there is none.  There are legal definitions; cases have been tried and legal judgments have been given that such and such was an agricultural holding.  But these decisions were contingent upon certain particular circumstances, and they could hardly be quoted as definitions for the purpose of this amendment. They were such, in any case, as made it clear to my mind that without a proper definition of an agricultural holding the acceptance of the amendment would lead to the widening of the scope of the Bill in a way which was never contemplated, either by the Bill or the mover of the amendment.  For instance, in one or two cases that I noticed in looking for a definition of an agricultural holding I found, &ldquo;A plot of ground used as a market garden in an urban area.&rdquo;  Another case was a piece of land devoted to the cultivation of strawberries, which was defined as an agricultural holding.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that those responsible for that amendment had a particular class in their minds who should benefit by this increased grant, that is, the small farmers in rural areas, and that it was not their intention to include people living in <Col N="476" /> urban areas who have plots of ground devoted to agricultural purposes to an extent which would bring them under the legal definition of an agricultural holding.  But still the fact remains that if this amendment were allowed to remain in the Bill without a specific definition ruling out these urban areas, they would be entitled, under these judgments and under the Bill, to claim the increased grant.  I take it that that is not the intention of the movers of the amendment.  At least I would be glad to hear Senator Comyn on the matter.  He may be able to tell us if there is a definition of the term &ldquo;agricultural holding&rdquo; which would define rigidly what is intended for the purpose of the amendment, because I think he will agree that without such the amendment would widen the scope of the Bill in a manner which was not contemplated.</P>
    <P>There is another point with regard to the phrase &ldquo;sole or main source of livelihood.&rdquo;  Do not take me as hostile to the spirit or the intention of that amendment.  It is simply because I think it is not drafted in a way which would secure the object, even if the object were acceptable, that I am criticising it.  Who is to ascertain if it is the sole or main source of livelihood?  If that amendment remains as it is worded, would it not necessitate an enquiry by the Department to ascertain what is the means of livelihood of the applicant, and whether or not the information given is accurate? If so, that would involve an expenditure which I do not think was contemplated by the Bill, or by the mover of the amendment.  I think, as Senator The McGillycuddy of the Reeks said, that the valuation is not an accurate criterion by which to judge this.  It might very well be that one person on a holding with a £15 valuation would be in a much better position than a person on holding with a valuation of £40 £50.  To my mind this amendment, apart altogether from the idea that the mover of it has in mind, has intrinsic defects.  If it were to remain in the Bill it would, I think, involve <Col N="477" /> the Department charged with the administration of it when it became an Act in a whole series of complicated inquiries, the end of which it is very hard to see.  We are at the stage now that, even if it were possible to have a definition of an agricultural holding made clear, it is too late to have that put in.  Consideration of the drafting of such a definition would involve considerable time, and for that and the other reasons that I have indicated, I think the amendment is seriously defective. The amendment was passed in a moment of unguardedness on the part of the Seanad, and I think it is one that ought to be deleted from the Bill.</P>

      <P>So that Senators may be conversant with the terms of the amendment inserted on the Committee Stage, perhaps I had better read it.  It is in the following ing terms:&mdash;&ldquo;Section 3, sub-section (1).  To add at the end of the sub-section a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e)  to any person being the tenant or owner of an agricultural holding which constitutes his sole or main source of livelihood and the poor law valuation of which does not exceed £15, erecting on the said holding a house to which this Act applies a grant not exceeding £60 in respect of the said house.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am much indebted to you, sir, for having read the sub-section which was proposed from these benches and carried unanimously, or almost unanimously in a full House.  I would like Senators to recall that there was no surprise about this amendment. It was brought forward openly, and was argued plainly and fully.  It was discussed from all sides of the House, and was carried on the Committee Stage on a show of hands. During the time that I have been a member of the House I do not recollect any other proposal which received such an amount of general approval from all sections of the <Col N="478" /> House.  I must say that I am greatly surprised that the Minister, who must be thoroughly conversant with the weighty reasons put forward from these benches in support of that amendment, should now come back on the Report Stage and try to reverse the decision arrived at on the Committee Stage of this Bill not by surprise, not by fraud, but after open discussion and with the full assent of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As there are some Senators who may not have been present at the original debate on this amendment, I would like to state shortly some of the arguments which we put forward in support of it.  I am doing that because I am most anxious to secure that this section should not be lost to the Bill.  As the amendment indicated, it is intended that labouring men, who are not the less labouring men because they have £15 worth of a holding in which to occupy their labour, should get a grant of £60 when the artisan gets £45.  I will not dwell very much now upon the claims of that particular class. These claims must be obvious to Senators.  What I do say is that up to the present that class has not been very articulate.  I do not think that in the past three or four years they have been very generously treated.  In fact I would go so far as to say that the small farming class in the legislation that has taken place in the last two or three years have been very badly treated. They are not articulate at present, but when they speak they will speak with force.  In explaining why we requested from the House a larger sum for them than is given to the ordinary artisan, I pointed out that the small farmer's house is used, to some extent at least, for farming purposes, and that therefore it must of necessity be a little larger than the house of the artisan in a town or a city.  Of course, the Minister was quite right in saying that the small farmer can build at less expense than, say, an artisan in the city of Dublin or the city of Cork. We know very well that he can employ his own labour, the labour of <Col N="479" /> himself and of his sons, that he can quarry stones, and with his horses draw them to the building site.  We know that, and the Minister knows it, too, but if that gives the small farmer an opportunity of earning a few pounds, why should he not have them?  I see in this House, and in another place, a disposition to adopt a hostile attitude towards a class that is not at present vocal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>But, if they do become vocal, I can tell Senators that they will talk.  Of course, there was the argument which, if I may say so, was put forward very clearly by the Minister, that the small farmer can do a lot of this building work by means of his own labour and the labour of his sons.  That was put very clearly by the Minister, but notwithstanding that we still press that £60 should be the amount of the grant in the case of a small agricultural holding. Now I come to the elaborate and very acute legal argument put forward by my friend, Senator Milroy. He says that this amendment was not very carefully drafted.  Of course, he is entitled to his opinion, and the House is entitled to accept his opinion.  I will not complain as regards that.  I say that the amendment was very carefully drafted to include a certain class that are deserving of special consideration. If Senator Milroy differs with me on that, of course, I can only reiterate the opinion that I have already expressed. This I will say, that I do not expect the Minister will agree with Senator Milroy.  There were two points taken up by Senator Milroy. He says that we have no definition here of an agricultural holding. There is no necessity for a definition of an agricultural holding.  If there are any two words in the language, English or Irish, that are so clearly defined or closely limited, these are the two words.</P>

He says one thing and I say another.  I ask the House to accept what I say in regard to that. The Senator has shown a considerable amount of learning on this subject, because he referred to the case of market gardens.  That is a case that actually arose in reference to this question of an agricultural holding.  It was the famous Limerick market garden case.  I think that if there are any small farmers near Ardnacrusha who have 3 or 4 acres of a cabbage garden they ought to have good houses as well.  So much for the arguments which have been urged by Senator Milroy.  In regard to these small farmers, I would urged on the Minister not to press on the Report Stage the rescinding of the amendment carried in Committee. I think that these small farmers are entitled to special consideration. On the last occasion I pointed out that our desire was not to get for these small farmers a great share of this £200,000.  We do not expect much of that, but it seems to us that this is an occasion upon which we can get the small <Col N="481" /> farmer into an advantageous position in legislation in preparation for the time when the Minister will have some comprehensive scheme to bring before the House.  I have only one other matter to deal with, and when I have dealt with it to the satisfaction of Senator Johnson, I hope that we will have his support.</P>

      <P>In regard to what Senator Johnson said as to why these small farmers do not form themselves into a public utility society, I can imagine a small farmer who wants £60 going around and getting seven names.  I suggest it would be easier to get seven names on a promissory note than to get seven farmers over a countryside to form themselves into a public utility society for the purpose of getting £60 when they can get £45 without being obliged to do anything of the sort.  I think, with all respect to Senator Johnson&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not happen at the moment to want £60 for the building of a house.  I might want it for something else, but I think that is a sufficient answer to Senator Johnson's argument.  The argument which the Senator put up on the last occasion was, and I say it with respect, quite untenable in the mind of anybody who understands the country.  I submit that if the Minister does press for the rescinding of the amendment carried in Committee, it is really a challenge to the House.  If he presses that, I <Col N="482" /> hope that the House will not reverse the decision which it gave by an overwhelming majority on a show of hands on a most important question.</P>

      <P>This amendment deals with a class of people constituting part of the population of Ireland who have gone through more difficulties, troubles and sufferings during hundreds and hundreds of years than any other section of the population.  They live, as I have seen them myself, in mud houses on the side of the road&mdash;houses which are several feet below the level of the road.  Many of these mud houses are in the midst of bogs, practically surrounded by water.  I have seen many of these houses myself in the west of Ireland.  They are wretchedly bad. I have seen some very bad cabins indeed.  While saying that, I do not want in the least to minimise the sufferings of the people who are obliged to live in congested areas in the City of Dublin.  Great numbers of these people suffer seriously.  Nothing could be worse than the habitations they have.  In supporting this amendment, I am not therefore to be taken as in any way minimising the sufferings of these people in Dublin.  My feelings are quite the opposite.  Senator Milroy, in looking for a definition of an agricultural holding, even though I am not a lawyer, made me smile, because I have been hearing about that all my life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator seemed to be so fully informed on the matter that he appeared to think it was a matter for amusement.  I spoke subject to correction when I stated that I had not been able to discover such <Col N="483" /> a definition myself.  I hope, when Senator Brown speaks, that he will be able to inform the House that the definitions that he states are in Acts of Parliament are such as will suit the purposes of this particular amendment which deals with a particular class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave that matter to somebody else to speak on. The point has been made that the people living in the agricultural areas in Ireland can provide more help themselves as regards the actual work of house building than people living in the towns and in the cities. I suppose there is something in that. I have seen them building their own houses in the West.  I have seen them improve their houses there.  I have seen them build some mud cabins. Generally they built their houses of rough stones without possessing much knowledge of the art of house-building. These people are not masons, and I have seen them build some cabins which would not, I think, be now accepted by the inspectors who go around and whose duty it is to inspect houses.  These houses that I have seen had clay floors.  They were small houses and were badly built.  I do not think the people ought to be encouraged to build that class of house.  These, of course, are the only sort of houses that they can build at their own expense. I think there is no section of the population which is more deserving of a little help than these small farmers who live in the West of Ireland. They live in wretched little houses on the side of the road.  They ought to be encouraged to build better houses for themselves, and I see no reason why they should not be encouraged by means of the amendment carried on the Committee Stage on the motion of Senator MacEllin.</P>

      <P>On the Committee Stage of this Bill I listened with great attention to the case that was made for his amendment by Senator MacEllin.  I supported his amendment on that occasion, and I propose supporting it to-day.  I think that <Col N="484" /> the Senator made a good case for increasing the grant for these people from £45 to £60.  I do not think that the question raised to-day about the definition of an agricultural holding should lead Senators who supported the amendment on the last occasion to change their opinions to-day. There is only this difference of £15, and in my opinion the people concerned deserve to be treated with a little generosity.  They are a most deserving class, and this extra sum of £15 will be a great help to them houses for themselves.  I intend to support the retention of that amendment in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. MacEllin Mr. MacEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was the mover of the amendment, perhaps I ought to say something on this.  As far as I could understand his attitude, the Minister on the last day did not seem to have any great objection to the acceptance of my amendment.  In fact, the only objection he urged was that these small farmers and people of that class were not so badly hit at all.  I think that was an absolutely ridiculous objection to raise, considering the present position of those engaged in agriculture.  In the case of a small farmer who has a holding with a £15 valuation, his income at the very outside would be about £80 a year.  Out of that he has to pay rent and rates, which would account for about £20.  Then he has to pay for feeding-stuffs, manures, and one thing and another.  When he has all these charges met he is left with about 10/- a week for the support of himself and his family.  The number in family in the case of most of these people would be eight or ten, more often ten than eight, and all that they are left to live on is ten shillings a week.  I think it is time that something should be done to help these people to provide themselves with houses, and to get out of the hovels in which they are living at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the cost of building materials has been reduced during the last couple of years.  As far as I know, I think myself that the cost to a small farmer of building a house would be in or about £100.  I do not know that for certain, because I have no technical knowledge on the subject. What I do submit to the House is that a grant of £45 would be no inducement whatever to these poor people to make a start in the building of a house.  If they got the extra sum of £15 provided for in my amendment, it would be a great help to them.  It may be said that £15 is not so much in the building of a house, but I can tell Senators that £15 means a lot to these poor people in the country living on holdings with a valuation of £15.  Fifteen pounds means a great deal to them, and would encourage them to set about the building of a house.  On the last occasion Senator Johnson referred to the formation of public utility societies, and said that if they were formed the grant of £60 could be got.  Anybody who lives in the country, or anyone acquainted with conditions in the country, knows perfectly well that it is almost impossible sometimes to get people to move, even in their own interests. Take, for instance, the case of a rural area in which you have ten or fifteen families.  Let us assume that one man there wants to build a house, and that he goes around to his neighbours and asks them to form themselves into a public utility society so that he may be able to get a grant of £60 to build a house for himself.  The first thing that would happen would be this: the <Col N="486" /> people he approached for the purpose would at once become suspicious. They might get the idea into their heads that this man would not be able to pay for the house when built, and that the liability, whatever it was that remained over, would fall on themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Milroy stated that some people might term a market garden, or even an acre of land, an agricultural holding.  Anyone who reads my amendment could not come to the conclusion that I ever intended to include as an agricultural holding a market garden or an acre of land, because it most specifically sets out that the increased grant is only to apply to persons who are the tenants or owners of an agricultural holding which constitutes their sole or main source of livelihood.  In the case of a man who had only an acre of land his sole or main source of livelihood would not come from that.  Further, a man living on an acre of land would come under the part of the Bill dealing with workers.  My amendment that was accepted on Committee Stage in no way interferes with such a person. World conditions are such at the moment that the Governments of practically every country are doing something to help the farmer.  Even the wealthy United States of America has realised the necessity of coming to the assistance of the farmers in that country in order to help them over the difficulties that face those engaged in agriculture.  The position here is very critical at the moment.  I hope that this House is not now going to say that it is not prepared to help these poor people to build new houses.  I think that my amendment is a very reasonable one.  It merely asks the State to give this little extra help to the small farmers of the country as an inducement to them to get out of the hovels in which they are living, and to provide themselves with decent houses.  I ask the House to support the case that has been made to give these people the necessary assistance they require in order that they may <Col N="487" /> be able to build new houses for themselves.</P>

      <P>There is no question of any hostility to the small farmer in offering my opinion on this particular matter.  There is a provision in the Bill whereby any small farmer, or unfortunate person with no land at all, can under certain conditions get a grant from the State of £45 to build a three-roomed house. If people have any sense, or have any friends willing to help them, and they require to get a grant of £60, all they have to do is to form a public utility society.  There is nothing preventing those who have sympathy with the small farmers doing the preliminary work in regard to the formation of a public utility society on their behalf.  Moreover, the amendment is picking out one particular section of the community and putting it in a privileged position.</P>

      <P>The Senator may say that but the facts speak for themselves. The amendment means that the farmers with holdings of less than £15 valuation are to be entitled to a grant of £60, while a man with no land would get only £45.  I voted against the amendment the last day, and I will vote against it to-day, and not because I am lacking in sympathy with the small farmers. Senator Comyn may shake his head and think that nobody has as much sympathy with the small farmer as he has, but I can assure him that we have every sympathy with the small farmer.  It is not, however, a question of sympathy, but a question of dealing fairly with everybody and not placing one particular section in a privileged position.  It is unfair to give one class £60 and another class, who may be worse off, only £45.  I want to point out to Senator Comyn that under previous Acts, if these small farmers wanted to take advantage of the £60 grant, there was nothing to prevent them from doing so.  It is nonsense to speak in connection with this Bill of hitting people in the countryside.  Any person <Col N="488" /> of average intelligence who has the interest of the small farmer at heart can do the little preliminary work that is necessary as regards the formation of a public utility society, and every farmer who is a member of that society will get the £60.  In that way the making of special legislation for one particular section of the community can be avoided.</P>

It is only waste of time discussing it, and it is merely treating the House with contempt to ask it to reverse a decision deliberately arrived at this day week.</P>

      <P>It would be a mistake if we adopted the principle that we should not discuss, when necessary, matters fully on the Report Stage.  The reason for the Report Stage is to give an opportunity for such discussion.  Whatever opinions we hold, or whatever way we vote in regard to this amendment, we should not be influenced by the suggestion that the House should not reverse its decision.  A great deal has been said on this amendment that we did not hear the last time, and the House should not object to have a good discussion on the Report Stage.  Another point I want to make is that the promoters of this amendment cannot convince me that this extra £15 given to a man who has such a wretched house that it is uninhabitable, will enable him to build a new house.  The difference between £60 and £45 will not enable a person to build a house unless he has very considerable resources to fall back upon.  We have been told again and again that the small farmer cannot get his neighbours to join with him to form a public utility society, so that he might get the grant of £60.  It seems to me that the amendment which was brought forward on the last occasion by <Col N="489" /> Senator MacEllin would make the measure extremely difficult to administer. I would not like to be sitting in the Department that had to deal with the claims for grants from those with a valuation of £15 or under.  I really think the House should consider whether it should pass a loosely worded section which would give no end of trouble to the Department.  The House should be convinced that what it is proposed to do in the amendment brought forward on the last occasion by Senator MacEllin can be done.  I doubt it, and I think the Bill would be better without it.</P>

      <P>I am entirely with Senator Farren that the principle of the amendment which we adopted last week is entirely wrong considered in relation to the rest of the Bill.  I deprecate the talk about hostility to the small farmers.  Talk of that description is only lowering the level of the debate.  I come from a district where there are small farmers, and is it conceivable that I would come to the House and be hostile to their interests? We come here to speak for the good of the whole people.  That is why I put down an amendment, and that is why the Minister drafted the Bill in the terms he did.  The cost of building materials, I suppose, has fallen a certain amount, but not a great deal. It still remains a great deal higher in the towns than in the country on account of the cost of transport, apart from anything else.  The small farmer, when he is building a house, collects the material for it bit by bit &mdash;a load of stones now and a load of gravel then.  He goes to the market with his produce, and he brings back a little lime one week and some timber another week, and so on until, finally, he has got to the position where he can start with the actual building of the house.  He is, in most cases, a handy man himself, and there are plenty of handymen to help in the work at a cheap rate. He is undoubtedly in a better position than any man in a town.  It must be also considered that a £15 valuation <Col N="490" /> in the poorer districts is a pretty high one, and to base a grant on that basis is entirely wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator MacEllin rather objects to the fact that I did not speak strongly enough against this amendment on the Committee Stage here.  My point of view on the Committee Stage was that the Seanad had the opportunity of discussing whatever principle was involved, and, personally, I would like to interfere as little as possible except to help Senators to understand certain aspects of the matter. If a matter is raised on review on the Report Stage I do not see why, if I object to an amendment, it should be regarded as an insult.  The Report Stage is simply the machinery which the Seanad has adopted for review, and I think a very reasonable machinery. If, as Senator Fanning suggests, matters were to be irrevocably decided on the Committee Stage we might very well prolong our discussions to a very great length.</P>
      <P>As far as I can see, Senator MacEllin, Senator O'Connor and Senator Fanning did not seem to appreciate the policy in the background of our housing legislation up to the present, that is, where we accept the moral responsibility and place it in part on the local authorities to provide houses for the working classes. We have gone beyond that in the present state of the scarcity of finances and the cost of building. We have done what was not done before: that is, we are giving grants to private persons who are putting their own money into small-sized houses.  Having regard to smallness of size is one way we have of seeing that people who are rich were not unnecessarily dipping into the public purse.  Grants to private persons in respect of houses were given only for the purpose of bringing private money into house-building at a time when money was scarce and costs high.  This is the second step down in grants for private persons since grants were introduced in 1924.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Milroy suggests that this <Col N="491" /> amendment is widening the scope of the Bill.  It is introducing a completely new principle under the heading of grants to private persons. It is discriminating in the matter of private persons who shall get grants. If there is to be any discrimination in the matter of private persons getting grants the discrimination, on the face of this Bill here, would be against the person living in a rural district.  If Senators will look at the Bill they will see that under Section 3 (1) (a) a private person may get a grant of £45, but a public body building for the working class can get a grant of £60, and in certain circumstances a grant of £72, so while we can give £60 at least, and in some cases can give as much as £72 to a public authority, we can give the private person only £45.  We cannot differentiate in this matter, provided people build houses to the limitations specified here.  We cannot examine into the matter of means, as in the case of old age pensions, because the cost of administration of the Act would go up very high if we had to do that.  Taking a comparison between a private person and a local authority in an urban district, the figures are £45 as against £60 or £72. According to Section 3 (1) (d) a public authority building labourers' cottages can get a grant of £50, and not £60.  If we are to have anything like the same relationship between the private person and the public authority in the rural districts, then that £50 should be reduced in respect of private persons.</P>
    <P>The principle that is enshrined in the £50 as against £60 is that it is cheaper to build in a rural district than in an urban area.  If there is to be any discrimination, and we are against any discrimination, it should be the discrimination I indicated on the Committee Stage, that for definite reasons it is cheaper to build houses in a rural district than in a town.  Passing from that, we come to this, the Senator proposes that a particular class of persons should get special terms, that is, that as against £45 they should get £60, and <Col N="492" /> the only reason adduced is that they are a most deserving class, hard working and in very poor circumstances.</P>

That is on the understanding that he has a certain amount of money, and we want to draw that capital into building.  If there is no money to draw upon to build houses, then the case for giving grants to private persons fails even more rapidly than it has been failing since 1924.</P>

      <P>The point is that if every cabin with a mud floor on holdings of £15 valuation and under in the country is to be replaced by public money, then we are up against a bigger proposition than some people understand.  The case made for this class of people is that they are hard working and deserving and have been badly hit. Senator Comyn wants for them bigger houses than are provided for the ordinary person.  There is a restriction with regard to houses in the Bill so far as floor space is concerned. I take it it is floor space the Senator is talking about.  If Mayo County Council becomes as generous as the Seanad, which it shows no sign of becoming, then the person on a holding like that mentioned is to get public assistance from the State and the County Council to an extent that is denied to the road-worker and the farm labourer in Mayo.</P>

      <P>I am speaking of people living in mud floored cabins.  The McGillycuddy of the Reeks raised another aspect, that is, with regard to persons living in an insanitary class of house and to widows with a number of children. The question of health has been introduced, and reference has been made to a family with a tendency to tuberculosis, so that any special class might be brought into it.  My point is that in the making of grants to private persons for the purpose of building houses we cannot enter into any class of discrimination as to the people who will be helped.  If we do, on the figures enshrined there in the Bill, and they have not been attacked, there ought to be less grants for the type of person for whom the grant is asked here than for others.  I would like to add, and this has been repeated again and again, that grants are made to private persons in our recent housing legislation for the purpose of bringing capital into house building and if any particular class, or any particular set of classes, desire to get more money than is available for the private person it simply means shutting down at an earlier date the passing of public money into private hands for the purpose of building houses, and bringing about at an earlier date a situation in which the State contribution to the building of houses will be given solely through the medium of public authorities.  We inevitably will pass to that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we could settle the position by which suitable credit facilities are provided for local authorities which <Col N="494" /> would enable us to meet the housing shortage through the local authorities there would be no case for giving public money to private persons. As to the sanitary side that Senator MacEllin introduced in his amendment, the whole aspect of things was fully considered and kept in mind in dealing with our legislation. Such houses as are being built are gradually wiping away insanitary houses.  The definite responsibility rests with the local authorities of wiping out insanitary houses in respect of those people for whom they have the moral obligation to provide houses.  In respect of the people of the higher class who have got money to put into houses, if they have insanitary houses it is to their own discredit, and as the law stands they could be proceeded against by the local sanitary authority to get them to have their houses put into a proper sanitary condition.</P>

As Senator Johnson pointed out, the key to the solution of the problem is credit for public authorities, and we are only jeopardising that position as regards credit if we put public authorities into the position of attacking the housing problem at a point which is not the most attractive and effective point on which it should be attacked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrington</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing this question to-day we are somewhat at a disadvantage compared with the Committee Stage, when we had the advantage of having a number of medical members of the Seanad present who gave us their opinions on the subject.  One expression used has stuck in my memory.  A Senator said that tuberculosis was commonly alluded to as being in certain families, whereas as a matter of fact it was not in the families but in the houses.  It was also said that the medical officers were unable to condemn <Col N="495" /> these houses because there was no other place for the people living in them to go.  That is a matter which moved me to vote for this amendment, and another consideration which moved me to do so was what has been still more prominently brought out by the Minister to-day, and that is, I doubt very strongly when this Act comes to be administered whether it will be sympathetically administered, after the remarks that have fallen from the Minister.  The Minister, in the course of his speech, said that there should be discrimination in administering this Act against people living in rural districts.  These are his words:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am very much afraid that a great many of the insanitary houses and a great many of the people who need assistance will be ruled out.  It is not so much a question of the £15 valuation, but as to whether these people will come in at all under the provisions of this measure.  Unless this amendment is adhered to, I very much fear when the Act comes to be administered they will be ruled out altogether.&rdquo;  The Minister said that the grant of £60 as regards the building of a house was neither here nor there, and that people would want more capital of at least £200.  I think Senator The McGillycuddy of the Reeks has very clearly explained the principle upon which these people work.  They may not have capital in the bank, but they can accumulate capital day by day and week by week in the manner that has been explained by the Senator, I do not agree with Senator Comyn's suggestion that out of the £60 grant a man might make a few pounds.  £60 would go but a short way towards building a house, but it would probably just enable it to be done.  For those reasons, I hope the Seanad will not reverse its decision.  I firmly believe that if this amendment, or some amendment similar to it, is not adhered to, the removal of insanitary houses throughout the country will not take place.</P>

      <P>I did not wish to intervene in the discussion, but as Senator Barrington has brought in the question of tuberculosis, I feel that I must say something.  If it is important to provide better houses in the rural districts, surely it is more important to provide better houses in the urban districts?  Take the slum areas of Dublin, where tuberculosis is rampant; where in very many cases families are living in single rooms, with one or two tubercular children living in a room with them.  To my mind it is far more important to help cases like that than it is to help in the rural districts, where there are fresh air, fresh food, fresh milk and various advantages.  Although I am not against the country districts, and would like to support their claims, at the same time we should not discriminate against town areas.  That is what is being proposed; and it was very definitely pointed out by Senator Farren that this is a discrimination in favour of the country as against the slums.</P>

      <P>I want to make it very clear that I am prepared to go on, but I thought the suggestion to defer the matter for a week might be agreeable to the critics of the Bill. There seems to be some particular reason why they are anxious to go on, and I do not want to prevent them from continuing the discussion.</P>

      <P>One definite reason I had for asking for an adjournment of this matter was that I have an amendment to amend the definition in Section 1 of the Bill.  I had not time to get it circulated.  In my opinion the amendment is one which would materially influence the course of the discussion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  In Section 1 to delete all after the word &ldquo;practitioner&rdquo; in line 20, and to substitute therefor the words, &ldquo;efficiently to take instructions from and to <Col N="500" /> advise clients, to examine witnesses, and to follow proceedings in the Irish language.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the Senator is going to move as drastic an amendment as that, I consent to an adjournment until this day week.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the business for to-morrow I have handed in a motion dealing with the Gárda Síochána Allowances Order.  It is obligatory that this question must be decided one way or the other before the 15th inst., because unless a decision is taken 21 days after the Order was laid on the Table, it has no effect.  I, therefore, request that the Seanad should allow my motion to be discussed at the opening of the business to-morrow.  The Censorship Bill will surely carry us through the day, and my motion might be deferred, so that the intention of the statute would be defeated.</P>

      <P>The same thing struck me when I saw Senator Johnson's motion, and it occurred to me, that while we have at present no Standing Order governing it, it is a pity that we have not in this House the sort of arrangement they have at times in the Dáil, by which a motion is taken at the beginning for a given time.  I should not object to an hour, but I would object if it were to be debated the whole day. If there was consent that a division would be taken after an hour or so I think it would be reasonable.</P>
