    <Title>Constitution (Amendment No. 12) Bill, 1928&mdash;Third Stage.</Title>
    <P>The Seanad went into Committee.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 1.</P>
    <P>Article 35 of the Constitution shall be and is hereby amended by the deletion of the third paragraph now contained therein, that is to say, the paragraph beginning with the words &ldquo;The Chairman of Dáil Eireann&rdquo; and ending with the words &ldquo;final and conclusive&rdquo; and the insertion in lieu of the paragraph so deleted of the following paragraphs, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Chairman of Dáil Eireann shall certify any Bill which in his opinion is a Money Bill to be a Money Bill and such certificate shall be final and conclusive unless the question whether the Bill is or is not a Money Bill is referred to a Committee of Privileges under the subsequent provisions of this Article.</P>
    <P>If before whichever of the following events shall first occur, that is to say, the expiration of seven days from the day on which a Bill is certified by the Chairman of Dáil Eireann to be a Money Bill or the return of such Bill by Seanad Eireann to Dáil Eireann under Article 38 of this Constitution&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  two-fifths of the members of either House by notice in writing addressed to the Chairman of the House of which they are members so require, or</P>
    <P>(b)  a majority of the members of Seanad Eireann present and voting at a sitting of Seanad <Col N="66" /> Eireann at which not less than thirty members are present so resolve,</P>
    <P>the question whether the Bill is or is not a Money Bill shall be referred to a Committee of Privileges consisting of three members elected by Dáil Eireann, three members elected by Seanad Eireann, and a Chairman who shall be the senior judge of the Supreme Court able and willing to act and who in the case of an equality of votes, but not otherwise shall be entitled to vote.</P>
    <P>Every such Committee of Privileges shall decide the question so referred to it and report its decision thereon to Dáil Eireann and Seanad Eireann within twenty-one days after the day on which the Bill the subject of such question was sent to Seanad Eireann and, upon such Committee so deciding and reporting, the decision of such Committee shall be final and conclusive, but, if such Committee fails so to decide and report within such twenty-one days, the certificate of the Chairman of Dáil Eireann that such Bill is a Money Bill shall at the expiration of the said twenty-one days become and be final and conclusive.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete in line 30 the word &ldquo;is,&rdquo; and before the word &ldquo;or,&rdquo; in line 31, to insert the words &ldquo;is received by Seanad Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that, as the Bill reads at present, the seven-day period is fixed from the time when the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil makes his decision.  I suggest that if the section is altered in the way that I am seeking in this amendment it will mean that the seven-day period will operate from the time when the Seanad receives the intimation from the Ceann Comhairle.  It might so happen that the Seanad would not be meeting for seven days, or that there would be no opportunity for calling the Seanad together.  The result of that, it seems to me, would be that the seven-day period would have <Col N="67" /> elapsed, and that therefore the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil could then take action without the Seanad having had an opportunity of discussing the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this is a good amendment.  It does not alter the 21 days during which we must act, and at the end of which the axe goes down anyway.  The amendment, if agreed to, will give the Seanad the little additional time that may be necessary in certain circumstances, and therefore it is one, I think, that we ought to adopt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the principle of the amendment is right, but I am not quite sure of the exact effect of the words &ldquo;is received by Seanad Eireann.&rdquo;  I think, in view of the fact that the final 21 days can hardly operate as 21 days from the day in which the Seanad next met&mdash;because that might work against ourselves&mdash;and in view of the fact that the Committee has not met and reported within 21 days there will be no action.  I think that the period should be seven days, but not from the time the certificate has come from the Ceann Comhairle, but seven days from the time the Bill has been received by the Seanad. By that I mean received by the Officer of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to this amendment very short notice has been given to me for consideration of it.  It will be observed that paragraphs (a) and (b) read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  two-fifths of the members of either House by notice in writing addressed to the Chairman of the House of which they are members so require, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  a majority of the members of Seanad Eireann present and voting at a sitting of Seanad Eireann at which not less than <Col N="68" /> thirty members are present so resolve.</P>
    <P>That is the only part of the section which, I take it, Senator Connolly is interested in.  In so far as two-fifths of the members of the Seanad are concerned, their right is still preserved, and I take it that it is only in respect to the second paragraph that his amendment would be material.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, the time that has been given to me for the consideration of this amendment has been very short.  Under the Constitution, as it stands, an objection to a Bill being certified as a Money Bill must be lodged within three days.  The recommendation of the Joint Committee was that that should be spread out to seven days. What this proposal amounts to is that there should be a still further extension of the period.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>Not if you add after the words in Senator Connolly's amendment &ldquo;as received by the Clerk of Seanad Eireann.&rdquo;  If these words are added it will make the point perfectly definite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out that both provisions are affected by this?  What is desired is that the Clerk of the Seanad should receive the Bill, and should be in a position to notify Senators by post that such a Bill has been received by him and has been certified as a Money Bill. The point is that the seven days should elapse from the time that the Clerk of the Seanad receives the Bill.  If that is done it will mean that from the point of view of Senators they will have about five days in which to take action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am not vitally concerned about it, but so far as I know there is no means at present of communicating the decision of the Ceann Comhairle to the Seanad.  That is what I want to make provision for, because the seven days might have elapsed without any opportunity being given to the Seanad to discuss the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 1.  After the word &ldquo;vote,&rdquo; in line 47, to insert the words:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If on the expiration of seven days from the day on which the question whether the Bill is a Money Bill is referred to such Committee of Privileges either House of the Oireachtas shall fail to elect three members to act on such Committee, the three members elected by the other House of the Oireachtas and the senior judge of the Supreme Court who is able and willing to act as Chairman shall constitute and act <Col N="70" /> as the Committee of Privileges for the purpose of this section.  If any member of such Committee constituted as aforesaid ceases to be a member, or for any reason becomes incapable of acting as a member thereof, the remaining members of such Committee and such senior judge of the Supreme Court shall constitute and act as the Committee of Privileges for the purpose of this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is much on the lines outlined by me on the Second Reading of the Bill.  It is, to my mind, a necessary result of the amendment inserted in the Dáil to the original Bill.  The amendment inserted in the Dáil provided that if the Committee had not reported within 21 days, then the decision of the Ceann Comhairle shall be definite and unquestionable.  That safeguards the Dáil against certain Senators having sufficient influence on the Committee to prevent the Committee reporting, and thereby preventing it getting its way in the event of a dispute.  It is by no means certain that the decision of the Ceann Comhairle would be one with which the Dáil would agree.  In fact it might be the other way round. The demand might equally come from the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I have put in the period of seven days in my amendment.  I would not object to the insertion of the ten days mentioned in Senator Johnson's amendment if that is thought desirable, but it seems to me important that there should be a provision in the event of either House ignoring the demand&mdash;not meeting for instance or in not appointing three members whether deliberately or by inadvertence&mdash;and that the balance of the Committee should be able to meet and act.  Otherwise it would be in the power of either House, if they thought fit, simply by not appointing members to make the whole thing null and void and of no effect.  I have had the assistance of Senator Brown in the drafting of this amendment.  It has been drafted very carefully.  This, however, may not be the best form in which to put <Col N="71" /> it finally, but as regards the principle of it I think the House ought to agree to it in its own interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have joined in preparing the draft of this amendment if I did not really feel that the Bill as it stands might break down in the working out of it.  The question as to whether a Bill is a Money Bill or not is one that would only arise when there was some really serious question between the two Houses.  It is, therefore, of the utmost importance that this Bill should provide for an effective committee to deal with every situation that does arise.  There are two ways in which it may happen that under the Bill as it stands there would not be an effective committee.  One would be that if for any reason either House failed to elect the three members.  The other way, and this is one that did not occur either to Senator Douglas or myself when the Bill was having a Second Reading, in which the committee may cease to be an effective committee and may cease to be able to operate is by the failure of some of its members to act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some one of the three members selected by either House may unfortunately die in the interval, or a member might get so seriously ill that he could not act.  In cases of that kind it is a very doubtful question if you can have an effective committee under the Bill as it stands.  There is supposed to be a common law more or less laying down what happens when a committee meets, as to whether it can go on or not when there is not a majority of the members present who are nominated to act.  There is a vague common law of that kind, but it is not settled.  It might happen if some crisis arose between the two Houses that the committee would break down, simply because one of the members was not able to act.  Under those circumstances I thought that for the protection of both Houses this was a matter that ought to be definitely put into the present Bill.  That is why I helped <Col N="72" /> in the drafting of this amendment, and why I support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should speak to this amendment as well as to my own, because I think the one is bound up with the other.  My amendment reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 1.  After line 47 to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The appointment of the Committee of Privileges referred to in the preceding paragraph shall be completed within ten days of the issue of the certificate by the Chairman of Dáil Eireann.  In the event of either House failing to elect its quota of members to act on the Committee or the non-appointment or absence of a Chairman the remaining members shall act as the duly constituted Committee.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The first difference between the amendment moved by Senator Douglas and my amendment is on the question of the number of days. The ten days seem to me preferable, because of the possibility of seven or six days having elapsed before a certain thing was done.  If the suggestion contained in Senator Connolly's amendment is inserted in the Bill, then there is not very much point in the ten days as against the seven.  The second point on which my amendment differs from the amendment moved by Senator Douglas is, that it provides for the possible absence of the Chairman, whereas Senator Douglas's amendment does not take note of that as a possibility.  It is a possibility, and in a constitutional provision of this kind, I think it should be provided against, because the end of the section declares that if the committee does not decide and report within 21 days, then the Money Bill becomes law, notwithstanding any other view that the Seanad may take as to the meaning of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One cannot but remember in this connection the rather vivid example in connection with the Boundary Commission.  When it was provided that that Commission should be set up consisting of a representative of <Col N="73" /> Northern Ireland with others, the Northern Ireland representative was not appointed, and therefore the Commission could not act.  If for any reason, a majority in the Dáil decided to take no notice of a requisition from two-fifths of the members, the Committee could not act. If the majority of the Seanad did not appoint its three members the Committee could not act, and if for any other reason a Chairman was not appointed, or, having been appointed, did not make himself available, the Committee could not act, and the Bill would automatically become law.  I think that the proposal in these two amendments is to fill a gap which is clearly evident in the Bill as drafted.  Except for the point about the chairmanship, I am quite prepared to support the amendment moved by Senator Douglas, but I think that some provision ought to be made for meeting the possibility of the absence of the Chairman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasEsmondeBart" hpid="Sir Thomas Esmonde Sir Thomas Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Thomas Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the amendment.  I think that the President might safely agree to it, as Senator Brown has advised that it should be incorporated in the Bill, and the Senator is certainly not a fire-brand.  The arrangement which the amendment suggests seems to me to be obviously a logical one.  If a member of the Committee, which is supposed to be set up, becomes incapable of acting, then this amendment, if agreed to, will enable the remaining members on the Committee to act.  If the Committee is to serve the useful purpose intended, I think this is a very necessary arrangement to make.  The President may want time to consider it, and may express his views on it at a later stage of the Bill, but if the Act is to work in the sense in which it is drawn, this seems to me to be a very obvious amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether all the present members of the House were Senators at the time when the Joint Committee considered these various amendments to the Constitution.  If not I would ask them to read up what transpired <Col N="74" /> at the proceedings of the Joint Committee, and in addition to examine the Constitution in the light of this particular Article.  On the passing of this Bill a question will arise as to whether a particular measure is or is not a Money Bill. That will fall, in the first instance, for the decision of the Ceann Comhairle. As far as the Seanad is concerned, it is limited by the Constitution in its treatment of a Money Bill to the making of recommendations. That limitation does not occur as regards an ordinary measure, but in setting out in the Constitution what should be regarded as a Money Bill it is fairly clearly laid down.  It is obvious that the Ceann Comhairle would have to confine himself strictly to the terms of the Constitution in making out his certificate. In the event of a dispute arising as whether that certificate was properly made out and as to whether a particular Bill was or was not a Money Bill, we are making certain provisions for dealing with a situation such as that.  My principal objection to this amendment is as to the wording of the first portion of it. It suggests a possible contingency which, I think, one would be rather inclined not to contemplate, that is that one of the two Houses of the Oireachtas, having in mind its obligations to the State and its sense of dignity, would fail to nominate members to a body to consider the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, even in time. If we are to have that in mind and are to make provision for such a contingency let us adopt every possible means to make as respectable provision for it as is possible in the circumstances.  If this amendment is left over for the Report Stage, I will endeavour to meet Senator Brown with something which will not strike one so violently in the eye as this amendment, and that possibly will meet the point that he has in view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to suggest <Col N="75" /> that the President would agree to the principle contained in the amendment and that some alteration of the wording of the amendment would be necessary.  The drafting of the amendment was extremely difficult. Indeed I might say that I never had a more difficult job in the matter of drafting than in drafting this particular amendment.  If the amendment is left over for Report the President will have an opportunity of consulting with the Parliamentary draftsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>In that connection might I read to the Senator the following suggestion:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The question whether the Bill is or is not a Money Bill shall forthwith be referred to a Committee of Privileges consisting of such number (not exceeding three) of members (if any) as shall be elected by Dáil Eireann within seven days after such reference such number (not exceeding three) of members (if any) as shall be elected by Seanad Eireann within such seven days, and a chairman who shall be the senior judge of the Supreme Court able and willing to act and who in the case of an equality of votes, but not otherwise, shall be entitled to vote.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that would be quite satisfactory.  The only thing I would like to point out is that in the suggested amendment which the President has read out he has got an imputation against either House in brackets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>

      <P>I was going to suggest that an effort should be made to meet the point made in Senator Johnson's amendment with regard to the Chairman.  I do not think it has been pointed out before that there is the danger of his becoming ill and that the Committee would not then be able to act.  With regard to the question of seven or ten days raised in the amendments in the names of Senator Johnson and myself, I would like to say in regard to that that I think the period should be seven days.  It is quite probable seven days would elapse before the Seanad gets the resolution. If that period were made ten days it would mean a total of seventeen days out of the full period of 21 days, and that in my opinion would be far too long.</P>

    <P>It shall be the duty of the Senate of the National University of Ireland, the Governing Body of the College, or the President of the College (as the case may be), when making an appointment to any office or situation in the College, to appoint to such office or situation a person who is competent to discharge the duties thereof through the medium of the Irish language: provided a person so competent and also suitable in all other respects is to be found amongst the persons who are candidates or otherwise available for such appointment.</P>

      <P>Section 3.  To add at the end of the section the words:&mdash;&ldquo;and when such person is not a candidate or otherwise available the appointment shall be made for a period not exceeding five years.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President, when speaking on this Bill in the Seanad last week, struck a note that I would like to emphasise in moving the amendment which stands in my name.  He said: &ldquo;It is not the purpose of the Government, nor is it, so far as I know, the purpose of any political party, to get persons into University positions whose only qualification would be a knowledge of the Irish language.&rdquo;  I wish to endorse that on behalf of the Party with which I am associated.  I hope that in considering amendments to this Bill the Seanad will approach the question from that point of view. The question is non-party and nonpolitical. The object of the amendment that I have moved is to strengthen the educational value of Irish in University College, Galway. <Col N="78" /> At the present time, as most Senators know, the fundamental policy of the Department of Education is the development and the extension of the Irish language.  The language is being used not merely in the schools of the Gaeltacht, but here in the city of Dublin, as the medium through which the main subjects of the primary education programme are being taught.</P>
    <P>I had occasion to meet quite recently some teachers who were engaged in teaching mathematics through the medium of Irish, and it is their considered opinion that the students who have been so taught have reached higher standards than pupils of the same age who have been taught through the medium of the English language, and similarly with regard to secondary education. The President also stated that what we hope to get is a real scholarly knowledge of the language, a scholarly knowledge of every subject if possible through that language, and the sooner the better.  The object of my amendment is that we shall have that grip on the language as soon as possible. The pupils trained in the primary and secondary schools, and taught through the medium of Irish, will eventually arrive at the stage when they must reach the professions through the university.  Surely it is our duty to provide for them as far as possible the means whereby they can take their courses through the medium of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>The Bill as it stands provides that appointments can be or may be made to chairs in the University College, Galway, of individuals who possess a sufficient knowledge of the language to do the work of the chair through that medium.  It also provides that the appointing body shall have the right to make the permanent appointment of an individual who has no knowledge of the Irish language if no candidate is presented with such a knowledge.  My amendment simply means this: that if the appointing body finds that there is no candidate, or no person otherwise available for <Col N="79" /> the appointment with a knowledge of Irish, that the appointment may be temporarily made for a period not exceeding five years.  My reason for bringing forward the amendment is because I feel we will eventually arrive at the point when we must supply university education for those who have received their primary and secondary education through the medium of Irish.  If professors who can conduct their business through the medium of the Irish language are not available now, however much we may regret that fact, we should not close the door on those who will be coming forward with a knowledge of Irish and who will have equipped themselves to teach through the medium of Irish.</P>
    <P>If the appointment were made for only five years or ten years the position would be different, and the door would not be closed on those who would come forward qualified with a knowledge of Irish.  I ask the Seanad to consider the amendment from an educational point of view.  I am not going into the relative merits of the present stamp of professors.  Neither am I suggesting that they cannot do their business through the medium of Irish.  I am thinking purely of the future.  We want to hasten the day when university education can be imparted through the medium of our own language.  In view of that we should abstain from making permanent appointments to chairs in the University College, Galway, of those who are not qualified to do all their work through the medium of the Irish language.</P>

      <P>I desire to support the amendment, and in doing so I do not wish to go over the ground Senator O'Doherty has travelled in giving his reasons why the Seanad should pass the amendment.  I would like to say, in the first place, that there is no mystery about the teaching of science through the medium of Irish, or any other language, and I would like to remind Senators that all the terms of art are classical, that is, they are Latin or Greek.  Whether you teach <Col N="80" /> scientific subjects such as physiology, botany, or any other subjects of that description, whether you teach in French, German, English or Irish, the terms of art, the main words, are all the same.  They are Greek or Latin words.  That is very convenient, because the meaning of the words never changes, and that is one of the reasons why Latin and Greek are selected for the purpose of giving names to the various terms of art in the various sciences.  Where is the difficulty in teaching mathematics, physiology, astronomy or any scientific subject, or even poetry, through the medium of Irish?  None whatever.  There are people who know more about this subject than I do, but I think it is quite possible to get professors at the present time&mdash;I imagine they would be tumbling over each other &mdash;who are capable of imparting a knowledge of any scientific subject through the medium of Irish.  The amendment proposes to restrict the appointment of a person not qualified to teach through Irish to a period not exceeding five years. That is a long temporary appointment. It has this advantage, that whoever is appointed can occupy his leisure hours during the five years in acquiring a knowledge of the Irish language.  If during the period of his appointment he devotes any attention to Irish, at the end of the five years he should be able to come forward as a candidate capable of teaching his subject through the medium of Irish.</P>

      <P>This Bill is for the purpose of extending the usefulness of University College, Galway.  We are all most anxious that the usefulness of the work of the college should be extended, but the amendment would only hamper the university authorities in the selection of their professorships.  I know of no university where there is such a limitation put on a governing body.  I can mention two instances of medical schools&mdash;Colombo and the Welsh universities&mdash;where the students all speak the native tongue, but there is no such limitation regarding <Col N="81" /> the professors.  There are no text-books in Irish on subjects such as physiology and anatomy.  I am not against Irish.  I am in favour of Irish being extended in every possible way.  If it had been proposed to appoint a professor to look after Irish folklore or Irish songs I would support it with my whole heart.  I think if we accept what is proposed in the amendment we will be hampering the college by interfering with their selection of the most suitable candidates.  Galway is handicapped in its medical school at present, and this amendment would kill the school.  No man in a permanent post who is fitted for his work is going to take a temporary post.</P>

      <P>The one bright spot in this Bill so far as I can see is that it provides for the appointment as professors of those who do not know the Irish language.  Nobody who is worth his salt as a university professor is going to take the position if the appointment is to be limited to five years.  The medical school in University College, Galway, is already handicapped and it will be still more handicapped if the proposal in the amendment is accepted. I do not know the number of medical students who qualified in the last seven years, as I have not returns by me, but they are surprisingly low. While we are waiting for the Irish language to be extended to embrace the terms that are necessary in the curricula of university education, apart from the fact that we are sacrificing the culture that language embodies, while the country is waiting for that to happen, what is to become of the school which has so far produced so few finished products? To equip the university with text-books in Irish on the different branches of science and art would cost about £2,000,000.  That is if we have only one dialect, but if we have three dialects current in the country it might easily cost £6,000,000.  If I had £6,000,000 to distribute in Galway I would spend it in Galway, for Europe begins at Galway; but this sort of thing will make Europe and <Col N="82" /> culture end in Galway.  It is pathetic to think that people's patriotism is supposed to have this climax in a dialect or three dialects.  The limitation of Galway's university efficiency to five years is a thing we ought to set our face against.  I am strongly opposed to the amendment.</P>

      <P>The kernel of this Bill is to make provision for teaching in Galway College through the medium of Irish.  The President alluded to the fears of our friends over there, that if there is no competent person to teach through the medium of Irish that somebody else should get the Chair, so that it should not lie fallow.  I think that was made plain in Section 3 of the Bill.  If some arrangement is not made, such as is suggested in the amendment.  I think the teaching of English will be stabilised in the College, for if you appoint a man in a year's time to teach any subject he is appointed indefinitely if he cannot teach through the medium of Irish. I think an appointment of that sort is against the whole principle of the Bill, and, therefore, I support the amendment.  I think that possibly three years would be better than five.  Any person who gets the appointment for five years should be able to master the Irish language in that period.  He will live in the University with the Irish language all around him, and if he cannot do something for the Irish language in the five years, it shows that he does not want to learn Irish.  Senator Sir Edward Coey Bigger says that he has no objection to professors teaching folklore, and so on, through Irish.  That is exactly where the enemies of the Irish language want to keep Irish, confined to the teaching of folklore and not letting it outside such narrow limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator also told us that he has no hope of professors coming forward with a sufficient knowledge of the language to be able to teach scientific subjects through it.  Of course he has no hopes, for he has no faith, and he cannot have hope without faith.  The Senator has no <Col N="83" /> faith in the Irish language, and, therefore, he has no hope.  When listening to the Senator I was reminded of what I heard twenty years ago when the National University was being put on its feet.  We were then told we were going to debase Irish university life by insisting that a knowledge of Irish was necessary for matriculation.  Nobody is admitted to the National University without a knowledge of Irish.  I think that what the University has accomplished in the twenty years of its existence justified what was done when it was being started, and as the National University has justified itself so, I think, the teaching of subjects through Irish will justify itself.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Doherty in dealing with his amendment said he was discussing it entirely from the educational point of view From that point of view I cordially agree with him.  It is from that point of view we ought to discuss the amendment.  The last time we discussed this subject it was a case of abusing the plaintiff's attorney instead of discussing the Bill.  Supporters of the propagation of the Irish language must see that they are quite wrong in imputing to us that we do not want to see the Irish language going forward.  We are told that all the people of the Free State should be taught Irish, and that a knowledge of the Irish language will improve our nationality and everything else.  We are not discussing that point of view. I think that those who are responsible for the education of our people in the Irish language should take care that they cannot be accused of pushing the subject to such an extent that they would interfere with the education of our Irish students in all the other matters with which they have to deal.  I think if the amendment is passed it will undoubtedly for a good many years to come interfere with the education of students in Galway College in the ordinary subjects which they have to learn.  It is perfectly true that <Col N="84" /> you cannot get highly scientific professors and men learned in other subjects to take up appointments which are only for five years.</P>
      <P>I hope the professors in Galway College will live long but if they drop out their places will have to be filled, and then notice goes out to the world of learning that the appointment is to be for five years.  I think that all university professors and students who intend to follow that kind of life will not study for that.  If we pass this amendment we will probably ruin the education of Galway College for years to come.  It is from that point of view we want to debate the subject, and we should not be pushing forward the Irish language into such a place that any ordinary person can see is going to interfere with the education of the students in that College for years to come.  It is being pushed into a position in which it ought not to be placed in any university. If the professors and teachers in that University, or College, are not of the highest class then the students also will not be of the highest class, and their chances in life are being interfered with, and the reputation of that College will go down, for it will not get the right class of students who will reflect credit on the University College. If the professors are men of learning equipped for their places they will reflect credit on their College by the teaching of their students, who will get degrees that will be of use to them in after life.  I do not think that type of professor would be got if we pass this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">

      <P>It has been suggested that there may not be candidates equipped to teach certain subjects through the medium of the Irish language; and also that there would be candidates forthcoming, and, in fact, tumbling over one another, who would be qualified in that respect. It has further been said that if such candidates did not come forward there are men who are not equipped for the teaching of subjects through the medium of Irish who would be forthcoming.  It has been said that <Col N="85" /> no competent person would take a temporary appointment with the risk of his services being dispensed with at the end of five years.  I suggest to the proposer of the amendment to add to the end of it the words: &ldquo;unless in the meantime the person so appointed shall qualify to discharge the duties of the appointment through the medium of the Irish language.&rdquo;  I think that no man of intelligence coming forward as a candidate for such an appointment would fail to qualify in Irish after five years if he devoted any attention at all to it in the interval. In fact, in Galway University, where he would be surrounded by Irish speakers, a man could not fail to learn the Irish language in five years.  He would absorb it through his pores, because it would be spoken around him every day, even if he did not absorb it through his intelligence.  I think an inducement should be held out that there would be no cast-iron cutting off of the appointment in five years, and that it would rest with themselves to continue the appointment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express the hope that the Seanad will not carry this amendment.  I am opposing it because it is not in accordance with the general idea we had in mind when framing the Bill.  In drafting this measure our notion of how things would proceed was that we should set out in legal form the object to be aimed at, that we should indicate, as we do indicate in this section, that we assist the College in moving towards that object, but we do not try to tie up the College, or the Governing Body of the College, or we could have put many provisions in the Bill which would coerce them along that particular line.  I believe that none of the multitudinous provisions we could put into this Bill for strengthening the position of Irish in the College would be of any real avail unless the Governing Body of the College itself, and the various officers of the College, are anxious to push Irish.  I am very anxious that Galway College <Col N="86" /> should become a truly Gaelic or Irish University at the earliest possible date, but I believe that will be done only when the people in the College realise thoroughly that if the College is to have an important future it will have that important future by doing everything it can in Irish and for Irish.</P>
      <P>I think that the only way to get ahead is to lay that duty on the College in a legal form and to indicate, as is indicated in this Bill, that they will get assistance in doing that work, and then leave it to those in the College who believe in the future of the Irish language and in the need for fully restoring the Irish language to its proper place in the national life.  I believe that the time is not far distant when the Governing Body itself will be prepared to make a temporary appointment rather than appoint some person not capable of carrying out instruction through Irish, provided it sees somebody in the offing who is likely to fill the office.  If there is nobody in the offing who is likely to fill the office, it would be better to appoint a good professor who will do his work through English than to appoint an indifferent professor who would do his work through Irish.  I believe that we will not increase the prestige of the language itself by having subjects taught through Irish by people who are not really competent to teach these subjects through Irish. On the other hand, it will often happen that the Governing Body will be able to say that while there is nobody at present available who can teach the subject through Irish there will soon be somebody.  I know a particular subject that at the moment there is nobody at all in this country able to teach through the medium of Irish up to a University standard, but I know that there is an exceptionally brilliant student in that subject with a splendid knowledge of Irish.  I think that in that particular case in two or three years time it will be possible to make an appointment of a person who can give instruction through Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the Governing Body of Galway College will realise that <Col N="87" /> great things, from the College point of view, depend on their doing their best, and that where such an applicant is likely to come forward in a short time they will themselves voluntarily keep the place open for him.  I have known colleges to do it when there was no question of Irish involved; I have known them to hold places open for brilliant young people who were coming on, and I believe that Galway College itself will voluntarily hold places open.  They will be more likely to do that if they are not tied up with this five years limit, because while an appointment might be only for five years, a person who would be available in two years' time might not be available in five years' time.  I could devise a whole code for tying up the Governing Body of the College, but I deliberately, in directing the drafting of this Bill, refrained from putting such provisions in, because I know that even the best person who is put in will not be able to do anything if he has not the assistance and the general support of the College.  I know that there have been many cases of professors, actually appointed, who might give instruction through Irish but who have not done it and who might not do it, because for a long time it would be heavier work for any professor to give instruction through the Irish language in nearly every subject than it would be if he gave it through English, and unless you have the right spirit in the College, the problem will not be by any means solved simply by appointing people who will be capable of giving instruction through Irish, because after their appointment they may proceed to give that instruction through English.</P>
    <P>I think that the difficulties about giving instruction through Irish have been greatly exaggerated in the discussions here, and I also think that people who have been too ready to forget that there is a wide difference between excluding the Irish language altogether from a particular <Col N="88" /> classroom and giving instruction entirely through Irish in that classroom. In certain cases I believe that if you have a person who knows the subject and who knows Irish he can give all his lectures in Irish, though he may perhaps have to refer the students to various textbooks in other languages.  As a matter of fact, in a great many subjects, although the lectures are given through English, the students are referred to textbooks in languages other than English, and it would certainly be the case that in certain subjects, even if the lectures were given through Irish, the students would have to work with textbooks in other languages.  But it would be a great gain, even if the students had to work with textbooks in other languages, from the point of Irish to have the lectures given through Irish.  A Senator referred to the question of folklore.  Folklore is important, and it is a thing that will not be available in another generation or two if not attended to and collected.  But I am positive that the Irish language cannot live as a fireside or a country language merely; it can only live if it is used and has to be used by all classes and for all the purposes for which a language is used, by people of education as well as by people of no education.  I am extremely anxious that it should be increasingly used in the Universities, and I think that it will be increasingly used, in spite of such difficulties as exist, say, in the matter of textbooks.</P>
    <P>In respect of some subjects I think it will be possible to remedy to a very large extent the textbook difficulty without great delay or great expense.  It should be remembered that even if all the textbooks that students will be required to use are not available in Irish, if there is a reasonable number of textbooks available, instruction can be very efficiently done through Irish, and if you have a good enough professor it can be done efficiently even without textbooks. But when the textbooks are available, the task of the professor who is teaching through Irish will be <Col N="89" /> very greatly lightened.  For the present it will be heavy.</P>
    <P>I would like to come back to my original point, that if the Governing Body of Galway College does not want to promote the use of Irish all sorts of pretences can be put up. There is nothing I would be more afraid of than the thing which Senator Kenny suggested, that a man might be put in for a period of five years and that he would make himself able to give instruction through Irish within five years, that his appointment might be continued, because you could have people carrying on in some kind of way with some sort of Irish, but it would really be much better for the language if they frankly gave their lectures in English.  Unless a man who was not qualified at the time of his appointment voluntarily obtained a proper knowledge of the language I would rather allow him to continue his lectures in English. There are people at present in various colleges who would undertake to give their lectures through Irish if any pressure were applied to them, but I think it would be of no advantage to the language to have them giving their lectures in halting, inefficient and incorrect Irish.  I think that they would be better left alone.  It is an important thing not to have that particular temptation put in the way of the University.  There is no doubt that if a man has been in a position for five years, if he is liked amongst his fellows, is otherwise popular in the University, if he talks any sort of Irish and makes any sort of attempt to do his work through Irish, a point will be stretched in his favour and people will say: &ldquo;Do not deprive him of his livelihood.  Look at his young family,&rdquo; and so on.  He will be kept on and he will do a great deal of harm instead of good to the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I have given a great deal of consideration to this matter during the past two years, and nothing that has been said here has at all shaken me in the belief that the thing cannot be done by any form of coercion or regulation.  If we are driven to <Col N="90" /> coercion and regulation we will have to take complete State control of the College, have State appointments and power of dismissal, and all that sort of thing.  I do not advocate that, but if we cannot believe that we can convince the Governing Body that it is their duty and their interest to go ahead with the work, the right thing to do would simply be to have State control.</P>
    <P>I do think that there is some point in the argument that was raised in opposition.  I do believe that you will not have very good candidates coming forward.  It will happen for some years that people able to teach a subject through Irish will not be available, and that somebody who has not a knowledge of Irish will have to be appointed.  You will not have good candidates coming forward. Some people will stand out altogether, in the belief that when they do not know Irish their chances are no good, knowing in any case that if they did get such appointments they would only be for a five-years' period and that they would be pretty sure to go at the end of the five years.  I think that very mediocre candidates, or candidates that were scarcely even mediocre, will come forward.  I think that the appointment of such candidates and the effect that it would have on the reputation of the College would do more harm than good.  As I said in the Dáil, I am satisfied that already, since the settlement, which is really confirmed by this Bill, was made with University College, Galway, a great change has come over the spirit of that College, and while, of course, there are still people in it who are opposed to doing anything for Irish, those who are in favour of doing things for Irish have their hands strengthened and are able to make their weight felt, and that position is going to improve every year.  I feel quite confident that Senators need have no doubt that things will be done as well as any of us could desire them to be done, and that they will be done, taking everything into account, as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point that I would like to raise in connection with this amendment, a point which seems to me to be very frequently overlooked.  We have been discussing for some time now the possible relative qualifications of professors, what would be equitable and just to the professors, and how we could get the right professors, and it has been said that we could not get the right professors if we only appoint them for five years.  It seems to me that something ought to be said about the student's point of view.  As said last week, we have already two universities in the State catering entirely for the English-speaking population of the country. We have the small University College of Galway, which is the one element that might be claimed as a cultural centre, from the university point of view, of the Gaelic and the potentially Gaelic student.  I think it is only fair, with the other universities available and in view of the obvious intention of the Government and of most right-thinking Irish people to establish the Irish language on a proper basis, that we should at least do all that is possible to develop this one Gaelic centre of university culture in the country.  I think that we ought to lay ourselves out as far as possible to cater for the Gaelic-speaking students who will go to that University.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, we have been discussing it all from the professor's point of view; I want to speak on it from the student's point of view.  Supposing we have in that college 200, 300, or 400 students, many of whom must inevitably know Irish, must have it as their native tongue or have got it through the primary education system, which is compulsory Irish, and through the secondary education system, which is also compulsory Irish, are we going to force these to learn English that they may become educated citizens of the Irish Free State?  I claim that the student's point of view ought to count to some extent.  In the other House a Deputy who was a medical officer recently said that in a hospital where there were 300 patients it was <Col N="92" /> absolutely essential for the medical officer to know Irish in order to make diagnoses.  I mention that merely as explaining the position of the Gaeltacht, and I think that we ought to accept this amendment in the belief that we will arrest at some point the permeation of English culture and outlook in every activity of Irish education as it stands at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said he felt that the Governing Body themselves may make temporary appointments. If that is the case all the arguments that have been advanced against temporary appointments are knocked on the head.  I want to be quite fair, I see the possible danger and the difficulty of making temporary appointments.  I see that men of eminence in their own branches of learning may not be ready to accept appointments for five years.  But I do claim that we have a peculiar position to face, that we have to put a full stop at some point on the inroads of the university professors controlling our education entirely through the medium of English.  One other point I want to make in regard to that is that from what I know of university professors, they are a class who continue to live for a very long time.  It seems to me that if you place a university professor comfortably in his Chair, he will stay there until he has long grey hair almost down to his toes.  Five years may seem a very short time to people like that, but I am serious about it in this regard. We may be installing them for an average period of twenty-five to thirty years, and during that time there will be no possibility of getting these subjects taught through the medium of Irish.  If the House is satisfied with that, well and good, but if it feels that it wants Irish to be used as a medium of education in the university within a reasonable time, then I suggest that the amendment is the only way out.</P>
    <P>With regard to what Senator Gogarty has said, of course Senator Gogarty always thinks in millions. He talked about six million pounds' worth of books.  I am very glad to <Col N="93" /> hear that we will require so many books to replace the English, Latin and Greek editions that we have in our universities.  In spite of all the statements about our being a nation of saints and scholars, I doubt very much if his estimate of our book values is accurate.  With regard to other arguments, I am afraid I must confess I have a great deal of sympathy. We have had sympathy expressed by Senator Jameson.  I am sure it is a weight off all our minds to know that Senator Jameson is quite sympathetic to Irish.  I certainly felt relief.  But it is, I am afraid, lip service&mdash;that we may study little Gaelic stories and folklore and all the rest of it, but as regards making it a practical proposition by getting the Irish people to the point where they will live and think in the Irish language, that desire does not exist.  I suggest that the only way to do that is by means of Galway.  We are making a plea for the smallest university college in Ireland.  We have Trinity, the National, and Cork, and there is the Queen's University in Belfast.  This little college is in the last stronghold of Gaelic culture.  Even if we inconvenience certain people and if it seems drastic, it is up to us to see that this college is put on its feet as soon as possible as the centre of Gaelic education and culture.</P>

      <P>I am going to vote against this amendment because I think it altogether unnecessary.  I am a member of the Governing Body of University College, Galway, and I can assure the House that there is not the slightest necessity for this amendment.  In every case I think that the Governing Body of the college is quite alive to the fact that their existence depends on the way in which they carry out the provisions of this Bill.  I know that in every case they will do their best to make the college Irish, and I know of one case where a professor is more or less on probation.  He did not know very much Irish when he was appointed, but he has practically qualified now to teach in Irish as well as any of the other professors. <Col N="94" /> They will do the best they can, and I think this amendment is altogether unnecessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the amendment helps to fulfil the intentions of the Bill, and if one accepts the Bill and its general purport the amendment appears to be reasonable.  One cannot but take note of the argument of the Minister for Finance, knowing as we do how intensely enthusiastic he is to secure the object which the Bill sets out to accomplish.  But there is an aspect of the question which has not been touched upon.  I do not know what the practice is with regard to the appointments of university professors, but I know, as a matter of fact, that there are very frequent changes in professorships, and I am not sure whether five years is not a fairly complete life for a professorship. In one university I know, in certain subjects the changes have been much more rapid than that, and I wonder whether it would not be a good thing if professors were always appointed only for five years.  That is, perhaps, beside the point, but taking the argument in regard to educational qualifications and the value from an educational point of view, of Galway University, and the fear that has been expressed regarding the quality and status of the professors that may be appointed we will have to bear in mind that this university is starting a new life, as one might say, and there have been a great many statements made, statements of the kind which would reach the professorial class, which would tend to lower the prestige of the college in their minds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, three speeches were made here to-day by Senators who, I imagine, have been through universities, and these speeches will reach the kind of teacher who had got to a lectureship and who might be an aspirant for a professorship somewhere. The tendency of these speeches, and other speeches which have been made, will be to lower the prestige of the college in the eyes of prospective professors.  That being the case, there is the possibility&mdash;I <Col N="95" /> will not say the likelihood&mdash;that highly-qualified men, in view of these statements, are not so likely to be applicants for professorships in these circumstances.  But at the end of five years the college will have established itself, will have made its name and strengthened its position, and then the most highly-qualified professor might well be attracted to make application for professorships there.  That seems to me to be the real reason why appointments that may be made within the next year or two should be specifically for a limited period, because in view of the general atmosphere that has been created I think we have to anticipate that the most highly-qualified men who are not Irish speakers&mdash;I am now assuming that there are certain Chairs for which there are not Irish speakers available&mdash;will have been deterred from seeking appointments on account of the attempted lowering of the prestige which the anti-Irish speeches which have been made will have brought about.  In view of these circumstances I think that we should make provision for the probability that the prestige will have been regained and enhanced at the end of five years, and that if there is a new appointment to be made at that time, and that highly-qualified Irish speakers are not available, highly-qualified English speakers will be available.  Therefore I think the amendment is worthy of support.</P>

      <P>I have listened very attentively to the debate on this amendment, and I am amazed at the extraordinary amount of agreement which has been arrived at.  I think we all, whether we are very keen about the teaching of the Irish language or not, feel that if Irish is to be taught in the national schools, if it is to be made a qualifying subject for the professions, it is a natural corollary that people should be able to get Irish instruction in the universities.  It simply boils down now to a question whether the Seanad will be satisfied or not to let this amendment drop and leave it to the authorities of the <Col N="96" /> different universities to take such steps as they think right.  After what the lady Senator, who is more conversant with Galway than anybody else, has told us, I think that we might be perfectly satisfied that the authorities of Galway College will see that Irish does not suffer in the college.  I think it is very gratifying, after the violent debate which we had, to see such a measure of agreement to-day.  I will vote against this amendment if the Senator presses it to a division.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to say that I differ from the Minister on this occasion, because on this subject, at all events, I believe we have always been in agreement previously. I have always congratulated him on that fact, which shows that he is right.  But here it seems to me from all that he has said, that he is contradictory.  He thinks it may be right to appoint people temporarily and for five years, but he thinks it is better to take the chance and see what the university professors will do.  I am not very fond of professors.  Everybody who knows anything about professors will know that they are very conservative and that they very reluctantly change their habits.  Those who are in favour of the English language and not in favour of the Irish language are also very conservative, and it is very hard to make any of them see things as we see them.  Therefore, I think it is best not to be trusting to chance as to what these professors might do.  Supposing the Minister and those who have spoken with him are not right.  Supposing that in the next few months there is a vacancy of the sort we speak of; supposing the university does not do what he says they will do, and that they appoint some person permanently, he may stop there for thirty or forty or fifty years for all we know.  How can we go back on that?  We cannot; we will be fixed simply because we took a chance in the matter.  I am not inclined to take chances at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to other matters, I am sorry that some people seem perpetually <Col N="97" /> to be putting a drag on the question of Irish as the language of this country, because although they may really imagine that they are not doing so, according to our minds they are putting a regular drag on it.  It always seems to me that, latent in their minds, whether they recognise it or not, there is a perpetual idea that Irish is a vulgar and an incompetent language, that it is a language that cannot be much used by anybody, that it should be only a kind of secondary language in this country, and that it would be very much better if it was not even that.  They also seem to have the idea that it is extraordinarily difficult to learn the language.  Suppose that an Irish professor, an eminent and a clever young man, goes over to France and teaches his subject for five years.  Is there anybody here who will tell me that at the end of five years, if he takes the trouble and is a man of ordinary intelligence, he will not be able to teach in the French language?  It does not take five years to learn a language if people set out to do it.  I feel quite sure that any ordinary person who went over to France or Germany, without knowing a word of their languages, at the end of five years would be quite competent to teach in them.  We have had recently two German professors in our Museum.  Neither of them knew very much English when they came over, and yet they could do their business very well.  Unfortunately, one of them has died since.  But after they had been a very short time in the place both of them were able to do their business perfectly well in English.  I have been all over the world and I have seen people learning languages quite readily and without any difficulty.  I learned <Col N="98" /> some languages myself in a sort of a way&mdash;very badly, I admit, but I could use them in a conversational way&mdash;and I do not admit that this difficulty exists at all.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out that we are asking very little.  The ancestors of those people of conservative mind who opposed us, endeavoured for 700 years to suppress the Irish language.  Whatever else they say that is what we think.  I would ask them to remember that they have had every opportunity, by force and other means, and after 700 years they have not succeeded.  They know the pressure that has been used against Irish, even in the last ten or twelve years, when people were put in prison for writing their names in Irish.  Would it not be a little more generous for them to say &ldquo;very well, the feeling of the country to-day is in favour of this. We have tried to stop it but we see we were wrong and we failed.  Now go as far as you can.&rdquo;  I think everybody here will agree that if Irish is to be the common language of the country the sooner it is made so the better, that the longer it is in a state of transition in which we know a little of one language and a little of another the worse it will be.  If I had thought that a knowledge of the language would not have been developed quickly and permanently I never would have been in favour of it at all.  I always supported it because I believe it is&mdash;I will not say easy, but capable of being learned in a very short time.  For that reason I think the sooner it is done and the sooner we get a free hand to carry our way the better.  Holding that view, I shall certainly vote in favour of the amendment.</P>

    <P>the expression &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; means and includes the council of a county, the council of a county or other borough, and the council of an urban district,</P>
    <P>the word &ldquo;owner&rdquo; when used in relation to a national monument means the person for the time being having such estate or interest in such monument as entitles him to the actual possession and occupation thereof,</P>
    <P>the word &ldquo;monument&rdquo; includes any artificial or partly artificial building, structure, or erection whether above or below the surface of the ground and whether affixed or not affixed to the ground and any cave, stone, or other natural product whether forming part of or attached to or not attached to the ground which has been artificially carved, sculptured or worked upon or which (where it does not form part of the ground) appears to have been purposely put or arranged in position and any prehistoric or ancient tomb, grave or burial deposit, but does not include any building which is for the time being habitually used for ecclesiastical purposes,</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;national monument&rdquo; means a monument or the remains of a monument the preservation of which is a matter of national importance by reason of the historical, architectural, traditional, artistic, or archæological interest attaching thereto and also includes (but not so as to limit, extend or otherwise influence the construction of the foregoing general definition) every monument in Saorstát Eireann to which the Ancient Monuments Protection Acts, 1882, applied immediately before the passing of this Act, and the said expression shall be construed as including, in addition to the monument itself, the site of the monument and the means of access thereto and also such portion of land adjoining such site as may be required to fence, cover in, or otherwise preserve from injury the monument or to preserve the amenities thereof,</P>
    <P>the word &ldquo;maintain&rdquo; when used in relation to a national monument <Col N="101" /> includes the cleaning, repairing, railing off, fencing, and covering in of such monument and the doing of all such other acts and things as may be necessary or expedient for the preservation or protection thereof, and cognate words shall be construed accordingly,</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;archæological object&rdquo; means any chattel whether in a manufactured or partly manufactured or an unmanufactured state which by reason of its antiquity or the archæological or historical interest attaching thereto has a value substantially greater than its intrinsic value, and the said expression includes ancient human and animal remains but does not include treasure trove in which the rights of the State have not been waived.</P>

      <P>In the section natural caves are included under the heading of monuments, which includes &ldquo;any cave, stone, or other natural product, whether forming part of or attached to or not attached to the ground which has been artificially carved, sculptured or worked upon.&rdquo;  The object of my amendment is to ensure that a natural cave which has not been carved or sculptured or worked upon shall come under the heading of a national monument.  As a matter of fact some of the natural caves would have been greatly injured if any attempt had been made to interfere with the work of nature in their formation.  The amendment is to increase the number of objects that may be brought under the heading of national monuments.  I fear that as the Bill stands a natural cave would be excluded unless it was sculptured or worked upon.</P>

      <P>I am afraid it will be necessary for me to oppose this amendment because it would strain the scope of <Col N="102" /> the Bill very much to try to include in it natural caves or anything of that kind.  I quite agree with Senator Linehan that it is a desirable thing to endeavour to preserve those objects of curiosity and interest and of great scenic beauty, but if we were to include caves like Mitchelstown caves, which I think he has in view, there is no reason why we should not include the Lakes of Killarney, the Giant's Causeway, if it happened to be in Saorstát Eireann, or any such natural features.  If we were to deal with matters of that kind I think it would be necessary to introduce a different kind of Bill, a Bill perhaps dealing with tourist development, or national parks, or something of that kind.  This amendment is quite outside the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am surprised that the Parliamentary Secretary is opposing this very reasonable amendment.  In the definition of &ldquo;monument&rdquo; there is the word &ldquo;cave&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;monument&rsquo; includes any artificial or partly artificial building, structure, or erection, whether above or below the surface of the ground and whether affixed or not affixed to the ground and any cave, stone, or other natural product whether forming part of or attached to or not attached to the ground which has been artificially carved.&rdquo; Does the Parliamentary Secretary intend that this is to be confined to artificial excavation?  If it is to apply to artificial excavations, why should it not apply to natural excavations, which are of more importance from an archaeological point of view than artificial excavations? Then there is the other obvious comment. Taking the Mitchelstown <Col N="103" /> caves as they are&mdash;unspoilt&mdash;in order to come within this definition it would be necessary to make some artificial carvings in them.  I support the amendment, and I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that there is no great harm, and certainly a great deal of good in it.</P>

It would be much better to leave the Bill as it is.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to say that the last speaker and the Parliamentary Secretary are not thoroughly informed on the subject of caves.  The most important palæolithic and neolithic discoveries that have been made have been made in caves.  In ancient days the people lived in caves, and the remains of the successions of people who lived in these countries ten thousand, twelve thousand and twenty thousand years ago, up to five or six thousand years ago, have been heaped in caves one over another. So that when you want to know what sort of people lived in a country at a particular time you have only to dig into caves and you will find a succession of layers which may date even from the very earliest times to comparatively late times.  It was in these natural caves that people hid in old times.  For example, in the south of France and in parts of Spain the most wonderful discoveries have been made.  I think that to exclude natural caves from the operations of this Bill is really absurd.  There are some caves in this country which, from the geological point of view, are the most interesting in the world.</P>

I have seen in many parts of the country caves of the character described by Senator Linehan.  I think it is the duty of this House to arouse the interest of the people in the care and preservation of them.  A great deal is being done as regards the restoration and spread of the national language.  I think that people should be encouraged to aid in the preservation of all archæological objects.  I congratulate the Government on the introduction of this Bill which will have the effect of preserving our national monuments. The amendment which Senator Linehan has moved, if accepted, will have the effect of aiding such a praiseworthy object as the preservation of objects of archæological and national interest.</P>

      <P>The object which Senator Linehan is seeking to secure, and the argument of Senator Moore, are answered in the next paragraph of the section.  &ldquo;The expression &lsquo;national monument&rsquo; means a monument or the remains of a monument the preservation of which is a matter of national importance by reason of the historical, architectural, traditional, artistic, or archæological interest attaching thereto.&rdquo;  If it is merely a cave which may have no particular national interest, traditional, artistic, archæological or historical, then it does not come within the definition of national monument, but if it is, as Senator Moore suggests, a cave which has a particular traditional, archæological or historical <Col N="105" /> interest then it comes under that definition of national monument.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out that these caves have no tradition? No one knows anything about them. There is no tradition about them. They were occupied twenty thousand years ago, and they ought to be preserved.  At present people go into those caves and see nothing. They simply appear to them to be a natural object like a mountain. What we ought to secure under this Bill is that they are preserved so that trained archæologists will be able to examine them scientifically and with care.  At present the bottom of the ground in them shows nothing in particular, but when digging is carried out scientifically to a depth of twenty, thirty or fifty feet you find these different layers to which I have already referred.  We want to see that they are preserved until such time as trained archæologists will have an opportunity of thoroughly investigating them and reporting on them.  These caves have never been excavated.  That is one reason why we should be particularly anxious about them because we have no archæological or human remains belonging to the palæolithic period in this country.  It is not at all certain that such remains may not be discovered in some of these caves. Everyone interested in the archæology and history of the country should be anxious to see that these caves are excavated.  It is for that reason that Senator Linehan wants to have them preserved against the profane hands of people who might go into them and start digging.</P>

The latter, of course, is not.  I submit that it should be the duty of the Government to protect places like these either under this Bill or under some other Bill.  I suggest that these natural caves are or may be equally important from the geological point of view or any other point of view that you like as a structure such as the Giant's Causeway or the Lakes of Killarney.  I think that this amendment is a perfectly reasonable one, and that it ought to be included in this Bill.

      <P>If that is so, why is not the amendment accepted? Following what Senator Johnson has said, that the word &ldquo;monument&rdquo; covers it, I would like to know what is the interpretation of the word &ldquo;monument&rdquo;?  I have never heard the words &ldquo;natural cave&rdquo; included in the interpretation of the word &ldquo;monument,&rdquo; nor do I think that a natural cave is a monument.  A monument seems to me to indicate something that has been constructed rather than a natural thing.  The Minister said, in resisting the amendment, that if it were to be accepted it would mean extending the scope of the Bill too much, and that the next step would be to include places like the Lakes <Col N="107" /> of Killarney.  There is a tremendous difference between extending the scope of the Bill to include natural caves, and the extension that would be required to bring under this measure the Lakes of Killarney.  The only extension that Senator Linehan is anxious to secure is one that will bring under the Bill natural caves in addition to caves that have been sculptured or worked upon, and I think the Parliamentary Secretary should agree to that.  If one wanted to evade the purpose of the Bill, there is an open and easy method of doing so, but, as I have said, I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will see his way to grant the little extension that Senator Linehan requires, and include under the Bill natural caves as well as caves that have been sculptured or worked upon.</P>

      <P>What is troubling me about this amendment is this, that it is intended to bring in merely natural caves inside the provisions of this Bill.  That means that these are to come under the guardianship of the Department concerned.  The question then arises: What is to become of the beneficial interest that the owner has in these caves?  These natural caves, that are only natural, are used by the owners of them for the purpose of making money out of them.  I have no doubt that if you went to Senator Linehan's cave at Mitchelstown you would be charged 2/6 to get into it.  If there is nothing only a natural cave at Mitchelstown, and that is all that there is there, I do not see that we have any duty at all to take it in under the Bill.</P>

      <P>I think that for once in his life Senator Brown has made a mistake, because he has suggested that, by putting in the words &ldquo;natural cave,&rdquo; these words would take the property in the cave out of the present owners.  That is not the case.  All that the amendment does is to have the words &ldquo;natural cave&rdquo; included in the definition of national monuments, and to authorise the owner, if he likes, to make a grant. If the owner wishes, he can make a grant to the people in Dublin or to the local authorities.  If he does make a grant of the guardianship of the cave, then the local authorities will look after it.  I think on this occasion Senator Brown has made a mistake, and that he will find there is no substance in the contention he has put forward.</P>

      <P>With regard to the point made by Senator Brown as to the owner's rights, I have a later amendment, under which I propose to provide for compensation for the owner in the event of the Commissioners taking over the cave.  I was rather surprised that the Parliamentary Secretary should have adopted such a non-possumus attitude on this matter, for this cave is actually within his own constituency and he ought to know more about it.  The carving on these caves, if it may be called carving, was done by nature. Immense columns of stalactites and stalagmites meet each other in these caves, and they are most interesting from the geological and other points of view.  I think it is a pity that <Col N="109" /> they should not be brought in under this Bill and put in charge of the Commissioner of Public Works. Very little expense would make them easily accessible to the public. <Col N="110" /> I hope that the Minister will reconsider his attitude and accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>My object in bringing forward the amendment is to include in the Bill a number of articles which it is very important should be retained in the country.  Other amendments which I have down are consequential to this one.  I want to secure that movable objects such as bronze swords, spearheads, etc., shall be treated in the same way as gold ornaments, and other things that are treasure trove, and failure to hand over which to the Government renders one liable to a penalty.  These might be objects such as earthenware urns, and things of that sort, which may be of no intrinsic value in themselves but on account of their archæological interest more valuable than some of the gold objects.  These may represent the sub-structure of a whole period of history, and may show what tribes settled in the country, what part of Europe they came from, and so on.  I want to preserve these objects.  They are often thrown away or lost.  I had at Ballinasloe a very good spearhead with all the fastenings in position.  I had intended to hand it over to the National Museum, but it was stolen some years ago.  At all events, when I went to look for it it was gone, and perhaps it was sold out of the country.  There are many things in this country that are of value from an archæological point of view.  Of course if these are acquired they should be paid for.  In a later amendment I suggest that in case of dispute the price should be fixed by the District Justice.  I did not know the law when I put that down, and perhaps some Senator would suggest a better person than the District Justice to act in that capacity, say the keeper of the gold ornaments.</P>

      <P>It would.  In supporting the amendment I wish to say that this Section 11, of sub-section (1) as it stands gives power to the Commissioners with the consent of the Minister to acquire a national monument.  All we ask by the amendment is to give power to the Commissioners with the consent of the Minister to acquire an archæological object compulsorily.  The difficulty about the matter is that a great many of these archæological objects have been found throughout the country in bogs and other places by people who have no way of storing them and who place very little value upon them, and so they get mislaid, lost, or sent out of the country.  Only two months ago I saw two bronze swords of beautiful workmanship that were found in a bog in County Clare.  There was considerable difficulty in getting these two bronze swords into the Museum, because there was really no compulsory power.  One of them was of exceptional value, because it suggested that we could find the handle of that bronze sword, and if that handle is found it will be the only bronze sword handle in any museum in the world.  If Senator Guinness has a valuable archæological object in his possession I am sure the Minister would never consent to have it taken out of his collection. There must be some reason in everything. The only object of the amendment is to place an archæological object like a bronze sword in the same position as a monument, such as an ogham stone or something like that, and give the Commissioners power to take it over if the Minister consents.  I think this is a reasonable amendment.</P>

      <P>I would like to know whether the Parliamentary Secretary would consider strengthening his authority with regard to advertisements. The section gives power to local authorities to make by-laws to help in the preservation of national monuments, but because of the fact that it is a national monument it thereby goes outside the scope of local by-laws, and one can conceive quite readily of a local authority not being very much concerned with or aware of the means of preserving such a monument, yet by virtue of the fact that it is a national monument there should be some authority to over-ride the local authority in respect of such matters. I think the fact that we have defined a national monument in the way we have makes it right and proper there should be some authority to make it mandatory on the local authority, which is the only authority having power to make the by-laws under this Bill to make such by-laws as are necessary. I cannot draw up an amendment to meet the point, but I hope the Minister will consider the matter and extend the necessary authority in some way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I looked into this matter rather carefully.  After going through the Bill I found it was not necessary to strengthen it in this particular way.  On the Committee Stage of the Bill in the Dáil I think we improved the definition of a national monument by adding to the definition a provision that a monument should include the means of access thereto and also such portion of land adjoining such site as may be required for the preservation of the amenities thereof.  From the prohibition clause in Section 14, which is very wide, it is quite obvious that we have power to prevent unsightly advertisements being erected in any place which is likely to interfere with the amenities of a national monument.  A number of monuments would be under the care of the local authorities, and I think it would be inadvisable that we should interfere with them in whatever <Col N="118" /> measures they may consider necessary for the preservation of the monuments.  I think it would be inadvisable to accept the amendment, as it would only lead to confusion.</P>

      <P>I merely wish to repeat what I said on the previous occasion.  I think it is desirable to make it easier for a local authority, say an urban district council, to appoint an advisory committee than would be the case under the section as drafted.  Sub-section (3)  provides that members of a local advisory committee shall be &ldquo;persons having practical experience or special knowledge of architecture, archæology or some kindred subject.&rdquo; I do not think that one can say with any assurance that the average urban council contains within its radius more than two persons with a special knowledge of architecture, archæology, or kindred subjects.  There may be some urban councils which would like to set up an advisory committee because there are two enthusiasts, but as there is not a third it would not be possible to set up such committee.  I desire to make it possible that a person who has knowledge of cultural subjects may be appointed on such a committee.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="120" /> The amendment is intended to fill what I think is a gap.  Although the Minister or Parliamentary Secretary said that it is unnecessary, the point is that it is requisite for any person who finds an archæological object to report that fact to a member of the Gárda Síochána or the Keeper of Antiquities.  The Minister assumes that the Gárda will in the ordinary course of duty report, and he considers therefore that it is unnecessary to make any provision in the Bill in regard to that.  I am not convinced by that argument, for it seems to me that the Gárda ought to have some guidance in the Bill, or at least the Gárda ought to understand what is the intention of the legislature when a person has informed him of the finding of a certain object.</P>
    <P>It may be said that the authorities of the Guards will give general instructions as to what is to happen, but I do not think that is satisfactory either.  I think we should indicate in the Bill to the Gárda Síochána that when a certain object has been found and has been reported to them, what their duty should be.  It may be a matter of practice, but it does not seem to me to be enough to trust to the authorities to inform the Civic Guards as to what they ought to do in any special circumstances, and to expect them, without any legal liability, to follow that direction.

The higher officials of the Guards will know exactly how to instruct their men in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister a question about this section.  As I read the section and the definition of an archæological object, it seems to me that any person in possession of an archæological object is prevented from selling or exporting it without a licence?  Is that what is really intended?  I have a few chattels and many of my friends have articles which would come within the definition of archæological objects.  Under the section are we prohibited from disposing of these things if we wish to do so for the purposes of export?  Nearly everything of that sort in this country is exported at the present time.  If you take up the newspapers you will notice advertisements of auctions at which such articles are to be sold.  Would they come within this definition?  Are the owners to be prohibited from exporting such articles?  If so the section is, in my opinion, an exceedingly drastic one, under which individual liberties are interfered with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition of what is archæological is very wide in the Bill and for that very reason it is very likely a court of law would be extremely tolerant in interpreting it.  In any case it is the Minister for Education or the Keeper of Irish Antiquities who will decide whether an object is an archæological object or not.  In actual practice there is no danger of an object of vertu or a valuable picture being prohibited. As a matter of fact I had an amendment down on the Committee Stage in the Dáil restricting the operation of this section somewhat, but it was knocked out.  Even as it stands I do not think there is any danger of people being prohibited from exporting paintings, valuable furniture, Waterford glass, or anything of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assuming that what is intended with regard to archæological objects are those which have a peculiar and a particular interest, by virtue of their Irish association. I think the Bill might be too drastic if it applied to a person who bought something in Corinth, and who brought it to Ireland if he could not export it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But it seems to me, with reference to objects found within this country, that whatever value they have in the market should not appertain to the individual who found them, and if there is anything at all that has a value by virtue of its associations, which are not personal to the owner, it is an archæological object.  Surely no one is going to assert in these days that the owner of an object of that kind whose whole value depends on its antiquity and its peculiar associations, has a right to turn that into money and sell it to America, China, South Africa or anywhere <Col N="124" /> else, without regard to the national interest.  If one is going to argue that personal saleable property reside in an object which has its value because of its antiquity, because of certain peculiarities, it seems to me we have lost all sense of social values and national life.  Every country is interested in maintaining within its own borders those archæological objects which are of peculiar interest to that country.  I think one of the greatest movements in England at present is the outery against the sale of everything of historical or antiquarian value to people, simply because they have money.  I think the Seanad should stand strongly in favour of the proposition in this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only dealing with Senator Guinness at the moment as the Italian cups attracted my attention.  The Bill is a National Monuments Bill and the monuments or archæological objects must have national associations.  I think that would be the decision arrived at on the construction of that definition section.  Moreover he has another safeguard because he can export his object on securing a licence from the Minister for Education.  The Minister for Education is not going to refuse a licence for the sale of an object which has no national associations. Supposing that objects were bought in Austria, Spain or Italy and brought to this country and suppose they are in a collection, and that the owners wished to sell them abroad, I think if the Minister was asked for a licence he would give it under this Bill.  I am also of opinion that in such a case a licence <Col N="125" /> would not be necessary, because such objects would not be objects of national importance as distinct from international importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much astonished to hear that there was a clause in the Bill which includes a penalty of six months' imprisonment and a fine of £50, and that it is being treated so casually by the Seanad.  I agree that if Signor Mussolini was passing such a Bill in Italy one would expect such a clause to be there.  But to put the Minister for Education in a position where he has to decide a matter which may mean six months' imprisonment for another person, seems to be legislation against any liberty in this country. The Bill deals with national monuments. There is a definition of what are archæological objects, but none of us really knows what the definition means, or who is to decide what is an archæological object.  Is the new duty to be put on the Minister for Education?  If the owner of an object, who may not have known it was an archæological object, exports it, the Minister may come along and say: &ldquo;You had no right to export that object.&rdquo;  The owner may then be brought before a court, and may be put in jail for six months.  I think the Seanad should pause before passing the section.  We are taking very casually the infliction of a fine and the imposition of new penalties.  I think we should get rid of such things instead of putting them on.  Here we are inventing a new crime, imposing a new penalty, and creating a new judge, all in five minutes, in a clause the meaning of which I did not realise.  Most of us have things that, up to to-day, we thought we could give away, sell, or do what we like with. There is no definition in the Bill to enable me to say: &ldquo;These are archæological objects, but I have no right to export them without a licence.&rdquo;  I should say that there are many shops in Ireland and in Dublin where there are objects for sale which, if exported, might result in the owners being brought up and heavily fined.  We <Col N="126" /> should be very careful before imposing such penalties as are set out in sub-section (3).  It is all very well to try to keep these objects at home. We are all in agreement with that but to inflict penalties at the option of the Minister for Education on anyone who gives such objects away or sells them out of the country without any knowledge that he is doing wrong is another question.  We should consider it seriously before the Report Stage and see whether we could not modify the Bill so that people would get some notice of the risks they are running.</P>

      <P>I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that it would be a wise thing not to make the Minister for Education the judge of what is an archæological object but to refer it to the Keeper of the Museum, because it is really only that kind of art you want to keep in Ireland.</P>

      <P>A few years ago an object of immense interest to this country, St. Senan's Bell, which belonged to a County Clare family, and which is now in the National Museum, was sent over to Christie's in London to be sold.  It was a hereditary inheritance, having remained in the possession of one family for hundreds of years.  Only for the patriotism of the late Mr. Panter that object of immense national interest to this country would have been lost to it.  Mr. Panter bought the bell for £500 and gave it to the National Museum.  I call that an act of patriotism.  I think Senators are unduly alarmed.  Of course, the Minister will have to refer to the Keeper of Irish Antiquities, and he will only decide to prevent the exportation of objects that are of real national importance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Wild Birds Protection Bill, 1929, be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Senate would bear with me while I explain the provisions of the Bill.  In introducing it I said that its object was to consolidate and codify the existing law in relation to the protection of birds.  The existing law consists of six British statutes, five later ones amending or extending the first one, or amending some of the later ones.  The disadvantage of that is that anyone who wants to ascertain the law has to go through the six existing Acts of Parliament. What I have done in this Bill is to repeal those six Acts of Parliament and to put their provisions into this Bill in a way in which they can be read logically and in order.  The advantage of that will be that the District Justice, the prosecuting member of the Guards, the prosecuting solicitor or anyone who wants to ascertain the law, will only have to go to this small Bill of twelve or thirteen sections instead of wading through the six existing statutes. May I shortly deal with what the Bill proposes?  By Section 2 of the Bill a close time is created, from the 1st March to the 1st August, during which it is illegal to take or kill any wild bird whatever.  There is provision later on in the section which makes a small exception to that.  The close time is a close time for all birds and the second and third subsections of Section 2 give the Minister power by order, which he can make on the application of a county council, to vary the close time, to make it longer or shorter.  It also gives him very important power in sub-section (3) which will enable any body who so chooses on the application <Col N="128" /> to the county council, and by order of the Minister, to create what is known as a sanctuary.  Sub-section (3) gives the Minister power by order, on the application of a county council, to order that no wild birds may be taken or killed in any particular places in the county during any part of the year.  That is not only during the close time but at any time, and in that way a sanctuary can be created.  That will enable a sanctuary to be created on the Saltee Island where, as I know, many people are very anxious&mdash;the owner is very anxious&mdash;to have a sanctuary created.  In this Bill we have not forgotten the power of creating a sanctuary.</P>
    <P>The penalties for taking or killing wild birds during the close time, or in what the Minister may make the close time, are prescribed by sub-section (4).  So far as the birds mentioned in the First Schedule are concerned there is a maximum penalty of £1 per bird.  For all the other birds the offenders get off with a warning for the first offence, and then there is a maximum penalty of 10/-.  I said there was an exception to the illegality of taking or killing a wild bird in the absolute close season and it is an exception which I think is a useful and reasonable one. It is dealt with in sub-section (6), which says:</P>
    <P>This section shall not apply to the owner or occupier of any land or any person authorised by him taking alive or killing on such land any wild birds not mentioned in the First Schedule to this Act.</P>
    <P>That enables a farmer for his own protection, and for the protection of his crops, to take or kill birds not mentioned in the First Schedule, such as crows, hawks, pigeons and magpies.  I think that section is a necessary protection for the farmer and is one given him by a British Act.  Section 4 is the next section, about which I would like to say something.  It is a mixture of the old law and of the new.  It prevents anybody using as a scarecrow any live bird which is tethered. That is the existing law.  It prevents <Col N="129" /> the use as a decoy of any live bird which is tethered, or is secured by means of braces or other similar appliances, or which is blind, maimed or injured, and &ldquo;(c) the use of birdlime or any substance of a like nature for the purpose of taking or capturing alive or attempting to take or capture alive any wild bird.&rdquo; That is new, but I think it is an absolutely necessary provision.  Anybody who has not seen the effects cannot know the cruelty caused by the use of birdlime in the taking of these birds.  It is not to the bird that is caught that there is cruelty, as it is treated and the birdlime is carefully removed; it is to the bird that gets away with this stuff on its poor feet.  It alights somewhere, gets away again and then gets stuck, so that the result is death from starvation.</P>
    <P>The only other provision in Section 4 is that preventing the taking or attempting to take any wild bird by means of a hook or other similar instrument.  That is a common way of taking birds in some parts of the country.  For offences against that section there are heavy penalties. There is a maximum penalty up to £20, or a term of imprisonment not exceeding three months.  Section 5 prevents the use of what are known as pole traps.  That is, at places where birds naturally alight, they put a trap on the top of a pole or something like that.  Sections 6 and 7 are new.  They prohibit the keeping of any bird in a cage which is too small to let it spread its wings, with an exception when it is shown at a bird show.  Section 7 prevents the taking of the eggs of the green plover or lapwing.  I suggest that is a very necessary provision in a country where the lapwing is such a useful bird.  Section 8 gives the Minister power by order, on the application of a county council, to prevent anyone taking the eggs of specified wild birds.</P>
    <P>Then we come to what I consider to be the most important section in the Bill, one which makes a new law. It is Section 9, and prohibits the export of the wild birds that are mentioned in the Second Schedule. <Col N="130" /> They are mostly song-birds.  They include the peregrine falcon and the quail, but most of them are song-birds. I do not know if Senators are aware of the extent to which the export of birds is going on in this country.  In Manchester and Liverpool there are large numbers of bird shops that get their supplies from this country.  They have agents all over Ireland for the collection of goldfinches, siskins, larks, and other songbirds.  In a very short time if that custom goes on&mdash;it is perfectly legal at present&mdash;there will not be a goldfinch or some of these other delightful song-birds left here.  Another advantage of stopping the export of these birds is that it will also stop the use of birdlime, because it is in the capture of these very birds that birdlime is used.  The extent to which this practice is going on can be judged when I tell the House that there are advertisements practically every week from these Manchester and Liverpool bird shops offering 5/- a pair for goldfinches and higher prices for some other birds.  That is going on to a deplorable extent, and it is not only going to denude this country of some of its most delightful birds but it is naturally carried on with very great cruelty, because these birds have to cross the sea in what I might call parcels and a very large number of them arrive at the other side dead.  Therefore I submit to the House that that particular section is of real value and one that it ought to accept.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else for me to mention in the Bill. It provides for the continuance in force of all the orders made in this country under the existing law.  By this Bill we repeal the existing law. In a very large number of the counties in the Free State&mdash;sixteen or seventeen&mdash;there are orders which have amended the close time and have made other alterations in the law.  By repealing the Acts under which these orders were made these orders would disappear, but they are kept alive by a sub-section of Section 14, so that they will still be in force and the county councils will not have to get new orders.</P>

      <P>I feel that we will all welcome Senator Brown's Bill, and that it introduces a much-needed protection for wild bird life in this country.  Senator Brown has explained the Bill in great detail, and I have not very much to add, except one thing which strikes me, and which, in the course of this Bill, we might attend to at the same time as we are dealing with the clause with regard to birdlime.  I refer to Section 6, and I take that in conjunction with Senator Brown's own analysis of Section 9.  My reason for drawing attention to these two sections is this: that I think this is a fit and opportune time to introduce in such a Bill as this legislation preventing the caging of birds at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Of wild birds.  I have always felt, without being any way, shall I say, sloppily sentimental, that it is a form of cruelty to keep any wild bird in a cage.  If any people ought to understand that and have sympathy with bird life in cages the Irish people ought to, because so many of them have been behind bars themselves.  I feel after Senator Brown's argument on Section 9, whereby he would prohibit the export of wild birds to cities like Manchester and Liverpool, there is no logical reason why we should object to the export of these birds if the law permits the bringing of them into the city of Dublin to be sold in bird shops.  I intend to introduce an amendment on the Committee Stage prohibiting the caging of birds at all in this country.  If we prevent that I think we will have gone a long way towards protecting wild bird life, and removing what I look upon as a stigma on the people who, mostly thoughtlessly, continue to keep birds in wire cages.  To me it is not a question whether the birds have space to spread their wings or not. It is nonsense to talk about the wild lark or thrush spreading its wings in a cage twelve inches by twelve inches, or whatever the size may be. <Col N="132" /> I am in favour of the principle of the Bill, but I think it ought to be strengthened to prevent the caging of birds at all.</P>

      <P>I approve of this Bill and I will support it with all the power that I have.  Perhaps I might be allowed to relate a few personal experiences to show how necessary such a Bill is.  I would not speak on the matter at all only that some years ago another Bill was rejected by the Dáil.  I hope sincerely that this Bill will pass the two Houses.  I am very much afraid that a large number of people regard naturalists and people who have an interest in country life as faddists.  I want to show that this Bill is of the utmost importance to the farmers, leaving out any sentiment. I thoroughly agree with what Senator Brown and Senator Connolly said, and I want to show from personal experience how important this Bill is to farmers.  With regard to taking the eggs of the green plover, the county I live in has five or six thousand acres of reclaimed slobland where myriads of birds live.  These slobs are a favourite breeding place of the green plover, which eat the grub which causes liver fluke among sheep.  There is a constant trade in the eggs of these birds, and during the war and the succeeding years large prices were paid in London.  In late years we had a dreadful epidemic of liver fluke amongst live stock which was devastating whole districts. Last year two neighbours of mine lost, respectively, seventy and nineteen sheep, so that it is of the utmost importance to prevent the taking of the eggs of the green plover.  Another bird which breeds in the loughs, which are really inlets of the sea, along the coast of Wexford is the tern or sea-swallow. I have seen the eggs of the tern collected and left to rot in heaps along the seashore.  Sometimes they are brought home and boiled to feed young turkeys.  I happen to know that they are not necessary for feeding young turkeys.  I have the greatest possible interest in the <Col N="133" /> Saltee Islands, and I was delighted to hear Senator Brown say that it will be possible to make a sanctuary there for these birds.  The islands are amongst the most important breeding stations in Ireland for sea birds.  I only know of three or four other stations altogether.</P>
      <P>There is no more delightful sight than the Saltee Islands in June with the peculiar wild flowers that grow there like a carpet, and the hundreds of thousands of sea birds that breed on the cliffs.  Last summer the dreadful cruelty that was practised by picnicking parties on harmless but useful white gulls was brought to my notice.  They are very useful to the farmers.  I have not the least doubt that the people who gave me the reports were speaking the truth. Unfortunately the Islands have become easily accessible since motor boats came into use, and parties have gone there, not to spend their time admiring the beauties of the Islands, but in killing and maiming the birds, leaving them with broken legs and wings.  It is time to stop that.</P>
      <P>Another bird mentioned for protection in the Bill is the owl.  I wonder how many farmers realise what a useful bird the owl is.  It is absolutely harmless.  Its natural prey are rats and mice.  It is unfortunately almost extinct.  There may be places where there are a few of these birds but I think they are very scarce.  Wherever there are owls there are no rats.  I read a very interesting article a few years ago in an English newspaper in which the writer collected statistics and made a calculation of the amount of damage done on English farms by rats.  If anybody could be found with the ability and the industry to make such a calculation about Ireland the figures would be astounding.  The amount of damage done by rats on the farm is enormous. A bird which helps to kill these should not be exterminated. The bird itself is helpless owing to its semi-blindness in daylight and may be killed by a stone.  It is an easy victim to any thoughtless person with a stone, a gun, or a catapult.</P>

      <Col N="134" /> I am delighted to know that the use of bird lime is to come to an end. I think in the school the children should be trained to have some regard for, and to take some interest in, the birds of the country.  I have known instances where school children have done serious damage by robbing birds' nests and by using catapults.  They do more serious damage than people think by robbing nests.  They do not know the difference, but I think the Minister for Education might take the matter up and see that the children are instructed not to carry on such cruel practices.  I had to complain twice during the last year of the use of the catapults by children.  This is not a matter of sentiment at all. There is another very cruel practice that was very common and that, I think, ought to be done away with &mdash;hunting the wren.  I think it is done away with now.  It was a horrible practice, and although an old custom, was a very bad one.  I hope that both Houses will pass this Bill and that it will be put into force as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>This Bill, in so far as it is a codification of the law, is a very skilful codification.  I also agree with the sections that Senator Brown has described as new&mdash;those prohibiting the liming of birds and the hooking of birds.  I wonder whether any member of the Seanad has ever seen that very barbarous practice of hooking a wild bird.  If any one of them did see it he would certainly be very much in favour of Senator Brown's new piece of legislation.  Having said so much, I wish to say a little more, not by way of criticism of the Bill but in order to give the Senator an opportunity of improving it very much, in my opinion.  He has called our attention to the fact that wild birds are to be absolutely protected from the 1st of March to the 1st of August, and he has told us that there was an exception. Here is the exception: &ldquo;This section shall not apply to the owner or occupier of any land or any person authorised by him taking alive or killing on such land any <Col N="135" /> wild birds not mentioned in the first Schedule.&rdquo;  He protects absolutely, even from the onslaught of the farmer or his nominee, a list of birds set out in the First Schedule.  I have gone through that list and I have found that they are mostly English birds.  I was surprised to find that thirteen or fourteen birds for which I have a special regard are not included at all.  Some of those left out are the thrush, the blackbird, the wren, the marten, the swallow, the swan, the swift, the coot, the tern, the ringdove, the bullfinch, the linnet, the peregrine falcon, the merganser, the pewit, the seamew, the woodcock, the stonehammer and the summer snipe.  They are a number of my old friends, and they are left to the tender mercy of the farmer. I suggest to Senator Brown that instead of saying that the wild birds mentioned in the Schedule are to be protected, he should say that all wild birds should be absolutely protected as against the farmer, except our old friends the crow, the rook, the magpie, the cormorant, the sparrow, and the jackdaw.  I think if Senator Brown would put it that way&mdash;to protect all wild birds, except four or five that are very injurious, from slaughter by the farmer&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is another question on Section 11.  Senator Miss Browne has stated that a Bill similar to this was defeated in the Dáil.  We do not want to have this Bill defeated in the Dáil, and for this reason I think that Section 11 ought to be modified&mdash;&ldquo;Where any person shall be found committing an offence under this Act it shall be lawful for any person to require the person so offending to give his Christian name, surname and place of abode.&rdquo;  I wonder whether Senator Brown knows some parts of the country as well as I do.  A man will regard it as a frightful insult to ask him his name, surname and place of abode, and I think it would lead to breaches of the peace if every person were to be allowed to come up to <Col N="136" /> a man on his own land when he is shooting or snaring birds and ask him for his name, surname and place of abode.  In relation to that, there is a law authorising the holder of a game licence to go up to any man and say: &ldquo;Have you a game licence, and if not, what is your name and address?&rdquo;  but he must be the owner of a game licence.  That was bad enough, I thought, but I think this is going a little too far.  Perhaps it might not be acceptable to the Dáil, and perhaps Senator Brown might modify it to a certain extent.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with the other members of the Seanad who spoke in support of this Bill.  It is most necessary, because if you go round the country-side as I do you very seldom see more than an odd one of the rarer birds which one used to see years ago.  I have discussed the whole Bill with Senator Brown, and I think that in some directions it ought to be strengthened.  I think the Bill depends greatly on the arrangement of the Schedules.  If you look at the First Schedule you will find that it can quite easily be divided into two classes of birds&mdash; one, the song birds and the birds of beauty, and the other those which can, other than in the close season, be shot for food, and which really ought to come more under the Game Preservation Bill.  One case from each class is the golden oriel and the widgeon.  I think that if Senator Brown was to divide the Schedules into three parts the Bill would be better.</P>
      <P>As regards the First Schedule, I do not see why anybody at any time, either in or out of the close season, should ever attempt to take or shoot a golden oriel or a kingfisher, but according to the Bill you could do so out of the close season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>That is, unless the close season is extended by order.</P>

      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy of the Reeks</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Bill makes provision that on the application of a county council or a county borough the Minister may extend or vary the close season, <Col N="137" /> or, <i>per contra</i>, on application a prohibition order may be made.  But I do not think that as regards these birds of beauty a council or anybody else should have the chance of asking for a variation of the order or prohibition.  I think it should be a national question to preserve these birds, very much the same as in the case of the national monuments.  I think the Bill might be improved in these directions.</P>
      <P>Section 8 deals with the taking of birds' eggs.  I think most people will agree with me that when a small boy or small girl takes a bird's egg out of the nest, by the time they are finished the nest and that season are finished as regards that pair of birds.  I do not see why, if the Senator divided the Schedule, nesting by these small boys and girls should be allowed at all.  There is no great advantage in it.  There are sufficient collections of eggs that children could see if they required to do so, and I think birds' eggs should only be taken by expert people.  They go to a kingfisher's nest and take an egg; they go to a wren's nest in the same way, and you will never see that wren back again.</P>
      <P>My third point is the question raised in Section 9&mdash;the prohibition of the export of any wild live bird mentioned in the Second Schedule. I cannot quite understand why Senator Brown left out the dead bird as well.  Unless there is a prohibition order you can shoot a bird like the kingfisher out of the close season, and you can export it.  It is a most valuable bird, either for a lady's hat in England or anywhere else, and it is very good for salmon flies.  Let us get our feathers for flies from some country where they do not mind killing these birds and let us keep our own birds.  I suggest to Senator Brown that before the Committee Stage he should put down an amendment forbidding the export of birds of beauty, either alive or dead.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the Second Reading of this Bill, although there are some portions of it that I do not agree with.  I refer <Col N="138" /> to those portions which propose to give protection to birds that are harmful to agriculture.</P>
      <P>Senator Brown has explained that under sub-section (6) of Section 2, farmers are allowed to destroy birds that damage their crops, but are not to be allowed to kill the birds mentioned in Schedule 1 of the Bill. Under that Schedule two birds are mentioned that are distinctly harmful to agriculture.  I have no hesitation in saying that.  It is founded on many years' observation of their habits.  I wish to refer, in the first case, to the species of seagulls known as kittiwake.  This bird is found in large numbers along the coast and for some miles inland.  I have seen that bird eat corn and begin to eat turnips in a field.  I know that ornithologists will contradict me on that, but I am confirmed in my opinion by a neighbouring farmer who has observed the birds eating corn and damaging turnips.  I know that the habits of birds sometimes change, and that perhaps twenty years ago this bird was not in the habit of eating corn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another bird mentioned under Schedule 1 that does a great deal of damage.  It is one of the several species of larks.  I have observed this species of lark going in fairly large numbers into fields where wheat crops were growing and inflicting serious damage on the crop.  The only effective method that I can find for keeping birds from damaging crops is by shooting them.  Under Section 8, the Minister has power to prohibit the taking of the eggs of any bird.  He can make a general order or a particular order.  No doubt that is a desirable power to have, but I think that certain birds ought to be excluded from that penalty.  There is one bird that I wish to refer to.  It is known to most people as the house-sparrow. I do not mean the &ldquo;tree sparrow&rdquo; that is sometimes called the wren.  Before the corn is ripe this bird, usually accompanied by linnets in large numbers, comes and does a great deal of destruction to crops.  In my opinion, the only effective <Col N="139" /> way of dealing with it is to destroy the nests and so keep its numbers under control.  On the Committee Stage of the Bill, I hope to introduce some amendment dealing with these points.</P>

      <P>I am entirely in favour of this Bill, but I was somewhat astonished to hear my friend Senator Comyn putting in a plea for the merganser in the list of birds that ought to be protected.  In many parts of the country this is a most destructive bird, and in fact there is a price put upon his head by various boards of fishery conservators, owing to the amount of salmon fry and the fry of other fish that it destroys.  I do not think that the merganser deserves the protection which Senator Comyn would be inclined to give it.</P>

      <P>I am very glad that the main criticism of the Bill has been entirely in its favour, and anything that has been said against it, except the criticism of Senator Butler, has been in the direction of strengthening the Bill.  Nobody would be better pleased than I would if I thought I could strengthen the Bill without interfering with its chance of getting through.  I am <Col N="140" /> just as strongly in favour as Senator Connolly of making it illegal to cage ordinary birds.  I do not think any bird should be caged, except perhaps a canary or a parrot.  None of us likes to see it, but we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that there are hundreds of people who cage birds in their houses, practically as their friends.  You would, I am afraid, raise a good deal of opposition to the Bill if you went so far as that.  I would be glad to do it if I could.  If the Senator thinks he could introduce an amendment that would not harm the Bill I would consider it as favourably as I can.  The Bill I introduced in 1927 was thrown out in the Dáil, but it only included a prohibition of the use of birdlime, the taking of plover eggs, and the caging of birds in cages that are too small, and the Bill was thrown out in the Dáil largely owing to a misunderstanding. A number of the Deputies objected to my Bill because it did not go far enough.  It was a small Bill they said and it ought to be more general, forgetting that the general law was already in the six British statutes, which this Bill now repeals and re-enacts.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
