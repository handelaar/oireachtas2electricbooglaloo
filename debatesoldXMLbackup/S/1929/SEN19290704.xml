    <Title>Constitution (Amendment No. 11) Bill, 1928&mdash;Fifth Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: That this Bill be received for final consideration and do now pass.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Fifth Stage be postponed until the next sitting day after the passage by the Seanad of the Committee Stage of a Bill to amend the law relating to the filling of casual vacancies in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment that I have put down is practically a repetition of what has been done before, but the intention is to avoid the necessity of having to repeat that time and again.  No date has been fixed for the further consideration of this Bill, but it is proposed that the consideration of it shall not be before the date on which the Committee Stage of any Bill which deals with the method of electing Senators at a by-election is passed.  Perhaps it would be as well to state, very shortly, the purpose and the intention of the amendment.  The Constitution at present provides the means whereby vacancies in the Seanad shall be filled by election. The body to elect is the Seanad.  The Constitution Bill which is before us deletes those provisions, and says that the method of election for the Seanad in the future shall be by some means to be provided by law. If we pass the Constitution Bill as it stands before us that will annul the already existing provisions for filling vacancies in the Seanad, and there will be no machinery at all available for filling such vacancies. It is intended that new machinery should be created, and a Bill is in the course of discussion in the Dáil No. 19. <Col N="1068" />&mdash;I thought it would have been passed before now&mdash;to provide new machinery, but one does not know how long that Bill will take to go through the Dáil, and officially and formally we do not know what it contains.</P>
    <P>Therefore our position is that if we pass the Constitution Bill there will then exist no means of filling vacancies in the Seanad, and no means will be available until a new Bill has passed this House.  My proposal is that we should not deprive ourselves of the machinery for filling vacancies until we know not only the kind of machinery that is going to take its place, but that the machinery is ready.  Under the proposal before the Dáil, it is well understood, of course, although, as I say, not officially and formally before us, that the new method for electing Senators at a by-election will be by the two Houses acting together.  That machinery will not be in operation until the Bill has passed this House, and I think it would be quite wrong, injudicious and in every way out of order, thinking merely in the terms of decency and good order, that there should be any prolonged interregnum or any interregnum at all between the cancellation of one method and its substitution by another.  That is my sole purpose in moving the amendment&mdash;that the Seanad will be in a position to say: &ldquo;this machinery is going to replace the machinery which we are now about to abolish.&rdquo;  I, therefore, move the amendment, which proposes to give effect to what I have said.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1069" /> The following motion appeared on the Order Paper in the name of Senator Milroy:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That, during the Committee Stage of the Juries (Protection) Bill, 1929, the time given to the consideration of the following sections or groups of sections shall be as follows:&mdash;Sections 1-4, 1½ hours; Section 5, 3 hours; Sections 6-7, 1 hour; Section 8, ½ hour; Sections 9-13, 1 hour.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In reference to this motion, since our discussions yesterday I have had consultation with certain members of the House.  There seems to be a general desire that as much latitude as possible should be given to the discussion of this Bill. For that reason, I am asking the permission of the House to defer consideration of this motion until to-morrow. If that permission is given, and if it is necessary to move the motion to-morrow, then I may have to ask the permission of the House to modify it to meet the circumstances that will then arise.  I, therefore, ask that the motion be postponed until to-morrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to Senator Milroy that it might be better if he withdrew the motion altogether. That, I think, might help to improve the feeling in the House.  We are all very much against having to <Col N="1070" /> closure a debate on an important measure like this if it can possibly be helped.  We can go on sitting until 7.30 this evening and, if necessary, with an interval, could sit late to-night and start again to-morrow morning.  There is a motion down to sit at twelve o'clock to-morrow. I think it would be in the interests of the House that the motion should be withdrawn altogether.  If that were done it is probable that we would get through more business to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not adamant on this matter, but at the same time I recognise that while we spent five hours on this Bill yesterday we disposed of only twelve amendments. Amongst a certain section of the House there is no indication of a desire to expedite business on the Bill.  In some cases divisions were called for which seemed to me to be unnecessary.  There are 74 amendments, and so far only twelve of them have been disposed of.  If the same rate of progress is to be made on the remaining amendments, it means that the Committee Stage of this Bill is going to occupy at least a week.  I ask, is that reasonable.  The retention of this motion on the Order Paper in no way interferes with the freedom of discussion, and I think that as a precaution against certain contingencies it ought to be retained. However, as I have said, I am not adamant on the matter, and if it is the wish of the House that it should be withdrawn I am quite prepared to accede to that request.  At the same time I do so with a certain amount of reluctance, because I see the possibility of an unnecessarily protracted discussion on the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that if the motion is withdrawn that we are really not going to lose time by doing so.  If the motion had to be moved to-morrow, it is probable that two hours would be lost in debating it. I think it is better that we should <Col N="1071" /> proceed with the discussion of the amendments that are really important. I think Senators will see that some of the amendments that are down are merely repetitions.  If the course that I suggest is followed, then we will have practically no debate on the Report Stage of the Bill, because all the important amendments will have been discussed now, and in that way no time will really be lost.</P>
      <P>Motion by leave withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I suggest that we should now take item No. 4 on the Order Paper&mdash;Dublin City and County (Relief of the Poor) Bill, 1929.  If we dispose of that Bill now, we will have plenty of time to deal with the Committee Stage of the Juries Bill later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the number of amendments to the Juries (Protection) Bill that have still to be disposed of, it has been suggested to me that some extra time should be given for the consideration of that Bill.  Therefore I am going to ask the House to sit late this evening and continue consideration of it.  The suggestion is that we should adjourn at 7 o'clock and resume at 8.15, if the House is agreeable to that course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">

      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <P>Then the understanding is that we adjourn at 7 and resume at 8.15.  The Bill that Senator Fanning has referred to is a very important one.  Within the last few minutes a number of amendments, which I consider are purely drafting amendments, have been handed in to <Col N="1072" /> this Bill.  These will be circulated to Senators during the sitting.  I propose taking up the Committee Stage of this Bill at a quarter to seven this evening.  The Bill is not a controversial one, and it is hoped that the House may be able to dispose of it before we take the adjournment at seven.  Is the House agreed on that?</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

      <P>Section 3.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Every accused person shall be entitled as of right to apply to and may, if the Judge is satisfied, obtain from any Judge of the High Court or Supreme Court an order directed to the summoning officer to supply him or his solicitor with a copy of the panel of jurors from which it is intended that the jury for his trial is to be drawn.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Senator proceeds to speak to his amendment, might I point out that in Amendments 13, 14, 15 and 16 practically the same principle is involved.  That being the case, perhaps Senators in whose names these amendments stand would agree to take a discussion on them on the particular one now before the House.  It would convenience everybody, I think, if that were done.  The amendments are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>14.&mdash;Section 3.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  Every accused person shall be entitled to apply to any Judge of the High Court or the Supreme Court for an order directed to the summoning officer to supply him <Col N="1073" /> or his solicitor with a copy of the panel of jurors from which it is intended that the jury for his trial is to be drawn, and shall be entitled to obtain such order unless good cause to the contrary is shown.&rdquo;&mdash;(Senator Robinson).</P>
    <P>15.&mdash;Section 3.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  Whenever a person is to be charged in the Central Criminal Court or in the Circuit Court with any crime or offence, the prosecutor or the accused, as the case may be, shall be entitled to apply to any Judge of the High Court or the Supreme Court for an order directed to the summoning officer to supply him with a copy of the panel of jurors from which it is intended that the jury for his trial is to be drawn and shall be entitled to obtain such order unless good cause to the contrary is shown.&rdquo;&mdash;(Senator Johnson).</P>
    <P>16.&mdash;Section 3.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing the Judge at the trial of any accused person may order that a copy of the panel from which the jury is to be drawn for the trial of such accused person may be furnished to the accused person or to his solicitor at such trial.&rdquo;&mdash;(Senator Dowdall).</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle is the same in all of them.  I think, when a decision is reached on amendment 13, I will have to rule as regards amendments 14, 15 and 16 that the question raised in them had already been decided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving my amendment I wish to say that a motion similar to it has been proposed several times.  If the prosecution are to have the right to have a <Col N="1074" /> copy of the jury list, then the object of the amendment is to secure that the accused person will be put in the same position.  My amendment differs from some of the others in this way, that the accused person has to apply to the judge for an order to get the jury list.  If the judge is satisfied that the accused ought to have that list then he will make an order directing that he be supplied with it. Whether that ought to be done or not is placed in the hands of the judge who will be trying the case. In that way, my amendment differs considerably from some other amendments that have been moved. If we are to judge by the result of some of the votes already taken on a somewhat similar matter, it is, I think, correct to say that there is a strong feeling in the House that it is not fair that the accused person, of all others, should be put in a worse position than the prosecution.  My amendment will afford Senators who are of that opinion a chance of ensuring, by their votes, that justice be done to the accused person.  If the judge thinks it right to do so he can give an order to have that list supplied to the accused person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the request contained in my amendment is a reasonable one. I do not say that it will satisfy the Minister.  It is not easy to satisfy him, but I think it will satisfy most reasonable people.  It is only fair that the accused person should have the same right as the prosecution in this matter.  It will rest with the judge to grant or to refuse the request. If the judge considers that it is a proper case for the accused person to have the list, then he will grant the application made to him. If he thinks that there are any reasons why he should not grant it, then he can refuse the order asked for.  I would ask Senators to consider the large number of cases in which the judge may grant the application, cases which have no reference at all to political disputes, to murders, assassinations, threats, or anything of that sort, but in ordinary cases between one individual and another, a case, for instance, between a husband and wife.  All these cases <Col N="1075" /> will be governed by this particular Bill.  The accused persons concerned will not be able to get a list of the jury unless this amendment is passed.  This amendment gives the judge power to get over that difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. Gogarty Dr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>All these amendments are, to my mind, examples of the clumsy and dishonest litany of that policy of obstruction, subterfuge and of moral cowardice which is Fianna Fáil's characteristic, chief and only contribution to statesmanship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Senator accusing me of dishonesty and cowardice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. Gogarty Dr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that it is implicit in all the amendments.  It is dishonest to the country to pretend that this Bill is against the liberty of the subject, when it is really designed to protect the subject from those who are prone to act from murderous motives, and to protect the lives of jurymen who are prepared to vindicate liberty under the law.  The Fianna Fáil Party have always appealed to the lowest and basest instincts of the people, so that we might think that their constituencies were composed of nothing but tramps and outlaws; and now they are endeavouring to continue this deception in the name of liberty.  An attempt was made by Senator Colonel Moore to put the case of taking out jurymen and shooting them on a par with the case of a quarrel between a husband and wife.  That is a dodge, because if the list of jurors were made available in the latter case, a precedent would be created and the list should be available also in the first case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Fianna Fáil Party were honest, they would say that dastardly murderers should be punished as they deserve, and they should not attempt to facilitate murderers to get away in the dark, nor to expose jurymen to &ldquo;spotters&rdquo; and to assassins. I think that I am perfectly justified in saying that if they were <Col N="1076" /> honest and could honestly influence a clean public opinion in Ireland, they would call for lynch law for assassins; for lynch law, at least is the expression of an instantaneous though rough instinct for justice. When have these purists and advocates of a simpler life ever openly denounced murder?  Instead of this we have the tacit toleration of murder on the part of Fianna Fáil, all these amendments, and all this clumsy, petulant and childish subterfuge designed to jeopardise and intimidate jurymen and to upset that very law which is the foundation of liberty the world over.  The sooner this House throws out these amendments, trashy talk and parody of commonsense, the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the last remarks of the Senator absolutely. The trash that he has given vent to probably would require not lynch law but Gogarty law, the scalping knife or something of that kind.  My amendment, No. 15, is in the same category as the other amendments which have been mentioned.  I want to argue the case for my amendment on the assumption that what the Minister stated yesterday is reliable and ought to have consideration.  He told us that in certain cases, or in any case in which he is satisfied that no harm could come, he would be prepared to allow the solicitor for the accused to see the jury panel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>To see the jury panel is very like inspecting the jury panel.  I am asking in my amendment that the discretion should not be left wholly and solely to the Minister, but that the court&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but not necessarily for circulation.  A copy may be inspected.  I would be quite satisfied if the right to inspect a copy of the panel is granted by the judge, and if we provide for that in the Act. If the prosecutor, on the one hand, or the accused on the other, is given the right to apply to the court for a <Col N="1077" /> copy of the panel to be placed before him while the jury is being empanelled, the accused person will know the names of the people and be able to point out whether any or how many of those persons on that panel who have been arraigned to try him are prejudiced persons and unable to do him justice.  That person would then be in the position to effectively challenge a prejudiced juror or a juror whom he believed to be likely to be prejudiced.  The amendment would require to be somewhat varied, so as to allow the accused person to make his case before the judge and not before the Minister, so that the judge could say whether the inspection was going to be damaging or whether the inspection was just or could be reasonably conceded to the accused.  If on such an application the prosecution or the accused, as the case may be, says: &ldquo;We have reason to believe that such a solicitor cannot be trusted,&rdquo; or &ldquo;that such an accused person is associated with a criminal organisation,&rdquo; the judge may exercise his discretion and refuse the accused that panel.  That is possible, but I am asking that in this the discretion that the Minister has claimed for himself should be transferred from the Minister to the judge.  I think that case is a perfectly reasonable one&mdash;not merely reasonable but that justice demands it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to suggest that it would be a good idea if before Senator Gogarty precipitated himself hurriedly into the debate he had acquainted himself with all that transpired yesterday.  I want to be as brief as possible, not so much with the view of aiding Senator Milroy as to try to concentrate on the essential points.  I think it is necessary to point out to Senator Gogarty that we are trying to discriminate between the ordinary criminal, who might be termed, perhaps, in Senator Gogarty's estimation, the ordinary decent criminal &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>We were trying to discriminate between criminals yesterday.  We feel that there are a good many people with the outlook of Senator Gogarty, and we feel that this classification may be very wide, and that there may be people in this Chamber who may, by a strange distortion of justice, find themselves grouped together in this classification rather hurriedly arrived at by Senator Gogarty of Fianna Fáil, Republicans and gunmen and those people he is in such a hurry to get into one category. That is a reasonable proposition from what we know of people with Senator Gogarty's type of mind.  History shows that such things have happened and may happen again. Let us at least be credited with an altruistic motive in trying to protect the ordinary decent criminal, that is the ordinary blackguard who is not a political blackguard.  We want the law as regards the jury system to prevail for that unhappy victim, even though we ourselves and people like us&mdash;I am using Senator Gogarty's classification&mdash;are deemed not to be worthy of open jury trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. Gogarty Dr. Gogarty">

    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay attention to what Senator Gogarty says.  He is not a nonentity in the city of Dublin or the Free State, and we make a mistake if we consider he is.  Perhaps his sense of humour outruns his judgment.  That is not altogether undesirable, but I want to point out, in view of Senator Gogarty's absence yesterday, that we are only trying to protect a certain element that should not, in our opinion, be classified with those terrible people the Minister for Justice proposes to deal with.  We want the law of the land to be available to other than political offenders.  It is with that view that the amendments in the names of Senators Moore, Robinson, Johnson and Dowdall have been <Col N="1079" /> tabled.  If Senator Gogarty had been here yesterday he would have understood the psychology of the situation, which he does not understand anything about to-day.  That is the position.  If this medicine is going to be handed out in substantial doses to the political blackguards the Minister has in mind, then let the decent blackguards be left free from the menace this Bill holds over them.</P>

      <P>We would all be very pleased if what is called the ordinary criminal could be tried by a panel and not under this Bill, but unfortunately that is not possible without disclosing the panel.  He is tried by the same Commission and the same panel as the other kind of criminal.  We would like the ordinary kind of criminal to be tried in the ordinary way without the disclosure of the names of the jurors, but that is impossible.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Connolly and other Senators will see that any amendment they submit here having for its object an intention which would in effect make a disclosure of the panel a possibility is the very thing this Bill is designed not to do.  It is to prevent making disclosures which would give facilities to citizens who have banded themselves together for an open and avowed purpose from pursuing that purpose and achieving their aim.  I think Fianna Fáil Senators will see that this House, the majority of whom are well affected citizens, and who have taken the oath of fealty to the State, want to uphold the machinery of the State, and one of the most sacred duties of the State is to preserve the lives and property of the citizens.  We have all taken that oath, Fianna Fáil as well as the others.</P>

      <P>I think the House will see that any amendment which will have the effect of disclosing the panel and increasing the facilities of those people for pursuing their purpose, <Col N="1080" /> and who are not stopping short of committing murder, should not have the approval of this Assembly, which is an integral part of the Oireachtas and cannot condone anything of that sort.  It might be said that the accused would be disadvantaged by the ordinary method of trial, but the conditions are abnormal. It has always been the usage and practice of Governments to employ abnormal remedies in abnormal cases, to impose martial law and set the civil law aside.  The State here recognises that an abnormal condition does obtain in the country, and has obtained for some time past. The abnormality seems to be increasing. It is the duty of the Government to see that the aim of certain parties who are a menace to the lives and property of certain citizens of the State who are carrying out their statutory duties in working the machinery of the State shall have no chance of succeeding.  Potential murderers cannot be condoned by members of this House who have taken the oath of fealty.</P>

Yet they must be all tried under that particular section.  I want to draw attention to that.  If a judge is to decide one way or the other there cannot be any danger in that.  If a judge sees there is danger in a case he will not allow the panel to be given.</P>

      <P>It was very interesting to hear Senator Johnson speak on this amendment, because he is a very experienced Parliamentarian.  To hear Senator Johnson talking with his tongue in his cheek on this particular amendment amused me and, I dare say, most of the House, enormously. &ldquo;What I said three times is proved&rdquo; occurs in a certain well-known opera.  Senator Johnson said three times yesterday everything he said to-day, and he hopes to get a new lease of life by saying exactly the same thing for the fourth time and convince the Seanad.  I was amused by Senator Moore turning around to Senator Gogarty and saying: &ldquo;Nobody pays any attention to what Senator Gogarty says.&rdquo;  That, coming from Senator Moore, struck me as being extraordinarily humorous.</P>

      <P>As far as the merits of these four amendments are concerned, they have been hammered out.  It is perfectly clear that if a jury panel is given in one case it has to be given in all cases, and, therefore, the merits of one particular case does not decide whether or not the panel should be given.  As to whether an inspection should be given, I said all I had to say on that yesterday.</P>

      <P>Let us suppose that in the Northern portion of the Free State there is a Circuit Court in which there is no case whatever that would come within the category of the cases the Minister has put forward in defence of this Bill, why should it be necessary in such a case and in such a district to adopt this new method of empanelling and of secrecy?  In such a case an application should be permissible to the judge.  There is no fear there of the potential jurymen being attacked, because there is no political significance attached to the cases.  The Minister knows, and the prosecution knows that every one of the cases that comes before the Circuit Court is connected with ordinary robbery, larceny or assault.  In none of these cases has it been put forward that the jury panel should not be made public.  I am stating that as an added reason why the accused should have the privilege of applying to the judge for permission to see the jury panel in that case.  No one is going to plead in justification for the deprivation of this right that there is a risk to the jurymen.  It seems to me that unless the Minister is contending that in all cases, irrespective of the class of case, or the period, whether normal or abnormal, he intends to revolutionise the whole system that he has had no regard to <Col N="1083" /> other circumstances when drafting the Bill.  I put that point to the Seanad for consideration, as I think it is important.</P>

It seems the Official Party are quite determined that the panel will not be shown to anybody except to those in authority, and the other side is to take pot luck.  I do not believe our amendment will in any way endanger the jurors.  If after hearing evidence the judge is convinced there is no danger, surely there should be no danger then in giving a copy of the panel to an ordinary accused individual, an ordinary civilian?  The debate so far has shown that it is useless to make any suggestion, but I want to put on record the voting for or against amendments.</P>

The whole argument of the supporters of this amendment has been directed to try and obscure that fact.  They have been ignoring the <Col N="1084" /> circumstances out of which the necessity for this Bill has arisen, namely, that a murderous attempt was made to strike down the jury system.  Does anybody deny that is what has given rise to this Bill?  The object of the Bill is to protect the lives of jurors and witnesses.  One of the ways of doing that is to make it difficult for potential assassins to have access to the identity of jurors.  I suggest that the effect of a lot of the arguments and amendments is to secure&mdash;there is no other purpose behind them&mdash; that those potential assassins shall have access to and identify the jury.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I wished to convey.  That comes to the question of the security of the prisoner or the security of the jurors, and a certain step is proposed which gives a supposed security and facility to the prisoner but jeopardises the jurors' security.  If one has to take a choice as to which course is to be pursued, then I stand for the security of the jurors.  That seems to be the issue involved in these amendments, as to whether we are to put these theoretical privileges or alleged rights claimed for the accused as something of greater value than the security of the lives of the jurors and witnesses.</P>
      <P>Even though theoretically there is a diminution of the procedure which seems to guard the prisoner, if that is necessary to protect the jurors, as that seems to be the issue, then I say we must stand by the jurors.</P>
      <P>This is a Bill dealing with a certain transient phase in the life of this State.  It is limited to a couple of years, and if it is making regrettable changes in the law, then it is to be hoped its operation will be so effective during the period of its existence that when the time has come when those abnormal conditions that have called for it will have ceased to exist, we can go back to discuss these matters without reference to abnormal conditions.  I say that a great deal of the discussion here has been of a type which has ignored the abnormal conditions and circumstances that have called for this Bill, and I say that is imparting an unreal atmosphere to these discussions and is giving us a wrong perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot come to an effective decision, <Col N="1086" /> a decision which will have appreciation of the circumstances, if we ignore the facts out of which this Bill has arisen.  Remember that the lives of jurors have been endangered, and this Bill is to ensure that this danger will cease in so far as its operations can have that effect.  Further, I would like to know, in view of the rather highly-strung disposition that Senator Johnson evinced when he intervened, whether he is supporting Senator Moore's amendment or not. That amendment would create the possibility of the jury panel being made known to undesirable people. It is not the question of inspection that is involved; it is to supply a solicitor with a copy of the panel of jurors.  Now, the solicitor himself may be above suspicion, but if the solicitor has that in his office who is going to vouch for the fact that everybody in that office is of the same integrity, the same probity, that the names on that panel will not leak out and that those from whom we are trying to withhold this information will not have access to it?  I want to say again with more restraint what I had intended to say. I say that to pass this amendment would create a great possibility of the identity of jurors becoming known to those we are trying to withhold it from, that is, those who are out to intimidate and asassinate jurors.  I do not think that it is a workable amendment, an amendment that any man with respect for the security of the jury system could assent to.</P>

Under the Bill without any amendment there is a possibility, to put it mildly, of not only one man, but a good many men, being hanged in the wrong.  Therefore, the remedy is much worse than the original disease.  I think that a number of Senators would be quite pleased if some of these amendments were passed.  The amendment in my name simply gives the accused an opportunity of applying to the judge for permission to see the panel.  Surely to goodness the judges can be trusted by the Government, and if a judge decides that it is not dangerous for the accused to get the panel, why should he not get it?  The arguments to-day seemed to show an absolute panic on the part of the Executive.</P>

      <P>Senator Johnson has quite clearly stated that we were prepared at this stage to accept that if the Minister agreed.  We are not asking for that in the interests of assassins at all, but in the interests of fair play and justice.  Senator Milroy may talk about the rights of jurors and about their protection. That is perfectly right.  But the ordinary accused person is entitled to his rights and is entitled to justice. I understand the law is that every man and woman is innocent until he or she is proved guilty, but if a person is considered innocent before being found guilty of an ordinary criminal offence, and if the solicitor on behalf of that person asks the judge to place the panel before him for his inspection during the time the jury is being empanelled, so that he may have an opportunity of challenging some of the jury while it was being empanelled, that would not be asking too much. We ask for that now, and we are prepared to accept that.  The Minister says that that is not what we ask in the amendment, but we are prepared to modify the amendment to that extent if he will accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Milroy pointed out that the Minister had said certain things. What the Minister says in debate will not be the law.  It is what is contained in the Bill when it becomes an Act that will be the law, and we <Col N="1090" /> have repeatedly asked him to embody some words in the Bill that would bring about what we desire.  We believe in justice and we are entitled to get it.  There is no intention in this to assist assassins or anybody else.  It has been put forward in the interests of justice and fair play.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
      <P>4.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Principal Act, the following provisions shall apply to and have effect at every sittings of the Central Criminal Court and every sittings of a Judge of the Circuit Court for the trial of criminal issues, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  On every day of such sittings on which the registrar of the Court is required by the Principal Act to call over a panel (whether original or supplemental) of jurors under section 46 or under section 47 of the Principal Act, such registrar shall attend in the Court for one half-hour immediately before the hour appointed for the commencement of the sitting of the Court on that day and it shall be lawful for every person who is required by law to attend the Court on that day as a juror to attend before such registrar during the said half-hour and request such registrar to record his attendance and upon such request being so made to him such registrar shall record in such manner as he thinks fit such attendance of such person;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  When calling over in pursuance of section 46 or sub-sections (2) and (3) of section 47 of the Principal Act the names of the jurors entered on <Col N="1093" /> a panel (whether original or supplemental) of jurors, the registrar shall not call the name of any such juror whose attendance he has previously recorded under the foregoing paragraph of this section on that day unless he has reason to believe that such juror has since his attendance was so recorded left the Court and not returned thereto, and whenever the registrar refrains under this paragraph from calling the name of a juror he shall take such steps in relation to such juror as he would be required by the Principal Act to take if the name of such juror had been called and such juror had answered thereto;</P>
    <P>(c)  No person shall be admitted to or be present in the Court while the proceedings directed by section 46 of the Principal Act or the proceedings directed by sub-sections (2) and (3) of section 47 of that Act or the proceedings directed by paragraph (a) of this section are being had (whether in relation to an original or to a supplementary panel) save only the Judge presiding at the sittings, the officers of the Court, members of the Gárda Síochána on duty in the Court, and persons who have been summoned to attend the Court as jurors at such sittings, but nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as requiring the presence of the Judge while the proceedings directed by paragraph (a) of this section are being had;</P>
    <P>(d)  Save where the proceedings directed by section 46 of the Principal Act or the proceedings directed by sub-sections (2) and (3) of section 47 of that Act or the proceedings directed by paragraph (a) of this section are being had, every person attending the Court as a juror shall (whether he has or has not been sworn as a juror) be called, addressed, and referred to for <Col N="1094" /> all purposes in the Court solely by the number by which he is distinguished on the panel of jurors from which he is drawn and no such person shall be called, addressed, or referred to in the Court by his name nor shall the address or description of any such person be called or mentioned in the Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 4.  To delete all after the word &ldquo;Act&rdquo; in line 4 down to the word &ldquo;issues&rdquo; in line 7, and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;any two Judges of the High Court may on the application of the Attorney-General and on being satisfied that sufficient cause exists for so doing by order direct that the following provisions shall apply to and have effect at any sittings of the Central Criminal Court and any sittings of a Judge of the Circuit Court for the trial of criminal issues.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We have covered so much ground on this Bill that it is hardly necessary to reiterate our arguments about this.  The amendment is not meant to suggest that it would make the section perfect, or that it would make the Bill more acceptable, but, as we have already pointed out, it would confine the purposes of the Bill to those for whom it is primarily intended, according to the Minister, and it would give the ordinary prisoner some security.  I suggest that it is a reasonable proposition that if the Department of Justice or the Executive desire something in the nature of a special court, there is no reason to set aside the whole machinery of justice, and accordingly if they could make a case to two judges of the High Court with this clause we are satisfied that Section 4 could then be made operative.  It would be by way of creating a special court for the purposes that they require, and it would allow the ordinary administration of justice to proceed under the jury system as before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that it is rather futile to argue the case in face of the opposition <Col N="1095" /> that we are up against here, and particularly in face of the rigid attitude of the Minister.  But we feel that every step in this Bill ought to be contested and to be fought, and for that reason I suggest that to any ordinary reasonable people the facility that would be afforded by enabling the case to be made before two judges of the High Court should be sufficient to meet any emergency. I do not propose to labour the matter but simply propose the amendment.</P>

We know that in the course of the debate with our arguments yesterday we advanced from being a small minority of eight to the position of being within one of defeating the Government, and I think that when we say that we want to improve every clause of this Bill, that should not earn the sneers of the Minister.</P>

      <P>This deals with the exclusion of the public from the court.  But who are the public who go to the court?  Who are the public who go in to listen to criminal trials?  Everybody knows who they are.  They are the town loafers&mdash;everybody who has nothing on earth to do, or people who go there because there happens to be something sensational in a case which excites their morbid curiosity. This Bill allows the Press to go there.  It allows full publicity, and because morbidly-inclined persons, or persons who wish to go in for the purpose of discovering the names of jurymen in order that these jurymen may be subsequently intimidated or murdered are to be kept out, that is a terrible infringement of the rights of the prisoner! What does it matter to the prisoner how many persons, how many town loafers, how many corner-boys, how many morbidly-inclined persons are in court listening to the trial?  I wonder how often Senator Connolly has walked in gratuitously to a criminal court and listened to a trial.  I wonder if he has ever done it.  I wonder if Senator Moore has ever gone down to Green Street in his life.  It is the exclusion of people like Senator Connolly and Senator Moore from the court&mdash;men who have never gone to it&mdash;that is supposed to be a terrible injustice.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be a sentiment in the House that while jurymen are to be protected, so far as the secrecy of the panel would protect them, the prisoner is to have all the privileges which the law allows him consistent with preserving the secrecy of the jury panel.  That seems to be indicated <Col N="1099" /> by the discussion which has taken place, and this amendment, and a subsequent amendment, No. 23, are framed with the object of expressing, as I take it, the general sentiment of the Senate on this question.  If the House would agree I would withdraw this amendment in favour of amendment No. 23.  The amendment which is now before the House provides that the solicitor and counsel for the accused are to be present during the half-hour in which men who do not want their names known may come into court, give their names to the registrar, and receive numbers.  The object of the amendment is to secure that the legal advisers of the accused, and those chosen to defend him, shall know the names, addresses and occupations of the men who are on the panel of jurors.  I think this amendment, having regard to the opinion already expressed in this House&mdash; and I do not want to run counter to these opinions, because I really want to carry amendment No. 23&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not see that they are allowed to be present in court.  I may be wrong.  Apparently, while the panel is being read over the prisoner or his solicitor cannot be present but the prosecutor can.  That seems to me to be an unfair arrangement. The Minister has stated that the accused can, in certain circumstances, challenge the jury.  But if he has not seen them until they are about to try him he does not know the names, and I do not know how he is going to challenge.  The whole thing seems to be part and parcel of a scheme to blind the accused and blind his defence, and then put him before a jury.</P>

      <P>It is obvious from the speech that has been made by Senator Moore that he does not understand the meaning of the sub-section, and I venture to think that if he had consulted Senator Comyn he would have made quite a different speech.  What happens in court?  First a panel is called.  The whole of Section 4 deals with the calling of the panel.  While the panel is called no one shall be present&mdash;not even the prosecutor, the prisoner, the Attorney-General, nor his representative.  After the panel has been called for the purpose of discovering what jurors are present, it is then re-called when the prisoner is indicted.  If he pleads guilty no jury is called.  If he pleads not guilty a jury is called.  Section 4 does not deal with the procedure at all after the prisoner has been <Col N="1101" /> arraigned, or when the challenging comes on, so that it is perfectly obvious the Senator did not understand his own amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 4.  To add at the end of paragraph (d) the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided that the prisoner or his solicitor or counsel shall be entitled to call for and obtain the name, address and occupation of any juror about to be sworn for the purpose of enabling him to exercise his right of challenge.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the amendment in favour of which I withdrew Amendment No. 19, and I most seriously press its acceptance by the House.  The Minister has, in the course of this debate, expressed here and there a willingness to accept, as far as he reasonably can, the claims of ordinary justice.  This amendment puts him to the test.  The Seanad has already decided that the prisoner is not to be allowed to have a copy of the panel.  I had an amendment down proposing that the prisoner's counsel was to be allowed to be present, so as to verify the names of the jurors who are afraid or ashamed to give their names.  I withdrew that.  So that now, in so far as the panel is concerned, and as the Bill stands, the prisoner, his solicitor or counsel are not to know the names of the two, three or four hundred people called on the panel. So be it.  That is the decision of the Seanad.  The meaning of this amendment is that when a prisoner is arraigned, that is, when the charge is read out, and he has been asked to plead guilty or not guilty, as the Minister stated, if he pleads guilty, he is put back for sentence, but if he pleads not guilty, then he is informed that a jury is about to be sworn, that he can challenge five peremptorily and as many more as he can show cause for.  That is what happens.  Then, seventeen or eighteen men out of the whole panel are asked to go to the jury box.  The prisoner's counsel is <Col N="1102" /> usually asked: &ldquo;Do you intend to challenge?&rdquo;  Counsel for the State is asked: &ldquo;Do you intend to standby?&rdquo; Generally they say to the clerk: &ldquo;Call seventeen or eighteen.&rdquo; These seventeen or eighteen are called to the box, so as to allow the prisoner five challenges. The next thing that happens is that the first man is called to be sworn. It is essential that the prisoner should know the name, address and occupation of that man, so as to exercise what Senator O'Farrell called an intelligent and effective challenge.  If he knows the name, address and occupation, he will know whether that man is likely to have any prejudice against him personally, or against the class of offence with which he is charged. For instance, if a barrister were in the dock, and if I were defending him, I would be inclined to challenge any barrister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to explain some of the principles upon which those representing accused persons would act.  The object, <Col N="1103" /> I am sure, of prisoner's counsel on our circuit is to get impartial men.  It may be different in the West, but the star of the West shall yet rise.  That is one of the principles upon which counsel act, and it is a very proper principle. Another principle on which they act is this: A juryman may have expressed an opinion, either in public or in private, hostile to the accused, or hostile to the class of offence with which he was charged. Such a man should be challenged because he is not impartial.  Now, these are principles upon which counsel for the accused and counsel for the State act.  Any man who has expressed an opinion in favour of the accused is ordered to stand by. He is not impartial.  Any man who is believed to have been at any time associated with the accused is ordered to stand by.  He is not impartial. The whole thing has grown up and has been brought to a great degree of perfection so as to secure impartiality and to give the accused person a chance of getting a fair and an impartial trial from people who have no prejudice for him or against him.  That is the reason why the name, the address and the occupation of the persons who go on a man's jury ought to be known by him in order that he may exercise an effective challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the Seanad, if I properly express what is in Senators' minds, and I hope I do, is of opinion that the right to an effective, intelligent challenge should be preserved, and at the same time, as far as humanly possible, the secrecy of the jury.  The object of the amendment, then, is to reduce down from 300 to 16 or 17 the number of persons whose names, addresses, and occupations are to be known.  I do not ask that those names and addresses should be known to every person.  I only ask that the counsel or solicitor representing the accused should know those names for the purpose of exercising an intelligent challenge.  The Minister will not venture to say, I am sure, that the privilege granted to those who represent <Col N="1104" /> the accused will be abused in any way.  The risk is trifling.  In fact, there is no risk.  I do not want to repeat what I said two or three days ago.  Counsel and solicitors in the past, under the British system in this country and, indeed, during the crisis of our Civil War, have been allowed to see and to know things by people in authority who trusted to their ordinary professional honour to do nothing that would in any way discredit them or discredit their profession.</P>
    <P>That is all that I ask, that some chance should be given the accused person in all cases to exercise the right of challenge in an intelligent way.  That can be done without any risk of exposure of the names of the jurors on the panel.  The publication of the names will only be made to the professional men engaged.  I think the Minister will agree with me that there is a feeling in the profession that the principles of the Bill will be loyally adhered to if it becomes the law of the land.  Undoubtedly, if it becomes the law of the land, there will be a feeling in the profession that the principle of secrecy is to be adhered to.  No barrister worthy of his gown, and no solicitor entitled to remain in the ranks of his profession, would violate that principle of secrecy.  Therefore, all that I ask is that gentlemen in the position of barristers and solicitors should be allowed in these cases to know the names, addresses, and occupations of the twelve or thirteen men, out of seventeen, who are called to be sworn in a particular case, and before they are sworn.  I put this to the Seanad as an amendment worthy of the serious consideration of every person here.  I am sorry that Senator Brown is not here. Having regard to what the Minister said in the course of the debate on this Bill&mdash;I have observed very closely what he has said&mdash;I will be greatly mistaken if he does not accede to this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, and I hope the Senator will not.  Senator Comyn asked, amongst other things, that the prisoner shall have access to the names, addresses and occupations of any juror about to be sworn.  He says that his one reason why the prisoner should have that access is that there is no danger, good, bad, or indifferent, but that the principle of this Bill will still be maintained, that the identity of the juryman will be still shielded, and that there could be no attempt at murder.  It is only the prisoner who will see the list of jurors and, notwithstanding the intent which may otherwise be there, the juryman is going to be perfectly safe.  I wonder did Senator Comyn give any consideration to a case like this.  If a prisoner is liberated, and has access before his liberation to the list of jurymen and wants to wreak his vengeance upon them, is there anything to prevent him doing that?  The accused person is to have access to the list from which the jury will be selected.  Suppose he is sentenced to a term of imprisonment. <Col N="1106" /> If he chooses so to wreak his vengeance on the members of the jury when he is liberated in eight months' or in twelve months' time, what is to prevent him doing so?  If that is the case is the purpose of this Bill being maintained?  Of course it is not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that risk is there.  I know that even under this Bill there will be a risk.  I also know this, that if you give the prisoner the name, address and occupation of the jury, you are certainly cutting across the principle of the Bill which makes for shielding the juryman.  I do not say it is a counsel of perfection, but it is the best that can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the principle of the Bill is to deny all protection to the prisoner.  That is my reading of the Bill.  The Senator does not want, apparently, to face that conclusion.  There is a case, and he says that he is agreed that the Bill is not perfection.  The Bill does not absolutely deny this justice to the prisoner, but it gets as near to it as is possible.  It does not shield the appearance of the jury from the prisoner.  He may remember and be able to identify two or three or six members of the jury. Of course, the Minister told us yesterday that it is by that personal identity that the prisoner will be able to exercise the right of challenge. So that it is assumed that there is going to be a certain amount of identification.  If that is permissible <Col N="1107" /> at all, is it not permissible in respect of every one of the jurymen who are trying the case?  If it is permissible for the accused person to recognise the members of the jury, and to exercise, if he desires, the right of challenge, is it not desirable that he should have that privilege or that right, or whatever term you like to apply to it, as regards every one of the jury?  Surely no one would deny that.  Then, if it is permissible and if it is a right privilege that he should be able to identify the whole of the jury, what is the difference between that and having the names and the addresses?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two purposes in the Bill.  There is the purpose to prevent the general intimidation of jurymen.  I am supporting that principle.  Senators will see from an examination of our votes on these amendments that we are prepared to concede the point that there should be some means taken to prevent a general attack on jurymen and the intimidation of jurymen.  Therefore, we are prepared to support the deprivation of the general publication of the panel. But we are not going to agree, and I think that no atom of a case has been made for it, to deprive the accused of the right to know who are going to try him.  Now you concede in the Bill itself that the accused or his counsel or solicitor may be able to identify the jurymen. All that we ask is, that he should have the right to be able to identify the jurymen so that he can exercise the right of challenge which is still secured to him.  It is folly to say that we are giving this man the right to challenge and then to say that he shall only be allowed to exercise the challenge if he can recognise the appearance of the jurymen. If it is a case, let us say, of a prisoner from Donegal, and that the solicitor and counsel are also from Donegal, and that the prisoner is to be tried in Dublin by a Dublin jury, how is he to be expected to identify <Col N="1108" /> the twelve or thirteen jurymen that are called?  He cannot, because he does not know their appearance, and yet, it may be that there is some one on the jury who is publicly renowned as being an enemy of the prisoner or the class of persons from which he is drawn.  If the intention of this amendment is resisted, then the only conclusion that one can come to is that there is a purpose in this Bill to deprive the prisoner, no matter what class of case it is, of the right a prisoner has hitherto been given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Every solicitor who is challenging a jury on behalf of a prisoner attempts, and I think rightly attempts, to get as partial a jury as he can in favour of a prisoner, and to say that any solicitor defending a prisoner ever challenged a man because he said that he was a first cousin of his client and was likely to find him innocent no matter what happened, and not guilty no matter what happened&mdash;to say as Senator Comyn has suggested, that that is the ordinary procedure, is simply ludicrous.  It is absurd to come to the House and put an argument of that kind before it.  If a solicitor defending a prisoner finds <Col N="1109" /> that a brother of the accused is on the jury, he is absolutely delighted, and in my judgment correctly delighted, but there is a completely different standard to be taken where the State is concerned.  It is the duty of the State to see that there is an impartial jury.  It is not the duty of the defendant's solicitor to see that there is an impartial jury. Senator Comyn's suggestion that such a thing is done is the most childish statement that has ever been made to the House.  Senator Johnson is very persistent.  He has made the same speech again for, I think, the fifth time.  As he has done so, I will not delay the time of the House by repeating precisely the same arguments that I used when countering his last speech.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason why it seems to me that Senator Johnson has made the same speech over and over again is because the Senator is definitely opposed to certain principles in this Bill.  I dislike every one of those things and disapprove of most of them.  But I have come to the conclusion, rightly or wrongly, that I am prepared to give those powers that are asked for in the Bill because of the circumstances. If I were not prepared to give those powers to the authorities, then I would vote for practically every amendment on the Order Paper. There are only three or four amendments which, to my mind, do not weaken the powers asked for.  Those who are not willing to give those powers will support practically every amendment and with very similar arguments.  The arguments are practically the same in every case.  Therefore, it is not surprising to me that the speeches on every amendment are somewhat similar. I will vote against this amendment, not because I would be opposed to it in other circumstances, but because, rightly or wrongly, I have made up my mind that I am willing to support the Bill.  If I was voting for the amendment, then I would be voting against the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was greatly surprised to hear the speech made by <Col N="1110" /> the last Senator.  I stated at the outset that I accepted the decision of the Seanad in so far as it had been expressed, namely, that the House was willing to give very extensive powers for the purpose of protecting jurymen according to their view.  In my opinion this Bill will not afford any protection, but that is beside the question.  The view that I represent has been outvoted here, but in moving this amendment it is my duty to have regard to the sentiment expressed by the Seanad.  I did not understand that in securing the protection of jurymen by secrecy you were taking away from the prisoner the simple right that he always had of exercising an intelligent challenge. Now, you cannot propose to carry out one in its entirety without, in some way, trenching on the other. You cannot have this element of perfect secrecy without trenching in some way upon the right of the person who, as the Minister has said&mdash;being a free man&mdash;is an innocent man until he is found guilty. You trench on his rights when you say that he shall not have the panel. You trench on his rights when you say that he shall not be present while these men who want to have their names secret are being enrolled. I am limiting this amendment still further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say, do not take away the prisoner's right of challenge altogether.  Let him know the names and addresses of the whole panel of twelve out of the seventeen.  As regards what the Minister said, he contradicts what I said as to the object of all criminal trials, but I think that I am right in what I said. The object of a trial, in theory, is to have an impartial jury.  I do not mind what the Minister says as regards the practice in Connaught.  I am stating what the theory of trial by jury means, that its essential principle is impartiality, and that impartiality is secured by giving the prisoner's counsel or solicitor the right to challenge a person whom he does not like for one cause or another, and of giving the prosecutor the right of stand-by. <Col N="1111" /> From the two forces you get what the law desires, impartiality in the tribunal as far as that is humanly possible.  I press the Seanad to accept this amendment.  I am surprised that Senator Douglas, merely for the sake of giving complete and perfect scope to this new theory of secrecy, is prepared to take away the essential rights of the accused person.</P>

      <P>I move it as something less objectionable or damaging than a verdict by a majority of nine.  I prefer the unanimous verdict.  I move the amendment without further elaboration, and I am prepared to take the opinion of the House on that matter.</P>

      <P>I would submit to the Seanad that nine out of twelve is reasonable.  I would also suggest that in this country at the present time a majority verdict in criminal cases is desirable.  Of course, different countries have different ideas.  The English idea, as <Col N="1113" /> it has worked for ages in England, and it has worked very well in England, is that there should be a unanimous verdict.  In other countries, like Scotland, France and Germany, there is a majority verdict.  Take Scotland, for example; there it is a bare majority.  Considering the circumstances of this country, I do not think we should tie ourselves slavishly to any precedent.  We should think out to ourselves what is best for this country, and we should not be slavishly tied down to any precedent wherever it comes from.  What I suggest to the Seanad is that for this country a majority of nine out of twelve is the system of coming to a conclusion by a jury which is most likely to lead to fair administration of justice, and by fair administration of justice I mean to secure as far as it is humanly possible the acquittal of innocent persons and the conviction of guilty persons.  When I say the conviction of guilty persons, I wish to make it perfectly clear I mean persons who are absolutely proved to be on the evidence guilty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know there are certain persons in this country who object to finding a verdict of guilty at all. Everybody knows that from experience. Everybody who has had any connection with the administration of criminal law knows there are a great number of such persons in this country.  As a matter of fact, I know a county in my own circuit in which I think it has hardly ever been known that a verdict of guilty was found on any evidence except in cases of cattle or sheep stealing or sexual offences. Apart from that, a person might do anything almost and be certain of acquittal.  In deciding what sort of jury system should prevail in this country we should have in mind that we should have a jury system which would do justice between the State and the accused.  There are persons who want to acquit no matter what evidence there may be, and there may be persons, on the other hand, who, when they see a person in the dock, say, &ldquo;oh, he is charged and he is guilty.&rdquo;  That is <Col N="1114" /> a type of mind that exists.  It is not at all as common as the type of mind which says, &ldquo;Let the poor fellow off,&rdquo; and that sort of thing. Our suggestion is that if you get nine men convinced of the guilt, or nine men convinced of the innocence, as the case may be, of the prisoner that that verdict should stand.  It may be said that what we propose is a very big modification of the law.  I grant you.  In Scotland there is a bare majority. A modification of the Scotch system is more suitable to our country than the English system of the unanimous verdict.</P>
    <P>In order that I may not have to speak again on this point, I would like to forestall certain objections that may be made.  I would like to point out that the point regarding the objection that an innocent man might suffer, it must be borne in mind that in this country we have since the Free State was established set up a Court of Criminal Appeal, which used not exist at all. That court can go fully into every case.  If they think juries were not justified in coming to their findings they can upset the verdict.  They did, in fact, upset the finding of a jury.  The court do not confine themselves to questions of law, the misdirection of the judge, and all that.  They can go into the whole circumstances of the case.  There was one case recently before the Court of Criminal Appeal where a person swore to the identity of the accused person, but the court were not satisfied that the person who had sworn to the identity of the accused person really had the opportunity of judging, and the verdict was set aside.  I give that as one example.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends entirely.  If a person has no means he can go to the Court of Criminal Appeal and get a copy of the notes.  In other criminal cases there might be civil proceedings also, but in every case it is a great advantage, when charged with a <Col N="1115" /> crime, if you are wealthy, because you can get fashionable counsel and advocacy which, if you are not wealthy, you cannot get.  Possibly advocacy plays too large a part in the defence of prisoners.  Taking it from the point of view of the administration of justice, that is, the conviction of the guilty and the acquittal of the innocent, we are more likely to secure that purpose by having nine out of twelve.  As far as this particular Bill is concerned, and the particular circumstances of the country are concerned, there is a very strong argument why, as far as possible, the names of the persons who are serving on the jury should not be known.  We are endeavouring to prevent persons of criminal intent knowing who is serving on the jury.  As the section stands now, it means that it would not be known whether there was a unanimous verdict or not.  All that would be known is that at least nine persons decided.  That is a great safeguard. Even if the names of the jurymen can be got, it is a great safeguard to the jurymen who give a verdict, because a person who would be likely to pursue a juryman or injure him in his person or property will not know, even if he gets the names of the jurors, those who voted for conviction or acquittal. All he can know is that there were nine for acquittal or conviction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a very reasonable amendment, and the Minister has not attempted to answer it. All of his arguments have been addressed to the case where there might be one of the twelve standing out for an acquittal.  They are all addressed to the one boot-eater, as he is called, the one intelligent man, as it sometimes happens.  On the Second Reading of this Bill, I gave a description of a case in which an innocent man had been tried three times.  On the first trial, there were ten or eleven for conviction; on the second trial, there were seven: and on the third trial he was acquitted. Deputy Johnson gave another example from his own experience. <Col N="1116" /> If nine jurors were sufficient to secure a conviction in this case, the man would now be suffering imprisonment and would be under the cloud of infamy resulting from conviction on the charges made against him.  There may be something to recommend that the one boot-eater should not prevail&mdash;the cranks, as this type are sometimes called, but intelligent men they very frequently are.  The arguments of the Minister are all addressed against the theory of a unanimous verdict.  Not one argument was addressed to meet this amendment. The Minister said that advocacy plays perhaps too great a part in criminal trials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope advocacy is not going to play too great a part in the discussion of this Bill by the Minister. He has very nicely given you his version of what the law is in Scotland, but there are some things he omitted to state.  In Scotland three verdicts may be given.  There is the verdict of guilty, the verdict of not guilty, and the third verdict of not proven.  According to the law of Scotland the Chancellor or foreman of the jury is compelled to return to the court the fact whether it is a majority or a unanimous verdict.  That is a right which the Minister seeks to take from the people of this country.  There is no analogy whatever with Scotland.  Moreover, there is more than one judge hearing, and if the verdict is not a unanimous verdict, if it is a majority verdict, it is competent for three judges to consider what they would do as a result of that verdict.  In no country where the Irish people live is a majority verdict allowed.  Reference was made to the Colonies&mdash; Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.  So far as I can find out there are only two cases in our books in the Dominions referring to majority verdicts, and these were in civil cases.  I submit that while there may be some argument for disregarding one man on a jury there can be no argument for disregarding three.  If three men are for an acquittal it is a highly dangerous thing to convict a man, especially <Col N="1117" /> when he can be tried again as a result of a disagreement.  I think the amendment proposed by Senator Johnson ought to commend itself to this House.  I do not want in any way to be disrespectful to the Seanad, but if Senators are willing to listen to reason and argument they will support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is the Minister's case that rather confirms me in favour of the amendment.  I have not had very strong convictions on the question of a majority verdict in ordinary cases, but I have a strong feeling in regard to a majority verdict in capital cases.  The Minister's argument against the amendment rather strengthens whatever opinion I had in the matter.  He pointed out that there was a certain sentiment abroad and a general prejudice against finding prisoners guilty, and that sentiment played a part in determining verdicts.  Then he said that advocacy played perhaps too great a part in criminal cases.  One has not lived these last twenty years without acquiring some knowledge of mob psychology, and one realises how difficult it is for the majority of people to resist influences that are about them.  It is always the minority that is strong enough to resist these influences.  The case the Minister has made is that possibly if you have a plausible and effective advocate in a case he will at once influence the minds of the jury. Though it is desirable that it is on the facts the jury should find a verdict the truth is that in the majority of cases it is not only the facts that are taken into account but also the advocacy.  It is the minority in every case that is able to resist the influence and atmosphere that have been artificially created by the advocate. Therefore, we have to give greater weight to the minority which is able to resist that atmosphere and influence that the advocate has created, and that tends to strengthen the case for a unanimous verdict.  It is the minority that is able to bring reason more strongly <Col N="1118" /> to bear than emotion that you must convince by the presentation of facts.</P>
      <P>That strengthens very greatly the case for a unanimous verdict.  I would concede that it is possible that you may have on a jury a man who will say: &ldquo;I am for conviction, and I shall go to sleep until you find a verdict according to my judgment.&rdquo;  You may have that crank, but you are not going to have more than one crank in twelve, speaking on the average, on juries.  He would not be a crank if there were more than one in twelve of his way of thinking.  It is making allowance for that possibly violent objector, who is absolutely opposed to finding a verdict in any way but that upon which he has decided, that you are simply asked to insure in this amendment that eleven out of twelve people shall be convinced in a trial by jury.</P>

Eight is one less than nine, which is proposed in this Bill.  It is a curious fact that one of the most remarkable cases of miscarriage of justice in Scotland in recent times&mdash;the Slater case&mdash;was a unanimous verdict, and the worst miscarriage of justice in England, a case of mistaken identity, about twenty years ago, was also in the case of a unanimous verdict.</P>

      <P>Section 5.  After the word &ldquo;offence&rdquo; in line 65 to insert the words &ldquo;other than a crime for which the penalty of death may be inflicted.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to emphasise the importance of this amendment.  We have discussed the section at considerable length and Senator Johnson and Senator Comyn have made their case without much effect on the House. Now we come to the crucial test, as to whether the same principles of majority rule as regards juries is going to apply in the issue where a man's life is at stake.  Whatever arguments were used on the last amendment assume, I think, an infinitely greater significance with regard to this amendment, and I suggest to the House, without any further parleying on the matter, that a majority verdict in a case of life and death is not sufficient, and that a unanimous verdict, when there is a human life at stake, should be demanded and laid down in the legislation.  The section leaves it open for a sentence of death to be passed on a majority verdict. That I think is a highly dangerous thing, and I feel that whatever may be said about other trials, it is a <Col N="1121" /> very serious responsibility for this Seanad to accept that a majority verdict will be sufficient to sentence a man to be hanged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>What I indicated on the discussion on the last amendment I feel very much more strongly with regard to this one. I agree with Senator Connolly that it is of a much more serious character and I think we ought to take that seriousness into account, and not allow a majority verdict to carry in the case of an offence where the death penalty will follow.  The discussions that took place tend to show that there is a certain doubt about the efficacy of the jury system as we know it.  There seems to be a feeling amongst those who have had experience that it is not quite so satisfactory as would be desired, and is perhaps less satisfactory here than in some other countries.  The very fact that there is some doubt as to the efficacy of the jury system in ensuring that justice will be done, that there is a less acute sense of responsibility amongst jurors, certainly seems to show me, and would seem to show generally, that in the matter of the death penalty, at any rate, a unanimous verdict should be required.  I do not want to elaborate this case to any degree.  Instances were given by Senator Comyn on the Second Reading of two cases, one within my own knowledge, and another within Senator Comyn's knowledge, where verdicts of guilty were afterwards upset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would surely appeal to every Senator that when a verdict is going to involve the death penalty, the whole of the jury ought to be satisfied as to the guilt of the prisoner. If there is a possibility that three out of twelve&mdash;one-fourth of the population&mdash;because a jury is supposed to be a microcosm of the population, to put it that way&mdash;that one-fourth of the people who have power in the matter are not satisfied of the guilt of the prisoner, and that the other three-fourths find a verdict which will lead to the death penalty, <Col N="1122" /> that is too great a responsibility for the Seanad to accept, and it ought not to change the law in this respect. The Minister has elaborated upon the value of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  I am not going to depreciate that in the least, nor am I going to depreciate the possibility that an appeal to the Ministry might ultimately save the prisoner.  But we are now concerned with our responsibility, and we should not, I submit, agree that nine persons out of twelve are sufficient to send a man to his death.  I second the amendment, and I ask the House to approve of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is any mind in this Assembly open to argument on any clause of this Bill I wish with all the strength at my disposal to address my words to that mind, because there is not in the law of any country of the world a provision like this, where the question at issue is the life or death of a man.  The law of Scotland has been referred to and Senator Brown has stated that a majority of eight can carry a verdict. In such a case what happens is that a &ldquo;Not Proven&rdquo; verdict is usually returned; moreover, if there is a verdict by a majority the chancellor of the jury is bound to certify to the three judges sitting that it is a majority verdict and not a unanimous verdict.  Now this Bill, as it stands, proposes that even in a case of life and death if nine are for death the judge must not be told that there are three for life.  Therefore, I say that this Bill is the most drastic to be found in the legislation of any country and that the section is written in blood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many men, and I am not saying that I differ from them, or that they perhaps are not absolutely right, who say that the State has no power to take life.  The laws of this country provide that in cases of murder the State has power to take life.  But the State should be very cautious, and should secure that there is unanimity and certainty about the guilt before they do so.  If three men of the sworn twelve on their oaths say that they are not satisfied of the guilt, I think <Col N="1123" /> the State, in defence of life, which is a principle of law always, ought to say, &ldquo;let the man live,&rdquo; and that the men and women in this Seanad ought to say so, too.  Senator Brown has called attention to many cases where by a unanimous verdict innocent men have been convicted of murder.  Senator Brown said that in a case in Scotland there was a unanimous verdict.</P>

      <P>Very well, not murder. Even with a unanimous verdict there have been terrible miscarriages of justice in our own time.  Francey Hynes, an innocent man, was hanged; and as Senator Mrs. Wyse Power has informed the House, Myles Joyce, an Irish-speaking witness, who protested his innocence before a jury here in Dublin in his own tongue, was convicted and hanged, and when the rope refused to do its duty the hangman jumped on his shoulders and he strangled him on the gallows. In the Knocklong case an innocent man was sent to the gallows.  He was a man, I am told, who was known to be innocent.  That will be a matter for inquiry hereafter.  In another case two men went to bed one night but in the morning there of blood, and from that there was a stream of blood leading to a river. The conclusion at once arrived at was murder, that the living companion murdered the man who was gone.  A unanimous jury found him guilty of murder and he was hanged.  Three years afterwards the man who was supposed to have been murdered, reappeared.  He had been captured by a press gang. I say that in a case of life and death, <Col N="1124" /> if the State has a right to take life&mdash; which some people, and some of the best people deny&mdash;I ask you not to take life if there are any men in the twelve who vote against death. This is a very serious matter, and I think, without wishing in the slightest degree to go beyond what is reasonable, fair and moderate, I say, without any hesitation, that this section as it stands, means the verdict is one of blood and death. That is wrong, and the Minister is really going too far.  You may send a man to prison but the survives, but if you send a man to the gallows the thing is irrevocable, and really we ought not to do that.</P>

      <P>I am not prepared to follow the last speaker in all his arguments, but the reasons why I am prepared to vote for the amendment I would like to state very briefly.  In the first place, as most Senators know.  I absolutely disapprove of capital punishment by the State.  I do not want to go into that now; it is not relevant.  One of my reasons is because in almost every charge there is a certain discretion on the part of the judge as to the penalty which may be inflicted. In a class of crime for which capital punishment may be inflicted there is no discretion on the part of the judge, and it is not possible for him to vary the sentence according to the circumstances. That is one reason which I think is relevant.  The second reason is because it is irrevocable.  It is possible in some measure to right a wrong which may have been done.  Generally speaking, I would go further even than this Bill.  I think that nine out of twelve would generally be for all purposes wise.  As long as you insist on continuing capital punishment and because that punishment is irrevocable and because the judge has no discretion, I do not think you should carry out the death sentence where there is a doubt.  For that reason I would be in favour of continuing the unanimous verdict only in cases where, if there is a conviction, the penalty of death would have to be imposed by the judge.</P>

      <P>I do not often differ with Senator Douglas, but on looking at the purpose of this Bill, and seeing what it is meant to carry out, I note in all the speeches an entire omission of the danger to the juries who find the verdicts.  Undoubtedly in cases where the death penalty is inflicted for what is called political crime the danger to the jurors is far greater than if the penalty is anything else.  This is the crucial clause where the Bill tries to save the lives of jurors.  We have heard how justice may go wrong, but so far as the jurors are concerned it is not justice that will be done, it is vengeance, and if the Seanad choses to remove this safeguard and to make the name of every juryman known&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is the whole danger, because, of course, if there is an acquittal there is no danger.  I am considering the danger to the jurymen who find a verdict of guilty in a murder case of a political nature. I say that this clause is one of the most vital clauses in the Bill because it provides for some safety to jurymen in the greatest danger to which they can be exposed.  I would have liked to hear some of the speakers who have been advocating everything for the prisoner giving some consideration to the case of the jurymen who, I really believe, in all the votes that we have given on this Bill we are trying to protect.  I think the differences amongst us are quite plain.  All of us who have been <Col N="1126" /> voting for the Bill as it stands have had one object in our minds, and that was the protection of jurymen and witnesses in cases of political crimes.  That was the whole point that we had in view, and I hold in this case that the advocates of the proposal that the twelve jurymen should give a unanimous verdict for a conviction are exposing those twelve men to all the dangers that we are trying to save them from. To my mind, that is the weakness of the case as it has been put forward. If nine men out of twelve find a prisoner guilty I think there are very few of us who will deny that there must be a terrible weight of evidence to show that he has committed the crime of which he is accused.</P>

      <P>That is a matter of opinion.  If nine ordinary citizens of the Free State say that in their opinion the evidence shows that he has committed the crime, there must be a great weight of evidence against him.  But if we require all the twelve to agree we certainly condemn them to a risk to which we ought not to expose them.  That is the reason why I think this amendment should not be passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Commuted, yes.  In practice, of course, if there is any real doubt the sentence of death is always commuted. That is the ordinary practice.  It may be completely illogical.  A person is either guilty or is not guilty. A sentence of death should never be commuted, in strict theory.  In fact it is commuted, because there is doubt.  Possibly I have put that too widely.  It may be commuted in certain occasions because the crime hardly amounts to murder&mdash;when it is almost approaching manslaughter. But there are other occasions when undoubtedly the sentence is commuted because there is a certain amount of doubt.  That has always happened.  It is, as it were, indefensible in theory, but it has always been done.  I will take one famous example&mdash;Mrs. Maybrick's case.  The sentence was commuted in her case to penal servitude for life, and she was let out after a certain number of years.  The Executive Council deals with these matters, and I think any Executive Council would, if there was an element of doubt, consider that it would be wiser not to carry out the death sentence.  I think in practice that if a case such as Senator Douglas has put up did in fact come before any Executive Council in this country&mdash;that is to say, where the jury was not unanimous; I do not mean where one person dissented from the verdict, but if there were nine to three&mdash;certainly the Executive Council would regard it with the most scrupulous care&mdash;with doubly scrupulous care.</P>

I was dealing with Senator Douglas's suggestion, not as to what is in the Bill but as to what Senator Douglas thought might be put into the Bill, when I was interrupted.  It is quite conceivable that some provision of that nature might be put into the Bill.  But without tying myself down in any way until I actually see what is in Senator Douglas's amendment, if he puts down one for the Report Stage, I will certainly give it the most careful consideration&mdash;that is, an amendment to the effect that if the jury bring in a verdict of guilty, stating to the judge that it is a majority verdict, the death sentence shall not be passed.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it would save time if I explained that the Bill as drafted was drafted under the advice of a competent draftsman and was extended somewhat from the first intention; that is to say, it was made into three sections instead of one, but on submission to the Department of Local Government their advisers thought it desirable to re-draft the Bill so as to have one effective section only in it.  The amendments that are to be proposed do not affect to any degree the substance of the Bill but do, in fact, delete two of the clauses and compress them all into the first clause, with certain other formal amendments which the Minister believes necessary.  I may say that I have the authority of the Minister to indicate to the Seanad that the amendments that are now proposed are official, that is to say, they are departmental amendments; the Minister has agreed to them and is prepared to give support to the Bill and to help it through the Dáil.

      <P>I move amendment 30:</P>
      <P>Section 6, sub-section (3).  Before sub-section (3) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Whenever a person charged in the Central Criminal Court or in the Circuit Court with any crime or offence refuses to recognise the court or refuses to recognise the authority or jurisdiction of the court or does any act which in the opinion of the judge is equivalent to a refusal to recognise the court or the authority or jurisdiction thereof the judge shall enter a plea of not guilty.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happened immediately before the adjournment has, perhaps, altered my attitude and that of some <Col N="1133" /> members.  In regard to this amendment I suggest that it is an improvement on the Bill.  The Minister and myself have been in many courts where the performance has been gone through of persons not recognising the court.  There were then trials and inquisitions to find out whether the person was mute of malice or by the visitation of God. In the old days he was pressed, and here is the old phrase.  As much weight was put on him as he could bear, and more, so that he was crushed into making a plea.  In cases in which I was concerned, when a man said he refused to recognise the jurisdiction of the court, the judge entered a plea of not guilty for him and went on with the trial. I think it would be injurious to the prestige of the courts solemnly to go and sentence a man to six months' imprisonment for not recognising the court, and later to go on with his trial.  I submit to the House for their favourable consideration that in cases like this what ought to be done is what was done before.  If a man says from the dock: &ldquo;I do not recognise your authority,&rdquo; then let the judge enter a plea of not guilty for him and go on with the trial. That is the meaning of my amendment, and I think it is a reasonable one.</P>
    <P>It will put an end to all this business of having a special investigation as to what punishment ought to be inflicted upon a prisoner for the offence he commits behind the bar in the dock.  I submit the amendment to the good sense of the House. What I am suggesting in this amendment was done in several cases in which I was concerned. Immediately after the civil war there were a number of trials in Green Street Courthouse.  Sir Thomas Lopdell O'Shaughnessy, a man well known to Senators, who seemed to be terribly violent in his language, did not enforce the Act, an Act which was passed by the Oireachtas and which then provided that Republicans might be flogged. He imposed a sentence in one case of thirty years' imprisonment, ten <Col N="1134" /> years for the offence on which the prisoner was charged and twenty years for impertinence.</P>

The judge said that, instead of making the sentences run concurrently, three sentences of ten years each, he would make them run consecutively. He gave the lash to no man.  What that judge used do, when a man said that he refused to recognise the court, was to order that a plea of not guilty be entered for him and to go on with the trial.  I thought at the time that that was a sensible thing to do, and I am of the same opinion still.  Without any further comment I put the amendment to the Seanad for consideration.</P>

      <P>Two things can happen under the sub-section in the Bill.  If a man stands mute of malice, the old procedure is done away with, and a jury is empanelled. The judge then decides whether the man is mute of malice or by the visitation of God.  If the jury finds that he is mute of malice, a plea of not guilty is entered and <Col N="1135" /> the trial is proceded with.  A plea of not guilty is also entered if he refuses to recognise the court.  If he refuses to recognise the court he renders himself liable to a term of imprisonment, the term of imprisonment not to be more than six months. It is within the discretion of the court to say it may be only until the rising of the court, but the judge has the discretion to sentence him to a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months.  There are two courses open to the prisoner.  He may plead guilty or not guilty.  In fact, there are three courses open to him.  He may plead guilty, he may remain completely silent, and he may insult the court by declining to recognise the authority of the court.  If he does that I submit that he should be punished for it, because the authority and standing of our courts must be recognised by every citizen of the State.  Our courts have been set up by the authority of the Oireachtas, and they operate under the authority of the Dáil and Seanad.  They are the courts which have been set up by the people of this State, and they must be recognised by every person who comes before them.</P>

      <P>In answer to the Minister may I submit that you may go too far in trying to uphold your dignity.  You can make yourself a little ridiculous if you are always thinking about your dignity.  I think that what the old Recorder, Sir Thomas O'Shaughnessy, used to do was the best course to follow.  When a man came before him and said that he refused to recognise the court he ruled out all this dignity and ordered that a plea of not guilty be entered for him and the trial proceeded with. If that course is followed it will save a lot of time and inconvenience. It would also save all this parade that we know takes place.  It would save all the parade of trying a man for not recognising the court and then of sentencing him to a period of six months' imprisonment.  I put it to the Minister that it would conduce more to the dignity of the court if <Col N="1136" /> all this parade in trying a man and sentencing him to six months' imprisonment were left out.  I suggest the proper course to follow is to enter a plea of not guilty and proceed with the trial.  Otherwise the time of the court will be wasted as well as that of public officials and others who are compelled to attend the court.</P>

      <P>I wonder if the Minister would reconsider this part of the Bill.  There is a great deal to be said for what Senator Comyn says. After all, a man who is perfectly honestly opposed to the present régime in this country, when he is charged with a crime, may say respectfully to the court when he is asked to plead: &ldquo;I do not recognise the Court.&rdquo;  It depends, of course, a good deal on the way in which that is said.  Of itself, it is not an insult to the court.  The man is merely telling the court that he does not recognise the tribunal.  I think that perhaps the Minister would make the Bill more easily acceptable to us if he would reconsider this part of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the intention is that the discussion should be general in regard to this part of the sub-section inasmuch as several amendments down to it seek to effect the same purpose.  I am quite prepared to agree that gross disrespect should be followed by some penalty.  I had thought that, under <Col N="1137" /> the law as it is, the judge had power to punish for contempt of court.  I take it that gross disrespect of the court is, in effect, contempt of court. Under the sub-section as it stands refusal to recognise the court is immediately followed by a sentence not exceeding six months.  As Senator Brown has said, this may be done by a man from motives of the highest sincerity and conviction.  He is not even grossly disrespectful to the court.  He recognises that the court exists, and if he recognised the State he would be perfectly respectful to the court.  He states, in fact, that he does not recognise the court. That results from a certain attitude that he adopts towards the State.  I submit that there should be a habitation in any country for any individual who does not do overt acts of antagonism to the State or the social order.  Mere refusal on the part of an individual to recognise the authority of the State, the State as it is represented by the courts, unless that is accompanied by overt acts, should not, in my opinion, be followed by punishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on the Second Reading of the Bill, you have here the possibility for the kind of action that has been well known throughout history, of people who, even from religious convictions, will in some cases refuse to recognise the authority placed over them.  A person of that kind may state that fact to the court with perfect respect, but under the sub-section as it stands such a person is bound to suffer a penalty.  I plead that an offence of that kind has nothing whatever to do with the purposes of this Bill. It is entirely foreign to the purpose of the Bill as explained by the Minister. There is no question of the protection of jurymen in this.  You are making a new offence.  You may say that it is undesirable for a man to refuse to recognise the authority of the court.  There is no gross disrespect if he merely states that he refuses to recognise the authority of the court.  Let that be noted, but surely no punishment should follow. I think that whatever amendment is best suited, in substitution for <Col N="1138" /> that particular portion of the section, ought to be accepted by the Seanad, and that we should not place on the judge this imperative order that he must sentence an accused person if he states that he does not recognise the court.  I hope the House will agree to the suggestion that has been made by Senator Brown, even though the present amendment does not confine itself to that.</P>

      <P>I am not sure which of the amendments would be best suited to meet the object that I and other Senators have in view.  What I suggest is that the Minister would agree that the matter might be left over and considered on Report.</P>

      <P>My view is very firm on this.  Persons who have a conscientious objection to recognise the jurisdiction of the court can remain silent, but to deliberately stand up and say &ldquo;We refuse to recognise the court&rdquo; is undoubtedly flouting the authority of the court.  I submit that such a thing as that should not be recognised or allowed.  As to the amount of punishment that is inflicted, of course that would depend on the manner in which the thing is done. If it is done in a certain fashion, then the punishment will undoubtedly be very small, but if done in a fashion which is very extreme the punishment naturally will be more severe.</P>

      <P>The main point seems to me to be that what we want to do is to make it as difficult as possible for persons to use methods of violence in showing their objection to the authority of the State.  If there are people, to my mind foolish people, who believe this country is not independent, and who simply confine themselves to saying: &ldquo;I cannot recognise this court,&rdquo; I think it is foolish to make that of itself a punishable offence.  Of course, contempt of court can be dealt with by the judge.  It seems to me it should be possible in this amendment to provide definitely for genuine disrespect of court, but it should not be <Col N="1139" /> an offence simply to say: &ldquo;I do not recognise the court.&rdquo;  Again, I would say there are certain people in this country who, sincerely or insincerely&mdash;we need not argue that&mdash; say that they do not recognise the authority of the State at present.  I think they are foolish and misguided, and have wrong conceptions of the State, but if they are not taking part in any active violence opposed to the State I would not make that an offence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the discussion has taken an extraordinary turn. Here is one of the Houses of the Oireachtas, that frames the laws and enacts the statutes, that is the governing authority in this country, and here we have the suggestion that the repudiation of the authority of this State is going to get what is almost statutory recognition.  I say if there is one offence it is necessary for this Oireachtas to make perfectly clear will not be tolerated it is challenge to the authority of the State, whether the challenge to that authority be in a polite and courteous manner or in a brutal or murderous fashion.  I say the State has to recognise those who make that challenge as opponents of its authority, and must deal with them accordingly.  As the Minister has pointed out, this section does not state that the judge shall impose a term of six months regardless of the manner of the challenge to the State, or the non-recognition of its authority.  But to frame a law which is going to tolerate that denial of the State's authority seems to me an extraordinary view to be put forward by this House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such thing as asking that a denial of the State's authority should be sanctioned by this House.  The only point is this, and it has been well put already, that when a prisoner is asked to plead he should be allowed to tell the truth in a respectful manner.  If he says it in a disrespectful manner, or does anything to disrespect the court, the judge, under <Col N="1140" /> the ordinary law, has full power to deal with it, but my amendment only allows to be done what in fact has been done by the wisest judges up to the present.  If a man says: &ldquo;My opinion is such that I cannot recognise the court,&rdquo; then, &ldquo;Very well. Sit down.  Enter a plea of not guilty and go on with the trial.&rdquo;  That is all that is intended by my amendment. If a person is disrespectful, or says or does anything that brings the court, or the authority of the court, into disrespect, there is an old law for dealing with that.  I submit my amendment is doing that really. Another reason I have is in order to prevent the court from making itself ridiculous, or rather, allowing the judge the discretion to prevent his court from being made ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make one other suggestion to the Minister?  There is another amendment&mdash;I think it is number 34&mdash;in which failure to recognise the court is still recognised as an offence and the judge has discretion. It is not &ldquo;shall&rdquo; but &ldquo;may.&rdquo;  Therefore, he would have discretion if the failure to recognise the court was a respectful one and not meant as an insult.  He has power under that, and the judge, with ordinary discretion, would exercise that.  If it is done in a way that is an insult to the court he would have the power to deal with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. Gogarty Dr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it will not. The distinction between a respectful and disrespectful refusal to recognise the court is like a distinction between giving a respectful and disrespectful pair of black eyes.  The courts are there not to administer English law but the ordinary international human law.  If a man declares himself the enemy of social order it would be a desirable thing that he should automatically go to jail for a few years.  After doing so he might not be inclined to make <Col N="1141" /> such nice distinctions.  People who do not recognise humanitarian or social laws are of little value to the country.  People who do not want to recognise the courts here should go elsewhere.  Humouring and conniving and showing a sort of sympathy with felony should not be countenanced.  Anyone who does not recognise the court should be treated as an enemy.  The Oireachtas makes the laws of the land, and the courts administer that law.  The Oireachtas represents the nation, and the opinion of the nation has been made manifest at the elections.  Anyone who says he does not recognise the court should go to jail automatically without any discretion by the judge. I hope the Seanad will not be confused. The legal confuser on the other side has attempted to do it when he makes a distinction between a respectful and a disrespectful insult.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not an enormous amount of difference between the section as it stands and the proposal Senator Brown has just recently put forward.  The distinction is that as the section stands the judge must pass sentence though it may be only for a moment or two. It is then his discretion is exercised. He may pass sentence&mdash;the difference there is the difference between &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and &ldquo;may&rdquo;&mdash;to the rising of the court or the determination of the trial.  The difference between that and that he may sentence to six months is not, to my mind, a very big difference.  As far as I am concerned, I would be willing to accept the proposal, because really the principle I stand for still remains in the section, that is, the offence for the accused not to recognise the court is the main thing.</P>

      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Amendment 34.&mdash;Section 6, sub-section (3).  To delete the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in line 35 and to substitute therefor the word &ldquo;may.&rdquo;&mdash; (Senator Dowdall).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 6, sub-section (4).  To delete lines 40-54 inclusive and to insert in lieu thereof the words &ldquo;proceed with the trial of such person on the charge on which he was being tried when he was so sentenced and such.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I understand that the judge has to exercise his discretion, and in the exercise of that discretion he may sentence the accused to six months' imprisonment. Then, a certain procedure shall follow.  When a person is sentenced under the foregoing sub-section of the Bill the Bill says the judge shall at his discretion either direct that such a person shall suffer a term of imprisonment in regard to his non-recognition, and shall follow the sentence which he has been given in respect of the offence for which he has been charged.  Under the provision of this sub-section (4) it is possible for the culprit to have a very long term of imprisonment. He may be sentenced for his non-recognition to a month.  He serves that month, and before the end of the month the session is closed. Then he must come to the next session for the trial of his case, and again he refuses to recognise the court, and again he is sentenced, perhaps, to six weeks, on this occasion, or two months.  Again he is required to serve his sentence for his non-recognition, and in the meantime again the session concludes. That may be repeated time after time, so that there is no limit to the punishment this particular accused person may suffer under the provisions of this section.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister intended that should be possible, but it clearly is possible under the provisions of the section, and I think the Seanad ought not to agree to that indeterminate sentence which would follow the passing of the Bill in its present form.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not an uncommon thing for a person to be tried and found guilty of two offences, the sentences to run concurrently. I think it should not be possible for this indeterminate sentence to lie over a man.  If he had been tried for the original offence he would know exactly what his punishment was.  He would be tried and punished at that session.  In this case, as I said, the position of the prisoner is one of prolonged and perhaps perpetual imprisonment for these two offences, one of which is quite a minor one while the other may be a serious one.</P>

      <P>The Senator seems to forget, as he reminded us a few moments ago, that this is a Juries (Protection) Bill.  One of the notes of warning sounded to jurymen is when the accused says he refuses to recognise the court.  This is a class of case which is dangerous to juries&mdash;a case in which a person refuses to recognise the court.  That is the note of warning.  Why this comes into this Bill at all is that a note of warning shall not be sounded openly and publicly in court to the jury. If it is sounded in court, and if the judge thinks that that refusal to plead is a flouting of the court and is in effect a warning to the jury that the case is one that is possibly not very safe for them to convict the prisoner on, and if the judge thinks that that will affect the fair administration of justice, he certainly should have power, I submit, to let the man serve his sentence and have the trial postponed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask Senators to consider the position for one moment.  A man comes forward and without disrespect says that he does not recognise the court.  Now, the judge can go on with the trial.  My submission is that any judge with a head on his shoulders will go on with the trial in such a case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and that any judge, unless he is eligible for retirement, will not send a man to jail for six weeks and that when the man came out again and refuses to recognise the court, send him to jail for three months, and when he comes up again and again refuses to recognise the court sends him in for six months. Such a judge as that would make himself ridiculous, and no judge is going to do that, because before a man becomes a judge he has to serve a rather long apprenticeship at the Bar, where a certain amount of commonsense, a dread of making himself ridiculous, is inculcated, so that there is really nothing in what the Minister says at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>If the refusal to recognise the court is a perfectly respectful one the judge will not sentence him to any term of imprisonment. He will be tried and the case will go on.  But if he outrageously and in public contempt of the court refuses to recognise it, then he will be properly sentenced, and if he comes up again on the termination of that sentence and does that contumacious act again why should he not be sentenced again?  The section as it stands is perfectly right, a discretion being left to the judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>If my amendment were accepted the section would read: &ldquo;When a person is sentenced under the foregoing sub-section of this section to suffer a term of imprisonment, the judge shall proceed with the trial of such person on the charge on which he was being tried when he was so sentenced, and such person shall suffer imprisonment in accordance with such sentence as from the conclusion of and in addition to such other punishment,&rdquo; and so on.  That will be the section if my amendment is carried.  Now if you have a contumacious case you do not want to challenge that man to repeat his offence time and time again.  If you set it down in the statute that it is an offence, if he commits the offence and you punish <Col N="1145" /> him for it, surely that is enough. But the proposition is that you should in effect challenge him to come back again and that you will say to him: &ldquo;Now will you dare to do it?&rdquo;  If he is a man of spirit, a man of the kind that you are contemplating, he will do it because you have challenged him to do it.  But we do not want to create an offence by this kind of challenge when you have already punished him for it. You have indicated a sense of wrong, that the State has suffered by his contumacious act, you have punished him for it, and I do not think that it is the practice of the law to encourage people to commit offences for which they have already been punished once.  That would be the effect of the Bill as it stands.</P>

    <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 6 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 7.</P>
    <P>(1)  Whenever, at the trial of an accused person in the Central Criminal Court or in the Circuit Court and after such accused person has pleaded &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo; or a plea of &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo; has been entered for him and before any further proceedings are had, an officer of the Gárda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent states on oath to the judge presiding at such trial that in the opinion of such officer it is necessary for the protection of the witnesses and jurors concerned in such trial that the public should be excluded from the court during such trial, the judge shall order the court to be cleared and shall not proceed with such trial until the court has been cleared in accordance with this section.</P>
    <P>(2)  When a court has been cleared under this section at the trial of an accused person the court shall be kept so cleared during such trial until the verdict of the jury has been recorded or the jury have failed to agree and have been discharged.</P>
    <P>(3)  For the purposes of this section references to the clearing of the court shall be construed as meaning the exclusion from the court of all persons whatsoever except the judge presiding at the trial then in progress, the officers of the court, the jurors sworn for such trial, the accused person and any member of the Gárda Síochána or prison warder in charge of him, the counsel and solicitors engaged in such trial, members of the Gárda Síochána on duty in the court, other officers of the State present in their official capacity, the witness (if any) who is for the time being giving evidence, barristers bona fide practising as <Col N="1148" /> such in Saorstát Eireann and, subject to the provisions of the three next following sub-sections of this section, representatives of the press.</P>
    <P>(4)  In this section the expression &ldquo;representative of the press&rdquo; means a person who is regularly engaged or employed in journalism and is duly accredited by the editor of a bona fide newspaper published not less often than once a week or by the manager of a bona fide news agency or press association as a representative of such newspaper or a reporter of legal proceedings for such newspaper, news agency, or press association.</P>
    <P>(5)  Whenever immediately after the clearing of a court under this section an officer of the Gárda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent produces to the judge presiding in such court one or more then recent issue or issues of a particular newspaper or a document or documents appearing and purporting to be such issue or issues and the judge is of opinion that any articles or other matter contained in such issue or document or any of such issues or documents is calculated to intimidate jurors or witnesses either generally or in the particular trial then in progress or to prevent or discourage such jurors from performing their duty according to their oath without fear or favour or to prevent or discourage such witnesses from giving their evidence freely, fully and truthfully, the judge shall forthwith order that all persons claiming to be representatives of or reporters for such newspaper be excluded from the court so long as such court continues to be cleared under this section, and thereupon while such court continues to be so cleared no person shall be admitted to or be present in such court on the ground that he is a representative of or a reporter for such newspaper.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1149" /> (6)  Whenever at any time while a court is cleared under this section an officer of the Gárda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent states on oath to the judge presiding in such court that a particular person then claiming the right to be admitted to or to remain in such court as a representative of the Press is known to be or is suspected of being concerned or associated in acts of intimidation of jurors or witnesses or acts of a treasonable or seditious character or is known generally to associate with persons concerned or suspected of being concerned in any such acts the judge shall forthwith order such person to be excluded from such court while it remains so cleared and thereupon such person shall be excluded from such court accordingly.</P>
    <P>(7)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to take away or derogate from any power or duty vested in or imposed on a judge by statute or otherwise to clear his court or to exclude any persons or person therefrom, and the powers and duties conferred or imposed by this section shall be in addition to and not in substitution for such first-mentioned powers and duties.</P>

To delete all after the word &ldquo;had&rdquo; in line 1 down to the end of the sub-section and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;the judge presiding at such trial may, on hearing such evidence as may be tendered before him that it is necessary for the protection of witness and jurors concerned in such trial that the public should be excluded from the court during such trial, order the court to be cleared.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment which I hope will meet with the approval of the House.  My object in moving it is this, that I think the judge ought to be in complete control of his own court, and the section as it stands tends to militarise the court.  I think the best thing I can do is to <Col N="1150" /> read the sub-section as it stands and then to read my amendment.  The sub-section states: &ldquo;Whenever, at the trial of an accused person in the Central Criminal Court or in the Circuit Court and after such accused person has pleaded &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo; or a plea of &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo; has been entered for him and before any further proceedings are had, an officer of the Gárda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent states on oath to the judge presiding at such trial that in the opinion of such officer it is necessary for the protection of the witnesses and jurors concerned in such trial that the public should be excluded from the court during such trial, the judge shall order the court to be cleared and shall not proceed with such trial until the court has been cleared in accordance with this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That takes the control of the court out of the hands of the judge and puts it into the hands of a police officer.  The police officer may be perfectly right in his judgment, and I have no doubt that in every case, if the police officer says to the judge, &ldquo;It is desirable, in my opinion, to clear the court,&rdquo; the judge will do so.  But you should leave the power in the hands of the judge.  If the police officer can say, &ldquo;I want this court cleared,&rdquo; and if there is no discretion left to the judge at all, you make the judge a sort of amanuensis of the police officer.  My amendment is intended to leave the authority in the hands of the judge, knowing that he will exercise it in exactly the same way as the police officer would exercise his discretion.  Sometimes the superintendent might not be there, but under my amendment if any police officer comes up and says it is necessary that the court shall be cleared, the judge has a discretion, and of course if a police officer says that to the judge the judge will exercise his discretion.  As the Minister has said, judges are supposed to be reasonable men.  They are the persons entrusted by you with public order, and any judge who was worthy of his position would, of <Col N="1151" /> course, have the most sensitive regard for public order and for the protection of the people.</P>
    <P>Another matter is also involved. It is in the public interest that the authority of the judge should be respected, not merely in essentials but in details.  That is the reason why there is so much parade about the courts; it is not for the sake of the judge but for the sake of the people&mdash;to give as much authority as you possibly can to the judge and to exalt his office for your own protection and for the protection of the people.  Therefore I think that my amendment is, from a constitutional point of view and from the point of view of the ultimate object to be attained, preferable to the Bill as it stands.  My only object in moving the amendment is to keep inviolate the position of the judge and the dignity of the tribunal, because if a police officer can order the judge about in an imperative way the dignity of your court is gone.  I do not put this forward in any party spirit at all.  I simply put it forward as a Senator addressing Senators on a matter which is peculiarly within my own knowledge, and I do say that my amendment is preferable to the section as it stands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>It is refreshing to hear the Senator so exercised in maintaining the authority and the dignity of the judge, but it is not proposed in the Bill that the police officer should usurp the authority of the judge.  If I might put it in another way, I would say that the dignity and the authority of the judge are greatly preserved by the fact that he is not to act as a detective, looking after the characters on the public benches in the court or looking after the characters of the charwomen. It is eminently necessary that somebody should be aware of the possible hostility of people trooping into the court to upset it. You cannot have a judge acquainted with police work, and in order to preserve the authority and the <Col N="1152" /> dignity of the court this business should naturally be relegated to the police.  You might as well ask the judge to fix the wages of the people who clean the court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>What I think Senator Comyn's amendment would lead to would be a trial in the court to start with, with all sorts of evidence being called.  For instance, suppose this officer sees a well-known criminal who he knows is there for the purpose of spotting who was on the jury, according to the Senator's amendment he has got to come forward, and instead of his statement being taken that in his opinion there is danger to the jury and to witnesses if the court is not cleared, he has to say: &ldquo;I know that such-and-such an individual is in the court, and he is a dangerous person to be present when this case is being tried.&rdquo;  I quite agree with Senator Gogarty that that would not be at all a dignified or a judicious thing to do.  It would certainly be far better that the superintendent, whose business it is to know, should state that in his opinion it is wise that the court should be cleared.  Surely the Bill as it stands is far better than to have a police officer giving evidence and giving the names of persons, to have the whole matter argued out in court when a number of persons in the court might be interested in it whose characters might be injured. It seems to me that far more damage would be done to the prestige of the court by accepting this amendment than by leaving the Bill as it is.</P>

Senator Johnson's amendment does not postulate a trial.  If it would satisfy scruples in the minds of some parties in this House I would be willing to have the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; inserted for &ldquo;shall&rdquo;; that is, the judge may order the court to be cleared on the mere statement of the superintendent of the Guards.  But I would have to be careful of the wording.  I do not think that the Senator's words would quite suit.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very important, if I may say so, because it is really to take the place of sub-sections (3) (4) and (5).  Therefore I think it would be reasonable to consider parts of the Bill now which may be disposed of before we consider them at all.  I think the House must see that as far as barristers are concerned the words &ldquo;barristers bona fide practising as such in Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; are allowed by the Bill to be present just as they would be allowed under the Senator's proposal.  But when we come <Col N="1157" /> to the Press, for which he is putting forward such a great claim, we do find in sub-section (5) very distinct differences, because the individual who is to give evidence is &ldquo;an officer of the Gárda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent,&rdquo; who &ldquo;produces to the judge presiding in such court one or more then recent issue or issues of a particular newspaper or document or documents appearing and purporting to be such issue or issues and the judge is of opinion that any articles or other matter contained in such issue or document or any of such issues or documents is calculated to intimidate jurors or witnesses either generally or in the particular trial then in progress,&rdquo; and so on, and he has to show that representatives of these organs should be barred.  Now, if we take the Senator's amendment we do away with the whole of the gist of that sub-section, and it would be quite foolish for the Seanad to accept this amendment and then try to proceed to pass sub-section (5) afterwards.</P>

      <P>It is as plain as a pikestaff that this is only another method of trying to defeat the purposes of this Bill.  While barristers and solicitors are definitely recognised members of a profession, pressmen are not.  A good many people take up journalism for the purpose of being able to enter certain places and sometimes to evade certain responsibilities.  The story is told that on one occasion Bernard Shaw attended a religious function, and when the collection box went round he simply said: &ldquo;Press.&rdquo;  In that way you could nearly get in and out of any situation.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Senator Dowdall, I move amendment 47:</P>
      <P>Section 7, sub-section (2).  To delete the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in line 10 and to substitute therefor the word &ldquo;may.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The sub-section provides that, when a court is being cleared under this section at the trial of an accused person, it shall be kept so cleared during such trial and until the verdict of the jury has been recorded or the jury have failed to agree and have been discharged.  Therefore, the sub-section makes it mandatory on the judge.  Once the court is cleared it has to be kept cleared for the whole day.  There may be one objectionable person in the court. The superintendent of the Guards may tell the judge that there is an objectionable person in the court. When he does that the judge must order the court to be cleared.  Therefore, what happens is that everyone in the court has to leave.  Even though that objectionable person may leave the precincts of the court or the town it is still imperative on the judge, under the sub-section as it stands, to keep the court closed. Judges and legal men generally have a tremendous objection to the closing of a court.  The object of the amendment is to leave a discretion to the judge to open the court whenever he likes.  I do not think there can be any serious objection to that.</P>

      <P>No.  At present the only cases that I know of in which the judge can clear the court are in certain cases of indecency. There are certain cases in which the judge may make an <i>ad <Col N="1160" /> misericordiam</i> appeal to people to leave the court when certain types of cases are being heard, but in such cases the judge has no power to order people to go out if they will not go.</P>

      <P>What occurs to me is that an individual who might be objectionable, and rightly so, to the superintendent of the Guards, might enter the court.  Then it would be incumbent on the superintendent of the Guards to make his application to have the court cleared, and the court must be cleared of all the public. Perhaps I should say it must be cleared of all the public if that individual has to be cleared out. Once it is cleared of all the public nobody may return, so that this machinery to exclude one person must be set in operation and the effect of it is to automatically exclude all the public.  I do not think that is the intention, and I think it is an unfortunate result.</P>

      <P>The court would only be cleared where the jury trying the case or the witnesses would be in danger by the court not being cleared.  That is the only case in which the Guard could state on oath it would be necessary that, for the protection of the jurymen and witnesses, the court should be <Col N="1161" /> cleared.  Probably the Guard knows some of the men, but he may not know all of them.  He may not know all the spotters, if I may use what is probably a slang expression, sent out to find out who the jurymen were.  Some of them may be known to the Guards and others may not.  If that type of man is there, there would be danger as regards the witnesses and juries.  Then the judge would give an order to clear the court.  He does that on the statement of the Guard when he considers that for the protection of the life and liberty of jurymen and witnesses that should be done.  Though the court is cleared, the journalists are in court to report the trial, which will be published to the public. There is nothing like secrecy about it.  The ordinary person does not go to the courts.  The people who do, speaking generally, are those with a morbid interest in crime.  The number of persons who go to court as serious students of criminality are extremely few.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 7, sub-section (3).  After the word &ldquo;court&rdquo; in line 20 to insert the words &ldquo;members of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the intention of not moving this amendment, but in view of the attitude on the last amendment I think I must.  The Minister has indicated that it is only a certain class of people with morbid tastes and interests who attend the court. That may be true in regard to normal crime, but not in regard to the kind of case in question, with a certain political significance.  People <Col N="1162" /> interested in State trials of this kind are not morbid people.  I think it is desirable that some representative of the public, somebody who is not interested in the case on one side or the other but as representing the public, should have access to the court in such cases.  We know how important it is that such a case should be tried and openly proceeded with.  The clearing of the court suggests secrecy of trial. While it is true that barristers may be present, it is presumed that they are there as barristers.  It is true also that representatives of the Press who are bona fide may be present, but there is no assurance that the public aspect of the case, what I might call the constitutional aspect of the case, is going to be recorded and noted by the Press.  It probably would, but there is no assurance of that.  My point is that there should be some gesture or indication that some representative of the public should be free to attend the court.  I have indicated members of the Oireachtas as being probably the most truly symbolic of the public, and this right or privilege of attending the court should be extended to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the public are concerned they are fully represented.  Barristers and members of the Press can attend the court.  I am afraid it is not clear that members of the Oireachtas can at all times be completely trusted.</P>
