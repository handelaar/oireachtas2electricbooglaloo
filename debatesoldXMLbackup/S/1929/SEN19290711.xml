      <P>I move amendment 1:</P>
      <P>Section 1.  To delete in line 21 the words and figures &ldquo;and Sunday, the 21st.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Second Reading of this Bill last night, in a small House, I indicated my objection to the inclusion of Sunday, 21st, in this Bill.  I had better perhaps repeat, more or less, what I said on that occasion. The Act which this Bill is intended to amend was the result of fairly <Col N="1312" /> prolonged discussion in both Houses. The sections dealing with the closing and opening of publichouses on Sundays in the four boroughs and in the other parts of the country were the subject of a good deal of discussion. The late Minister for Justice, who was in charge of the Bill, succeeded in persuading both Houses against accepting the proposition that the provision dealing with opening on Sundays, where crowds gathered, should apply to the four county boroughs.  As we all know, a Bill was passed by the Oireachtas a few weeks ago.  That Bill was applicable to the one day on which the Catholic Emancipation Centenary celebrations were being held. It was pointed out that many thousands of people were expected to gather in Dublin on that day, and it was thought necessary to make provision for the publichouses in the city to open at different hours to those provided in the Act.  That Bill was for one occasion only, so that food could be provided and so that even publichouses might be utilised for the provision of food and refreshments for the thousands expected to come to the city.  Similarly, on Sunday, 14th, celebrations of a similar religious character are to take place in Cork.  Many thousands of people are expected to be in Cork on that day from fairly early in the morning until late in the evening.  Consequently, it was thought important that the same provision regarding the relaxation of hours in the Act should apply to Cork as applied to Dublin.  I suppose there is no real objection to that, because of the special circumstances which will probably not happen more than once in a generation or once in a hundred years.</P>
    <P>But the proposal in this Bill is to include Sunday, the 21st, and to have a similar relaxation for that day because of the fact that there is a football match in connection with which many thousands of people are expected to visit Cork.  There will be numerous football matches, no doubt, in the four county boroughs during the summer.  It seems to me that the proposal to include Sunday, the 21st, <Col N="1313" /> in this Bill is very unwise.  If there is going to be provision for such occasions the case ought to be argued and the views of the Department of Justice should be properly understood. The inquiry which has been promised into the working of the 1927 Act should be pursued before we make the exceptions that are now asked for.  I am opposing the inclusion of Sunday, the 21st, and I ask the House to delete the words in the amendment.  I have the authority of the chief promoter of the Bill in the Dáil, to say that rather than face any opposition or any long controversy on this, he is prepared to accept that view, namely, the deletion of Sunday, the 21st, the hope being that the Bill can, and probably will, be accepted by the Dáil so as to become law and be effective for Sunday next.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great danger that, if this amendment is carried, the Bill will be lost and the Act will not be available to be put in force on Sunday next, which is the principal day affected, because, as we all know, it is proposed that the Dáil should terminate its business this evening.  If there is an amendment now inserted, it would have to be considered by the Dáil before the Bill could become law.  The Bill before us was passed unanimously by the Dáil.  It would be a very serious matter for us to take up the position that we would endanger the passage of a Bill that is required for Sunday next.  Senator Johnson referred to the relaxation of the hours for the opening of the public houses.  As I pointed out last night, there is no proposal in this Bill to increase the number of hours during which the public houses may open in Cork City on Sunday next.  What the Bill proposes is to merely change the hours, that instead of opening from two to five they can open from five to eight. The Bill in no way affects the cause of temperance.  On the ground that this amendment, if passed, might endanger the passage of the Bill, I oppose it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFanning" hpid="Mr. Fanning Mr. Fanning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fanning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to the amendment.  The demand that <Col N="1314" /> has been made for the change in the hours for opening in Cork City has not been made by the members of the licensed trade. The demand for the proposed change has come from the nation.  When the Licensing Bill of 1927 was going through the Oireachtas we pointed out the difficulties that would inevitably arise by depriving licensed traders in the four boroughs of the privilege accorded to licensed traders in other parts of the country. Despite the case that we put up, we were turned down.  The development that we pointed out at the time that would take place if the case that we then made was not acceded to has, in fact, taken place, and Parliament has been forced to recognise it, not, mind you, on the initiation of the licensed trade but of the nation.  I happened to be in Cashel on Sunday week.  The Minister for Justice and other Ministers were also there.  There were between thirty and forty thousand people in Cashel on that day.  The law, as it stands, enabled that huge concourse of people to be catered for and there was no necessity to come to Parliament to get special legislation passed.  That, I suggest, affords the best possible evidence that the four exempted cities have been very unfairly differentiated against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Johnson is quite agreeable that the Bill should go through if the change in the hours for opening is confined to Sunday the 14th.  I suggest that it is quite as reasonable to ask that the provisions of the Bill should also apply to Sunday the 21st, because, I would like to point out, special facilities are not being asked for in regard to the hours of opening.  The period for opening will be the same as it is at present, the only change being that instead of opening between 2 and 5, people can open their establishments between 5 and 8.  If there was a real genuine objection to the proposal to include Sunday, 21st, in the Bill, I would be prepared to fall in with that, inasmuch as the conditions resulting from the operation of the Licensing Act of 1927 are shortly to come up for review.  I <Col N="1315" /> think that I am correct in stating that a Commission will be soon sitting to deal with that whole subject, but I hold that there is an absolute necessity for applying the provisions of the Bill to Sunday the 21st, as well as to Sunday the 14th. If, for instance, the athletic youth of Ireland assemble in Thurles, Kilkenny, Athlone or in any other town outside the four exempted cities on any Sunday in the year their requirements can be catered for, and there is no need to have special legislation passed.  I have seen huge crowds of people in these places time after time, and there has been no need to have special legislation passed to meet such a situation.  It is most unfair, I think, that the four cities of Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Limerick should be differentiated against in the way that they have been.  We have pressed for a review of the whole situation and we have been promised that that review will take place soon.  If Senator Johnson and those with him have a serious objection to facilitating the athletic youth of Ireland in Cork on Sunday, 21st July, then let them take the responsibility for pressing their objection.  I do not want to deal with the matter further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask Senator Johnson not to press his amendment. There seems to be a disposition in the House to support Senator Linehan's motion.  It does seem unfair that Cork would not be put in the same position as a place, say, like Thurles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the principle involved in this, I entirely agree with Senator Johnson, and I think he is absolutely right.  If Senator Linehan or Senator Fanning can make a case for this, then they can only do so by reason of very unusual circumstances.  Senator Linehan made the point that if Senator Johnson's amendment was persisted in it might have the effect of holding up this Bill, and depriving Cork of the facilities which many of us in this House are prepared to <Col N="1316" /> give it on Sunday next.  If it were not for the fact that we might deprive the city of Cork from getting those facilities on Sunday next, I, for one, would certainly vote against the Bill altogether.  Senator Fanning's remarks had no relevancy good, bad or indifferent to the Bill before us.  They have a relevancy in respect of the whole system under which the sale of intoxicating liquor is carried on in the State.  If that question is to be raised, let it be raised at the proper time.  I do not want to give a silent vote on this matter.  I want to protest against the adoption of practices which have recently been creeping in.  We have had examples of those practices in other places.  It was only last week that, in a certain town in the Free State a superintendent of the Civic Guards made application to the District Justice to have the hours altered during which the public-houses in that town might open on a particular Sunday.  The application was based on the statement of the superintendent that there was to be a sports meeting held in that town on the Sunday.  I take it that we should legislate very definitely on this matter.  If these facilities are to be granted, then let it be decided definitely and finally that power will be given to a lesser body than the Oireachtas to make these changes when necessary.  If I vote for the passage of this Bill, I do so solely in order that facilities may be granted for Sunday next in Cork.</P>

      <P>I have been speaking to the Deputy who has charge of this Bill in the Dáil.  At my suggestion he has made representations, and I think, probably arrangements, for the Dáil to take this amendment this evening if the Seanad agrees to accept it.  That is the reason why this Bill has been taken out of its place on the Order Paper in the Seanad to-day.</P>

I think it is beneath the dignity of the Seanad to be discussing the question at all.  I think the proper place to discuss it is in the District Court or some place like that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 1:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3, sub-section (3).  To add at the end of the sub-section the words:&mdash;&ldquo;Provided that no fee for the grant of a totalisator <Col N="1319" /> licence shall be charged unless and until it has been approved by resolution of Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment which I have put down is really a constitutional amendment.  It is based upon the theory and principle that charges upon the public cannot be made by the State without the sanction of the Legislature.  The totalisator is to replace the bookmaker to some extent.  There has been established here a tax upon bets.  The totalisator will alter the machinery whereby that tax can be collected in so far as those bets are made through the totalisator.  In the ordinary course of operations, through a bookmaker, the bets would be subject to an Excise duty. The provision in Section 3 is that the Excise duty, or the equivalent of it which is to be levied on the person making the bet, will be collected by means of a fee charged against the licensed holder of the totalisator machine.  Therefore, the fee, whether it is a single payment or a series of periodical payments, is a charge upon the public.  It is a charge upon the bets that they make, and my concern is that the Legislature should not give the power to a Minister to fix the amount of the tax that is to be levied upon the public by means of the totalisator or by any other means.  It is to maintain the principle that the Legislature should have control over the fixation of taxes that I am seeking to have this amendment inserted.</P>
    <P>It is not the perfect way of doing it.  I quite recognise the proviso I am seeking to insert is not going to do what I wish in the manner I would like, but it is due to the fact that the totalisator is an entirely new machine in this country, and possibly inexperience would not allow a fee to be fixed in the Bill at this stage.  Whether that is so or not I am accepting that assumption. Leaving out the Seanad in this case, for the Dáil is the authority for finance&mdash;I am conceding that to the Minister&mdash;I am asking that the rate of charge that is to be levied to the public through the totalisator should <Col N="1320" /> not be fixed without the sanction of the Dáil.  That is merely on the grounds of the constitutional principle, and I think it is an important principle and that it ought to be maintained.  If there has been a lapse, as undoubtedly there was in the passing of the Betting Act through the Oireachtas in 1926, we, having discovered the fault, should seek to amend it.  Therefore, I am pressing this method of securing that the Dáil should have the ultimate control of the amount of fee to be charged to the public through the totalisator.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I second.  I do not think it requires much argument in support of it.  If there is any constitutional principle that is thoroughly established it is that the House which directly represents the people should have absolute control over finances, down to the last penny, and it is in obedience to that principle I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators are elevating something into a constitutional principle which is not a constitutional matter at all.  There are many cases in which it is left to the Minister to fix the fee that will be charged.  For instance, in the case of the Post Office the fee chargeable for the carriage of letters is fixed by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs by warrant.  So far as letters are concerned, the fee might be described as a tax, for the letter part of the Post Office service more than pays for itself.  This is a case where a privilege has been granted to individuals, and it is proposed to enable the Minister, after negotiation with individuals who will carry on the totalisator, to fix the charge which they will pay for the privilege of doing something that people are ordinarily forbidden to do.  I explained yesterday why it was impossible to fix it in the Bill.  I do not think it is necessary to have this matter go before the Dáil.  As a matter of fact, if this amendment were passed it would, I think, prevent the totalisator being set up in time to be operated when it ought to be operated, because the Dáil will <Col N="1321" /> rise to-day.  It will, perhaps, meet one day in the course of a week or so, and there will be no possibility of laying before the Dáil the proposals in regard to the fee.  There would be no possibility, therefore, of granting the totalisator licence until, say, the beginning of November. That is a practical and immediate argument against the amendment. So far as the amendment is concerned, there is really no constitutional principle involved and there is nothing new or unprecedented in the powers given in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have spoken so often and so strongly against legislation by the Minister, or by Departments, I would like to say a word as to why this amendment should not be passed.  It is in entirely different case from Section 6, where the Minister, under the Bill as it was when it came to the House, had the power, as I said yesterday, to create an offence which was punishable by the district court, and to fix the punishment. That is legislation of a definite kind.  This is not.  It is more in the nature of administration.  The Minister will have to negotiate with the people who are setting up the totalisator.  He cannot do that without knowing all the facts.  When he knows all the facts he will fix the fee.  That is not legislation but administration. I will vote against this amendment.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(3).  Every regulation made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and if either such House shall, within the next subsequent twenty-one days on which it has sat after such regulation is laid before it, pass a resolution annulling <Col N="1322" /> such regulation, such regulation shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Section 3, sub-section (6).  After the word &ldquo;bookmakers&rdquo; in line 6 to insert in brackets the words &ldquo;(provided always that they are not disqualified persons under any recognised Rules of Racing).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think every Senator, from the discussion we had last night, more or less understands the object of the insertion of these words.  I think any objection taken was because of a misunderstanding of what was intended. I think Senator Byrne suggested that the desire was to keep out the small bookmakers.  If Senators read the words carefully they will see there is no such suggestion. The small bookmakers are just as honest and do their business as well as the larger bookmakers.  The object is to keep out undesirable bookmakers and no one should be more in favour of that than the reputable bookmakers, because it is necessary to protect the public and to maintain authority of the racing executives. Senator Hooper said it was unusual to refer to the Rules of Racing.  It is, but the whole section is unusual. It is the first time it is made compulsory on racecourse executives to admit bookmakers to the racecourses. Having accepted that, we think it desirable that some protection should be extended to them and to the authorities of the Irish Turf Club and the National Hunt Club. It is for that reason I move the insertion of these words and I think they should be adopted.</P>

      <P>I second.  It is not necessary for me to speak in support of the amendment, the reasons seem so clear why it should be done.  If we discuss the question of cricket we must discuss cricket rules, and if we discuss racing the Turf Club rules must be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to call the attention of Senator Sir Walter <Col N="1323" /> Nugent to what I think is a defect in the place it is proposed the amendment should be inserted.  I understand the Senator's point to be that unless the amendment is inserted the Bill will oblige the owners of the racecourses to allow licensed bookmakers on their premises because of the insertion of the words &ldquo;Where licensed bookmakers may carry on their business.&rdquo; I take it that the emphasis on the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; seems to give the right to licensed bookmakers to appear on the premises, and that it is to protect the racecourse authorities from the possible intrusion of undesirable persons who may be bookmakers.  I call attention to the fact that the same phrase follows in regard to the public&mdash;&ldquo;to which the public may resort.&rdquo;  If there is any validity in the point raised with regard to bookmakers, it is equally valid respecting the public.  Therefore, I suggest for consideration that this amendment should be inserted after the word &ldquo;betting.&rdquo; That would cover the public and the bookmaker, and in all probability would give the racecourse executives power to refuse admission to undesirable members of the racing fraternity and the public.  I think there is a defect in the drafting, and perhaps that would safeguard the interests of the racecourse owners.</P>

      <P>The circumstances are quite different.  The licensed bookmaker will go and demand admission and a member of the ordinary public is disqualified. A licensed bookmaker comes with a copy of the Act and says he is entitled to go in even after he was disqualified, while the ordinary member of the public disqualified under racing rules cannot go in under any circumstances.  It only applies to bookmakers who are disqualified. The ordinary member of the public who is disqualified cannot get in because the chucker-out would throw him out.</P>

      <P>To my mind, the Bill does not interfere in any way with <Col N="1324" /> the authority the racecourse executives have already.  If the insertion of this amendment is necessary they still retain their power notwithstanding this Bill.  The fact that we give this right of admission to bookmakers does not alter the control of private property.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Foran that there is no need for the inclusion of this amendment at all, for it is already covered in the rules of the Turf Club, and they are the people controlling racing.  They can keep out undesirables.  I fear there may be in this amendment some new disqualification.  Under this Bill, for instance, non-payment of an exorbitant charge to get into a racecourse to carry on business may constitute a disqualification. You are giving this authority to a body on which there is no representative of the public or the bookmakers. I would like if Senator Sir Walter Nugent would define what is in his mind and the class of person who is to be kept out.  If it is a defaulter who refuses to pay his honourable debts to his friends I and every member of this House agree with him, and every decent bookmaker would also.  To leave this thing in is going to leave people unfriendly to the totalisator in the hands of a body who will say, &ldquo;We will charge you so much.&rdquo;  If you do not pay that exorbitant charge there may be a new disqualification. I would ask Senator Sir Walter Nugent to be clear as to the class of person to which his amendment applies.</P>

      <P>Before a person can be disqualified he has to be reported by his own organisation and he has to be publicly or privately tried.  He is given every chance of making a case.  A decision <Col N="1325" /> is only come to on matters of great importance, such as default and a man not paying admission fee.  I do not believe that people have been unfairly treated under the Rules of Racing.  If you are to have racing maintained in the horse-breeding industry you must have tests, and the only tests are on the racecourses. If on the racecourse, they should be properly governed.  I think that is in the interests of the Turf Club as well as the public.  I think the insertion of the words I propose would be as strongly supported by the bookmakers and the general public as by the Turf authorities.</P>

      <P>I am puzzled to know what are the recognised Rules of Racing.  Have they any statutory value or basis?  If they lack it the embodiment of this amendment in the Bill will give them a statutory basis.  If so, is it wise to do that? Before this is passed we ought at least to have some approximate idea of what will constitute the disqualification of a person.  What test will be applied, and who is going to apply it?  Who are the people who framed these recognised Rules of Racing?  Are they to be set up as a recognised court of law who may or may not deprive a certain section of the community of their means of livelihood?  It would be well to have some more definite information on that point before, in my judgment, this can be accepted as wise, and embodied in an Act.  I think it should not be difficult for the Senator to tell us what exactly is meant by a disqualified person.</P>

      <P>I think the position is quite clear.  Prior to the introduction of this Bill the stewards of the Turf Club had a right to refuse admission to defaulters or persons who were not fit and proper persons to be trading with the public on their property.  The result of the insertion of the amendment will be to make it mandatory on the stewards of the Turf Club to admit bookmakers.  I <Col N="1326" /> think that the stewards and Senator Sir Walter Nugent are equally entitled to say: &ldquo;If we are compelled to admit these people we want the power to refuse admission to defaulters.&rdquo; It would not be in the interests of the general public to allow defaulters into the enclosure.  It is the general public who would suffer if these people default.  I think we ought to accept this amendment without any further discussion.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Sir Walter Nugent's amendment ought to be accepted for the reasons stated so clearly by Senator Farren.  We have expressed ourselves in favour of the bookmakers in the course of discussions on this Bill, and we have got for them concessions which go even further than Senator Byrne stated.  The power of the owners of a racecourse to exclude any person they like was absolute up to the passing of this Bill.  Now we have got for the bookmakers the concession that they cannot be excluded; that is, we have curtailed the ordinary common law right of the owners of the course, and when we do that I think we ought to do it subject to such a limitation as will make it absolutely fair to the public also.  I support the amendment for the reasons stated by Senator Farren.</P>

    <P>This amendment would make £5 the maximum charge in place of Senator Byrne's amendment, which was five times the amount that could be charged to the public for admission to the race track.  If the amendment that Senator Byrne carried yesterday remains it will be altogether against the public interest.  There will be no inducement to the proprietors of a race track to lower the admission charges, because by lowering the admission charges, under that amendment, they would also lower the amount that they could charge the bookmakers.  The idea of the totalisator is to bring the public back to racing.  They cannot be brought back if the high charges remain, and if the public are brought back in large numbers there will be much more business for the bookmakers to do.  So that I hold that my amendment is in the real interests of the bookmaker as well as in the real interests of the public.</P>

      <P>I also oppose this amendment.  Senator Parkinson has been for a considerable time referring to the decline in racing and the falling off in the attendance at meetings. We are all well aware of that fact, and some of us would go the length of saying that to-day the attendance at race meetings is, possibly, not more than fifty per cent. of what it was in the old days.  Notwithstanding that, Senator Parkinson suggests that bookmakers here should pay an amount in excess of what bookmakers on the other side are paying, where things are more prosperous than they are with us.  On the whole, I think the amendment passed yesterday was fair and equitable.  If it erred at all I think it erred in being a little too hard on the bookmakers.  But if in England they are satisfied with five times the admission fee for a bookmaker surely that ought to be sufficient for this side of the water at present.</P>

      <P>I am not raising an objection to the objective of this amendment, but I do want to emphasise the point raised by Senator Johnson.  Is this amendment drafted so that it could be embodied, without further amendment, in the Bill?  For instance, &ldquo;the general totalisator fund&rdquo; is mentioned.  No such fund is mentioned in the Bill.  Therefore, it would seem to me that in order to know what that fund was it would certainly require a definition in the Bill, and without that it would seem to me impossible to fit the amendment into the scheme of the Bill. Then again, there is a reference to the grand stand and to the smaller stand.  I believe that there are racecourses where there are no stands at all.  I think we should not pass legislation which will require an amending Bill immediately afterwards, and I do believe that if this amendment were embodied, before the totalisator had been working very long it would be necessary to introduce an amending Bill to tighten up the loose <Col N="1329" /> drafting that, in my opinion, there is in this amendment.  I do not know whether there is any way of eliminating what seem to me to be defects, if they are defects, and still retain the amendment in some form.  If not, I think it would not be advisable to pass the amendment.</P>

      <P>I would ask the House to stand by its decision of yesterday. A recommendation for that is the fact that I am sure it was carefully considered by the Minister for Finance before he accepted it, and why Senator Parkinson should now make an effort to penalise bookmakers I cannot understand.  As Senator Moran has said, all horse-breeders and others associated with that industry have been complaining that within the last couple of years there has been a decline of 50 per cent. in the attendance at race meetings. If that is so, I suggest that it would be unfair to fix such an exorbitant charge on bookmakers who will have to carry on their business against the new and probably popular opposition of the totalisator.  I cannot understand why such an amendment is proposed.  The latter portion of it, which refers to the excess to go into the special fund for the encouragement of horse-breeding and the industry generally, is along the lines of an amendment that I had down yesterday and that is already covered in another amendment of Senator Parkinson's.  I would ask the House to reject this amendment and give the bookmakers a fair chance to work against the new competition.</P>

      <P>I do not believe that the bookmakers would suffer by having a maximum charge of £5 put upon them.  I do not wish to weary the House by going over the ground again as to the possibility of the refusal of the proprietary tracks to reduce the admission charges when they can charge the bookmaker five times the charge.  There are racecourses where it costs £2 to get into the reserved enclosure, so that they could charge the bookmaker £10 a day.  Then you leave the public out altogether.  The public <Col N="1330" /> have a poor chance under the Senator's amendment of getting any reduction in the existing charges.</P>

Every hearing by the Circuit Court of an appeal under Section 196 of the Income Tax Act, 1918, and every hearing by the High Court or the Supreme Court of a case stated under Section 149 of the said Act shall, if the person assessed or proposed to be assessed to tax so desires, be held <i>in camera.</i>&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a recommendation which I have tabled for the reasons that I stated yesterday.  I do not intend to repeat what I said yesterday. The Minister was evidently personally favourable to the proposition which I put forward, and I think the only doubt he had was whether it might in any way interfere with the administration of justice, the proper reporting of legal decisions, or anything of that kind.  I can assure the Minister that it would not.  The official reporter will not be excluded if the case is heard in camera, and the reporter who reports every tax case will also have the privilege of being there.  Any point of law would be reported, but reported in such a way that the identity of the persons whose interests were involved would not be disclosed.  I quite agree that the Minister should have an opportunity of consulting those in authority who might take a view opposite to mine, although I am fairly confident that they will not.  Therefore, I suggest that this should stand over until next week, and in the meantime the Minister could consult them.  I myself will perhaps take the opportunity of having a word with the Attorney-General on it, and <Col N="1334" /> if there is any objection, of course I will not press the recommendation. But it is important.  I understand that if it is to go into a Finance Bill it should go into this one. I understand that there are two or three cases pending in which this arises in rather an acute way.</P>

It occurs to me that there will be a great likelihood, if you have appeals heard by one Commissioner, of a large number of appeals being taken to the Circuit Court which is not desirable.  The taxpayer who might quite conceivably be satisfied with a decision given by two Commissioners might not be satisfied with a decision given by one, and in consequence might appeal.</P>

      <P>It is not thought that it will have that effect at all.  I stated the reasons for this change in the Dáil.  We have so far had two Special Commissioners hearing appeals here because that was the law in England, but in England the decision of the Special Commissioners is final.  Here there is an appeal from the Special Commissioners to the Circuit Judge, so that the reason for having two which exists in England does not exist here.  Having two is a decided disadvantage with the whole country as one circuit, and in fact, the appeal circuit has to be begun too soon; it has to be begun before the inspectors of taxes have <Col N="1335" /> been able to carry on the correspondence with the taxpayers that might avoid the hearing of appeals altogether. Furthermore, it is not possible to finish the circuit in time, because at one circuit the cases are so many that the duplicates actually cannot be got out of the collectors in time.  Then there is the other point, that if one of the Commissioners falls ill, at the present time we have simply to appoint a dummy in his place, a person with perhaps no experience, simply to go around with the other Commissioner and sit there but take no part in the proceedings. If we have power to have one Special Commissioner to hear appeals an illness would upset only part of the country, and perhaps for only a month or so, and even if there was a permanent illness the position would not be any worse than it is at the present time.  This does not really prejudice the taxpayer, because there is the right of appeal.  We have cases from which there is no appeal heard and decided by one Judge.  I can see no objection to this at all, and I do not believe that the number of appeals to the Circuit Court will be increased.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New Section.  Before Section 10 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;10.  Any person deriving profits from trade shall have the right to be assessed for the years 1930-31 and 1931-32 on the average profits of the previous three years if the profits of the preceding year would result in an assessment higher by more than twenty per cent. than that based on the profits of the average of the preceding three years.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I take it that the Minister intends to go into this matter and that he will consider the possibility of making an announcement in regard to his attitude towards it. Otherwise, if we wait until the Finance Bill is introduced next year the effect would be, in regard to a considerable number of accounts which are made up on 31st December that auditors would not know what the exact situation was in making their reports to shareholders. If the Minister could not see his way to make an announcement as to what are the intentions of the Government in the matter now, I would urge him to consider it between this and next week.</P>

A question could be asked and the whole matter could be dealt with&mdash;both the point that was raised by Senator Douglas yesterday in regard to the carrying-over of losses which occurred in a year other than the year immediately preceding the change, and also the question of increase in assessments beyond what would take place if the three years' average prevailed.

      <P>I would point out to the Minister the difficulty that will arise owing to the non-liquidity of a business.  A business might show quite a large profit in the preceding year, but that might not be realised.  It would have to find a large amount of liquid cash and it might experience great difficulty in doing so, whereas, if it had time to prepare and to make provision gradually, it would be able to do so. That is a matter I would ask the Minister to consider.</P>

      <P>I would like some explanation as to the necessity for the change that is made in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The necessity is simply this: that up to some time last autumn it was thought that solicitors who were on the register before the change of Government were, as a result of the provisions in the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, entitled to practise in Northern Ireland and in the Free State.  It was thought until last autumn that the one stamping of the certificate sufficed, but as a result of a query which was raised a question was submitted to the Attorney-General, and it was found that it was necessary when a solicitor had his certificate stamped in Northern Ireland that he should have it stamped also here, and conversely, that a solicitor who had his certificate stamped here should have it restamped if he proposed <Col N="1340" /> to practise in Northern Ireland. What is intended in the Bill is really to restore the position to what it was thought to be before this legal opinion was obtained last autumn.  The matter is not of any consequence to the Exchequer. There are only £300 or £400 involved, and we do not think it is desirable, by means of a legal opinion, as it were, to impose what is in fact a new tax.  The arrangement, of course, will be reciprocal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there an arrangement about reciprocity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">

      <P>Certainly.  It does not operate unless it is reciprocal.</P>

      <P>The meaning of the words &ldquo;present or future&rdquo; taxation do not seem clear to me in this section.  The section says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Debentures, debenture stock and certificates of charge issued by The Agricultural Credit Corporation, Limited, shall not be liable to any taxation present or future so long as it is shown in manner to be prescribed by the Minister for Finance that they are in the beneficial ownership of persons who are neither domiciled nor ordinarily resident in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether it is usual, or a precedent, to put in words like that which have the appearance of trying to bind the legislature.  After all, the section would not be weakened if &ldquo;present or future&rdquo; were deleted.  I do not understand the meaning of the words, but perhaps the Minister would explain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is simply a statutory promise.  There is no doubt that a future Parliament could impose taxation.  It is quite a common thing.  For instance, in connection with the two issues of National Loan, we promised that they would not be subject to present or future taxation.  If we imposed taxation it would be a breach of faith with the people who took up National Loan.  This is a proposal <Col N="1341" /> to place people who took up this stock in the same position as those who took up National Loan.  The promises I made in the prospectus of the National Loan were afterwards ratified by a section of the Finance Bill, and this is really putting this stock in the same position.  It means that they get a statutory promise.</P>

    <P>The following amendment stood in the name of Senator Douglas:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Section 5.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) Whenever a jury finds a person to be guilty of a crime for which the penalty provided by law is death, the judge shall inquire of the foreman of the jury whether the verdict is or is not unanimous, and if the foreman states that such verdict is not unanimous the judge shall not sentence such person to death but shall sentence such person to penal servitude for life.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the Minister that he is prepared to accept an amendment similar but not identical in words to that in the name of Senator Johnson.  That being the case I do not propose to move my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 5.  To add at the end of the section the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided that in the case of a trial of a person on a charge for which the penalty of death is prescribed, if the jury has found a verdict of guilty the foreman of the jury shall notify to the Judge, in writing, the number of dissentients, if any, and the Judge shall forward to the Minister the information thus obtained.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like if it were possible to have inserted in the section a provision such as that of Senator Douglas, but in trying to frame an <Col N="1342" /> amendment on those terms, I felt that it was not within my competence to do so, and therefore I fell back upon a second line, on the assumption that Senator Douglas would be introducing an amendment which might not carry.  I have had an intimation from the Minister that he is prepared to accept an amendment somewhat on the lines I have put down.  I will read the draft suggested as an alternative:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Section 5.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) Whenever a jury finds a person to be guilty of a crime for which the penalty provided by law is death, the Judge shall inquire privately of the foreman of the jury whether the verdict was or was not unanimous and in the latter case the number of the dissentients, and shall report to the Minister for Justice the information so obtained.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no guarantee in the Bill, of course, that a minority verdict would prevent the sentence of death being carried out, but we had the views of the Minister that, in such a case it would be probable, under the present jurisdiction, at any rate, that the sentence of death would not be carried out.  That is the procedure set forth in the amendment and this procedure would, at least, allow the Minister to obtain the information upon which he could come to a final decision as to whether a reprieve should or should not be granted.  If no amendment of the kind is inserted the section would prevent even the Minister from knowing whether the verdict was by a majority or not.  At least to that extent the amendment is an improvement on the Bill as it stands.  With the permission of the House I move this amendment first and will then go back on the consequential one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to that I think there is only one word that is objectionable and that is the word &ldquo;privately.&rdquo;  People who are accustomed to courts of justice know this, that the great thing to be desired is that whatever is done should be done <Col N="1343" /> in public.  In the Scotch system which I have looked into during the last three or four days what happens is this: When a verdict is found if the jury are unanimous the chancellor, that is, the foreman of the jury, so states to the Judge and if the verdict is not unanimous the foreman of the jury states that it is not unanimous and gives the numbers of the dissentients.  That system is absolutely right because it is fair and above board.  That is the great thing to be desired in all legal proceedings, and particularly in criminal proceedings.  I think that the word &ldquo;privately&rdquo; would expose the Judge and everybody concerned to a great degree of suspicion, and if Senator Johnson will withdraw that word from the amendment I think it would be an improvement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>In withdrawing my amendment in favour of the one which Senator Johnson has moved, and which I gather the Minister is prepared to accept, I did not mean that Senator Johnson should try to persuade me that mine was not better, or that I suggested I was convinced of that.  But from the discussion here I was quite satisfied that I could not carry my amendment, and I believed there was a general consensus of opinion in favour of the amendment moved by Senator Johnson.  With regard to what Senator Comyn has said, if we were dealing with a purely normal situation probably we would not have this Bill, and if we were considering a general change to nine instead of twelve, or to some majority as a permanency, I think I would agree with what he has said.  But in endeavouring to draft the amendment which I put down I took it that Senator Johnson was in exactly the same position.  It was a question of endeavouring to fit in with the scheme of the Bill, wisely or unwisely, his proviso.  My object was to get accepted the principle that there is a fundamental difference in a case where the law provides capital punishment and which cannot be put right again where an <Col N="1344" /> error occurs.  For that reason I hope the House will accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister would, in his suggested draft, object to deleting the word &ldquo;privately&rdquo; and inserting the words &ldquo;in writing.&rdquo;&ldquo;Privately&rdquo; is rather a vague and undesirable term to insert in a statute of this kind.  I think the responsibility should be placed on the foreman of the jury to convey, privately of course, but not in the way indicated in the draft amendment.  Let him convey in writing to the Judge the number of dissentients in a case where there is not a unanimous verdict.  Otherwise he might have to call to the Judge's private house and whisper to him what the result was, or by some other subterfuge to convey the result to him.  Of course he could do that in writing, and normally I take it that would be the intention. I think that might be said in the amendment.  I do not think it would disimprove it or weaken it.</P>

      <P>(2) Whenever a jury finds a person to be guilty of a crime for which the penalty provided by law is death, the Judge shall inquire of the foreman of the jury and the foreman of the jury shall notify to the Judge privately in writing whether the verdict was or was not unanimous and the number of dissentients (if any) and the Judge shall report to the Minister for Justice the information so obtained.</P>
      <P>Amendment, as amended, agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 5, as amended, stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash; put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 8, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;often&rdquo; in line 1 to insert in brackets the words &ldquo;(but not more than twice in respect of any one trial).&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was debated at considerable length previously.  If the section as it stands becomes law it will leave it open for &ldquo;a Judge presiding in the Central Criminal Court or a Judge of the Circuit Court sitting for the trial of criminal issues is satisfied that, by reason of intimidation or attempted intimidation of jurors or witnesses either in relation to the trial of criminal issues generally or of any class of criminal <Col N="1347" /> issues or in relation to the trial of a particular person or the intimidation or attempted intimidation of particular jurors or witnesses it is not desirable that the trial or trials of one or more accused persons awaiting trial before him should be had at the sittings of the Central Criminal Court or the Circuit Court (as the case may be) then in progress, such Judge may adjourn the trial or trials of such accused person or persons until the next following sittings of such Court or, in the case of the Circuit Court, to the next following sittings of such Court for the trial of criminal issues.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I consider this is extreme, and I so stated on the Second Reading.  I take it that the Minister intended this section to act as a deterrent to intimidatory practices by misguided persons, if I might put it so.  Perhaps he might have achieved his object by the section as it stood, but I think it went a little too far, and I hope he will agree with me.</P>
    <P>If power is given to the judge to postpone, or to adjourn, a trial of an accused person because intimidation has been indulged in, then I take it that, if this section is to be effective, he must in practically all cases use his power in that respect, and postpone the trial.  If he does not use his power in that respect the practice, if I may so put it, will fall into disuse, and the real object of the section will not be attained, because those who might indulge in these practices would not ordinarily be got. As Senator Johnson said on the last occasion, this section might lead to abuses in the case of a person arrested and indicted on a criminal charge.  The enemies of such a person might indulge in intimidatory practices and attempt to intimidate jurors or witnesses for the purpose of keeping an accused person in prison.  The section might lead to such abuses or such malpractices as that.  On the other hand, you might have the case of a person who might be imprisoned and who, by reason of the action of certain persons with whom he is not directly concerned at <Col N="1348" /> the time, might be detained in prison for a considerable, or even for an indefinite period of time.</P>
    <P>I think that a purpose such as that is not intended by the section and should not be so intended.  I think I can see the point of view of the Minister, that this section is to act as a deterrent.  The idea, apparently, is that it should act as a deterrent to people outside from carrying on processes of intimidation.  I think that the Minister's object would be attained if the judge were given power to postpone the trial on two occasions to the following sitting of the court.  I submit to the Minister and to the House that his object would be served if he were prepared to accept the amendment.  On the other hand, I think that the object which I and other Senators have endeavoured to attain would also be secured by the adoption of the amendment, and that no injustice would be done to an accused person if the period during which he might be detained were limited to the length of two sittings of the court.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment, and I hope that the Minister will accept it.  The duration of the Bill is limited, roughly, to a period of two years.  Two adjournments, from one session to another, will in effect cover practically the greater part of that period. That being the case the Minister will really not be altering the principle of the Bill very much by accepting the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is with the principle of the Bill, more than anything else, that we are concerned.  The idea of unlimited adjournments and of an unlimited period in prison because of the activities outside of persons over whom an accused person has no control is a terrible prospect to look forward to.  It is one that we should not approve of even in a temporary measure.  Senator O'Hanlon has stated the case very fully.  He has shown how an accused person may suffer an extended period of imprisonment <Col N="1349" /> because of the acts of people outside over whom the accused has no control.  On the Committee Stage of the Bill, I said that the section seemed to me to be unnecessary and useless.  If there are people to-day who attempt to intimidate witnesses or jurors, the probability is that they will be there in six months or in twelve months' time.  It is probable that they will not have changed their views, and if in the meantime they do not indulge in acts of intimidation, the desire to do so will be with them, so that by a mere adjournment of the case you do not remove the intimidators.  The acceptance of this amendment would make the Bill a better one from the point of view of equity and justice, and I hope that it will be accepted by the Minister and the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>They sit four times in the year.  This would mean six months' adjournment at the longest.  I would like to point out to the House that there is always a discretion left to the judge to adjourn as often as he considers the ends of justice demand.  That is how the section stands.  There is nothing automatic in it.  There is nothing in it that would compel the judge to adjourn.  The judge would simply adjourn if he considered that it was necessary to do so for the administration of justice.  I think that is a circumstance which should be kept carefully before the minds of the Seanad.  As there seems to be a generally expressed opinion in the Seanad in favour of this amendment, I will not oppose it.</P>

      <P>On the Committee Stage, the Minister made the point, in opposition to the original motion, that it sought to substitute August because of the period of the session.  An attempt is made here to fix the 30th day of September instead of the end of the year.  The sole purpose of the amendment, as I have said before, is to secure as nearly as possible that if this is to be re-enacted for a period it shall be done by a special measure brought before the House and not be inserted among a long list of Acts which are annually continued.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have thought that over very carefully and I do not think there is any substance in the Senator's objection on the ground he has put forward, that is, that there is a danger that this Bill might be renewed under the Expiring Laws (Continuation) Act.  If it were included in the Expiring Laws (Continuation) Act, it could be as much opposed in its passage as if it were a separate measure.  If you look to the Expiring Laws (Continuation) Act and the classes of Acts contained in it, you do not see one of this nature.  For instance, in this very session two Bills were introduced.  I introduced one myself, the Civic Guards (Acquisition of Premises) Bill, which was not in the Expiring Laws (Continuation) Act.  It does not seem to me important, but if the Senator is very keen about the matter I will put it off, if he likes, to <Col N="1351" /> the 25th March, 1932.  Good Friday will fall on that date in that particular year and the courts will not be sitting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. It may be remembered the reason why the suggestion was made that the date should not be the 31st of December was that we wanted to emphasise the fact that this was a special kind of legislation which the Seanad was not eager to pass, but which I think every member of the Seanad voted for.  Those who did vote for it did so with some degree of reluctance and regretted the necessity which they thought existed for it, but which we think did not exist.  I think the Minister was rather humorous when he suggested an extension of the time. That is increasing the drop instead of shortening it.  I think the Minister ought to accept the amendment suggested by Senator Johnson, and if he does not the House ought to vote for the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared carried.</P>
      <P>Report Stage concluded.  Fifth Stage ordered for Wednesday next.</P>

I would like to have the opinion of Senators as to whether the Seanad should sit on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday and dispose of the business before it, or whether we should sit in the ordinary way on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.  That may mean that we would have to come back in the week following.</P>
