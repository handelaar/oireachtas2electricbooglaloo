      <P>A number of amendments have been received to this Bill.  In my opinion these amendments are amendments of substance within the terms of Standing Order 94 of the Standing Orders relative to Private Business.  The amendments, therefore, will be referred under the Standing Orders to the Joint Committee that formerly considered this Bill for consideration on Report.  The Bill will, therefore, be referred back to the Joint Committee for consideration of these amendments.</P>

      <P>On this motion, we are in the same position to-day with regard to this Bill as we were on the last occasion.  I see on the Order Paper for the Dáil that the Bill which is consequent upon this Bill is still under consideration before the Dáil.  It is probable that it will be considered by the Dáil to-day. I, therefore, move that the further consideration of this Bill be postponed for three weeks so that the Seanad may have the Seanad By-election Bill before it proceeds with a discussion on the Final Stage of Constitution (Amendment No. 11) Bill.</P>

      <P>I have not any great feeling about the Senator's motion, but the position is that I did not catch what he said&mdash;it is hard to hear here&mdash;when stating his reasons for putting off the final consideration of this Bill for three weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Senator said was that the Bill which implements the method for filling vacancies in the Seanad is now being considered by the Dáil and that we are in the same position with regard to it as we were on the last day when the Fifth Stage of the Constitution (Amendment No. 11) Bill was before the House.  The position, the Senator pointed out, would be this: <Col N="976" /> that if we passed the Bill now before us, and if a vacancy occurred in the Seanad, we would have no means of filling that vacancy until the Seanad By-Election Bill now before the Dáil had been passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that was the position the last time this Bill was adjourned.  It was just after the death had occurred of Mrs. Stopford Green.  The announcement of her death was made to the Seanad on that day.  A vacancy had, therefore, arisen in the Seanad, and if we passed the Final Stage of this Bill on that day the election to fill the vacancy created by her death would have to be under the new law.  The position was that there was no electoral Act in operation at that time, although the law as to the constituency would have been altered by the passing of the Final Stage of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>And the position would really be the same if a vacancy in the Seanad were to occur to-morrow.  The position to-day is identical with what it was on the last occasion that this Bill was before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WalterNugentBart" hpid="Sir Walter Nugent Sir Walter Nugent">
      <NameTxt>Sir Walter Nugent</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any reason why we should not go on with this Bill to-day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been pointed out that should we go on with this Bill to-day and pass the Final Stage of it, and should a vacancy arise in the Seanad to-morrow, we would be without the machinery for filling that vacancy, for the reason that the Bill before the Dáil, already referred to, has not yet reached this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>One reason why I oppose this motion is that we should have had notice that a motion to adjourn the consideration of this Bill was to be moved.  To spring a motion like this upon the Seanad without notice gives Senators no opportunity of considering whether or not there are sufficient reasons for supporting the motion moved by Senator Johnson.  I do not anticipate, <Col N="977" /> and I do not think that there are any grounds for anticipating, that an impasse is likely to arise in connection with the Bill at present before the Dáil&mdash;a Bill the object of which is to provide machinery for the filling of vacancies.  I do not think it is fair to this Assembly to have a motion of this kind sprung on us without notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion that I moved was quite formally spoken to, because I thought it was the fixed opinion of the Seanad, as decided twice before, that in a matter of this kind there should be in existence machinery for the filling of vacancies.  If Constitution (Amendment No. 11) Bill passes out of the hands of the Seanad and it immediately becomes law, there will then be no machinery for the filling of vacancies in the Seanad until a new Act of Parliament is passed.  There is a Bill dealing with the subject of the filling of vacancies before the Dáil at the present time.  We do not know in what form that Bill will reach the Seanad, nor do we know what changes the Seanad may make in it.  Neither do we know how long it will take to pass.  In those circumstances, if we pass this Bill at the moment, the Dáil and the Seanad will be in the position that there will be no means at law for filling any vacancy that may occur.  It seems to me that it is an incongruous position for the Seanad to place itself in, and that it is quite undersirable from many points of view.  That is on the matter of machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the constitutional position, it is surely undesirable that the Seanad should bind itself to any course of action altering the constitution of its body until it knows what is going to replace it, or until it has some idea of what is going to fill the gap.  That is why I think the present situation should be kept in hand until we know what the position will be.  Probably the next step which will be available for us will be as soon as the Bill, altering the method of election for the <Col N="978" /> Seanad, comes from the Dáil.  That Bill is on the Order Paper for the Dáil to-day.  The Bill may be in the Seanad next week, but of that I know nothing.  But, clearly, it seems to me that the present machinery should not be scrapped until we know what is going to take its place.  By passing the Fifth Stage of this Bill to-day we, in effect, scrap the machinery for reconstituting the Seanad, that is, for the filling of vacancies which may at any time occur between now and the setting up of new legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHooper" hpid="Mr. Hooper Mr. Hooper">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hooper</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out that the position to-day in respect to this Bill is exactly the same as the position that existed before this Bill was first held up two or three months ago.  It was then pointed out that if we passed the Final Stage of this Bill before the amending Bill came forward from the Dáil that we would be without any machinery to fill any vacancy that might arise in the Seanad.  Since that was done, three vacancies have arisen in the Seanad. If objection were not taken three months ago to the passing of the Final Stage of this Bill, and if the Bill had been passed at that time, we would be to-day three short in our membership.  To-day we are in no better position than we were in then.  If this Bill is finally passed to-day we may have a further number of vacancies occurring in the Seanad before the Seanad By-Election Bill comes before it, and we would still be without the power to fill those vacancies.  In the circumstances, I do not think that we ought to depart now from the attitude towards this Bill that we took up before.  As to the point that has been made that the motion to adjourn the consideration of this Bill has been brought forward without notice, might I say that the motion is brought forward to-day under exactly the same circumstances as those which existed on a previous occasion.  No notice of motion was given then, and as far as I understand, no notice to move such a motion is required under our Standing Orders.</P>

      <P>In my judgment there seems to be a misunderstanding.  Senator Jameson is mistaken when he says that the other Bill cannot be proceeded with in the Dáil until this Bill is passed in the Seanad.  I am quite sure he is mistaken in that view.  It is quite competent for the Dáil to pass the Bill now before it, whatever we do with this Bill in the Seanad.  In fact, as was said in the Seanad some time ago, there would be nothing unconstitutional in including in this Bill provisions as to the machinery for an election.  In case this Bill is passed, the two Bills could have been included in the same measure.</P>

      <P>The position with regard to this Bill is that there have been about seventy-five amendments handed in.  A number of them were handed in about 4.55 on Tuesday evening, and an additional number yesterday morning.  I think Senators will see it was physically impossible to have a corrected proof in the hands of Senators for consideration to-day.  I consulted with the Minister and he agreed to the adjournment of the Committee Stage of the Bill until next Wednesday.  I suggest to the House that the Committee Stage be adjourned until that day.</P>

    <Col N="981" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move that the report of the Special Committee re Poor Law Relief do lie on the Table and be printed.  Perhaps I may be allowed, in the special circumstances, to enlarge upon that formal motion.  The Committee has met on three occasions and has had the advantage of having three interviews with the Commissioners for the Dublin Union, and has arrived at certain definite recommendations. The report, which will be circulated, will contain the following:&mdash;The powers of the Commissioners acting for the Guardians of the Poor in the Poor Law Unions of Dublin City and County have not been altered by recent legislation.  The classes of persons to whom outdoor relief may be granted are set out in Section 1 of the Poor Relief (Ireland) Act, 1847, viz.:&mdash;(a) persons permanently disabled by old age and infirmity; (b) persons temporarily incapacitated by illness or accident; (c) widows with two or more legitimate children.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the same Act provides for the relief of other classes in the event of no accommodation being available in the workhouse.  Section 13 of the Local Government Act, 1898, provides for the relief of able-bodied persons outside the workhouse in the event of exceptional distress. The statutory limitations upon Boards of Guardians affecting the grant of outdoor relief to able-bodied persons, to widows with less than two legitimate children, etc., which, in places where a county scheme is in operation, were removed by Section 10 of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, are still effective in the County Borough of Dublin and the County of Dublin where no county schemes as defined by the Act have yet been formulated and adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee understands that negotiations have been opened with the object of securing the adoption of a scheme jointly by the Council of County Dublin and the Commissioners <Col N="982" /> for the County Borough of Dublin.  The Committee, however, is of opinion that the needs of the case require that the powers of the Guardians for the Dublin Unions should be enlarged without delay, and, therefore, recommend to the Senate that legislation should be passed without delay, providing that: pending the adoption of a county scheme the Guardians of the Poor for the Dublin Unions shall have and exercise all the powers and duties for granting outdoor relief which they would have and exercise under Section 10 of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923 (No. 9 of 1923) if a county scheme had been adopted and was in operation.</P>
    <P>I should explain we are convinced that the Commissioners of the Dublin Union have been doing more than the law allows in respect to the granting of outdoor relief.  We are convinced also it is necessary that acts of the kind which they have permitted themselves to do should be clearly made legal.  The members of the Committee have agreed if this report is accepted to submit to the House an effective one clause Bill to grant these extended powers to the Commissioners of Dublin City and the Guardians of the county.  The purpose of the Bill would be to place the Guardians of the poor in the county and city of Dublin in exactly the same position, so far as outdoor relief is concerned, as the rest of the country.  It is desirable that the Bill should be enacted at an early date.  We hope there will be no difficulty in passing it into law.</P>
