      <P>On behalf of Senator Jameson I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 2.  To delete all after the word &ldquo;of&rdquo; in line 9 down to the end of the section and to substitute therefor the words, &ldquo;the archæological interest attaching thereto or of its association with any Irish historical event or person has a value substantially greater than its intrinsic (including artistic) value, and the said expression includes ancient human and animal remains and does not include treasure trove in which the rights of the State have not been waived.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy to say that the amendment to this section is now an agreed amendment.  The House will remember that there was a good deal of controversy, and a certain amount of difficulty, about the definition of an &ldquo;archæological object&rdquo; which was originally in the Bill, because it included the quality of antiquity as practically decisive of an object being an archæological object.  I am happy to say that the definition which will be found in the amendment has been agreed upon.  It excluded from &ldquo;archæological object&rdquo; anything like a piece of Waterford glass, or a piece of old Irish silver, which has merely got an increased <Col N="480" /> value owing to its artistic quality and other interests of that kind.  The definition will now read as follows:</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;archæological object&rdquo; means any chattel whether in a manufactured or partly manufactured or an unmanufactured state which by reason of the archæological interest attaching thereto or of its association with any Irish historical event or person has a value substantially greater than its intrinsic (including artistic) value, and the said expression includes ancient human and animal remains and does not include treasure trove in which the rights of the State have not been waived.</P>
    <P>That seems to be a perfectly satisfactory definition.  It will include all articles of real archæological interest and of historic value.</P>

      <P>The following amendment stood on the Order Paper in the name of Senator Miss Browne:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New Section.  Before Section 24 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Any person who injures, alters (otherwise than in accordance with a licence issued by the Minister for Education under this section), destroys or attempts to destroy any archæological object shall be guilty of an offence under this Act and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a penalty not exceeding fifty pounds or to imprisonment for any period not exceeding six months or to both such fine and imprisonment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(1)  It shall not be lawful for any person to injure, deface or destroy any archæological object, nor shall it be lawful for any person to alter any archæological object otherwise than under and in accordance with a licence in that behalf granted under this section.</P>

      <P>The necessity for this amendment is that sometimes archæological objects are found, or people may have them in their possession, and they may be altered and thereby great loss or damage may be done to them.  For instance, if a person possesses a gold torque he could, if this provision were not in the Bill, have it melted down.  Such a case occurred where a man who possessed a gold torque had it melted down and made into bracelets. In order to prevent that it is well to have this extra protection for archæological objects.  If gold is found it comes under the law of treasure trove.  There are other small archæological objects which could be altered, so that I think the amendment is necessary.</P>

Under the clause it would be impossible to get that work done.  I take it if a case of the sort arose that the Minister for Education would grant a licence for the purpose.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Senator Jameson, I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 24, sub-section (2).  To add at the end of the sub-section the words: &ldquo;When an application for any such licence is made to the Minister he shall consult with the Keeper of Irish Antiquities in the National Museum as to whether or not such object is suitable and required for Museum purposes.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 24, sub-section (2).  To add after the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  When any such licence is refused by the Minister he shall acquire for Museum purposes any object which is the subject of such application for such licence at a price to be determined by an arbitrator to be appointed by the High Court.</P>
      <P>Section 24, sub-section (3).  To delete all after the word &ldquo;pounds&rdquo; in line 4 down to the end of the sub-section.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these amendments are met by the new definition of &ldquo;archæological object.&rdquo;  I do not know whether <Col N="483" /> the Senator was desirous of moving them, but, in his absence, I thought it better to do so.  Section 24 is the one which prevents the export of archæological objects, and Senator Jameson's objection, and all our objections to it, was that it might prevent the export of a number of things that were not archæological objects at all.  The first amendment was absolutely necessary as long as the definition of &ldquo;archæological object&rdquo; was as it stood in the Bill. It is not so necessary now, and I think it is a question for the House and perhaps for the Parliamentary Secretary to say whether the amendment is any longer necessary.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 7, sub-section (2).  To insert before the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  No building grant or improving grant shall be made under this Act to any person</P>
      <P>(a)  who is in receipt of either a salary or pension (other than an old age pension or disability allowance) from the State or any public body or from the British Government exceeding £25 per annum;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="484" /> (b)  the poor law valuation of whose holding exceeds £10.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the Committee Stage yesterday I had an amendment down involving three clauses which were discussed at considerable length.  On the suggestion of some members of the House it was left over until to-day for the purpose of having it considered again.  As Senators will notice, the amendment has been altered.  Clause (a) has been altered and clause (b), as it stood yesterday, is eliminated, so that what was clause (c) now becomes clause (b). There is not much need to add anything to what I said previously, except perhaps to explain the change in clause (a).  The main purpose of that clause is to prevent pensioners benefiting under the building or improving grants in preference to people who need them more, and the pension has got to be over £25 per annum before they are debarred. The mention of the British Government might perhaps require some explanation.  The only reason for that is that ex-Army pensioners from the Great War would not be covered under the clause relating to salary or pension from the State, or from a public body, and it is simply to bring such pensioners into the same category as pensioners in Ireland, or who derive a pension from the Saorstát or any public body within the Saorstát.  The clause which appeared on yesterday's paper limiting the giving of a building grant or an improving grant to those who had an income of over £52 per annum, I found it necessary to withdraw, not because I do not believe that the principle is right, but because I realise, as the House realised yesterday, that certain serious hardships might be inflicted upon those with very moderate incomes.  I found it impossible in the time to get a formula which would adequately cover what I had in mind, and I have been forced accordingly to withhold it from this amendment.  I might mention that the difficulty has been largely caused owing to the fact that the Report Stage is taken within twenty-four hours or less of the <Col N="485" /> Committee Stage, and that does not, in my judgment, give an opportunity to secure what we want in a clause of this nature.  At all events, I found it impossible to get such a clause as I would like to see embodied in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Clause (b) of the amendment remains as it was yesterday&mdash;&ldquo;the poor law valuation of whose holding exceeds £10.&rdquo;  That is self-explanatory. Of course we have had assurances from the Minister that he and his officials will look after the interpretation of the Bill and that all will be well.  I submit that that is not as it should be, that after all we are supposed to be perfecting legislation in such a form that it will be framed, as far as possible, so that no Minister or no administrative official can interpret the laws of the Saorstát as he wants.  It is for that reason and in order to protect the public that we are here.  I suggest that these two clauses would improve the Bill considerably from the point of view that I argued yesterday, namely that those who are in most need of the facilities, or the help that the Bill aims to give, will be protected, and that those who are pensioners, or who may have incomes, and who are not really in such bad need of the help of the Bill will be prevented from getting it until the other people are dealt with.  That is the spirit behind the proposal in the amendment, and I submit it to the House for its favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second the amendment and to urge, as far as I can, its absolute necessity.  The Minister said last night that his object was to help the man who can help himself&mdash;the <i>fear saidhbhir</i> The object is to help the <i>fear bocht.</i> I think the philosophy underlying what the Minister said has this imperfection, that the well-to-do man ought not to be assisted out of State funds at the expense of the poor man who cannot help himself, unless, at the same time, you do something to help the poor man.  The Minister also stated last night that in some observations I made I did not seem to understand how this Bill would <Col N="486" /> work out.  Coming as I do from the Gaeltacht, and with a little experience, both in the economy of the Gaeltacht and of the building of houses of the description which is here contemplated, I am quite satisfied that the people who get the grant to build these houses will, out of the money, be able to have something for themselves, and that you will have the very poor man&mdash;that is the man who is not able to give even his own time for nothing in the building of his own house&mdash;coming forward and making application for the £80 grant and the £80 loan.  If he gets the loan and the grant, in the circumstances of the Gaeltacht he will be able to build a house of the description contemplated, and yet have something to represent wages for himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am perfectly satisfied from the attitude of the Minister towards the Bill that his object is to do what is best for the Gaeltacht, and to make the Bill a success.  This amendment will help him to make the Bill a success.  Four or five times in the course of discussions yesterday, when amendments were proposed, the Minister said: &ldquo;Well, I have a discretion.  I will do that, but do not put it in the Bill, because I am going to do it.&rdquo;  The more discretion the Minister seeks for himself the more difficult it will be for him to meet the big problems of the Gaeltacht. Another Minister yesterday when it was suggested that discretionary powers should be given him, met it by asking the Seanad not to give him discretionary power, that is, not to expose him to pressure.  In many parts of this Bill discretion is given to the Minister.  In each one of these cases that discretion will be availed against him for the purpose of exercising pressure upon him.  Of course, he will probably resist that pressure, but it will take a lot of the work out of him.  Here we come with this amendment.  It is clean and neat, if I might say so.  It comes down to the point.  The Minister has in his Schedule a wide area, about six or seven hundred district electoral divisions, over <Col N="487" /> which that £250,000 is to be scattered with a very light hand, because it will not go far.  It is like a man who has a cwt. of corn to sow an acre.  The Minister has a great number of townlands.  The very extent of the area which he is supposed to cover is one thing that will put the greatest possible burden on his discretion, and he will have the greatest possible difficulty in working it, having regard to the very wide area he has to cover.  It comes to this: We say that no person except a person with the old age pension or some small pension of less than £25, is to be eligible for a grant for housing in the Gaeltacht. The meaning of that is perfectly plain.  It is to save the Minister from the tremendous pressure which is likely to be exercised upon him. He and his Department are approaching this question with, as I think, a clear vision, but pressure will be brought upon his Department by influential people, pressure which he will scarcely be able to resist, or if he does resist it, which will leave himself and his Department absolutely worthless for the real work.  That is all I say.  We say it quite distinctly, and that is what we mean by it.</P>
    <P>The other part of the amendment which suggests that the grant should be confined to people with valuations less than £10 is of the same character.  A man whose valuation exceeds £10 could come under the social clauses of the Bills to which Senator Johnson referred, Bills intended to improve the social condition of the people, or that they can repair their own houses.  But when you have a small sum of money like £250,000, with £400 for each district electoral division which elected a district councillor in the old days, let him limit it down even to 80 electoral divisions as we suggested yesterday. That would leave about £3,000 for each district electoral division. That is a very small sum considering the cost of houses, and considering that the grant will be £80 and the loan £80 or less.  As it is so <Col N="488" /> small every care should be taken to reserve it for the people who are really in need of grants, which must be contributed by the very poor in the city of Dublin and in the country. It should be confined to the very poor, and therefore I hope the House will support the amendment, which has been framed by Senator Connolly and modified to suit the sense of the House as expressed yesterday. I hope, therefore, that the amendment will be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. Lynch) Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. Lynch)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to emphasise again that the intention underlying this Bill is not to give wages to any person for the building of his own house.  The Senator has reiterated that to-day, although I think I emphasised it sufficiently yesterday.  The idea underlying the Bill is that a man is to build his own house, and in doing that he is to be helped by the Government by getting an £80 grant and a possible £80 loan.  We did not at all conceive the idea that such a man would utilise portion of that grant or loan for the purpose of paying wages for his own labour; in fact we have practically prevented that by providing that the house for which he will get this £80 grant will be a certain standard house for which the materials that he will have to buy will cost him £130 and the work of his handyman will cost him £50.  We are securing, if you like, that he will not be paid for the building of his own house. He will be getting a grant and a loan from the Government for building it, and I think it would be entirely unreasonable to expect that he should be paid for his work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Connolly has stressed the question of the discretion of the Minister, and has said that the Minister wants discretion for this, that, and the other thing.  I am not looking for discretion for myself, but surely the administration must have some discretion.  Whether I am here to-day and away to-morrow does not matter.  I want to have it in the Bill, whether I am Minister or whether one of the Senator's colleagues, in the very remote possibility of that <Col N="489" /> party ever coming to administer the affairs of the country, will be administering this Bill, and I am perfectly satisfied that a great deal of discretion must be allowed at least to the administration.  As far as the amendment itself is concerned it is just the same as we had yesterday. with clause (b), referring to the household income, cut out.  As I said yesterday, if I thought the amendment was necessary I would not receive it in any hostile manner, because I think we should secure that the purpose for which the Bill was brought in is carried out, and I pointed out yesterday that in many of its clauses that is already secured. I pointed out that under clause 3 it was necessary that the house should be wholly insanitary.  I pointed out the over-riding matters in clause 11, such as sub-section (3), which provides for a wholly Irish-speaking household, and I differentiated as between the Irish-speaking households, and again as far as the valuation amongst the Irish-speaking households was concerned.</P>
    <P>If I wanted to get into the small points of the amendment I might ask, for instance, what is a disability allowance?  You might say that everybody knows in general terms what a disability allowance is, but what does it mean in a statute? Where are you going to draw the line?  Even there you would be giving a further discretion to the Minister, because he would have to decide what was or what was not a disability allowance.  There are several types of people who might come under it, for instance, an employee of a local authority who had got hurt and who had been granted some compensation, small or large. This provision would not meet, for instance, the case cited by, I think, Senator Connolly yesterday, that even though the applicant himself was not in receipt of any salary or pension exceeding £25, he might have one or more members of his family in receipt of such salary or pension.  If we were to exclude an applicant who is himself excluded but who has perhaps two members of his family in receipt of either pensions <Col N="490" /> or salaries, these two might live away from him for a couple of weeks, and when he had qualified for the grant they might come back.</P>
    <P>But there was one thing which, from the point of view of my Department, might not be so much apparent to Senators, but which has occurred rather strongly to me, and that is this: We are endeavouring, in connection with this Bill and with other Gaeltacht matters, to get little industries going in the Gaeltacht. For instance, we hope that from some of these houses we may eventually get one of the little girls to be trained to work in charge of a knitting machine, or something like that, work that might enable her to earn £1 or 25s. a week.  Our aim is to get down to the very poorest, to pick out and train a little girl and enable her earnings to go into the house.  Our idea was that that would enable the father to apply for a grant and a loan, and that the money she would earn would enable him to repay the loan.  This amendment would cut entirely across our idea, because if one of these girls was earning £1 or 25s. a week in such a rural industry, that would exclude her family from benefiting under the Bill.  I do not believe that that is the Senator's intention, and I am sure that he would not wish such a thing, but in fact that would be the result of it.  That is the type of problem that, even if you were putting clauses into the Bill for ever, you could never really deal with, and you must depend on the administration for equity in these cases.  A provision of this kind would undoubtedly add to the cost of administration, because very many inquiries would have to be instituted from different angles. Inquiries would have to be addressed to every salary or pension-paying authority to find out whether or not such and such a person was in receipt of any salary or pension.  It might look very easy, but in fact very strict inquiries would have to be made.  These inquiries would involve a delay, and therefore there would be a delay in putting up the houses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="491" /> With regard to the question of valuation, I believe that, normally, no person with a valuation of £10 or over will come under the Bill.  I am perfectly certain that any Minister who comes after me will be as anxious as I am or as any Senators are, that the Bill is applied to the persons for whom it was conceived &mdash;the worst houses and the very poorest persons.  But if you draw the line at £10, why not draw it at £8, £7, £6, or £5?  I do not like drawing a line of that kind, because I have known cases in the Gaeltacht of holdings that I always believe to be very much over-valued, persons with valuations of £10 or £11 who had stretches of mountains for which they were valued, and I am perfectly certain that no Senator would give a £5 note for the whole thing.</P>
    <P>You have isolated cases, and if you draw any line, no matter where, you may exclude persons that you would like to help.  No matter how many lines you draw, no matter how you may attempt by legislation to keep any Minister in a straight line, some discretion must eventually be allowed.  The inspector who will go around will be an ordinary civil servant who may be serving another administration to-morrow.  His inclination will be to do his work in the fairest way possible, interpreting the Bill in the spirit in which it was conceived.  It will be his duty to see that nobody benefits under the Bill who was not entitled to benefit under the Bill.  That discretion will remain, no matter how much you curtail it.  Some discretion will have to remain, and it is a question of the wider or the narrower discretion. and to draw the line in a matter of this kind is next to an impossibility. Even if we could agree on any line, I believe it would be wrong to draw such a line as this amendment intends to draw.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not feel that the Minister has met our case at all. He said that the discretion that he enjoys may, in the very remote future, be enjoyed by some of my <Col N="492" /> colleagues in the party to which I belong.  That may be so.  I would like to assure him that I am not at all interested in that issue at the moment.  When we are dealing with legislation, I would like to feel that we are dealing with it on its merits.  The Minister's case is a complete argument for the reduction of legislation to the very simplest terms whereby the Minister involved will have. in the main, sole discretion as to what is to be done.  We admit that no matter how fool-proof we try to make legislation, in the last analysis the administration must have a discretion in certain directions.  I think that the numerous clauses in the Bills that are presented to us indicate clearly that it is the intention of the Oireachtas to limit the discretionary powers of Ministers to the minimum.  Otherwise why should it go to such pains to explain in such detail the various precautions that are afforded to the people of the State against a Minister and his officials? That, after all, is what legislation means to me, and I think that that will be generally accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the first idea which is covered by clause 3 deals with insanitary houses. and he seemed to claim that because a house is insanitary that will eliminate the necessity for the clause which I have suggested embodying in the Bill.  Some of the most insanitary houses that I have seen in the country have not indicated poverty at all.  I cannot speak of the Gaeltacht, but I think in most of the rest of the country some of the dirty gombeen public houses are amongst the least sanitary houses in the State, and I suggest that insanitary conditions do not necessarily denote poverty; very often indeed they denote gombeenism and the meanest type of miser, so that I think that argument goes by the board at once.  The Minister went to great pains to labour the income clause and told us what he hopes to do for the young girls.  That is a pretty worthy object for the Minister to have in mind, and I sincerely hope that he will be successful in it <Col N="493" /> in all parts of the Gaeltacht.  I believe that that is one of the things that can be done, and I speak from some experience.  But I want to warn him that it will take time and money to get these people trained. Leaving that aside, what I want to point out is that the Minister was out of order in referring to the income clause at all, because it does not appear on the paper.  I think the point with regard to the cost of making inquiries was a perfectly futile and childish one to put up.  I do not suppose for a moment that the Department will undertake to grant a loan, whether for rebuilding or building on the new, without adequate inquiry, but the additional inquiry involved will not mean that it will have to circularise every public board in the country to find out if the individual concerned has a pension or has any grant from them.  An inspector of ordinary intelligence would find that out.  It would mean in effect that he would have two additional lines on his inquiry form, if there is an inquiry form, and on one of these lines would be stated whether or not the individual applying for the grant had any such pension or disability grant from any public body or from the State.</P>

      <P>There is no case at all in the Minister's statement that special inquiries would have to be made all over the country.  That is perfectly ridiculous.  What we want to do is to prevent what we do know exists and what has existed, and that is the local pull&mdash;I am not suggesting that it is a political pull, either in the sense of local politics or Dublin politics&mdash;but I do know that these things are very often worked, and what we want to do is to try to make this Bill so that it will reach people that it is honestly intended to reach.  I do not for the moment care what Minister is in power; I would like to feel that, irrespective of who was in power, whether they were friends of mine or enemies of mine, at least they were trying to have honest administration. I believe that in these two proposals you hold some control over the civil servants, the local politicians and all the others, and I believe that they are both essential for the protection of the poor people who will not have any pull, whether that pull is in the hands of the gombeen man, the publican, the local politician, or anybody else, and it is for that purpose alone that I put up these proposals.  I suggest that they are necessary, and I ask you to consider them in that light.  We cannot afford to leave any more discretion with the Minister than we can help. That is what legislation is for, and it is in that spirit that I ask the Seanad to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 8, sub-section (2).  To add at the end of the sub-section the words &ldquo;but not exceeding five pounds per cent.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment has been put down mainly for the purpose of finding out, if possible, what is in the mind of the Minister in regard to the possible obligation that will be placed upon the recipient of the loan.  I put down five per cent., but that is an arbitrary figure.  I do not know whether it is possible to put down a maximum of that kind in the present state of things or not, but I think it is necessary that there should be an explanation to guide the House and to guide the applicants, even at this stage, but certainly to guide the House as to what is contemplated as a likely charge for the loan.  I would not anticipate, for instance, that these loans would be granted for this class of house over a period of, let us say, more than twenty years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">

      <P>Thirty-five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says thirty-five years.  That surprises me, because it has been difficult to get advances made for houses built in the ordinary way of contract over a period of that extent, and I am very glad to learn that it is contemplated that the houses that will be built by this method are likely to be good security for a period of thirty-five years.  Even at thirty-five years I do not know whether the Minister could go a little further and tell us whether five per cent., six per cent., seven per cent. or eight per cent., including repayment, is in mind.  I anticipate that the charge upon the borrower will involve what will amount to a weekly repayment of anything from 2/6 to 3/6.  The point I am making is that we are going to have a state of things whereby the very poorest portion of the community, having in fact built their own houses, will be in a worse position comparatively than the agricultural labourers in respect to the repayment of rentals.  The man who builds his own house, having provided the material and skill, will probably be paying double as much as an agricultural labourer occupying a house under the Labourers Acts.  I know it is not possible to get over the present situation regarding the cost of money, but I think it is desirable that we should understand as clearly as possible what is before us under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the last amendment I was glad to hear the Minister make a revelation as to what is in his mind regarding the facilities or opportunities he hopes to create to enable people to repay these loans, because, bear in mind, it is contemplated that before a person will have one of these houses he must borrow £80 as well as provide £20 of his own money.  I am speaking now of the standard houses.  As the Minister has pointed out, that will involve a considerable charge for a period of 35 years.  Alongside that it now appears there is the intention to develop the economic side for the purpose of enabling the applicants for loans or grants to repay the moneys advanced.  I should like if the Minister had revealed to the Seanad something of his policy with regard to the Gaeltacht as a whole.  This housing problem is so intermixed with the general economic and social policy in regard to that part of the country, and to the people in those districts that it would have been pleasing to have heard the Minister say something with regard to his <Col N="497" /> general policy.  The little of his policy that we have got from him helps to explain to me, at least, what his hopes and intentions are. I would point out that the Minister has in mind that comparatively few people will be able to receive these £80 loans.  Speaking in the Dáil, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>When I said that the granting of loans would be regarded more as an emergency measure than the normal procedure, what I had in mind was that we were loth to saddle people in the Gaeltacht with perhaps a repayment burden which they could not pay rather than that we had any idea of trying to cut them off from any of the facilities under the Act.  It is notorious, of course, that at the moment they find it difficult enough to meet the obligations they have to meet half-yearly or yearly, as the case may be, in the way of rates, land commission annuities and so on.  The placing of any further burden on them by way of loan may not be to their advantage.</P>
    <P>and so on.  I am anxious to have it made clear that under the scheme, generous as it may appear to be, the applicants will not be able to build houses of the kind indicated without having that loan or an equal amount from some other source.  If they can find an equal amount from some other source. a good deal of the case in favour of the Bill passes.  But, having got the loan, it is going to impose upon the recipient a liability of perhaps 3s. a week for quite a long number of years.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will give us a little more enlightenment on the point about the cost of material.  In the estimate of his house, costing £275, he puts down £130, which is practically half. as the value of the material which has to be bought.  I was under the impression from earlier statements that he anticipated that much of the primary materials such as stone, sand, etc., would not have to be bought at all, that they would be obtainable close at hand by <Col N="498" /> the labour of the applicant and his friends and would not be paid for in money at all.  If that were to be the case, possibly the cost of material should not be as high as one-half of the total value of the house.  That. however, is a detail.  I think we would have been better pleased if we had a fuller picture given us by the Minister of what he hopes to secure by this scheme, and what part it plays in the general scheme that he has for the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>I gather from what Senator Johnson has said that he does not feel that his amendment could be agreed to.  In his amendment he takes an arbitrary figure with regard to the rate of interest that may be charged on loans.  Might I point out that the rate of interest charged on loans granted under this Bill must be governed by the rate at which the Government itself can borrow?  If I tell Senator Johnson that I can almost guarantee that loans will be granted to borrowers at a rate of interest no greater than the rate at which the Government itself can borrow, his case, will, perhaps, be met.  I do not believe for a moment that any borrower will be charged 7 per cent.  Making a rough guess, I should say the rate would be 5¾ per cent. or 6 per cent.  I do not want to be held to any particular figure, for apart from anything else I have not the power to agree to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator said he would like to have had a statement from me with regard to my policy for the Gaeltacht as a whole.  I did endeavour to make a statement of that kind in the Dáil, a statement outlining, in connection with this particular housing scheme, the kind of policy I had in mind.  But in that statement I was only dealing with my policy in regard to the Gaeltacht so far as it affects this Bill in the way of providing that the persons who might benefit under the Bill, or who at the present time might not be able to avail of the benefits under the Bill might, through the action of the Department, <Col N="499" /> be put in a position to take advantage of this loan scheme. When I started to give details of a scheme of that kind in the Dáil I was ruled out of order, and the reason I did not touch on the matter here was that I might also be ruled out of order.  Of course, the matter is not quite relevant to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnson is afraid that the loans to be granted under the Bill are only to be, as he said, for the comparatively few.  The statement that I made in the Dáil, to which the Senator has referred, is I think perfectly clear.  In that connection I would like to reiterate this, that I hope the whole of the money to be provided for loans will be revised, just as I hope that the money available for grants will be.  There is no question of restricting these loans to the comparatively few.  I have no intention of giving loans and having them regarded as grants.  When money is given as a loan it must be repaid.  If we want to do otherwise, let us make the whole of the £250,000 a grant.  There is a provision in the Bill for giving loans, and when these are given they must be repaid.  As far as restricting these loans to the comparatively few concerned, I have given the indication to which the Senator has referred, that we hope to provide, by certain little industries, in one way or another for persons to whom at a given moment you could not give loans.  We hope to be able, by some little industry, or perhaps under the sections dealing with poultry and pigs in the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I must ask the Minister to confine himself to the amendment before the House.  The amendment deals specifically with the rate of interest to be charged on loans.  Senator Johnson dealt with some matters that, strictly speaking, were outside the scope of his amendment, but I ask the Minister not to follow the Senator's example.  The amendment deals specifically with the rate of interest to be charged on loans, whether it is to be 5 per cent. or not.</P>

      <P>I must apologise for departing from relevancy, but I was simply commenting on the points made by Senator Johnson.  To return to the question dealt with in the amendment, it would be impossible for me to say what rate of interest should be charged.  As I have stated already, that must always depend on the rate at which the Government can borrow.  If the Government had to borrow at 6 per cent. it would be unreasonable to lay down that the rate on loans under this Bill should be 5 per cent.  At any rate, I could meet the Senator in this way, that I can almost guarantee him that no borrower will be charged a higher rate of interest than the rate at which the Government itself borrows.  That is about all one can say on the matter.</P>

      <P>At this stage I desire to refer to certain criticisms which were passed by Senator Connolly with regard to the short period allowed between the Committee and Report Stages of Bills that have come before us for the preparation of amendments.  I think the criticisms made by the Senator were absolutely just.  I have always endeavoured to see that ample time was afforded between the Committee and Report Stages of a Bill for the preparation of amendments.  My <Col N="501" /> predecessor frequently made complaints, and I have made complaints myself, in regard to the manner in which Bills are rushed upon us at the end of a session.  These criticisms were made yesterday by Senator Connolly, and I left it to the House to decide whether or not they would take the Report Stage of this Bill to-day.  As the House decided to take the Report Stage of the Bill to-day, no option in the matter was left to me, but I desire to say that I shall always endeavour to see that a reasonable time elapses between the taking of the various stages of Bills. I hope that a situation such as has occurred at this meeting of the House will not happen again in the future.</P>

But the Schedule only contains one Clooney. I drew attention to this fact before and thought the Minister would have seen right to declare, by means of an amendment, which Clooney and which Kilmurry he wanted inserted in the Bill.

    <Title>Poor Relief (Dublin) Bill, 1929&mdash;Third Stage.</Title>
    <P>The Seanad went into Committee.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 1 (2).</P>
    <P>The board of guardians of a union to which this Act applies may, at their discretion, relieve out of the workhouse of the union, any destitute poor person who could not heretofore under the provisions of the Poor Relief (Ireland) Acts, 1838 to 1914, have been relieved by them otherwise than in such workhouse, if such person at the time when he is so relieved has been resident for a continuous period of not less than two years either in the County of Dublin or in the County Borough of Dublin or in the said county and county borough.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 1:</P>
      <P>Section 1, sub-section (2).  To add at the end of the sub-section the following words:&mdash;&ldquo;the expression &lsquo;person eligible for relief&rsquo; means any person who is unable by his own industry or other lawful means to provide for himself and his dependents the necessaries of life or medical or surgical treatment.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Second Reading Stage of the Bill I raised the question of the <Col N="505" /> effect of the reference in the Bill to &ldquo;destitute poor.&rdquo;  The Minister promised to look into that matter and to inform the House whether the effect of these words would be such as to make it possible to refuse relief to any applicant on the grounds that he was not destitute as distinct from being in a state of poverty.  If the Minister gives me an assurance that the insertion of these words &ldquo;destitute poor person&rdquo; is not going to be detrimental and is not going to be effective in preventing the giving of relief, I do not propose moving the two amendments in my name, notwithstanding my detestation of the phrase &ldquo;destitute poor person.&rdquo;  If the Minister cannot give me any assurance on that point, then I shall try to persuade the House that the amendment is desirable.  Perhaps it would be in order for the Minister to state his view on that now.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies I should be glad if he would state whether there is any intention to take into consideration the income that is coming into a particular house, because surely that is relevant and should be considered. There may be a destitute poor person in a house but there may be other people in that house earning.  In view of the alarming burden that this measure is going to impose, I think that we should have regard to the practical consideration and not treat the individual members of a household as a separate unit.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure Senator Sir John Keane that all the circumstances of a particular case are taken into consideration, and that there is no system of dividing up the household into individual persons for the purpose of considering whether they should be entitled to poor relief or not.  As far as the parent is concerned, the income coming into the house through his family is considered just as any other kind of income, and, as the Senator has said, the matter is dealt with in a practical <Col N="506" /> way.  With regard to the point raised by Senator Johnson, I have gone carefully into the matter.  The terms of the enactments dealing with the granting of relief, the judicial decisions that have been taken on the matter, and the actual practice do not bear out the fears the Senator entertains that destitution meant that every stick of furniture in a house, or anything like that, would have to be sold before relief could be afforded.  I have already explained, with regard to the Bill, that it is bringing the position as regards able-bodied destitute persons in the city and county of Dublin into the same position as persons of the same class in the rest of the country are brought under the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act of 1923. The Temporary Provision Act of 1923 may be said, as regards the description of persons entitled to relief, to have done away with the foundations that existed under the Poor Relief Acts from 1838 down.  As regards Dublin, we have grafted our legislation on to the Poor Relief Acts from 1838 down in order to deal in a practical way with the able-bodied persons in the way in which they are dealt with in the rest of the country under the Temporary Provisions Act of 1923.  The Senator suggests that certain other words should be used to describe the type of person entitled to relief under these Acts.  So far as the terms of the enactments and the Acts of 1838 and 1847 bear on the matter, I want to draw the attention of the Seanad to this, that the descriptions used in these earlier Acts are the basis of the extended relief that is going to be given here to able-bodied persons.  Section 41 of the Act of 1838 describes the type of person entitled to get relief in the workhouse.  That section reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For relieving and setting to work therein, in the first place, such destitute poor persons as by reason of old age, infirmity or defect may be unable to support themselves and destitute children, and ... in the next place such other persons as the said guardians shall deem to be destitute poor and unable to support themselves <Col N="507" /> by their own industry, or by other lawful means.</P>
    <P>So that the words the Senator would desire in the Bill as descriptive of persons entitled to relief are used in the Act of 1838.  The interpretation of what is meant by destitute poor is again in the Act of 1847, which extended the system of poor relief and enabled guardians to give outdoor relief to certain classes of persons. The very same words were used.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but really as an interpretation of destitution. Section 1 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the guardians of the poor of every Union in Ireland shall make provision for the due relief of all such destitute poor persons as are permanently disabled from labour by reason of old age, infirmity or bodily or mental defect, and of such destitute poor persons as being disabled from labour by reason of severe sickness or serious accident, are thereby deprived of the means of earning a subsistence for themselves and their families, whom they are liable by law to maintain, and of destitute poor widows having two or more legitimate children dependent upon them; and it shall be lawful for the said guardians to relieve such poor persons, being destitute as aforesaid, either in the workhouse or out of the workhouse, as to them shall appear fitting and expedient in each individual case; and the said guardians shall take order for relieving and setting to work in the workhouse of the Union, at all times when there shall be sufficient room in the workhouse of the Union to enable them so to do, such other persons as the said guardians shall deem to be destitute poor and unable to support themselves by their own industry or by other lawful means.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of a widow with less than two children.  In this Bill we want them included in the scheme <Col N="508" /> for the relief of the poor.  The late Chairman of the Seanad in a decision he gave when on the bench bears out in a judicial way the arguments I put forward here.  It is common knowledge that those persons who are being relieved at present outside the workhouse in the city and county of Dublin by reason of being infirm and disabled are not destitute in the terms in which the Senator fears they might require to be destitute under this particular Act.  Although they have in their households certain bits of furniture or other belongings, and they are relieved outside the workhouse, this Bill gives power to give them the same type of relief in the same general circumstances of poverty as to the persons who are able-bodied, so that I submit no purpose would be served in the Bill, even if it were desired to change the wording for the purpose of describing persons entitled to relief, to leave out the word &ldquo;destitute.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not entirely reassured by the Minister's statement, for I know from my own reading that a large amount of the evidence given at various commissions in respect of poor law has been in favour of restricting relief under the law, believing that it was the law to relieve persons who were destitute as distinct from other people to whom relief should not be given who might be poor but were not destitute.  I know from general experience that the relieving officers in different parts of this country, as well as in England. Scotland and Wales have to satisfy themselves that a person has to be in a state of destitution to be entitled to relief, and that mere poverty and want is not sufficient. However, I shall not press the amendment at this stage, but I wish to express the hope that when the Minister is dealing on permanent lines with the question of poor law he will alter the definition in the Act of 1838 and the Act of 1847 in such a way as to delete the reference to destitution.  The definition in the amendment is taken from a definition which is in the schemes <Col N="509" /> affecting the counties, which in its turn has been taken from the 1847 Act, and the schemes do not refer to the destitute poor.  I urge the Minister to defer to this point of view when dealing in a more permanent fashion with poor law.</P>

      <P>As I understand it this Act terminates in 1931, and in order to be eligible for relief people must be resident two years in the city.  In addition to the people who are here already two years, there will be a whole year for people to trek in from the country to enjoy the benefits of the Act, and there is no means of preventing them from coming in from the country for that purpose.  On the contrary, there is an invitation to people to come into the city and be destitute here instead of remaining destitute in the districts where they are at present, or doing what is more natural, seeking agricultural employment in their own districts.  Twelve months are open to people in the surrounding districts of Dublin to come here and enjoy this poor law relief.  I think the necessity for this relief has to some extent arisen from the policy of the Government in not demolishing slums that have been vacated by people who have gone into the new houses built in the city and district &mdash;in Fairview, Crumlin and other places.</P>

      <P>Surely this is a matter in which there should be some limitation.  As long as slum houses remain undemolished there is an invitation <Col N="510" /> for people to come in and reside in them, and that will increase unemployment and the necessity for poor law relief.  Trouble has been taken to provide houses to replace the slums, yet the slum areas are overcrowded.</P>

      <P>May I ask what will be the effect if amendments are carried here to-day?  Would it not mean that the needy people in Dublin who are waiting for the passing of the Bill will for a couple of weeks be deprived of the relief they are expecting? I ask the House to remember that when they are considering accepting amendments.  I am aware that at the moment the authorities have ready the machinery for granting relief within twenty-four hours. Many of us who would like to support amendments will not do so, for that would mean delaying the granting of relief.  I hope the Seanad will not adopt any of the amendments.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 2.  To add at the end of the section the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided that no person eligible for relief shall be relieved in any institution provided and maintained by a board of guardians of a Union to which this Act applies unless he can be relieved effectively in such institution at less cost than in any other lawful way.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is taken from the schemes which are operating in the rest of the country.  I do not know whether it is necessary to press it at this stage.  I do not desire to hold up the Bill, but I would like it to be provided in the Dublin scheme as in the rest of the country that a person shall not be forced to go into an institution.  Such a provision as the amendment suggests would ensure that unless a person can be relieved more effectively and at less cost inside than outside an institution, he shall not be sent in to the institution. I cannot say what has been the practice in the last year or two by the Commissioners, but in any poor law relating to Dublin, I think a provision of this kind should be brought into effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we ought to be rather critical about this amendment, because my recollection of this question of cost in the workhouses is that it is a purely fictitious figure.  There are no overhead charges taken into account&mdash;the maintenance of buildings, the payment of rates and salaries to higher officials.  The present cost is illusory. If this is to be done it should be done on the basis of true and not fictitious cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Senator is not going to press the amendment because I do not not know that it would serve the purpose he has in mind with regard to including regulations that apply to hospitals and county homes.  We are dealing now with maintenance in workhouses, and as to whether we should relieve able-bodied people inside the workhouses or outside them.  I think that is a new criterion to apply to relief.  It shows that there is a misconception as to what the Bill is intended to do.  The Bill is intended to give outdoor relief to the able-bodied. There is also a misconception as to what the tendency is in the Dublin workhouse.  The tendency at present is to develop it into an hospital on the one side and a county home on the other.  The amendment might work out in a way different to what the Senator anticipated.  I could have it argued to me that it would be cheaper to take a man and his wife and six children into the workhouse than to give them outdoor relief outside, for, as Senator Sir John Keane said, the overhead cost would not be taken into consideration.  The overhead cost is there already, for the workhouse exists.  I ask the Senator to take it that the intention of the Bill is to give relief to able-bodied people outside the workhouse. There would be, and there have been, cases of rather undesirable persons seeking relief, and other persons pressing for relief that the Commissioners could not bring themselves to give outside the workhouse, and they would require <Col N="513" /> them to come inside the workhouse in order that they should be effectively relieved.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Agreed that Sections 2 and 3 stand part of the Bill.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (1).  A board of guardians may, as a condition of the granting of relief under this Act to any person, require such person to perform any task of work which in the opinion of the board is suitable to the sex, age, strength, and capacity of such person.</P>

      <P>Section 4, sub-section (1).  To delete in line 1 the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the word &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel in rather a dilemma in moving this amendment.  The remarks of Senator Byrne suggested to me a revival of popular administration in the City of Dublin, that our sentiment is going to be so strong that we are not to do our duty, but that we are to let our hearts run away with our heads, and pass this Bill whether it is good or bad.  I should be sorry the House should adopt that line with regard to my amendment. The effect of the amendment is to impose an obligation on the guardians to make everybody work according to his age and capacity, and not merely to give a permissive power to do so.  It may be argued that that is not done in other parts of the country, but I put it to the House that the conditions in Dublin differ materially from those that prevail in other parts of the country where you have the large, unsheltered trade of agriculture.  I know I will lay myself open to the charge of advocating the principle of &ldquo;nature red of tooth and claw,&rdquo; as was said in the other House, but I will say that the laws of supply and demand apply as much to labour as to any other commodity. You may try and dodge the issue, you may try and force an artificial position by sentiment, but in the <Col N="514" /> long run economic laws will find you out.  You will have to face up to them, and the taxpayers will have to face up to them.  You may put off facing the issue, but truth is eternal.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, you have got an outlet. In the country there are unsheltered trades where the wages are deplorably low, but the people can get a subsistence on these low rates.  In Dublin, you have got sheltered trades, and the vigilance of the unions, which act as a protection against any lowering of what they consider the minimum rate at which people should be rewarded.  I will go further, and ask the House to agree with me that there is a very large element of people who are taking advantage, or are prepared to take advantage, of the sentiment that in some quarters lies behind this disposition to assist people who do not want to work.  There are people who will not do a decent day's work in order to earn their living and who prefer to get their living in some other way.  Surely it is only reasonable that we should apply the acid test to decide whether a thing is uneconomic or unsound in principle?</P>
    <P>I hold this whole structure is fundamentally unsound, and the only way to revive industry and promote efficiency is to get co-operation between capital and labour, and so stimulate employment.  As long as you have this unsound structure I would not insist on the work being necessarily economic.  Take the occupation or task of breaking stones. That could be performed by all the able-bodied.  The breaking of stones might not be wanted, but it might be well worth while to put people to the work of breaking stones, which does not require a high rate of efficiency. If the stones are not wanted in Dublin it would pay in the long run to cart them where they would be required.  When you talk of the importance of applying a labour test, you can do that by putting a yard of stones before an able-bodied person requiring relief and saying &ldquo;before you get relief that yard of <Col N="515" /> stones will have to be broken.&rdquo;  You may say that is unnatural or inhuman, but I call it common sense. That is a test that could be imposed on the work-shy.  If you do that you will be surprised at the numbers who expect relief but who will not work. I believe that the old people were right in the principle that the workhouses should provide relief for those who were really destitute.  The tendency is now in the wrong direction, to let our sentiment run away with our common sense, and to try and remove the stigma of pauperism. Are you going to remove the stigma of pauperism by relieving people outside of the workhouse?  It is charitable relief whether you relieve inside or outside the workhouse.  I cannot see any distinction between giving relief through a relieving officer or in an institution.  I hope the House will accept the amendment mainly because it is fundamentally sound.  The conditions in Dublin are totally different to those in the country.  You want to make sure that the large number of people who drift into the city to get relief are prepared to do work before they get relief.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the good sense of the House will reject the amendment, because it would be impossible to put what it suggests into operation.  It suggests that a person applying for relief shall be given a work test.  The Senator apparently has in mind the conditions of a small village when he is speaking of relief in Dublin.  According to the figures of the responsible authorities there are 5,000 able-bodied heads of families in Dublin who cannot secure employment, and who require assistance in order to keep bodies and souls together.  The Senator suggests that these 5,000 people should be given work.  He knows in his heart and soul that it is impossible to do that.  He talks about the question of economic laws and about unsound structures. Economic conditions have the happy knack of adjusting themselves in other matters than with regard to <Col N="516" /> wages paid to the ordinary workers. We have noticed within recent months how some wonderful financial magnates have been found out owing to the working of economic laws.  We have found out that the wonderful people who are running the finances of the world have made a complete mess of it.  They have ruined themselves and millions of people.  I believe if the law was put strictly into operation these people would be at their proper occupation, breaking stones and with the mark of the broad arrow upon them.  We on these benches are not in favour of mere relief.  We have always advocated that every man and woman has the right to live.  The Almighty created them, and they should get that opportunity.  Thanks to the goodness of nature, there is more than sufficient to go round for everybody. There is plenty for all and to spare, but some people, owing to their greed, deny to others the miserable existence that is necessary to keep body and soul together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill proposes that we should act as Christians, and that we should not allow people to be hungry in a land that is full of food.  We have more food than we can sell.  There is plenty for all, and yet there are, according to the responsible authorities, 5,000 in Dublin who are not in a position to earn the price of food to keep themselves and their families as they ought to be kept.  Because of that, and because of the conditions that have been brought about by the system of which Senator Sir John Keane is such a tremendous advocate, we find that everything is all wrong and that there is necessity for a relief Bill such as this.  We do not ask for relief.  We believe that useful employment could be found for everybody prepared to do useful work on behalf of the community. Because that is not being done we believe the only alternative that presents itself and that ought to be put into operation is that when people are unable to find employment to provide the necessaries of life for their families we as Christians should come to their assistance. <Col N="517" /> This Bill, as an emergency measure, proposes that power shall be given to the local authorities in Dublin to do what has been done by other local authorities.  Senator Sir John Keane suggests that we should send them all to break stones.  If we do that then we will have to relieve the stone-breakers, for they will all become unemployed and we will have to relieve them.  Carry that to its logical conclusion, and the professional men will have to be relieved by the rates.</P>

      <P>Senator Sir John Keane has not told us how the applicant for relief who is to do stone-breaking, oakum picking, working the water wheel or other work of that kind, is going to seek employment while he is doing that work, and we are presuming that 90, 95, or probably 99 per cent. are men who would be glad to work if work were available.  If the able-bodied applicant receiving relief is to be put into the stone-yard to break stones, how is he to seek work?  That is one of the dilemmas that has always faced the stone-yard proposition.  I think that the answer to Senator Sir John Keane can be found in the Report of the Poor Law Commission of 1836, which stated: &ldquo;The difficulty in Ireland is not to make the able-bodied look for employment, but to find it profitably for the many who seek it....  We <Col N="518" /> see that the labouring class are eager for work, but work is not for them, and that they are, therefore, and not from any fault of their own, in permanent want....  Our conviction is that the able-bodied in general and their families would endure any misery rather than make a workhouse their domicile....  If it (i.e., the workhouse system) were established we are persuaded that it would be regarded by the bulk of the population as a stratagem for debarring them of that right to employment and support with which the law professes to invest them.&rdquo; Notwithstanding the recommendations of that Report, the workhouse system was established.  We have been endeavouring to get away from it and its ill-effects, but the Senator desires to run counter to the sentiments of the Irish people since 1836.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 7 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>7.  There shall be raised in the portion of the Dublin Union specified in sub-section (1) (b) of Section 6 of this Act and in each of the Unions other than the Dublin Union to which this Act applies a special and separate rate of sixpence in the pound of the ratable valuation of such portion of the Dublin Union and of such Unions respectively and the proceeds of such rates shall be paid to the board of guardians of the Dublin Union as contributions to the cost of the relief under this Act of the destitute poor within the area specified in sub-section (1) (b) of Section 6 of this Act and shall be applied accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My object is to secure a more equitable distribution of this exceedingly heavy burden that is being placed by this Bill upon the Dublin community, that is, a more equitable distribution between the ratepayers of the central portion of the metropolitan area and those living in the outlying districts of the county.  As <Col N="519" /> the House is aware, the Bill divides the city and the county of Dublin into four areas for the purpose of this special relief.  The Dublin Union, as it has existed up to now, is split into two portions, one consisting of the city proper and the townships of Rathmines and Pembroke, and the other consisting of those parts of the Dublin Union lying outside that central area.  There is, in addition, the Union of Rathdown on the south and the south-east, and the Union of Balrothery on the north.  The Bill provides that in each of these areas the cost of this special relief shall be borne by the ratepayers within the borders of the area.  Normally, that would seem to be a perfectly fair arrangement, but we are dealing here with an abnormal situation in so far as it relates to the central area.  It is an accepted fact that the vast bulk of the unemployment that is being dealt with under this Bill exists in the central area, and a comparatively small portion of it outside.</P>
    <P>One of our difficulties in dealing with this matter is the absence of reliable figures.  The Minister will not even make an estimate of the probable increase in the rates.  We have got an estimate from one of the City Commissioners, but the Minister repudiates that, so that we are more or less in the dark, and we must make our own calculations as to the size and the distribution of the problem.  But I think anyone who knows Dublin City and County will hardly dispute the fact that at least four-fifths of this problem, and probably 85 to 90 per cent. is concentrated in what I call the central area of the city and Rathmines and Pembroke, and the remaining portion of it is distributed over the three other areas which I have mentioned. I think the result of that will be that a crushing burden will be thrown on the ratepayers in the central area, and a very light burden upon those who live outside it, and it is my purpose to try to redistribute that burden.  As things stand now, the proposed arrangement appears to me to be most <Col N="520" /> inequitable on several grounds.  It must be recognised that the unemployment problem in the central area of Dublin is not purely a problem arising out of that area itself; it is, to a large extent, a problem of the County Dublin, and to a lesser extent a problem of the rest of the country, because, as we know, Dublin absorbs, and has continually absorbed, large numbers of unemployed from other parts of the country who come here looking for work.  When they find that there is no employment in their own districts&mdash;and it is easy to see when there is none and no prospect of employment&mdash;they come to Dublin where, if there is a great deal of unemployment already and thousands looking for jobs, there is always the hope that the man coming in may be a lucky one.  There is always some kind of work in Dublin, and if one is lucky one may get work.  That is applicable to the county of Dublin, which is near the city, and the city draws people in.</P>
    <P>That is one reason why I say that the proposed arrangement is inequitable. Another is this, that many thousands of the people who draw their incomes from Dublin live outside it.  It is hard to calculate the number, but it certainly runs into many thousands.  Although their obligation to their fellow-citizens is as great as the obligation of those who live within the central area, still they escape under this Bill with a very small proportion of the burden. That ought to be corrected. Perhaps I will enforce my point if I give a few illustrations by way of contrast.  Let me take the case of two business men, having premises in the central part of the city, say in O'Connell Street.  One of them lives at Clontarf, which is within the city boundary, and the other lives at Howth, which is a few miles further out.  The man who lives in Clontarf has to bear his full share of this burden in respect of his business premises, and he has also to bear his full share in respect of his residence. The man who lives in Howth has to bear his full share of it in respect of his business premises, but only a <Col N="521" /> very slight portion of it in respect of his residence at Howth.</P>
    <P>It has been calculated, although, of course, I cannot vouch for the figure, that this will cost in Dublin an additional rate of anything from 2/- to 4/6.  I have not seen any estimate that has put the figure at less than 2/-.  I think the Minister in one speech did rather hint at 2/6, but we know that Commissioner O'Dwyer put it as high as 4/6.  I am not tying myself to any of these figures; I am merely committing myself to the statement that it will be very big&mdash;certainly more than 2/-. But in the case of a man living in Howth, or in any other outlying district, it will probably not mean a quarter or a fifth of that.  Let us take the case of two solicitors living in Dublin, one of them having a solicitor's office somewhere in the centre of the city.  He pays perhaps a couple of pounds a week for it, including rates.  When his day's work is done, he gets into his motor-car, which is probably parked on O'Connell Bridge or at some of the other parking places in the city, and he drives off to his residence in the country.  His only contribution to this problem in Dublin is that which he makes in his rent, which is inclusive of rates.  The other man, with an office perhaps on the next floor to him, lives at Sydney Parade.  He has also to pay his proportion of the rates in respect of his office, while at Sydney Parade he has to pay his full proportion of the burden for the central area.  There are two striking differences there.  Let me take the case of two civil servants, probably sitting opposite each other at a table in Merrion Street.  One lives at Rathmines, the other at Dalkey. The man who lives at Rathmines has to pay his full share of this impost, but the man living at Dalkey pays nothing except what he pays in respect of such relief as may arise in the Dalkey area.  There is no necessity to labour this.  It is a very old story and the inequality is glaring, so much so, that I am surprised the Minister has not made some attempt to deal with it in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish it was possible to make all <Col N="522" /> those people who draw their incomes from the city and who live outside pay their full share, as the people who live within the central area do, but I recognise that it is not possible. The only way in which that would be possible would be to extend this charge to the whole county, to make it a county-at-large charge, so that it would not only fall on the people who travel to and from the city each day&mdash;I think they call them commuters in America&mdash;but also upon the people who live in these areas outside the city but who do not directly draw their incomes from the city, as the commuters do.  There are shopkeepers outside the city who do not directly draw their incomes from the city; there are lodginghouse-keepers, there are artisans, there are farmers, and if one were to make this a county-at-large charge, which would be only fair to the commuter class, it would be unfair, I think, to this other class, the members of which do not draw their incomes directly from the city.  But that does not mean that we should allow these town workers to escape their fair share altogether, and I say that the right way to make them liable is to ask them to pay a contributory rate, which I suggest should be 6d. in the £.  Of course, that would also have to be borne by the people who do not draw their incomes directly from the city, but still I do not think it would be an unfair thing to ask of them, because there is hardly anyone in these outlying areas who does not, at least indirectly, draw benefit from his proximity to the city.  All these places are more or less dependent on the city.  If it were not for the city the coast towns would really be villages, and there is hardly anyone in these areas that does not indirectly derive benefit from their closeness to the city.  The shopkeepers out there live largely upon the people who live there but who derive their incomes from the city, the artisans build houses for them and the lodginghouse-keepers are maintained by them.</P>
    <P>The one class that might have a grievance under this proposal is the <Col N="523" /> farming class, but let us take the problem of the farming class there. I have looked into the population figures for these areas and I have found that the number of people engaged in agricultural occupations in these outlying districts represents less than nine per cent. of the total population of the districts.  It will be said that that nine per cent. derives no benefit from the city.  I agree that the farming community of County Dublin does not now have the same advantage in respect of the Dublin markets as it used to have; the extension of transport facilities has brought in farmers from other counties to the Dublin markets, where they are able to compete with the Dublin farmer better than they were ever able to do before.  But to ask me to believe that the farmer in County Dublin derives no benefit from his proximity to the city is to ask me to believe something which I cannot believe.  Even if it were true that they did not derive benefit from that proximity, if it is just to ask the other 91 per cent. of the population in these districts to pay this contribution to Dublin in this great social emergency, is it right that the Oireachtas should be precluded from asking that 91 per cent. to come along and bear its fair share merely because it will hit less than 9 per cent. who say that they are not benefited, but who I hold are benefited?</P>
    <P>This 6d. in the £ that I propose these people should be asked to bear will not be a big thing in comparison with what the city will have to shoulder.</P>
    <P>In the outlying districts the rate in respect of this relief will probably not exceed fourpence, fivepence, sixpence, or sevenpence in the £. Perhaps it might come to ninepence in the £.  I do not know.  No one knows.  Let us assume that it is sixpence. The additional sixpence would make one shilling in the £, which for these people in normal times would be a large amount; but, on the other hand, when you have the people in Dublin having to pay <Col N="524" /> two shillings, three shillings, or perhaps four shillings in the £ it would not be an excessive amount to be paid by the people outside.  It would bring in about £14,500 yearly, not a large contribution by any means when compared with the city, where it is expected the impost will come to anything from £200,000 to perhaps £250,000 a year.  Still it is a substantial contribution when such a figure is being faced by the city and one which I venture to ask the House to provide that these people should give.  There is only one other point that I wish to explain and that was the one made by Senator Byrne as to the holding up of the relief to the poor.  The Minister asked us to discuss these amendments on their merits.  I am glad he has done so and I agree that that is the right course, but if that consideration is introduced I will have something to say when I come to reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WalterNugentBart" hpid="Sir Walter Nugent Sir Walter Nugent">
      <NameTxt>Sir Walter Nugent</NameTxt>
      <P>I second.  The amendment is a very moderate one. I would like to explain to the House what the position is at present under the Bill.  It is this, that the three areas named Dublin, Pembroke, and Rathmines have not only to bear their proportion of the increased levy, but they also have to bear that proportion which will be borne by the rest of the County Dublin, if it were applied the same as in other counties.  Surely that does not seem to be a fair proposition.  Personally, I would have preferred giving the relief in another way; I would have preferred giving relief by having certain excesses over a fixed computed increase in the rate paid out of the Central Fund, but I know that it would not be in order to move such an amendment.  Therefore, I am accepting the suggestion in the amendment moved by Senator Hooper.  What is the amount involved? Being a farmer and having sympathy with farmers, I dislike placing any further burden on them, because I know what a hard lot theirs is, and how hard it is to make ends meet.  But the total sum which would be levied on a computation of sixpence in the £ over these districts <Col N="525" /> would not exceed £6,000.  That is not a very large sum, but it would be some small relief.  I do not think it at all meets the case, but nevertheless it indicates what we all feel, that these three areas are being unfairly treated.  As the Senator pointed out, the rate in Dublin is a very high rate.</P>
      <P>It is so high that if it was increased by twopence-halfpenny in the pound, it would bring it up to the level of the highest borough rate in Ireland, that is in Waterford where this rate is 5/2 in the pound. I only mention that in passing to show that these townships have to bear a considerable burden.  As the Seanad is aware there are many ratepayers in the townships who are not well off, but the increased rate, the amount of which is unknown, will be very severe on them.  A proposal was put forward by business men to obtain relief from the Central Fund, but it was not successful.  We feel that we would not be doing our duty if we did not point out what a severe burden is being placed on them for some unknown reason except that you believe they are able to bear it. I shall vote for the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to oppose the amendment.  I believe it would be more sensible for Senator Hooper to propose that this rate should be put on the whole country than on County Dublin.  Proximity to the city is of very little advantage to farmers.  With the present transport methods any advantage which County Dublin farmers have from proximity to the city is counterbalanced by the very high rate of wages and by rates ruling in County Dublin.  As Senator Butler says, if it is put on County Dublin why not put it on County Kildare, County Meath and County Wicklow?  There are very large tracts of these counties more convenient to the City of Dublin than portions of County Dublin.  It is not proposed to include these counties in the sixpenny rate.  This is an audacious proposal and I hope the House will reject it. From discussions I had in the Lobby I have come to the conclusion that <Col N="526" /> the Seanad is very largely composed of Senators with too much of an urban or a city outlook.  That is not good from the national point of view, especially in an agricultural country.  I strongly oppose the amendment.  I do not think Senator Hooper has made any case which requires to be met by any member of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great sympathy with anyone who tries to relieve the people of Dublin from the great burden of the rates, more especially the traders and small shopkeepers. I wonder whether Senator Hooper's suggestion could be worked out at present.  There is, however, another matter to which I would like to call the attention of the Minister.  There are within the City of Dublin very large properties that are exempt from rate.  I do not mean charitable institutions or religious houses, but very valuable properties that are exempt from rate on the alleged ground that they are public institutions.  Such properties are not exempt from rate in England. They were subjected to rate by a decision in the Liverpool docks case.  The same kind of properties is exempt from rate by a different and contrary decision in Ireland in the Derry case.  I have not the rate book before me and, therefore, I do not wish at this moment to say much on the subject.  But I would suggest to the Minister that if he is casting about for some method of relieving the shopkeepers of Dublin he will find it within the boundaries of the city itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. Barrington Mr. Barrington">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrington</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this amendment, and I do so because it seems to me so essentially unfair and unjust.  The Senator proposes that the immediate districts around Dublin should become liable to a rate of sixpence in the pound for the relief of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His argument was that a good many of the people there derive their incomes from Dublin.  He seems to forget that there are a good many people living there who do not derive any benefit from Dublin.  He <Col N="527" /> completely overlooked the fact that these people have to bear their own burdens and will have to pay for the relief of their own poor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHooper" hpid="Mr. Hooper Mr. Hooper">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hooper</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. Barrington Mr. Barrington">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrington</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition he suggests that they should be asked to pay sixpence in the £ for the relief of the poor in Dublin.  I do not know how it was made clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHooper" hpid="Mr. Hooper Mr. Hooper">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hooper</NameTxt>
      <P>I said at the beginning that this was an additional rate to what they would have to pay, an addition to the small proportion of the burden they would have to bear in their own districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. Barrington Mr. Barrington">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. Barrington Mr. Barrington">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrington</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I suggested that the proposal made by the Senator involved that, and I think it is a very unjust thing.  There are many people who, owing to the circumstances of the country, have had to come and live there who do not derive any benefit from Dublin.  To place on these people any addition to the burden of maintaining their own poor, to make them contribute sixpence in the £ to relieve Dublin is, to my mind, unfair, and in the interests of these people I must urge that this proposal be not accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Counihan stated that from what he had heard in the Lobby the urban mind was strongly reflected in the Seanad. From what we have heard in the Seanad the suburban mind is very strongly reflected in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Senator Hooper has made a case for his proposal.  It is quite clear that those who live in the county and in the suburban areas of Dublin get practically all the advantages that the city of Dublin offers in the matter of facilities for carrying on their trade or profession. It is only fair in the circumstances that they should shoulder a <Col N="528" /> reasonable proportion of the burden that is being put on the city under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement and in sympathy with the object sought to be acheived by the amendment, but I do not believe that the method proposed is the proper one to bring about the results desired.  I agree something ought to be done to make people who run small offices in Dublin and do a big business in the city, people who avail of all the advantages which the city offers and live in the suburbs, should be made contribute something towards the relief of the unemployment problem in the city.  Under the original Bill that was drafted in connection with this question of poor relief, it was sought to make the whole of the County Dublin one area of charge. Owing largely to representations that were made by people residing in the agricultural areas in the county it was found impossible to carry that proposal into effect.  If, instead of the method that he proposes in his amendment, Senator Hooper had endeavoured to amend the areas of charge, it would, I think, be a more just way of achieving what he seeks.  We must face ing to this fact that the people in the areas outside the city who would be affected by Senator Hooper's amendment will have to look after their own needy poor in their districts.  In addition, they will have to pay the equivalent of sixpence in the £ on their valuations towards the relief of the poor in the city.  I think they ought to be made pay something, but I suggest that the method outlined in the amendment is the wrong way to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the districts ought not to have been split up in the manner that they have.  I think there ought to have been two areas (1) embracing the district from the city to Dalkey and to Howth, and (2) the agricultural areas outside those boundaries.  That, of course, cannot be done now.  We heard a good deal of talk from Senator Comyn and others about coming to the relief of the poor shopkeepers.  There was <Col N="529" /> also a good deal of talk as regards business men having to foot the bill in connection with this.  I say that is not correct.  In my opinion the people who ultimately will have to bear the cost of this are the residents of Dublin, and particularly those living in tenement areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that there are places exempt which ought not to have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion it is the poor, some of the people getting relief under this Bill, who ultimately will have to pay for the cost of relieving themselves.  Why I say that is because all other classes practically can pass the burden on to somebody else, but the poor cannot.  The shopkeeper and the manufacturer or the farmer, if you like, can pass on the burden that will fall on him, but the unfortunate people living in the tenement areas in the city will have no one to pass it on to and must bear it themselves.  It is time, I think, that we ceased talking about business and industry having to bear the cost of this.  We will all have to pay our share of it.  I will have to pay my share of it, though I can less afford to do so than many other members of the House.  The fact at any rate is that the poor are there and they must be relieved.  The position is that we ought to face up to our responsibilities and do our best to relieve them to the best of our ability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators will remember that the original Bill dealing with this matter, which passed through the Seanad; comprised three areas; the area of the Guardians of Balrothery, the area of the Guardians of Rathdown and the Dublin Union area embracing the city, Rathmines and Pembroke Urban Districts, as well as the rural area consisting of North and South Dublin and Celbridge. Therefore, the original Bill passed through the Seanad contemplated that the Guardians of Balrothery and Rathdown would shoulder their own burden, and that the burden on Dublin City and the rural districts around it would be <Col N="530" /> borne by these areas at a flat rate. The representatives of the county objected to this burden being put upon them.  The matter was opened for discussion by the Department of Local Government between the bodies in the city and county of Dublin with a view to seeing whether a joint scheme could not be formed to settle this particular matter and obviate the necessity for introducing legislation.  These bodies failed to come to agreement on that.</P>
      <P>In the report that was made by the representatives of the County Dublin and the Dublin Commissioners it was asked that in so far as the Balrothery area was concerned that fifty per cent. of the cost would be made a national charge.  The same suggestion was made in respect of Rathdown Union and of the Dublin Union.  That proposal was not entertained by the Executive Council for reasons that I am satisfied were good and sound.  The arrangement in the original Bill passed by the Seanad by which the Guardians of Balrothery were made responsible for their own charge is in this Bill, and the same has happened with regard to the area administered by the Rathdown Guardians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking into consideration the fact that the areas of North Dublin Rural, Celbridge, and South Dublin Rural were rural areas of Dublin in the sense that the Balrothery area was, I considered, simply because it had been joined in with Dublin for normal poor law charges, that it would be unfair to saddle that particular rural area of Dublin with portion of the alleged big burden that is being placed upon the city of Dublin when other rural areas around the city were not being so charged.  We, therefore, agreed to divide the area comprised in the Dublin Union into a rural and into a city area.  In the action that we took in that direction we were impelled by the fact that we were placing before the Oireachtas a Bill dealing with the future local government of the city and county of Dublin, which sets out a new city <Col N="531" /> area.  It comprises the present Dublin County Borough with Rathmines and Pembroke as a new county brough area, with one or two small areas put in, leaving the rest of the county as an area which, when the necessary legislation has been passed, will automatically become one area of charge for poor law purposes.  In setting up proposals like that consideration was given to this, that as regards any possible burden arising out of the rearrangement there should be no such thing as discrimination as between two rural districts, and for that reason the present divisions were made.  Senator Sir Walter Nugent suggests that what we propose here is different to what exists in the case of other counties, or in the case of Cork, Waterford or Limerick.  That is not so.  The only difference is that, because you have three areas at the present moment in the County Dublin which are separate areas of charge for poor law purposes, we are leaving them there.  If there is a unit area of charge comprising Waterford City and Waterford County in one case, and if there is another unit area of charge comprising the city of Cork and part of the county of Cork, the reason is that that was done by agreement between the county council on the one side, and the county borough council on the other.</P>
    <P>In Limerick that agreement was not come to, and Limerick City bears its own poor law charges the same as the city and county of Dublin has to bear its own charges for this class of relief.  In Dublin we are in the same position as other parts of the country.  The County Council and the Commissioners failed to come to an agreement as regards a joint scheme.  The Minister for Local Government at the time would have been glad to have legislative power that would have enabled him to enforce a joint scheme in the case of the city and the county of Limerick. There is a great difference between a city of the size of Limerick and a city of the size of Dublin, including Rathmines and Pembroke, with a <Col N="532" /> population of 390,000.  At this particular stage of our knowledge I suggest that Dublin City might very well stand on its own feet and shoulder its own burdens, and examine clearly and precisely the situation.  There are additional reasons for that.  The number of persons in receipt of home assistance at the end of the year 1927-28 per one thousand of the population has been figured out in the different counties. We find that the highest number is 51.1 per one thousand persons in receipt of home assistance.  That occurs in Kildare and in Rathdown. There is this difference with the Kildare numbers, I take it that the numbers there are those of able-bodied persons who are in receipt of outdoor relief, so we have the situation that in Rathdown Union we have the highest number of persons per thousand of the population in receipt of home assistance.  It differs from the rest of the country in this, that able-bodied persons are not given outdoor relief there.</P>
    <P>Coming to Balrothery, the number of persons per thousand in receipt of home assistance is 33.7.  If we except Kildare and Rathdown, there are only two other places in the country, one the city of Limerick and the other the city and county of Waterford, that have a higher number of persons in receipt of outdoor relief than Balrothery, though Balrothery differs in this respect, that the able-bodied poor are not catered for there.  The figure for Dublin is 15.6 per one thousand as against 51.1 in Rathdown and 33.7 in Balrothery. In face of these figures I do not know how much of this burden is going to be put on Rathdown and Balrothery, but I do suggest there is a case for accepting my point of view, that if the problem of Dublin is going to be critically and efficiently examined Dublin should have its own machinery and face its own problem in the light of the facts, just as every other county has to face its own problem and bear its own burden for this class of relief.  If we look for other people to carry the burden, then <Col N="533" /> there is going to be irresponsibility in the matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir Walter Nugent suggests that the nation might bear a part of the cost of this relief.  I question that.  The present expenditure in the city of Dublin in poor law relief amounts to a rate of 2s. 10d., in Cork 3s. 1d., in Waterford 3s. 11d., and in Limerick 8s.  If the Limerick people are going to be relieved in respect of poor relief from the national funds, once they got above the rate of 2s. 6d.  I think their rate might be extended with a lavish hand, and go from 8s. to 10s., because they would feel that after all it was going to come out of the taxpayers' pockets and not out of the pockets of the people of Limerick. We require to know much more as to where we stand in this particular matter before we start by spreading the charge over the shoulders of other people.  Dublin has not much to complain of.  Reference has been made to England.  I think Senators will find that the cost of poor relief in England has gone up since 1913 from £11,000,000 to £44,000,000, an increase of 400 per cent.  Here it has gone up from £1,000,000 to £1,500,000, an increase of 50 per cent.  Our unemployment insurance is based on insurance.  I came across a business person in Dublin who did not know that uncovenanted benefit was not being paid for in the unemployment insurance scheme in the Free State.  Some business people do not know that, whereas for the last four years unconvenanted benefit has been paid to an enormous extent in England, and the unemployment insurance scheme is not on the basis of insurance.  We have it on the basis here, so that we are in the position that our unemployment insurance is on a proper actuarial basis.</P>
    <P>I do not think we have to look to the other side for our models as to the way we should go about doing our business.  I think the most satisfactory way of dealing with this problem, even for the ratepayers of Dublin, is to have them face their own problems and shoulder their own burdens until we know where <Col N="534" /> we stand.  If any other changes are to be brought about they have to be carefully examined.  As to people who work inside the city and who live outside of it, all that can be said is that they get a licence to work inside the city, or something like that.  We should not confuse the areas of charge for local government by the consideration that a person who works here does not live here. Some other method will have to be adopted than one of confusing the finances of our local government.</P>

      <P>I am sorry the Minister did not approve of the amendment, and more particularly because of the line of argument he adopted. There was one strong point, I admit, in his reply when he quoted the figures showing the amount spent in ordinary relief in places like Rathdown and Balrothery.  The Minister admitted that there it was ordinary outdoor relief.  He did not show what the expenditure of this kind to relieve the able-bodied unemployed would be.  It seemed to me his reply was mainly based on grounds of expediency.  He spoke of objections taken by representatives of the rural areas in the early stages of this measure.  It seemed the representatives of the rural areas had only to say &ldquo;no,&rdquo; and the Minister surrendered.  I do not know what representation the city had there.  I presume the City Commissioners were present at the discussions, but I wonder would he be quite so acquiescent in the demands of the rural representatives if the citizens of Dublin had been a little more active in their own defence than they were?  Unfortunately they are not in the position now to be as vocal as they used to be.  All that the Minister has said does not seem to me to be any answer at all to the fact that in the central area of Dublin, including Rathmines and Pembroke, the impost will run from anything from 2/- to 4/- in the £.  We do not know what it will be.  The impost on the outer portions is going to be small. The Minister has not suggested it would be anything like the figures I have mentioned.  When a large portion <Col N="535" /> of the people who live in the outer areas draw their income from Dublin, I say that this disproportion <Col N="536" /> is unfair.  I hope the House will show that it shares that opinion when deciding on this amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I will explain in a word or two the position in which this Bill is.  It is a Bill that originated in the Senate, and when it came to the House in Committee a resolution was passed appointing a Select Committee to consider the amendments to it. Accordingly the Bill went to a Select Committee, which considered it most carefully and put in a very large number of amendments.  You have all got a printed copy of the amendments that were put in, together with a copy of the Bill as amended by the Select Committee. When a Bill is sent to a Select Committee and comes back to the House it is just as if the House had passed the amendments which were made in the Select Committee, so that this Bill now comes before us <Col N="537" /> on Report.  While we were considering it in Committee it came to our knowledge that the Minister for Local Government was considering this question of town planning and had a Bill in contemplation, that in fact he had gone so far as to have a small committee of his own officials considering the provisions of a Bill which is to be introduced. Our Bill which comes before the House to-day on Report is, I hope, a very good Town Planning Bill. Whether the Minister will be able to take it up as his Bill, or whether he will have an independent Bill of his own, with the assistance he will get from this Bill, I do not know, but that would require time for consideration, and even if we were to go on with this Bill and take it to its final stage in this House, there are certain amendments which ought to be introduced on the Report Stage. We have not put them down because we think it more convenient and more proper in the circumstances that the further consideration of the Bill should be adjourned until we meet again next year.</P>

      <P>The motion which I propose is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Seanad disapproves of the procedure adopted by the Minister for Defence in the formation of a Volunteer Reserve as being an abuse of the power of the Minister and an encroachment upon the authority of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I was about to say that the practice has been everywhere for Parliaments to keep a very strict watch upon and control over the use that is made of armed forces.  I do not want to express any views at all as to the advisability or the wisdom of establishing a Volunteer Reserve, but I want to bring to the attention of the Seanad what I consider to be a serious departure from what is right and proper touching the establishment of a military force.  In the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, it was provided that the Executive Council night raise and maintain a Reserve Force, that Reserve Force to consist of officers and men.  &ldquo;The reserve of men shall consist of non-commissioned officers and men who, having served in the Forces, have been transferred to the Reserve in pursuance of Part II, Chapter V. of this Act.&rdquo;  Part II, Chapter V. of the Act provides that:</P>
      <P>The original enlistment of a person under this Act shall be as follows&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  for the whole of the term of his original enlistment in Army service; or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  for such portion of the term of his original enlistment as may be, from time to time, fixed by the Minister and specified <Col N="540" /> in the attestation paper in Army service, and for the residue of the said term in the Reserve.</P>
    <P>The Minister may from time to time, by general or special regulation, vary the conditions of service so as to permit a soldier of the Forces in any service, with the assent of the Minister, either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  to enter the Reserve at once for the residue unexpired of the term of his original enlistment; or</P>
    <P>(b)  to extend his Army service for all or any part of the residue unexpired of such term.</P>
    <P>Acting under the powers of Section 146, presumably, the Minister has thought fit to establish a Volunteer Reserve by enlisting men in the Army and immediately, without any interval for training or for any other purpose whatsoever, for them to apply for transfer to the Reserve. It is probably quite true that the Minister has power, by twisting and stretching the provisions of that section&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite understand the anxiety of some Senators not to have this matter made public. I do not know why there should be such anxiety to leave Dublin to-night when they might have legitimately been expected to remain over until to-morrow.  As I was about to say, the Minister has illegitimately and unreasonably used the powers given to him under Section 146 of the Defence Forces Act to establish a new military arm, and I contend that in doing that he has over-stepped his own authority and has encroached upon the authority of the Oireachtas. It is provided that a person may be enlisted to serve as a soldier for twelve years or less, as fixed by the Minister.  It is provided that:</P>
      <P>The original enlistment shall be for the whole of the term of his original enlistment in Army service; or for such portion of the term of his original enlistment as may be, from time to time, fixed by the Minister and specified in the attestation paper in Army service, and for the residue of the said term in the Reserve.</P>
      <P>I think I could quote section after section which would convince the House that the meaning of this Act is that persons shall have served for a period in the Army and then be transferred to the Reserve.  It is provided that the Reserve shall consist of non-commissioned officers and men who, having served in the forces, have been transferred to the Reserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 6th November there was tabled the Defence Force Regulations, D.F.R. 76, 1929.  It is required by the Act that these Regulations shall be tabled before the Oireachtas. It is not required that they shall be approved, and there is no provision that they may be nullified by the vote of the House.  They explain <Col N="542" /> the whole intention of the Volunteer Reserve, and how a man seeking to enter the Reserve makes his attestation oath.  In the course of that form of oath I read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>And I do further solemnly swear (or declare) that I will bear true faith and allegiance to and against all enemies whatsoever, defend Saorstát Eireann and its Constitution as by law established and I will render good true service and obedience to the Oireachtas and Government of Saorstát Eireann under the Constitution, and that I will submit myself to discipline and obey without question the orders of the officers appointed over me according to law and further that I will not while I am a soldier of Oglaigh na hEireann join or be a member of or subscribe to any political society or organisation whatsoever or any secret society.</P>
    <P>Every member joining this Volunteer Reserve is required to sign this oath but at the moment of signing he is informed &ldquo;That the provisions of the above oath cease to apply to a soldier when he has been transferred to the Reserve.&rdquo;  A member of the Volunteer Reserve will therefore be entitled to engage in any lawful political activity except when in case of general national danger or great emergency the Reserve is called out on permanent service. We have heard a good deal from time to time of the phrase &ldquo;an empty formula,&rdquo; but if ever it was applicable surely it is applicable to a regulation of this kind requiring that a man who shall take that oath and a moment afterwards be released from that oath as not being applicable because he has been transferred to the Reserve.</P>
    <P>I do not want to elaborate too much upon this but I want to point out that there has never been any authority given by the Oireachtas for the establishment of this new military force, except the authority that I have referred to, and which, as I say, was clearly not contemplated and clearly in the mind of the Minister for Defence a few <Col N="543" /> months ago was not considered lawful, because he informed the Dáil that he was doubtful whether he had power to establish that Volunteer Reserve.  Later, presumably, he found that by this subterfuge or evasion he was able to establish such a Reserve, and without coming to the Oireachtas for powers, he proceeded to establish it.  He made no provision in the Estimates submitted to the Dáil in January of this year for this Volunteer Reserve, and I submit that the whole method and the whole procedure has been entirely irregular and quite unfair to the Oireachtas, and that it is stretching the powers contained in the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act in a manner that ought not to have been done by any Minister of State.  I submit that the House is entitled in view of these facts to express its disapproval of the procedure.</P>
    <P>The question of the advisability of this is not before me and I do not want to express any views on it.  If I were looking at the matter entirely irrespective of the procedure I would think that a Volunteer Reserve is probably the best form in which military training can be extended to any large section of the people, but the method of establishing this new force without regard to the formal permission of the Oireachtas, without bringing the matter formally before the Houses to get legislative sanction, was wrong and should be disapproved of.</P>

      <P>The little comedy that took place when Senator Johnson moved this very important motion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Are you seconding the motion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I will second it.  The little comedy leads me to think that although we may have the sentiment and the desire for national liberty, there is not in the people of this country an educated opinion of what popular liberty is.  Personal freedom and the safeguards of personal freedom <Col N="544" /> are absolutely unknown.  We are still children in that respect.  This question of this embodiment of armies came up in every European country in the 17th century.  The enrolment of a standing Army led to the downfall of liberty in every country except England.  It did not lead to the destruction of liberty in England simply because the English people had fought for liberty in the two generations preceding, and because in their Mutiny Act they had guarded against the evils of a standing army.  There is this preamble in their Mutiny Act:</P>
      <P>Whereas the raising or keeping of a standing Army within the United Kingdom in time of peace, unless it be with the consent of Parliament, is against the law.</P>
      <P>That was the preamble of the Mutiny Act of 1689.  It has been repeated in every annual Army Act since then, and is contained in the Army Act of last year.  I would also like to point out in regard to the National Militia, which corresponds in some way to the Volunteer Force which the Minister has without the consent of Parliament, embodied, that that militia could not be lawfully embodied except Parliament was in session.  If Parliament was not in session the King was bound to issue a proclamation convening Parliament within ten days.  That shows the jealous care with which Parliament sought to supervise the enrolment of bodies of armed men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is in our Army Act, which is called the Defence Force (Temporary Provisions) Act, a reference made to the provisions in our Constitution.  There is lip service paid to that.  But I think the attitude which the Minister has adopted in this case shows that he has no regard whatever for the principles of liberty, which have been sanctioned by the usages of ages and for which men have bled. I suggest if these principles are not initiated in the Dáil and in the Seanad, if they are not paid regard to, I can assure the Minister that at <Col N="545" /> some other time, perhaps other men will rise and do what men in England and in other places have already done.</P>
    <P>Looking at the constitutional history of all European countries, we can see that armed and permanent military forces have led to the destruction of liberty, unless in cases where they were strictly supervised by Parliament.  In England the Army Act, in addition to that preamble which is intended to preserve the liberties of the people, goes further, and strictly limits the number of armed men who are to be enrolled.  Last year it provided that the whole number of such forces should consist of 153,500 men, including those employed at depots for the training of recruits.  In our Irish Act there is no provision limiting the number of men that are to be enrolled.  Our Act provides that &ldquo;it shall be lawful for the Executive Council to raise and maintain an armed force to be called Oglaigh na hEireann (hereinafter referred to as the forces) consisting of such number of officers, non-commissioned officers and men as may from time to time be provided by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know on what legal grounds the Minister considers that he can enrol this Volunteer Force without bringing his proposals be-force Parliament.  Perhaps it is because there is some loophole in Chapter 1 of the Act.  They are not limited as in England to the number of men that can be enrolled.  They are only checked by the moneys to be placed at their disposal.  Under that Act it would be quite possible to enrol 500,000 men if there were so many here for one month and pay them.  I think that Senator Johnson's motion is a very important one, and that it ought to have been listened to by members of the Seanad.  It raises a very serious question, one which the Minister has no doubt carefully considered, but which the Dáil and the Seanad are entitled to have fully explained.</P>
    <P>I say nothing at all upon the merits of having a volunteer force. <Col N="546" /> I think it is the best method of securing national defence, but in the present case, I think the Minister has not acted constitutionally, because he has not brought the proposals before Parliament, which is the only authority under which armies can be enrolled.  If Parliament neglects its duties, abrogates its powers, or derogates its authority, if members run away from meetings where this question is discussed, then, whatever may be said about political liberty, personal liberty is in danger, and the soil is being cultivated and prepared for the dictatorship which is to come.</P>

      <P>I am not going to comment on the indecent action&mdash;at any rate I consider it indecent action&mdash;of my colleagues.  I am not going to comment on the insult that was offered to Senator Johnson and the party to which he belongs during part of the proceedings.  I will content myself after consulting some of my friends by moving the adjournment of the debate until the next meeting of the Seanad.</P>

      <P>In view of the very important matters raised by Senator Johnson's motion, and in view of the small attendance, I second the motion proposed by Senator O'Neill. I also suggest that Senator Johnson's motion be put down as the first item on the Order Paper when the Seanad next meets.</P>

      <P>I want to support the motion for the adjournment as I think it would be well to defer this matter until after the Recess.  In any case I take this opportunity of supporting the motion, and to state emphatically that the attempt which was made to get this discussion adjourned, was not with a desire to baulk any discussion of the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say, with all the emphasis that I can command, that my desire in this matter was that Senator Johnson in raising this would have a good House and a good hearing and that the matter would be fully considered.  I was afraid that it would be very difficult <Col N="547" /> indeed to have that this evening, and for that reason some of us considered that the purpose which Senator Johnson has in mind would be met much better if this matter were adjourned until after the Recess.  I think some Senators who have spoken have tried to broadcast the idea that those who support the Government fear that some disclosures might be made if the discussion proceeded and wished to have the thing hushed up.  There is no such intention.  There is nothing to hush up and we have nothing to fear that may emerge from this discussion to the discredit of the Army or the Government.</P>

      <P>I support the motion for the adjournment now that it has been moved, but I protest against the insult offered to the House by the contemptible action of Senator Milroy's colleagues in going around trying to induce Senators to leave their places so <Col N="548" /> that there might be no quorum.  I characterise that as contemptible. Senators should know better than to surrender themselves to that type of seduction in the discharge of their public duties.</P>
