    <P>Question proposed: That this Bill be read a second time.</P>

      <P>As the law stands at present, there is only one condition of affairs under which a temporary circuit judge can be appointed.  That is when a circuit judge, through illness, is unable to sit.  That is provided for in the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.  This Bill makes provision that when a circuit judge through illness, or for any other reason, is unable to sit a temporary judge may be appointed to take his place.  The reason for this Bill, which I may point out only purports to remain in force for two years, is that at the present moment one of the circuit judges has been called away to fulfil a very important public position for some little time as chairman of a commission. Another of our circuit judges, though he is now after a long illness able to resume his duties in Dublin, is not able, owing to his state of health, to go down to outside counties where his presence is required. It is to enable these temporary difficulties to be overcome that this Bill is introduced.  If a Bill of this nature were not introduced and did not become law, it would mean that in certain counties there would be no sittings of the <Col N="328" /> circuit courts and that would be very unfair to litigants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to this measure I would like to register a protest against the appointing of temporary judges.  If there is one thing which experience has taught us it is that judges must be independent of the Executive.  They cannot be independent of the Executive if they are to be temporary judges, to be appointed for such time as the Minister may think proper and to be dispensed with, or probably not appointed to permanent positions if in their period, let us say, of trial they happen to displease the Minister.  If an ordinary member of the Government had come forward with a proposal like this I would be inclined to say that perhaps he had not the same experience or the same wide reading that the Minister who now proposes this Bill has had.  The great conflict between Parliament and the Minister of the King in the seventeenth century raged round this question of the permanence of the judicial office and the independence of the judges.  It is only through the independence of the judges that you can have the supremacy of Parliament. No person knows that better than the Minister who has introduced this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, I do not object to the appointment of men with judicial experience to act as chairmen of important commissions.  They are suitable for such work by reason of their experience, and by reason of the fact that they can, perhaps, keep calm when less experienced men would be liable to get somewhat excited.  They have had experience of the conduct of work where witnesses are examined, and are undoubtedly suitable for such work. At the same time, I think their services ought not to be resorted to too freely.  A judge's duty is to administer law on the Bench.  He should be left on the Bench as far as possible, and it is not desirable that persons filling judicial positions should too frequently be brought into such a position that they would get into the whirl of politics.  All I <Col N="329" /> say is that it is not desirable.  Of course when a circuit judge is ill it is essential that a judge should be appointed in his place, unless indeed some other circuit court judge permanently appointed could not be found to discharge his duties.</P>
    <P>I admit that the business of the country must go on, but what I object to is the underlying idea in sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 1.  There is permeating these two sub-sections the motion of the temporary appointment of judges.  Sub-section (1) provides that, wherever, owing to other public duties or services temporarily imposed on him, a judge is required, or on account of illness, or for any other sufficient reason, a Judge of the Circuit Court is unable to discharge the duties of his office, then the Minister proposes to take power to appoint a temporary judge not for the period of the incapacity of the other judge, but for such period not exceeding the duration of such complete or partial inability&mdash;&ldquo;such period not exceeding as he shall on the advice aforesaid think proper.&rdquo;  A judge goes on to the chairmanship of a commission.  The Minister takes power to go to the Bar and select another man for a month or two to see, I suppose, how he gets on.  The Minister does not take power to appoint him for the period during which the other judge is absent.  He takes control over the judge.</P>
    <P>In the second sub-section you have this remarkable provision:</P>
    <P>Every person appointed under this section to act as a Judge of the Circuit Court shall, during the period for which he is so appointed, hold office by the tenure by which a judge of the Circuit Court holds his office.</P>
    <P>If that is not giving lip-service to the principle of the independence and the permanency of the judicial seat.  I do not know what is.  It is the tribute which, I suppose, the intellect of the Minister pays to the constitutional principle that he knows so well.  I do not wish, on a measure of this kind, to go too far or to say too much.  I would like to repeat again that we are very <Col N="330" /> jealous of the independence of judges.  We see in the independence of the judges the only protection there is against Ministers, whether they are Ministers of the Crown, as happened in the seventeenth century, or whether they are Ministers of the Free State as happens to-day. There is always a struggle for the Minister or his staff, his office or his Department to get power.  There is always a chafing against Parliamentary supremacy and the liberty of the people.  It always seems to be inevitable in the nature of things.  It is our duty to watch very carefully, whatever else happens, that the permanency of the judicial office and the independence of the judicial mind shall be preserved.</P>

      <P>I am in the happy, but rather unusual, position of agreeing with a great deal of what Senator Comyn has said.  For nearly six years I have been protesting against the appointment of temporary judges, mainly for the reasons which have been given by Senator Comyn, reasons which I am sure do appeal to the Minister just as strongly as they do to us.  I was glad to see from some observations made by the Minister himself when the Bill was in the other House that he is not going to do this again.  He admitted that it was not a practice that ought to be pursued, and I think he more or less gave a promise that he will not do it again.  I also agree with Senator Comyn, to a very large extent, when he said that our judges ought not to be taken from the Bench and employed as chairmen or members of commissions.  I think that is not a good arrangement.  I admit that they are eminently suitable to preside over some of these commissions.  They are suited to the job, but the job does not suit them.  They ought not to be there because most of those commissions are appointed with a certain amount of political direction in them with which a member of the Judiciary ought not to be mixed up.  I propose to vote for the Second Reading of the Bill which is a purely temporary one, but I hope that a measure like it will not be repeated.</P>

      <P>The position which this Bill is designed to meet is really not of a temporary character.  I think that every lawyer, and particularly the Minister, is aware of the fact that there is the most scandalous congestion of arrears of work in the courts.  There are cases in the courts which have been hanging over for a very considerable period and there is no knowing when they are going to be heard.  I understand that cases under the Workmen's Compensation Acts have been listed for a very considerable period.  The applicants in these cases, while awaiting the trial of them, are suffering considerable hardship. Their counsel are unable to give them any information as to when the cases are likely to be heard.  That is because of the vast accumulation of arrears of work in the courts.  It is also due to the fact that the Bench generally is understaffed.  I think it is time that the question of the proper staffing of the Bench was faced for the reason that the present position inflicts considerable hardship and unnecessary expense on litigants.  Our courts, as a rule, are pretty dilatory in their methods and progress, but when you have them, as they are at present, overworked the position becomes very much worse.  The practice that has been referred to, of taking the judges away to preside over commissions has accentuated the present position in regard to the accumulation of arrears of work in the courts.  I think it is time these temporary measures were dispensed with and that sufficient appointments were made to deal with the business in the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is anything calculated to break a person's heart and to rob a well-to-do man it is to enter into litigation at all because of these desperate delays that take place. Counsel meet on a particular day, and suddenly they find that the cases they are engaged in cannot be heard on that day.  Then there is a postponement to some other day.  Very often there is a further postponement. Counsel have to get their fees as well as refreshers, while of course <Col N="332" /> the solicitors have also to be paid. The whole thing results in the spending of enormous amounts of money on legal fees that would not be necessary if the courts were conducted in the manner that they should be conducted in.  The position in the Court of Appeal&mdash;this does not really enter into what we are discussing on this Bill&mdash;is a proper farce.  In that court one never knows when he is going to get a decision even after a case is heard. The people concerned are simply obsessed with the old idea ingrained in their very bones that they must have the absolute maximum delay before they will give a solemn decision. The sooner, I think, that the Executive Council try to infuse into the Bench generally the idea that they are just a business organisation set up for the purpose of administering justice in a capable and at the same time expeditious way the better for the community as a whole. I hope that the Minister in getting this Bill through will not feel satisfied that he has dealt with the position that exists.  From every quarter you hear complaints regarding delays in the courts, with the consequent amount of hardship, suffering and expense which those delays cause.</P>

      <P>I only want to say that I agree with all that the last three Senators have said.  I am not a lawyer and I do not know, but as far as I can judge there seems to be a unanimous opinion that the method with regard to the courts which has been adopted&mdash;a method over which we spent a lot of time with a former Minister&mdash;has absolutely broken down.  From what has been said there seems to have been a complete stoppage as regards the hearing of cases in the courts.  At any time, the law is a great burden to the people and not an advantage to them.  As a judge once said: &ldquo;it is a misfortune to lose a case, but it is disastrous to win it,&rdquo; which shows that anyone who goes to law and who could possibly avoid it is a sort of a lunatic.</P>

      <P>There is nothing in the Bill which does away with the independence of the Judiciary.  There is nothing in the Bill which put the Dáil or the Seanad or Ministers in control of the judges&mdash;nothing of the kind. But certain circumstances occur, one being the illness of judges.  In the case of illness, you must either have a permanent judge doing nothing ready to take the position of a judge who becomes ill, or you must appoint a temporary person in his place for the duration of that illness. The other case is that a de-rating commission, a commision of very great importance, has been set up, and it was considered to be right that over that commission there should be a person whose judicial qualities had been completely proved.  I am not going to enter into what Senator O'Farrell said about delays in the courts.  I hardly think that arises on this Bill.  The Senator <Col N="334" /> attacked the Supreme Court, but I venture to think that we have a very able Supreme Court indeed.  On the general question as to the number of judges, that does not arise here.  If Senators flung back their memories just a few days they would be aware of the fact that a Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad has been set up to investigate these very questions: the number of judges, how to fill temporary vacancies when they occur, the method of hearing appeals and so on.  All these matters will come before the Joint Committee which is set up.  This Bill does not purport to be a permanent measure. It is a temporary measure introduced to tide us over such time as must elapse before the Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad has made its recommendations and before those recommendations have been embodied in law.</P>

      <P>I move Amendment 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 3.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  It shall not be lawful for the Master or owner of a pack of harriers or beagles or for the owner of a harrier or beagle hound to permit such pack or hound to hunt (either in the pursuit of game or for drag-hunting) during the annual close season over any meadow or cornfield or other land frequented by game, and any person who acts in contravention of this sub-section shall be guilty of an offence under this part of this Act and shall be punishable accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 3 relates to the annual close season for various classes of game.  I ask the permission of the House to make a slight addition to my amendment.  The addition that I seek is to insert after the words &ldquo;annual close season&rdquo; the words &ldquo;for hares.&rdquo;  I do not intend to interfere with the close season for birds at all.  It is quite clear that the object of the amendment is in relation to the hunting of hares.</P>

      <P>As I explained on the Second Reading of the Bill it is usual in certain parts of the country to have what are known as drag hunts during the summer period, that is the racing of hounds or beagles over the country.  For several miles over the country they follow a line of scent laid by some person.  Farmers as a rule have no objection to this, provided they keep to the pasture land and avoid tilled land where meadow or corn are growing.  It very often happens, however, that a meadow or a corn field comes within their line.  The <Col N="336" /> result is that very great damage is done to the crops.  The adoption of this amendment will in no way interfere with sport in the country. Farmers as a rule are quite agreeable that this sport should be carried on, provided it is carried on under such conditions that no serious damage will be done to their crops.  I submit the amendment for the consideration of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the amendment will not pass.  I have seen excellent sport for many years with a pack of harriers which is over two centuries old.  Many people consider that March is the best month of the year for the harrier packs.  They also consider that the close time for hares should not begin until 1st April.  I would like to point out that harriers are particularly useful for the training of horses, more so, perhaps, than fox hounds.  I come from a part of the country which is an important horse-breeding centre. The people who keep packs of harriers there would be very much against any such arrangement as is proposed in this amendment, which I hope will not pass, for I believe it would seriously interfere with sport in the country.  So far as I know, no farmer objects to hounds going over his land.  With few exceptions hunting people are always very careful to avoid doing damage in any way.  In the advertisements of meets there is generally a notice inserted asking the hunt followers to be careful. I do not think there is any need for the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Earl of Granard</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand the mentality of the Senator who has moved this amendment. Last week he advocated the use of bird lime for the catching and destruction of small birds.  To-day he shows great concern for game, such as hares, etc.  The amendment, if passed, will seriously affect the horse-breeding industry, and curtail hunting for a month or six weeks. As Senator Miss Browne has pointed out, the month of March is the best month for harriers.  I agree with her that generally speaking little <Col N="337" /> damage is done to farmers by hounds passing over their lands.  I think every consideration should be shown to farmers for their kindness in allowing hunts to pass over their lands.  I am inclined to think that the Senator who has moved the amendment has done so because he objects to hounds going over his land.  In my opinion the amendment has nothing to recommend it, and I hope neither the Seanad nor the Minister will show any regard for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something more to be said for the amendment than has been so far stated. In former times there was a great difference of opinion in Ireland as regards the close season.  The Grand Jury used to fix the dates for the close season, and there were different dates for different counties. Some included March and some did not.  I think that March is a good hunting season, and much harm is not done by hunting during that month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. Gogarty Dr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I could satisfy Senator The Earl of Granard about the mentality of Senator Linehan when I draw attention to the fact that it is the March hare he was discussing, and the amendment is in sympathy with the mentality of the March hare.  Everybody here knows that any steps that would in the slightest way curtail hunting would be very harmful by allowing it to get abroad that hunting was obstructed by law in Ireland.  That would further tend to the desolation of the country mansions which are at present in a ruinous condition.  As long as we are going to consider that the salt of the earth lives in the Gaeltacht it may be possible to allow a number of gentlemen's houses in the country to fall into ruins to further our patriotism, but even the Gaeltacht to some extent depends on the circulation of money.  I do not think it is independent of that.  It behoves us not to allow further misrepresentation about the difficulty of sport in this country.  There is an immense amount of money <Col N="338" /> brought into circulation through the number of establishments that are occupied throughout the country during the hunting season. This country provides exceptional facilities for hunting.  Urban extension into the countryside in England has developed so much that the pheasants have become so tame that they would almost shunt a railway train.  I do not think the Senator was anything more serious than perhaps a March hare.  I leave it at that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, but the Senator is brackish all the same.  In regard to the amendment, I would like to say that in my opinion the mover of it is in favour of sport and hunting in Ireland.  He is a sportsman himself, and he is a good judge and a good breeder of horses, and, therefore, he would be anxious for the development of the horse breeding industry.  I would be in favour of the amendment if I could see how you are going to direct the way in which a hare is to run.  Once you start the hare you do not know where he is going to run and finish. With regard to drag hunting, I think it is wrong that a drag should be drawn across the cultivated land of a farmer.  I am not for the amendment, for the reason that I do not see how it is going to be carried out, but I am going to support the sentiment it expressed.  It is wrong, if it could be avoided, for a hunt to go over a corn field or a meadow.</P>

      <P>I come from a well-known hunting county, Kildare.  I do not think the Senator need be so very anxious about the question of trespassing on a corn field.  The people connected with drag hunting generally acquaint the farmers of the direction in which they are to go. <Col N="339" /> Generally it is the local farmers' sons who lay the drag, and they can easily do that so as to avoid damage to tilled fields or new meadows.  I agree that people who run drag hunts should avoid causing loss or annoyance to farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of it is to provide that at the season of the year where a permit was issued by the Ministry to certain people that these packs shall not be allowed across corn fields.  Tillage has been advocated for this country.  When the winter oats are in and the meadows are there are they to be run across just to please certain people in some parts of the country, for it is not in every area these hunts are carried on?  I am in favour of hunting, and were it not that there is so much of what I might call a tendency to treat the matter as a joke I would not have spoken at all. I intend to support the amendment.</P>

      <P>These drag hunts are an old form of sport in the country, and they provide the only amusement for the people in some districts.  The farmers have no objection to packs running over their lands.  I think it would be a great mistake to curtail the hunting season by a month. March is generally the month in which the hunting season is would up, and hunt meets in March are looked upon as the great hunting days of the year.  I hope the Seanad will do nothing that will interfere with this sport.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. Bagwell Mr. Bagwell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am of the same opinion as Senator Linehan, that it is extremely undesirable anybody should run a drag across fields when the season is so far advanced.  I hope the members of the Seanad will agree with him on that.  I would not vote for the amendment on that account, for there is more in the amendment than that.  I cannot believe that drag hunts are wilfully run over land where obviously harm can be done to any great extent. One part of the amendment would mean that the hunting season would be curtailed by a month, and that would be great harm to hunting and horse-breeding, and for that reason I could not support the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (4) When a game bird protection order has been made under this section, it shall not be lawful for any person while such order continues in force to kill or take any game bird of the species to which such order relates in any part of Saorstát Eireann to which such order applies without or otherwise <Col N="342" /> than in accordance with the permission of the Superintendent of the Gárda Síochána for the district in which such game bird is killed or taken: Provided always that if the Superintendent of the Gárda Síochána unreasonably objects or refuses to grant such permission the person so applying may appeal to the Minister against such neglect or refusal of the Superintendent of the Gárda Síochána to grant such permission and the Minister may grant permission to kill or take such game bird.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 6, sub-section (4).  To delete all after the word &ldquo;applies&rdquo; in line 60 down to the end of the sub-section.</P>
      <P>The amendment refers to the power given to the Minister by protection orders to prevent the killing of certain birds during certain periods.  Sub-section (4) of the section provides that the order may be modified if permission is granted by the superintendent of the Civic Guards.  I object entirely to bringing the Civic Guards into this matter. Their duties are onerous enough at present.  I am afraid the suggested legislation would put duties on them entirely foreign to those for which they were originally appointed.  I do not think Civic Guards should act as gamekeepers. In my opinion it is the duty of the owner of the game rights to appoint caretakers, and the most they can expect from the Civic Guards is protection. We have recently had examples of the very sad results of the attempt of the Civic Guards to protect game rights in the County of Cork and the County of Kerry, when two valuable lives were lost as the result of shooting by members of the Civic Guards who had taken up the duties of gamekeepers and bailiffs on certain estates.  I think as far as possible we should keep the Civic Guards out of this section, and leave it to the Minister to decide whether he should withdraw the order or not as he thinks fit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Seanad will accept the amendment for the reason stated by Senator Linehan. The Civic Guards have very onerous duties to perform in connection with the preservation of the public peace. It is not right that their functions should be extended so as to bring them into conflict with or in opposition to the farmers of the country. Senator Linehan referred to two regrettable incidents that occurred some time ago in the province of Munster.  I think this is the place in which those incidents should be referred to in calm, temperate and measured language.  In the County of Cork a farmer's son was shot during the night by a police officer. I am not going further into the circumstances of that incident, save to say that the man who was killed was apparently engaged in the poaching of fish in the river.  When that regrettable incident happened we all hoped that it would be the last, but in the County of Kerry some time ago another farmer's son was shot dead at night by a police officer, who apparently went alone, armed, while the poacher was not armed.  This poacher was also a farmer's son, and he was taking fish in a river that passed through his father's farm, a river in respect of which the sporting rights were reserved to the Congested Districts Board, on the understanding that they would be held in trust for the tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to say anything more about that, but this is the moral, I think, to be drawn from it, that the members of the Gárda Síochána, who have responsible duties to discharge in the preservation of the public peace in a time which some people may say is a difficult time, ought to be confined to their own duties and ought not to have imposed on them duties of this description.  I am sure that they do not desire them; I am sure that they are not trained for these duties.  If there is to be any preservation of game under this Bill or under any other Act, it should be the work of <Col N="344" /> regular gamekeepers, who would be under the protection of the police if necessary.  I think that this is a very wise amendment, and I ask the Seanad, without any question of party or anything else, to accept it.</P>

      <P>I do not know on what grounds Senator Comyn has come to the conclusion that this is a very wise amendment, because it must be perfectly obvious to every Senator that Senator Comyn has not read the section and has not got the remotest idea of what it is about.  What is the use of talking about this section making the Civic Guards gamekeepers?  It does nothing of the kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the meaning of it?  Here is a section which puts certain duties upon an officer of the Civic Guard.  Here is a section which allows an exemption from a protection order for certain purposes.  It does not make the officer of the Civic Guard a gamekeeper; it is the very opposite. Senator Comyn has failed either to read the section and the amendment or to understand it, and he then proceeds wantonly, as I put it, to attack the Civic Guards for what they have done in the preservation of fishery rights.  What has that got to do with this amendment?  What the section means is that in certain cases an order may be made that no game can be shot; but for the real preservation of game, there must be exceptions to that, that is to say, as I explained on the Second Reading and as I think anybody who knows anything about shooting will agree, old cock birds must be shot. That is necessary, and permission must be given to gamekeepers or to the owners of shooting  shoot off these birds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" /> Who is to give permission?  This Bill suggests that the local superintendent is the most likely person to give that permission.  He will see that it is necessary in certain circumstances, that even though the general shooting of birds is prohibited in a certain area, there must be exceptions.  Who is to decide whether there is to be an exception, as to whether a moor is overstocked, whether there are too many pheasants in a wood, or something of that kind?  The Bill suggests that it is to be the local superintendent, and if he unreasonably withholds that permission, there can be an appeal from him.  That is what the section provides.  The effect of the amendment would be this, that where a prohibition order on shooting has been made, that never in that area, under any circumstances and no matter how much it might be necessary, could there be any exemption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand the reason underlying this amendment. We do not preserve hares as things of beauty; we preserve them for sport.  The shooting of hares is sport: it may not be as sporting a form of sport as other forms of shooting: but it is sport.  Also if no hares were allowed to be shot anywhere, they would become a plague.  There are a great many parts of the country in which there is no coursing whatever, and there is no need to preserve hares for that purpose.  If hares are absolutely and entirely protected, they will be exceedingly detrimental to people's gardens and exceedingly detrimental to young trees.  In fact it would be necessary to shoot hares where there are young trees, and this would be an absolute protection for them.  I do not follow the amendment.</P>

      <P>In Kildare there are two coursing clubs which have been in existence for some time, one of them in Newbridge and the other in Naas, where there was coursing last week.  In my district, there is a game preserve of about 5,000 acres.  The farmers there have agreed to have their lands protected by the game protection association. After this year, unless the hares are either shot or taken, they will become a great nuisance to the young trees and to the crops.  Last week, some friends of mine got on order for 150 hares, at 15s. each, to be sent to a Western district where there are no hares, and they had them caught by nets, which is the only humane way of catching them. I think what underlies the amendment is that a great number of years ago when hares were very scarce they were afraid of everything; they were the most timid animals of all. There is a fable told about them that they were so timid that they made up their minds at one time to drown themselves, but in going towards the river they ran into a flock of sheep which ran away. They then came to the conclusion that there were animals more cowardly than themselves and they stayed on.  Unless hares are killed by shooting they will become a plague.  There were thirty-eight hares caught on a farm of ours last week and we were very glad to have them taken away.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already considered the point raised by Senator Bagwell.  It is possible that hares might become so numerous that they would be very injurious, but I see that Section 7 (3) states &ldquo;The Minister may, if he so thinks fit, on the application of the occupier of any land in a county or part of a county to which a hares protection order relates, exempt by writing under his hand for such time and on such conditions as he thinks fit such land or any part thereof from such order, and upon such exemption being so granted, such order shall not apply or relate to the land the <Col N="351" /> subject of such exemption so long as such exemption continues in force.&rdquo;  I take it that by that sub-section the occupier of land who finds that hares are too numerous on his land has only to apply to the Minister to get permission to destroy them or to reduce their number in any way which he wishes.  But I think that in the ordinary course of sport the shooting of a hare is an unmanly and unsportsmanlike proceeding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>To a certain extent Senator Linehan is right. Where there is a protection order made for hares, there may be an exemption from that for the purpose of protecting gardens or young plantations. But if the amendment were carried it would prevent in those circumstances a hare being shot at all.  In other words, if you were going to protect your garden you would have to protect it by trapping hares, or by some means other than shooting them, and most people would probably find that rather difficult.  In addition to that, there are certain places where there are a very large number of hares reared only for shooting purposes.  I myself knew at one time a very large demesne in my own county of Mayo where you could see hares running about by the score, I might almost say by the hundred, and where no dog was ever allowed in.  These hares had to be reduced in numbers from time to time, and the way in which they were reduced was by shooting.  If a person does rear hares for the purpose of shooting them, I think it would be rather unfair to prevent him from doing so.  Coursing people strongly object to the shooting of hares; they think it very bad form, but I think you must leave that to public opinion.  Let public opinion get to work in counties in which there is coursing.  In counties or parts of counties where coursing is not carried on, I think owners ought to be able to shoot hares if there interests require it.</P>

Persons authorised by a coursing club cannot go upon anyone's land unless they have permission from the owner of the land.  That has already been pointed out.  The wording of it&mdash;&ldquo;on land over which such club possesses the exclusive sporting rights&rdquo;&mdash;would not do either, because they might have the right to take hares and not have the right to shoot grouse, let us say.  In any case, as far as the spirit of it is concerned it is not necessary, because persons who belong to coursing clubs cannot trespass on anybody else's land under the provisions of this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the House is aware that there has been a campaign in progress for several years past in England to get rid of the netting of grouse, for two reasons. First of all, because the netting of grouse brings with it a small troupe of people who settle themselves down in between different grouse moors and make their living out of the netting of birds which fly across the grounds.  That is not so likely to happen in this country because it will be a long time before grouse increase sufficiently.  But my main reason is that the netting of grouse is an extraordinarily difficult thing <Col N="355" /> to carry out.  You need very high nets; you can only net grouse when they are flying from part of the moor to another or from their feeding grounds, in the early autumn when the corn is in stooks, back to the moor.  That must be done with very high nets, and in the process of netting, even when it is done by the most expert people, in many cases as many as five birds are injured to the one that is fit to take away, while at the best about thirty per cent. are injured.  There is no particular reason in this country to have netting for re-stocking, and if we want to re-stock we should get our birds from somewhere else.  I think netting is very undesirable and that we should delete the words &ldquo;or grouse&rdquo; from this section.</P>

    <P>I have brought forward this amendment in the interests of those persons in the Saorstát who breed hares in large numbers commercially for the supply of coursing clubs and for re-stocking.  There is no animal that needs more careful management when re-stocking than the hare. This can only be affected by netting. There are few people that this could <Col N="356" /> affect, and I think we could confidently leave it to the superintendent of the Gárda to discriminate as to the right people who would have permission to net hares.</P>

    <P>My amendment seeks to provide that the consent referred to in the sub-section shall be given after the passing of this Bill and that the consent shall not be that which had previously been given.  In some cases occupiers of land were waited upon by people who requested their signatures to certain legal documents by which the game rights on their holdings were given to these people.  To my knowledge these consents in many cases were signed without any consideration being given for them and when the occupiers had not the benefit of any legal advice.  I think it is desirable, in order to ensure that the consents were given willingly by the occupiers, that they should be given after the passing of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I would be willing to accept part of the amendment, that is to say, &ldquo;given in writing.&rdquo;  This section gives power where a game protection association have acquired shooting rights over land, for them to prosecute in the name of the secretary. That is all that it does.  It sets up a form of legal procedure.  I agree with the Senator that it would probably be better that that permit should be given in writing so that the writing could be produced in court.  I could not agree with the Senator that it ought to be after the passing of the Bill, because these game associations may have acquired rights before the passing of the Bill, may have got signatures in writing and deeds of assignment, and I do not think it would be fair to make them go to that trouble and expense again.  If anyone has got the worse of the bargain in that way with a game protection association, he has got his own remedy.  It is a voluntary licence, and he can probably revoke the licence.  If he has been tricked into it he can get it set aside.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the leave of the House to add certain words to the amendment which I originally sent to the Clerk.  I am afraid he was not able to read some of my writing.  He wrote to me to Kerry but I did not receive the letter in time to send on the words &ldquo;between the 15th of April and the 1st day of September.&rdquo; That is what I originally intended, and I regret I did not get them in in time.  My reasons for moving the amendment are that the present burning period is from the 1st of April to the 14th of July.  The 1st of April is slightly unnecessarily early because unless the weather is very fine in April I do not think you could have many grouse breeding then.  That date would give the farmer a chance of burning the heather in possibly the only dry time there is before the close season. On the other hand the 14th of July is very early to start burning a grouse mountain, because if you have a wet summer you will find a great many of the broods are lost, the grouse will pair again and even as late as the 12th August you will find birds so small that they are not fit to shoot, and people let them go. A great many people do not shoot <Col N="360" /> grouse in any quantity until the 1st of September.  I think the close season for burning would be very much better if these dates were adopted.  As to the question of burning, at present no burning whatever is allowed, but I have always been brought up in a school which believes that you should never issue an order which you are not quite certain you can have obeyed, and I do not think you will get this order obeyed in the mountainous districts where very few grouse breed.  Practically no grouse breed in the higher parts of my own county, and I think it would be advisable in the interests of public order if someone had power to give leave to burn in proper places. Presumably under Section 31 the Minister will make orders explaining to the superintendents of the Civic Guards under what conditions they would give permission and where it would be done.  The actual practice of giving permission would also help the tenant purchasers to realize how, when, and where to burn mountains, and the result would be that you would have many more grouse than there are to-day. I think permission to burn should be given in places where grouse do not breed as a rule, and also that the burning period should be altered as I suggest.</P>

Whoever owns the sporting rights throughout this country, the grazing rights belong to the farmer.  I have in my mind a part of the county Kerry, from Tralee to Ballyferriter, a distance of 30 miles, the Dingle Peninsula, where there are 20,000 sheep which are the main support of three or four hundred families.  These sheep cannot be sustained on the mountains unless the heather is burned periodically.  The farmers understand the method of burning the heather.  It appears that when heather grows for three or four years it is quite useless for sheep and for grouse.  It is necessary to burn it so that young grass will shoot up through the ashes in the patches which are burned, and that is the grass which provides nourishment for the sheep.</P>

      <P>There ought not to be. It is just as important for the preservation of game that the heather should be burned.  Grouse cannot live in old heather.  Therefore there ought not to be any difficulty in making an arrangement which would work out to the benefit of both.  I am inclined to think, knowing what I know&mdash;which is certainly not as much as Senator the McGillycuddy knows&mdash;that the provision he seeks is one that would work out satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>To a very large extent I agree that a certain amount of judicious heather burning is as necessary for grouse as for sheep.  I think there is this difference however, that grouse require two classes of heather, big heather for shelter and young heather for food, whereas sheep do not require big heather at all.  I think the judicious burning of heather from year to year would rather work both in the interests of the sheep and the grouse in the long run.  The only difficulty is one of time.  These are the dates I finally arrived at after consultation with a great number of persons who I understood were skilful in all respects, both as farmers and as persons interested in <Col N="364" /> game.  But I must honestly say that I have seen the greatest divergence of opinion.  As to the dates for burning, I do not think you can get any two persons to agree.  The only thing is to try to get a date that appears to meet with the views of the largest number.  From enquiries I have made it appears to me that the 1st of April would be about the best.  Though it may not be to some extent germane to this issue, it must be remembered that grouse are not the only birds that nest in the heather.  The section deals not only with heather but with gorse, furze, whin, heath and rushes, so that as well as the aristocratic grouse the sky-lark, wild duck or various other birds may have their nests destroyed. I would like the House to consider that.  I have a perfectly open mind in the matter.</P>

      <P>I am in a difficulty about the proposal in the sub-section and the amendment.  Taking Senator Comyn's view, that the rights over the land are owned by the tenant or occupier, I would wait for some sort of general law which would allow a superintendent of the Guards to come in and tell the farmer, no matter whether his land is growing whin, grass or corn, whether he should allow it to remain under grass, strikes me as being a rather revolutionary proposition.</P>

      <P>The principle of the Bill more or less incidentally is depriving the farmer of certain rights over his property, and the amendment proposes to deprive him of those rights, provided that the permission <Col N="365" /> of the Superintendent of the Guards can revoke the section. Surely that is a rather revolutionary change, and for it to be brought in, incidentally in a Bill of this kind, strikes me as rather a tall order.  I wonder whether the Minister for Agriculture, for instance, was consulted, and whether the representative of the peasant proprietors was consulted as to whether they are generally agreeable to the proposition that there should be a prohibition as to what they shall be allowed to grow on their lands.</P>

      <P>Section 28, sub-section (1). After the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; in line 51 to insert the words &ldquo;other than the owner or his agent.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this amendment will bring out the issue in a very clear form. The object of my amendment is to secure that the owner of the heather shall have the right to burn it whenever he likes.  There is a great difficulty about the burning of heather. Owing to the moisture of the climate in the South and West of Ireland it is not possible to burn it whenever one chooses.  There must be ten or fifteen days of perfectly dry weather before the heather will <Col N="367" /> take fire.  It is very difficult to get a dry week or fortnight in March, April or May.  It is frequently difficult to get it any time during the year, and in these Kerry mountains where there are no grouse and 20,000 sheep I suggest to the Senate that the small farmers who have to make a living by grazing sheep should not be hampered.  Senator Brown said there were two persons interested.  Where the sporting rights are vested in the tenant purchasers there is no person interested except the tenant purchasers.</P>

      <P>On their own holdings, but the way the mountains are arranged is that nine, ten, fifteen or twenty tenants on the lowlands have the grazing on a mountain.  The grazing of the mountain is worthless to them unless they can burn the heather.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>But they do not own it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>They do own it.  If they do not own it I do not cover them.  My submission is that they do own it.  Where the sporting rights are vested in the tenants no person can interfere with them. There is the other case put up by Senator Brown, which perhaps Senator Johnson did not consider; that is the case where the tenant purchaser owns the land in fee-simple. From the centre of the earth to the highest point in the sky the heather and all belongs to the tenant.  In that case the former landlord may have sporting rights, but these sporting rights are subject to the rights of the tenant and these are the rights I wish to preserve. The place I have in mind is a stretch of country from 20 to 30 miles long, where there are no grouse.  Are you to prevent the farmers of Kerry from burning heather on the Dingle mountain and the Brandon mountain <Col N="368" /> in order to provide feeding for sheep?</P>
      <P>I suggest for the consideration of the House that the amendment which I now propose is a reasonable one. This matter escaped notice in the Dáil, but Senators now have the opportunity of making this amendment to the Bill.  I suggest it is a reasonable amendment, and that it will do no harm to anybody.</P>

In order that as little inconvenience as possible may be caused to farmers, I suggest it would be <Col N="369" /> advisable to have the date the 1st May.  I am as much in favour of the preservation of game as anybody, but I see that in an earlier part of the Bill the Minister has power to issue a prohibition order against the destruction of nests. Therefore this amendment of mine would not in any way interfere with the nesting of grouse.  It would simply provide for cases where you have stretches of mountains where there are no grouse, where there are no nests of grouse or of any other wild birds.  The adoption of the amendment would, I think, afford facilities to the farmer for farming his land to the best advantage, and I leave the matter at that.</P>

      <P>Section 28, sub-section (1). After the word &ldquo;lands&rdquo; in line 54 to insert the words &ldquo;where grouse usually nest.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I hope that this amendment will not be lost.  The object of it is to secure that grouse and other wild birds shall be absolutely protected, and at the same time that farmers shall not be injured.  The section, if amended by the insertion of these words, will then read:</P>
      <P>(1) It shall not be lawful for any person to burn or otherwise destroy between the 1st day of April and the 14th day of July (both days inclusive) in any year any gorse, furze, whin, heath, fern or greg-ling growing on any lands where grouse usually nest not then cultivated or in course of cultivation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the object of the Bill is to protect grouse and game generally, then I should say that the only game that nests in heather are grouse.  The amendment, I think, would meet what I have in mind, namely, the protection of the interests of the farmers and the protection of the interests of sportsmen.  The amendment would protect both sets of people.  They seem to be in conflict, but I do not know why they should be.  My idea is that the farmers, if they are properly treated, will be the best preservers of game, and I think something should be done to avoid any resentment which farmers might feel by reason of the provisions of this Bill.  This resentment can possibly be avoided if the Bill itself is reasonable.  It will prevent, if you like, the burning of heather or gorse or anything else where grouse usually nest, but why should you prevent that on mountains where a grouse has not been seen for twenty years and will not, I presume, be seen for the next twenty years?  Why <Col N="371" /> should a farmer be handicapped in a case like that?  I put the amendment to the wisdom of the House without any further comment.</P>

      <P>I think this is a dangerous amendment, because it starts by giving permission to burn in the close season. Senator Comyn told the House a great deal about the rights of the farmer and the rights of the game owner, but I think that the State has a concern in both.  As the State has a concern in both, I think it should make quite sure that the permission given by the Gárda Síochána will be sufficient.  I do not think there should be any burning, as suggested, in the close season.  It is very difficult to find where grouse usually nest.  If one asks a man who wants to burn he will be assured that, in the memory of man, no grouse has ever been seen within twenty miles of that particular place, and I think that is where the danger comes in in the case of this amendment.</P>

You could possibly never go into court and prove that birds usually nest in a particular place.

      <P>I move amendment 19:</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 31 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>31.&mdash;(1) The Minister may <Col N="372" /> establish by order a Consultative Council for the purpose of giving advice and assistance to the Minister in connection with any matter in relation to the making of regulations under, or otherwise carrying into execution, the provisions of this Act, or any other matter affecting the preservation and propagation of game or any other matter affecting the game industry.</P>
    <P>(2) The said Consultative Council, if and when appointed, shall consist of such persons (being persons having experience or special knowledge in relation to the matters on which the Council may give advice or assistance to the Minister) as the Minister shall from time to time nominate to be members thereof, and shall include representatives of both Houses of the Oireachtas and of the General Council of Country Councils.</P>
    <P>(3) Each member of the said Consultative Council shall, unless he previously dies or resigns, retain his membership for two years only from the date of his nomination, but shall be eligible for renomination.</P>
    <P>(4) The said Consultative Council shall meet whenever summoned by the Minister and also on such occasions as the Council may from time to time determine.</P>
    <P>(5) Payments may be made by the Minister out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas to the members of the said Consultative Council and Committees thereof to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance in respect of repayment of travelling expenses and payment of subsistence allowance.</P>
    <P>I think that on the Second Reading of the Bill I made my reasons clear for the acceptance of an amendment of this nature, and therefore I do not propose to repeat what I said then.  With regard to what I said on that occasion there was some criticism made which I desire to dispute. The Minister, speaking presumably <Col N="373" /> for the Executive Council, and Senator Bagwell, speaking for himself, deprecated the suggestion that I made on that occasion, that this was a nascent and struggling industry, and that it should be given some sort of State assistance. I think that both the Minister and Senator Bagwell must be taken as putting forward the view that this was a matter for individual enterprise only and not one in which the State should ever interfere.  I think if we review the general trend of the policy followed by the Government with regard to other industries it will be seen that the Minister's view on this particular question is only his own and Senator Bagwell's <i>laissez faire</i> idea of national development cannot, I believe, appeal to the House.  We are a struggling community with a small national income.  I believe that we should examine every possible means in the direction of increasing and improving our national income.  I feel that until some co-operative body, such as I suggest in this amendment, is available for the purpose of examining ways and means that progress in the development of the game industry will be very slow indeed.  I think that the tendency of the age is towards co-operative work on the part of experts rather than that of individual effort, and that it requires in these days supermen to succeed.</P>
    <P>I wish the House to bear in mind that I am not asking for the return of the money which has been taken out of the game industry in the last eight years, but simply for the setting up of a consultative body which will form the necessary link with our present legislation, a body that will examine the efficiency of that legislation, will receive reports as to its working and devote its energies to devising improvements in the Act itself, in the light of the working of the Act and of the operation of game laws elsewhere.  The Minister assured us that this Bill was not the last word in the matter of game preservation. I would like to remind the House that the Fishery Act passed in 1925 called for an amending measure almost immediately. <Col N="374" /> The drafting of that Bill has been under consideration for the last two years, but it has not yet seen the light in the other House.  There was one other point, I think, that exercised the mind of the Minister, and that was as regards the composition of the committee which I propose. The committee, no matter how constituted, will not satisfy everybody. I do not suggest that a committee composed on the lines that I have outlined in my amendment will go as far as it is possible to go in the direction of getting together a suitable one, or towards advancing the interests of the large man and the small man.  The wording of the amendment before the House is somewhat similar to that contained in the Live Stock Breeding Act, except that I have somewhat weakly substituted the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;  I do not see how the insertion of this amendment can in any way harm the Bill.  I believe that a committee like this may be of the greatest possible assistance, and I hope that no honeyed words from the Minister will persuade the House to do anything except record an opinion in its favour.</P>

      <P>I would like to support the amendment.  I do not wish to suggest that it is necessary to bring about the requirements by payment except, perhaps, that it arises from gun licences or other such source of income.  Even so, a committee is a longer-lived thing than an individual who tries personally to develop the game resources of the country.  This committee will not cut across the efforts of the Executive Council.  It will be more or less an aid to them.  It can do no harm, but it would do a certain <Col N="375" /> amount of good, and as it has the opportunity of proving its enthusiasm without payment I would support it if it does not put a tax on the Central Fund, or any other moneys arising.  I think a committee of sportsmen would do much for sport. When we consider the lack of support for carrying out the Censorship Act we find there is very little enthusiasm as regards that, but this is a matter for sportsmen, and they are in a position to do work which is very necessary.  I think that with the proviso that it does not cost the country anything the Minister will have little difficulty in accepting the amendment.  The attention of the Executive Council cannot be focussed on small enterprises, whereas a consultative committee would constantly interest itself and do much good in the preservation of game.  Such a committee would be drawn from different parts of the country, and would have an interest in the matter that could not be expected from the Executive Council.</P>

It is primarily, and in fact altogether, an amendment of the game laws.  Here you have got two entirely new principles, and this section is going to be a dead letter or it is going to do some work.  You have come to a new principle, that is a direct fostering of the game industry by the State. Senator McGillycuddy of the Reeks seemed to put forward the view that I had expressed myself as being against fostering by the State of a <Col N="376" /> struggling industry, or the development by the State of State resources. I think you will find it very hard to get any statement of that nature by me, but I did say, and I still am of opinion, that this question of the fostering of the game industry, if I might put it in that way, in this country is one which will want to be considered.</P>
      <P>The attitude that I think any Government will take up must be greatly influenced by the way in which this Game Bill works, and by the efforts which are made by persons in this country to really develop the breeding of game, but if a Government grant were given to develop game I would point out to the House that the work in connection with that could not be done by my Department with the assistance of the consultative council.  It would have to be done by a Department which has experience of the development of industrial resources.  It would have to go under the Department of Agriculture, or a Department of that kind.  My Department has not got the outdoor staff, to begin with, and it is not at all germane to the work carried out by my Department that we should set to work to develop a particular industry. That would have to be done by one of the departments which is cognisant with such work and in the habit of developing industries.  I do not think a consultative committee would be any good, and in fact it might prove harmful.</P>

      <P>According to the title of the Bill the amendment is germane to the question. The Bill is entitled &ldquo;an Act to make better provision for the pre servation of game and for that purpose to make provision for the control of game dealers and for other matters incidental or conducive to the preservation of game.&rdquo;  The suggestion is not a new principle.  It is applied in connection with the National Monuments and the Live Stock Breeding Act.  Why not allow it here?  There will undoubtedly be some little cost in connection with <Col N="377" /> meetings of the Committee, and, as I said, expenses of a similar kind have been allowed in other directions. The Minister used the word &ldquo;grant.&rdquo;  I said as clearly as I could that I am not looking for a grant.  I want to disabuse the minds of the House of the idea that I make any such claim.  With regard to the work being assigned to a particular department, surely we find the Minister for Fisheries asking for advice elsewhere when he is in a particular difficulty?  I think the Minister for Justice is not so ignorant as he would have us believe of the shooting of game, and he would be perfectly qualified to carry out this particular proposal.  I press the amendment on the House.</P>

Under Article 37 of the Constitution money shall not be appropriated by vote, resolution or law unless the purpose of the appropriation has in the same session been recommended by a message from the Governor-General on the advice of the Executive Council. There is no distinction between the powers of the Seanad and the Dáil in relation to the insertion of a money clause in non-money Bills, provided that there had been the necessary message.  The Seanad could insert an amendment of the kind in the Bill.  If the Executive Council accept the amendment, and so advise the Dáil, they can advise the Governor-General to send an appropriate message, or, if necessary, an amended message.  This is in accordance with a ruling by my predecessor, and I agree with it, and it has never been challenged.</P>

In providing for the issue of hunting permits and giving recognition to the societies named, the Minister will have to incur some expense in his office.  He probably will have to keep a register of the people to <Col N="379" /> whom he has issued permits and lists of recognised coursing clubs.

      <P>After the words &ldquo;wild duck&rdquo; in column 1 to insert the words &ldquo;and brent goose, barnacle goose, and other species of wild goose.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This affects very much the part of the country from which I come, particularly on account of the huge sloblands which there are in County Wexford, and I suppose that it affects other parts of the country as well.  It is most necessary to have these species of wild goose included for the reason that if they are not it will be impossible to protect other game which are now game birds, such as teal and widgeon.  If you allow people to go into these slobs and shoot geese you will not be able to protect the other birds, and the people in these particular places who are most concerned are anxious that geese shall be included in the Game Bill.</P>

But I am positively certain that I am voicing the opinion of a great number of snipe-shooters who live both in the West and in the East when I say that snipe are not fit to shoot, and certainly not fit to eat, until the 15th of October.

      <P>I am in the hands of the House.  I do not think I need say very much about this amendment, but, as Senator Butler is here, perhaps I had better say a few words in relation to the thrush and the blackbird.  They are very numerous in and about the city of Dublin, and they have been numerous in that area for a very long time.  There is a place-name in the south of Dublin, which I am sure Senator Gogarty is very well aware of, which takes its name from the thrush&mdash;Glenasmole &mdash;the glen of the thrushes.  I think that shows that thrushes have been very numerous in and about Dublin for ages.  I am sorry to say that they are not so numerous in the West, because they are most useful birds. The Minister for Justice would tell you on another Bill that the green plover is very useful in destroying the snail which acts as the host of the fluke which destroys sheep.  How a soft-billed bird can do that I do not know, but I am not in a position to contradict the Minister.  I can say this, however, with regard to the thrush, that I have seen thrushes of all kinds take these white snails, carry them away, break them against stones, and devour the contents.  In that way they are very useful in preventing fluke in the West of Ireland, and I would ask the House to include thrushes of all kinds as birds which <Col N="385" /> should come within the terms of the schedule for special protection.  The blackbird is in the same position as the thrush.  I am sure that I need not emphasise the necessity for protecting finches of all kinds; they do very little harm, they are song birds, and I do not think that anybody would be in favour of denying them this additional protection.  Next comes the heron&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it would save time if I said that I am just as anxious as Senator Comyn to get as many birds into the Schedule as can reasonably be got into it because it will give them this particular protection, that they may not be shot by the owner or the occupier of land during the close time, and that if they are shot the penalties are much heavier.  Therefore, I do not object to having them put in.  The more birds I can get into the First Schedule the better.  I would like the Senator to address himself for a moment to the blackbird.  The object is not to have any bird in the First Schedule which is really destructive to fruit or food.</P>

The stonehammer is a small white-backed bird, and is very numerous in certain parts of the country.  It does no harm and I think it should be included.  If that bird is included in the First Schedule I cannot recognise it.</P>

      <P>I stand for the whole amendment.  Then there is the swallow.  I am very glad to say that that bird is now very numerous in the west of Ireland.  It is protected &mdash;I will not say by the superstition of the people, but by the reverence of the people.  It is the favourite of poets and peasants.  Nobody would kill a swallow, and I hope the House will accept it as being entitled to special protection.  Next comes the swift, then thrushes of all kinds, and tits of all kinds, including the tom-tit.  If any one has any objection to the inclusion of these birds in the schedule the objection can be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Bryan Mahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Comyn in respect of all the birds he has mentioned, but especially in reference to the peregrine falcon.  I had the good luck to live for some years in a country where falconry is still carried on.  It is probably the oldest sport in the world, and up to the beginning of the 18th century was very much practised in Ireland.  The peregrine falcon was a bird that was very plentiful in Ireland in the past, and Irish falcons were supposed to be the best in Europe, and were sought for from all over Europe.  It is probably the gamest, the bravest, and the most sporting bird that flies.  The falcon is scarce in Ireland now, but is to be found in the west wherever there are mountains.  Probably there are a few in the Wicklow mountains and in other places.  It does very little harm.  It may kill an odd grouse or partridge, but it will only kill a bird on the wing.  It is not like carrion birds that rob nests and take the young; it will only kill a bird on the wing for food.  Anyone who has seen the sport of falconry would, I think, support this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I favour the inclusion of the peregrine falcon.  The principal reason why that bird should be preserved is its increasing scarcity.  A scarce bird is in more danger of being shot than any other bird.  The peregrine falcon should also be preserved for its beauty.  If there are birds for which it has a special liking they are wood-pigeons, and what is known as the grey crow, two most mischievous birds, so that in doing away with them he is doing good.  The grey crow is also called the scald crow, and he is very mischievous. I was very interested in Senator Sir Bryan Mahon's remarks about the peregrine falcon.  I think the Normans introduced the sport of hawking into Ireland.  Giraldus Cambrensis tells us that his brother flew the first hawk in this island.  A Deputy in the other House remarked, when speaking about the wild geese, that they were historic birds.  I think the peregrine falcon is a very historic bird.  In former <Col N="389" /> times when falconry was practised in Ireland the falcons bred in the Great Saltee Island, and falcons from that island were greatly prized; they were even sent as presents to kings and emperors in various parts of the world.  I hope the few falcons that are left will be preserved.</P>

      <P>Amongst the birds that Senator Comyn proposed to include in the First Schedule are some birds that are decidedly harmful.  I refer principally to the blackbird and the thrush.  The blackbird in particular does a great amount of injury to orchards.  I have in my mind two orchards, devoted mainly to growing cherries.  I know the proprietor of one, and in the spring when the cherries are ripe he has to keep a man with a gun for several weeks to keep these birds away, particularly blackbirds and thrushes.</P>

      <P>I would gladly put them all in, but my reason for thinking that the blackbird ought to be excluded is that there is no doubt he is a very harmful bird.  Personally I think he is worth his food, but I am rather afraid that he will probably be knocked out in the other House.  I would be quite willing to accept the whole list otherwise.</P>
