      <P>I beg to propose:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, in view of the fact that the Ports and Harbours Tribunal has not yet reported, the Second Stage of the Cork Harbour Bill, 1927, be further postponed until the 10th day of April, 1930, or, if the Seanad be not sitting on that day, until the next day thereafter on which the Seanad shall sit.</P>

      <P>I rise to open this question about an adjournment.  The vacancies in our harbours are more important than the vacancy in the Seanad, so that I trust the House will bear with me in making a few remarks before the election.  I do not know what Committee or Commission is meeting for whose findings this Private Bill is being delayed, but I know that I would be out of order if I discussed the Bill on its merits.</P>

      <P>But I may say this, that it is the usual thing when traffic falls off to double freights; in other words, to double the cost to meet falling traffic.  We have that in every form of transport in this country. As far as the naturally supreme position that this country holds in the Atlantic in its relations with America goes we might as well be a mud bank in the Mersey.  The Cork Harbour Bill is held up for a Commission whose findings will probably not deal with our harbours from a national standpoint, and I very much wish to emphasise the fact that no Commission and no body in this country seems to realise the urgent and paramount importance of opening our ports.  A country is fed by its ports, and a country is starved by a tax on its ports.  There is not a single Irish shipping company that brings enough into one of the Irish ports to pay its harbour dues.  There are certain proposals to make Dublin a free port in order to evade the competition which the opening of ports on the western seaboard would bring about.  These are questions that I trust this Commission will consider if it is a national Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3" /> There is one thing that is not in this Cork Harbour Bill, and as it is not there I suppose I can discuss it without discussing the merits of the Bill.  It is the matter of the air.  A certain external air service was approached by the Cork Corporation to link up Cork with the Continent, but that air service, not being British, was warned off Cork.  Now that is the position.  We are marooned on the high seas and we are curtailed in the air, and it is not an external Power that is doing this. There is no body of men so interested in Ireland that they will starve Ireland, because they know there are men in Ireland with so little vision that they will allow Ireland to starve. Until we come out into the Atlantic we are no better than a mud bank in the Mersey.  That is a matter I want to work up about this Bill.  I have nothing to say against the Bill. I wish Cork were a free port.  It is pre-eminently situated for one, and it is already half of one through Ford's enterprise.  But I do not wish Bills like this to be postponed until the 10th of next April, while the urgent position of the whole country's services and the revenue of the Government is at stake through the non-development of our ports.  In the old days we thought that the British deliberately failed to develop a decent harbour by having no railway to it.  There are some of the greatest harbours in Europe without any railways&mdash;Blacksod, Galway, and Foynes, or any other estuary you like to mention.  That was a condition of affairs that could be remedied.  It has not been remedied now that the British have gone, and it will not be remedied by footy little Bills like this and vague postponements. I do not believe much in commissions, but until there is a national recognition of the fact that we have a supreme position in the Atlantic, that everybody in this country is dependent on the cheapness of food and for employment on these harbour dues, that you can be cut off from the world through harbours, <Col N="4" /> there will be no improvement. We do not own a single harbour in this country as regards development.</P>
    <P>The harbour at Dún Laoghaire is a national harbour in so far as the British Government in its foresight thought fit to build that harbour and hand it over to one railway&mdash;the London North Western.  The British Government handed it over to one of their own independent railways because it connected up this country with England, and they gave a monopoly of traffic to that British railway. We with our harbours have not yet provided any opening to foreign shipping, and as I have already told you, in spite of the enterprise of Cork men, a firm of Continental air lines was warned off.  Our position in the seas is useless, and our position in the air is beginning to be curtailed.</P>

      <P>I think the object of the motion is quite clearly set out in the motion itself.  It says that: &ldquo;In view of the fact that the Ports and Harbours Tribunal has not yet reported, the Second Stage of the Cork Harbour Bill, 1927, be further postponed.&rdquo;  That ought to be a sufficient reason for the postponement of the Bill until next April, because the Ports and Harbours Tribunal has spent a great deal of time in going round to all the ports. Cork included, and taking evidence as to what changes should be made.</P>

      <P>The next business is the election of a Senator to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Senator Sir Nugent Everard.  The following is the list of candidates duly nominated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Patrick Joseph Brady, &ldquo;Glena,&rdquo; Booterstown, Co. Dublin.  Qualifications: Former member of the Seanad.  Nominators: Senators P. J. Hooper and James Moran.</P>
      <P>Richard Andrew Butler, Pope's Hall, Skerries, Co. Dublin.  Qualifications: Farmer; President of the Irish Farmers' Union.  Nominators: Senators John J. Counihan and M.F. O'Hanlon.</P>
      <P>Major-General Sir George McKenzie Franks, K.C.B., Ballyscaddane, Knocklong, Co. Limerick.  Qualifications: Landowner and farmer; interested in questions of national development.  Nominator: Senator Sir William Hickie.</P>
      <P>Michael Joseph Staines, 235 North Circular Road, Dublin.  Qualifications: Active member of Irish Volunteer Executive from inception to truce; Quartermaster-General, 1916-20; T.D., 1918-23; Alderman, Dublin Corporation, 1920-24; Wholesale Merchant. Nominator: Senator Francis Mac-Guinness.</P>
      <P>The result of the first ballot was: Butler, 28; Brady, 17; Franks, 17; and Staines, 16.</P>

      <P>There is a tie between Mr. Brady and Major-General Franks.  A precedent has been established as regards a matter of this nature.  When a similar position arose my predecessor asked the House to assist him in the matter by a directing vote.  I would ask the House to do the same for me&mdash;to take a vote between Mr. Brady and Major-General Franks.  That would be an easier position for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A poll was then taken between Mr. Brady and Major-General Franks, in which Major-General <Col N="6" /> Franks received 24 votes and Mr. Brady 21.</P>

    <P>The following motion stood on the Order Paper in the name of Senator Sir John Keane:</P>
    <P>That in the opinion of the Seanad the terms of compensation to be paid to such permitted undertakings as may be acquired by the Electricity Supply Board should be referred to arbitration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to say that the House will not be troubled with this motion, as I understand that the Electricity Supply Board has consented in principle to its terms, and that the matter is now going to arbitration as to price and compensation in the event of failure to agree.  I do hope that this arbitration may be retrospective, and may be allowed to embrace those undertakings that already agreed in the matter of price, because I think they agreed in some cases rather under a misapprehension, and certainly if they had ever felt that arbitration was likely to come they would have held their hands.  Some of them were very much pressed, I understand, for funds and agreed, in a way, in the face of such pressure.  I hope, therefore, that this arbitration will cover all undertakings that are to be, or that have been acquired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the acquisition of what are described as non-statutory undertakings was debated at very great length at the time of the introduction of the Electricity Supply Bill, and I might say that the case that was put by the Minister&mdash;the policy of the Government in the matter&mdash;will be <Col N="7" /> found on page 1730 of the Dáil Debates, 27th April, 1927.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said:</P>
      <P>I come here to-night with an amendment which states that we will leave every unauthorised undertaker operating.  We insist that he be allowed to operate, that he must get a permit and that the permit cannot be withheld or withdrawn.  The only case where he can disappear is where he makes an agreement with the Board as to the price to be paid...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the situation when the Bill was introduced.  The Minister stands by that.  The unauthorised undertakers are protected by that statement.  They are in exactly the same strong position that they were in at the time he introduced the Bill and when it passed into law.  Their case is no better and no worse by reason of the acceptance of what Senator Sir John Keane states to be the arbitration proceedings.  They cannot be acquired except with their own consent.  They had an absolute right to be regarded as undertakers. The Board could not withhold permission to them to be regarded as undertakers, and they can only be acquired by their own consent.  At the time the Minister could not go <Col N="8" /> any further than to outline that particular position for the undertakers. He was unable to get such information as would enable him to introduce a clause settling the matter beyond dispute in that measure.  It was his intention, as soon as the Electricity Supply Board was set up, to give them power to get the information he required, and it was then his intention to introduce legislation later if it were not found possible to effect a settlement by agreement.  This particular agreement on the part of the Electricity Supply Board does not place them in any better or any worse position.  The Minister's case can be summarised in this way.  If the unauthorised undertakers are satisfied with the arrangement come to&mdash;that is to have the matter settled by arbitration&mdash;legislation may not be necessary, but the Minister wishes it to be clearly understood that it is the intention of the Act that unauthorised undertakers are entitled to a settlement by agreement or further legislation, and he is prepared to introduce this further legislation if necessary.</P>
