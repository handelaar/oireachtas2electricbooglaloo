    <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2 (1).</P>
    <P>(1)  Whenever a vacancy occurs in the membership of Seanad Eireann by the death, resignation, or disqualification of a member thereof the Clerk of the Seanad shall, on the direction of Seanad Eireann, send to the Minister notice (in this Act referred to as notice of a casual vacancy) in writing of such vacancy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 1:</P>
      <P>Section 2, sub-section (I)&mdash;To add at the end of the sub-section the words: &ldquo;and a requisition that it shall be filled in accordance with the provisions of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The explanation for the amendment lies in this, that the Bill, to the ordinary reader who is not closely analytical, would appear to reverse the procedure that has hitherto held, and to place the Minister in a predominant position in regard to the filling of a vacancy in the Seanad.  In the analogous case of filling a vacancy in the Dáil, the procedure is that the House orders that a writ shall be issued.  The actual work is initiated by a formal decision of the Dáil, the Clerk of the House calling upon the Returning Officer to proceed with the election. It is quite clear that the proposals in this Bill make some variations necessary from the procedure followed in the Dáil.  While I do not think there is any intention whatever to make any change in the relative positions of the Seanad and the Minister, there does appear, on the surface at any rate, to be a change in the emphasis that is laid in sub-section (1).  We have the provision that the Clerk of the Seanad shall send notice to the Minister, in writing, when a vacancy has occurred, but I ask Senators to note that that depends upon the direction of the <Col N="183" /> Seanad.  These few words, &ldquo;on the direction of Seanad Eireann,&rdquo; seem to fit in rather casually.  Then, after the notice has been received by the Minister, the Minister shall, by order, direct an election to be held.</P>
    <P>I think that, in actual fact, the initiating of the election procedure depends upon these words &ldquo;on the direction of Seanad Eireann.&rdquo;  In my view that is not definite enough, and is inclined perhaps to create a precedent which would be unfortunate. It seems to me to leave the work of ordering an election for the filling of a vacancy in the Seanad to the Minister and not to the Seanad itself.  I think if one were drafting the Bill with that idea in mind, the Bill would have to be redrafted very thoroughly in quite a number of particulars. I have not thought the matter of that great importance and urgency that it justifies such a radical change in the form of the Bill.  It has been thought that the predominant position of the Seanad in the matter will be provided for if we insert the words set down in the amendment&mdash;&ldquo;and a requisition and that it shall be filled in accordance with the provisions of this Act,&rdquo; emanating from the Seanad in those directing words.  The purpose of the amendment is, therefore, to make quite clear that the Seanad is the initiating authority in the matter and not the Minister.</P>

      <P>As suggested by you, sir, the other day there were a number of Senators anxious to discuss this matter with me.  I have discussed the matter with them.  As far as I am concerned as a lay draftsman, I have no objection to Senator Johnson's amendment.  If the amendment meets with the approval of the Seanad generally, I have no objection to accepting it.  The matter, however, has been discussed with the Parliamentary draftsman, and he suggests that, instead of Senator Johnson's amendment, an amendment like the one I am about to read <Col N="184" /> would harmonise more with his professional outlook on this matter.  The amendment reads:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) page 2, line 27, to insert after the word &ldquo;thereof&rdquo; the words &ldquo;in order to cause such vacancy to be filled.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As I have said Senator Johnson's amendment is quite satisfactory from my point of view, but the Parliamentary draftsman suggests this amendment.  If it meets with the approval of Senator Johnson and of Senators generally, I suggest that it should be accepted in substitution for the amendment moved by the Senator.</P>

      <P>I am inclined to think that it meets with their approval.  The question really is: by what authority is the machinery to be started for the filling of a vacancy in the Seanad?  If the draft amendment read by the Minister puts that authority in the hands of the Seanad, as I think it does, then I think the suggested amendment is satisfactory.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>No objection made by the Seanad returning officer himself or to him by any other person to any nomination paper on the ground that the statement therein <Col N="185" /> of the name, address, description, or qualifications of the candidate thereby nominated is insufficient or is not in compliance with this Act shall be allowed or deemed valid unless the same is made before twelve o'clock noon on the last day for receiving nominations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 2:</P>
      <P>Section 6, sub-section (3).  To delete in lines 53-4 the words &ldquo;twelve o'clock noon&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;two o'clock in the afternoon.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is, perhaps, of not very great importance, but yet it would seem to me, notwithstanding advice to the contrary, that it is desirable that if any person is entitled to make an objection to a nomination paper on the grounds that the name, address, description or qualifications of the candidate are insufficient, or not in compliance with the Act, that a period should elapse between the close of the nomination hour and the last moment for making an objection.  As the Bill stands the nomination papers must be handed in before twelve o'clock noon.  That is under sub-section (1). But under sub-section (3) any objection on the grounds that I have stated shall not be deemed to be valid or be allowed unless handed in also before twelve o'clock on the same day.  One can see that nomination papers may be handed in at one minute to twelve o'clock.  If there is any justification in providing for an objection being allowed by anyone at all to the returning officer, it seems to me inevitable that some time should elapse between the closing hour and the period within which an objection may be laid.  I suggest the hour of two o'clock, but that is a matter of no moment.  I raise the point because it seems to me to be a defect in the drafting of the Bill if there is any justification at all for allowing objections to be raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out to Senators the distinction between sub-section (2) of Section 6, <Col N="186" /> which deals with objections on matters of substance, and sub-section (3) of the same section, which deals with objections on matters of form. Sub-section (2) reads:</P>
      <P>(2)  Between the hours of 10 o'clock in the forenoon and one o'clock in the afternoon on the last day for receiving nominations the Seanad returning officer shall, at the place mentioned in the foregoing sub-section, make such objections as he shall think fit to any nomination paper duly delivered to him and consider such objections to any such nomination paper as shall there and then be made to him by any person law fully present and shall rule on the validity of every such nomination paper.</P>
      <P>The persons lawfully entitled to be present are the candidates themselves, and one other person nominated by each candidate.  Therefore, under sub-section (2) there is one clear hour for acting after the close of the nomination in the case of persons lawfully entitled to be present who desire to make objections on matters of substance.  (Sub-section (3) read.)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, sub-section (2) deals with objections as regards matters of substance, while sub-section (3) deals with objections on matters of form.  I submit to Senators that it is undesirable, after the time for nominations has closed, that the period should be extended so that objections could be allowed on mere matters of form.  If there is an objection on matters of substance there is a period of an hour inside which the objection can be made. Suppose there was a small error in the name, address or qualifications of a candidate&mdash;I mean the qualifications which an article of the Constitution requires candidates for the Seanad to have&mdash;I think no one would desire that on a mere matter of form of that kind, and where the nominations had closed, that the person should be disqualified.  I submit that the hour that is allowed for objections of substance is, in practice, quite sufficient and requires no extension. <Col N="187" /> If we were to extend the hour in sub-section (3) beyond 12 o'clock, which is the hour fixed for the closing of nomination papers, it might easily result in the disqualification of a perfectly qualified candidate because some technical error had been made in the filling up of the nomination paper.</P>

It would not, I think, be desirable to have a Constitution Amending Bill and an Electoral Bill hanging over.  If it were not straining the Standing Orders of the Seanad very much, I would ask that this Bill and Constitution (Amendment No. 11) Bill be taken in their final stages tomorrow, so that both could be reported to the Dáil before the adjournment on Friday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to make better provision for the preservation of game.  I do not think that I need take up the time of the House in stating the great economic advantage it would be to this country if that undeveloped asset of ours, the possibility of making this a great shooting country, could be carried out.  No doubt it would bring a very large number of wealthy persons to this country. The farmers to whom the ownership of their lands has now passed, would find that in the game upon their lands they had an asset which might be availed of in the way of considerably increasing their means.  This Bill enlarges the number of birds which hitherto have been known as game birds.  Up to this the only game birds practically were pheasants, grouse and partridge.  Under this Bill, the following are now made game birds: pheasant, partridge, grouse, quail, landrail, plover, snipe, and woodcock and also mallard, teal, widgeon, and other species of wild duck, brent goose, barnacle goose, or other species of wild goose. The Bill also settles the close season for game.  Senators will notice that the first period of the year on which there can now be any shooting is the 12th August.  Up to this, you could shoot duck in part of the country as well as snipe, plover, teal and widgeon on the 1st August. <Col N="189" /> That date has now been moved back to the 12th August.  That is to prevent people going out, ostensibly let us say, to shoot wild duck when, in fact, they were going out to shoot grouse before the opening of the grouse season.</P>
      <P>The first Schedule to the Bill gives the dates with regard to the close season for the various classes of game.  Power is also given to the Minister for Justice for the time being to declare that for a period of the year, which can be extended, no game of a particular class shall, except on licence, be shot in a particular area.  The object of that is to allow game that are natural in this country, or which may be artificially reared or imported into the country either by game preservation societies or by private individuals, to increase and multiply.  On the other hand, there must be a provision that certain classes of persons should be authorised to shoot certain kinds of game, because it is a well known fact that you must have only a limited number of cock pheasants in proportion to hen pheasants.  It is very well known also that old grouse are deadly enemies of young grouse and that they go around exterminating them.  Therefore, if the Act were not to defeat its own object it is necessary to give persons leave to shoot unnecessary cock pheasants and unnecessary old grouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hares are also protected under this Bill.  Certain coursing societies are recognised for the purpose of carrying out coursing under the authorised rules of coursing.  These societies are getting special powers under the Bill for the trapping of hares.  Otherwise the trapping and destruction of hares is not allowed. It is also made illegal to kill any game birds at night except duck and wild geese.  Game birds can only be netted or trapped for the purpose of restocking.  Certain powers are given to recognised game protection associations.  It is our hope that game protection associations will spring up all over the country, because it is only by co-operation amongst the small land owners that <Col N="190" /> one can reasonably expect to see the game in this country developed.</P>
    <P>The second part of the Bill deals with the sale of game.  It provides that game can only be sold to a licensed game dealer except where a person who holds a proper certificate has shot game upon his own land or where his friends or guests have done so.  The game dealer must keep a book which is open for inspection by the Gárda Síochána.  That book must set out every transaction which he carries out.  It is hoped in that way that the operations of the professional poacher, that is the man who lives by shooting game on other people's land and selling it&mdash;a man who is a very dangerous enemy as regards the development of game in this country&mdash;will be very much checked.  There are also provisions in the Act which deal with a question which is a rather vexed question, because there is very great doubt as to what is the correct season for the burning of gorse and heather.  Finally, after a great deal of consideration and debate and having heard the views of a great many members of the Dáil, and the views of many people outside interested in this matter, the dates were fixed under Section 28 as between the 1st April and the 14th July.  The penalties for trespassing in pursuit of game have also been extended. Up to this, if a person came in on your land with a gun and dog and was found there, that was not even proof that he was in there for the purpose of trespassing in pursuit of game.  He could always say that he was not on the land for the purpose of shooting game&mdash;that he was there to shoot rabbits or something of that kind.  No matter what he is in pursuit of now, whether rabbits, plover or any other creatures, if a man with a gun and dog is found on land, there will be a <i>prima facie</i> presumption that he was there for the purpose of shooting game.  These, I think, are the main provisions of the Bill.  I have put them as concisely as I could, and I now commend the Bill to the best consideration of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Earl of Granard</NameTxt>
      <P>As Vice-Chairman of the Irish Game Protection Society, I think it is only right that I should for a few moments intervene in the debate to say how pleased the Society is that this Bill has been introduced.  The Minister has been very sympathetic towards the different suggestions submitted to him by our Society, and I think the Irish Coursing Club and the masters of harriers have had the same experience.  The Minister referred to the great asset we have in game in this country.  I think 100 years ago the North of Scotland was derelict.  It had a poor population and very little game.  Scotsmen, unlike us who live mostly in the past, live in the present and make a good thing out of it.  They attract people to the country for the purpose of shooting.  I am told that nearly £2,000,000 goes into Scotland every year through sporting tenants from America and elsewhere.  This means that a great number of people are able to live in comfort in the northern part of Scotland, where previously they were in very poor circumstances.  There is no doubt that this is one of the best sporting countries in the world.  We have the best fishing and hunting, and there is no reason why in a short time we should not have as good shooting as well.  There are large areas all over the West which would require preserving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are various points in this Bill which, I think, are very useful, and especially the one with regard to the export of game.  When in London I talked to big game dealers in Leadenhall market.  They told me that most of the grouse that came to London before the 12th August came from Northern Ireland and the Free State.  Under this Bill that will be stopped, for no one can export game except under licence.  Another point, which I think is a good one, is the power given to the Minister to schedule certain areas in which game cannot be killed.  He rightly referred to the cock grouse.  Cock grouse on the moors is really as bad as an old bachelor, and the sooner he is got out of the way the better. <Col N="192" /> I do not think the provision with regard to restocking is a very safe one, for, as the Minister pointed out, if I or anybody wanted to catch pheasants for the purpose of rearing them we would not be able to do so except there was some provision such as there is in this Bill.  I think the main provisions of the Bill are good.  With regard to the close season for snipe, I should prefer it extended to 1st October.  I gather that sportsmen who live on the eastern side of Ireland say the snipe that breed in the east would be shot by the shooters in the west.  I hope the Bill will pass through this House and that before the 1st May it will become law.</P>

      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy of the Reeks</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with Senator the Earl of Granard in supporting this Bill. It is an excellent measure to a certain point.  While I do not want to be taken as criticising it in any way, I would like to make some remarks with a view to its improvement.  I think there are many both inside and outside this House who realise that in the game question there is a wonderful opportunity for helping the farmers, who in many cases have game rights, and of also increasing the national income.  The Minister has given very considerable thought to the problem.  The Bill as it stands gives power to restrict the killing of game where necessary, and it provides that game can be sold only under licence.  It gives power to restrict the shooting of certain species of game to limited periods, and during other periods it stops it.  Speaking from experience of my part of the country, the west, I do not think the Bill will have the effect of increasing the head of game to anything like what is expected. As far as the Bill goes in its fairly limited purview, I think it makes provision for most contingencies, but it is coercive rather than constructive. It is, as the Minister said, on the organisation of the farmers that the success of the measure will largely depend, but I do not think that the Bill goes far enough <Col N="193" /> towards getting the farmers to cooperate.</P>
      <P>The Bill is based on what I might call two misconceptions.  The first is that the head of game will multiply under the provisions of the Act, and, secondly, the Bill takes no account of the regular tribe of individuals who come out into the country in motor cars from the towns and who shoot simply for the joy of destruction, to whom the sale of game is of no object, and who care very little for the national interest. We had hoped that the measure would be considerably wider and that it would have contained some scheme for organising the farmers, and so indirectly provide them with a sideline which would go some considerable distance towards paying their rates.  I raise this question on the Second Reading for I am afraid that pressure of other business may mean that it will be shelved, that the golden opportunity of increasing our national income may be put aside for a very considerable time, and that in the meantime the farmers who should be helped will suffer.  Farming and fishing, since the Free State came into being, have been helped in every possible way by subsidies, propaganda and educational legislation, and as a result have been growing in strength day by day, and particularly the fishing industry, which is most closely allied to game preservation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The income from the sale of salmon and trout comes to £270,000 approximately per annum, and also the State gets a contribution from the licences as well as money from the fishery rights.  Every penny of that is spent on the fishing industry. It amounts to £38,000.  That money is utilised towards increasing the fishing population by artificial means.  If you come to the game industry there is quite a different outlook.  In the last 20 years partridge has been practically exterminated, and also the pheasant very nearly so, except on private preserves. Licences are being issued wholesale.  I do not know if the House is aware that in the Free <Col N="194" /> State there are 14,000 £2 licences and 44,000 5/- licences.  That amounts to £39,000, which goes straight into the National Exchequer and is utilised for other services.  Only 684 of these were issued last year to visitors from overseas.  We can assume that one-third of these were taken by people who came to stay with their friends.  That is an extraordinarily small number.  With regard to the figures given by Senator the Earl of Granard, arising from the pursuit and sale of game in Scotland, I think that what Scotland collects in that respect amounts annually to about £3,000,000.  That makes me feel that the possibilities of taking this measure further should be seriously examined.  Of course the circumstances in Scotland are somewhat different.</P>
    <P>There are some other points to which I would like to draw the attention of the House.  In France there is a very interesting system under the laws of 1884 and 1924.  The whole of the control of sport, which includes the killing of game, is vested in the Department of Agriculture, and they have very strict laws which deal with a varied population. They make provision for all classes of small and larger holders, and are most impartial.  There are three major points of importance. First, there is the fact that the operation of these laws is delegated to the Prefects of the Departments, which are very much like our counties, and to general consuls.  These Prefects and general consuls have power to refuse or grant licences and to vary, with the permission of the Minister, the close season.  They can make provision for re-stocking and for the systematic destruction of vermin.  Secondly, there is an allocation of a certain proportion of the sums got from the sale of permits towards the purposes to which I have referred.  Lastly, they have power to enlist and dispose of game wardens, who are a kind of special police for the purpose of game protection.</P>
    <P>I made inquiries in France and I found that in most localities the farmers are organised.  They let <Col N="195" /> their lands to syndicates in the towns who collect the money, and they do extraordinarily well out of the arrangement.  In the United States there is State game preservation and they have State game wardens.  In the State of New York pheasant can be shot only on four days in the year. In Canada the whole country is looked after by a small number of game wardens who are extremely useful.  I give these examples of what is done elsewhere because I want to convince the House that there is still room for improvement, and that it is a matter for serious consideration to see that this Bill will not be our final word, which I am afraid it will be, unless we give consideration to the matters I have mentioned.  For many reasons, the farmer has been apathetic in the matter of game preservation.  He has been even hostile, but I think the majority of the reasons that caused him to be apathetic have ceased to exist to some extent.  In fact, in many places they have disappeared altogether.  The farmer is better educated, and he realises more his own interest.  I think he only requires initial help and encouragement to strike out a sideline which will benefit him, and that, in many parts of the country, will help him to solve his de-rating problem without assistance.  I think if we follow the precedents which we have in recent legislation, such as, the Livestock Breeding Act, and other Acts of the kind, we would build up an organisation which would help the farmers on the right way.  I suggest, if the Minister could see his way to it, that we should have a joint committee whose task would be to examine the question of further constructive legislation with the object of increasing the head of game in the country.  I think such a committee might profitably examine the institution of a consultative council such as we have in connection with the Livestock Act, and such as has been introduced in connection with the National Monuments Bill.  Afterwards there could be formed an <Col N="196" /> association of county preservation boards like the Fishery Conservators. In my own district these have been extraordinarily successful.  The boards I have suggested would have duties similar to that of the Conservators of Fisheries&mdash;the destruction of vermin and re-stocking. I think they might also consider the allocation of funds which they have derived from gun licences towards game preservation.</P>
    <P>I think it is only reasonable to suggest that a certain proportion of the funds received from an industry should be returned to that industry. I know there will be a good many people who will say that the laws applicable to France and America are not applicable here, and that you cannot organise the farmers.  I think in many cases they would be right, but everything must have a start.  I think attempts at organisation will fail miserably in some places, but in others they will succeed. There are indications in Wicklow, and elsewhere, that the farmers are beginning to do this work of organisation on their own.  I am not wedded to any of these suggestions I have made, but I hope the House will agree to give some further examination to this big problem so that some steps will be taken in the matter which may considerably increase our income.  I hope the Minister will accept on the Committee Stage amendments to the Bill, and particularly as regards the formation of a consultative council, which I suggest should be made up of representative organisations in the country, and some members of both Houses, whose task it would be to inquire into what way we could increase our game, and incidentally help our farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Bill.  The shooting of game, as has been stated, is not the least important of the amenities of our country. I think that some improvement and modernisation of the law on the subject of game preservation is badly wanted.  This Bill supplies what is wanted in that respect.  Personally, <Col N="197" /> I find it a sensible, moderate and well thought out measure, but I hold strongly that there are very great limits to what the law can do in this matter.  That applies in a special degree to the preservation of game. Man is a natural hunter, and I hope he always will be so, but it follows that being a natural hunter the killing of game out of season or in season which belongs to somebody else, and which, in fact, is stealing, is not looked upon and never will be in much the same way as would be the removal of hens by a person from the domicile of another person. You will never get the same odium attached to the crime of poaching as to other crimes, for that reason the law will never be as effective as a deterrent as it would be in preventing other kinds of crime.  In regard to certain game birds, I believe their continued existence will depend more than anything else upon private endeavour and private initiative. I do not believe the State can go beyond a certain point.  I do not depreciate the great advantage of having the law better than it was in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Bill does a great deal, and I welcome it, but we must not expect too much from it.  In my opinion, game will never be in the Free State as great a national economic asset as it is in some other countries, such as Scotland.  It may be made a greater economic asset than it is now, but it will never reach anything like the figures quoted, for the reason that we have not got here the same area of wild, unfertile mountains which are economically better utilised as sporting lands than anything else.  Another thing is that we have not got as large a number of rich alien sportsmen visiting us who are willing to spend large sums on the shooting of game.  I hope we will have more of them, and that they will bring money into the country.  There are, however, certain difficulties in the way that do not exist in other countries.  The most lucrative bird is the grouse.  It is well known that the best birds are in the north of England and on the <Col N="198" /> east side of Scotland, which has a hard, rigorous climate.  In the west of Ireland you have a most climate and you have not such good grouse there.  It does not seem possible to bring about the same head of game on Irish mountains, no matter how favourably situated.  In this matter all the Oireachtas can do is to assist in putting matters right by law.  I think the Bill does that, and, therefore, it will have some effect.  With regard to the prohibition of the burning of gorse and heather within a certain period, hitherto the burning has been very detrimental, especially to mountain game.  There must be some burning, because you cannot entirely eliminate it.  This is an important economic factor.  There is plenty of time left for the burning between the 1st April and 14th July.</P>
    <P>It will be an exceedingly difficult thing to enforce.  Anyone who knows mountain country knows what I mean.  I hope it will be successful. Another proposal which struck me as an especially good one was that in Section 3 extending the close season for teal and widgeon to the 12th August, the same as for grouse. Many of these birds are too young to fly before that.  It would not be sporting to shoot them, and it would be a very great waste.  Hitherto the power to shoot them legally before the 12th August undoubtedly tended to bring about the shooting illegally of a great many grouse, because a man who is out shooting plover on a mountain about the 10th August, if grouse get up, he would be a remarkably better sportsman than a great many if he did not put them down.</P>
    <P>In one respect the Bill has disappointed me.  There is no mention of poison, but I shall have something to say about that in Committee, because poison is a very important factor in this question.  Personally, having regard to the practical difficulties surrounding this question, that is the only disappointment I found in the Bill.  It is a Bill of which I strongly approve, generally speaking, and I shall strongly support it.</P>

      <P>I have nothing to <Col N="199" /> say against this Bill, but, on the contrary, a good deal to say in its favour.  I think Senator the Earl of Granard is the only one who has thrown discredit on the Bill.  He told us about Scotland, about the millions of money that are spent there, how foolish the Irish people are, and how clever the Scottish are in regard to this matter.  The Senator looks only at one side of it. Scotland was cleared of thousands and thousands of people in order that game might exist in the mountain and other districts.  Of course the pasture on the mountains is of no use to anyone except for grazing sheep.  In the west of Ireland the mountains are used for the grazing of sheep.  I think the Irish people have been much wiser in not having allowed themselves to be put out of the country so that their place might be taken by deer and by wild birds.  I think we are very fortunate that our people succeeded where the Scotch failed, and that they are not now in Canada and other countries. I have nothing to say against this Bill.  On the contrary, I think it is a basis for the protection of birds. The Bill itself will not make such an enormous difference, because the people will shoot game.  You cannot stop that.  The only game I have ever seen protected properly was protected by the people on the land. Certain friends of mine took an area at a very small price and paid so much for every head of game that was shot to a certain person who lived on the spot.  In that way the game was protected comparatively cheaply.  Unless the people can join together, as Senator the McGilly cuddy pointed out, for their own interests, in order to protect the game for richer people who will pay for it, they will not go very far.  I think it would be well if something of the kind were attempted to help to do that sort of thing.  As far as partridge are concerned, they depend on tillage.  When tillage decreases partridge decrease.  Unless tillage is in a much better state than it is now there will not be many <Col N="200" /> partridge.  At present there are practically no partridge except in a few places where they are protected. Hares will be easily protected now. People are keen on sporting and greyhounds, and you will always be able to get those on the spot to help to protect hares, because they are always fond of coursing.  I think we are all agreed that the Bill is valuable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a representative of the occupiers of land I do not believe the Minister in any way consulted them when preparing this Bill. I would like to get information about points that do not appear to be clear. The occupiers of the land are the persons who support the game.  It was on their land the game was fed, and there seems to be a kind of insinuation that they are more or less responsible for the diminution of the amount of game.  In the first place it is well to see who are the legal owners of the game, because I presume this Bill will not in any way alter the existing ownership.  According to a return issued by the Land Commission for the year ending the 31st March, 1928, there were 9,079 estates vested under the Acts of 1903 and 1909, and out of these estates in only 5,844 cases were the game rights vested in the purchasers.  That is to say that in little more than half the estates the game rights are still in the hands of the head landlord, the landlord or the Land Commission. It may be taken that the estates that were not handed over to the purchasers were estates where the game rights were of some substantial value.  I find by this return that in 118 estates the sporting rights were reserved to the head landlord; in 812 estates they were reserved to the vendors; in 51 estates to the purchasers and superior landlords or vendors jointly; in 197 estates partly to the purchasers, the superior landlord or vendors; in 83 estates to the vendor and superior landlord concurrently; in 15 partly to the vendor and the superior landlord; in 245 to the vendors for life and afterwards to the purchasers; in <Col N="201" /> 26 partly to the purchasers and to the Land Commission; in 109 to the Land Commission and superior landlords or vendors; in 57 to the Land Commission and superior landlord, and in 902 to the Land Commission alone.  That shows that in a very large area the sporting rights are not legally in the hands of the occupiers.</P>
      <P>I find by Section 15 of the Bill that it is necessary to get the consent of the occupier where a recognised association wishes to pursue game on a holding.  I do not know if that means that by this Bill the ownership of the game is transferred to the occupier or not, but in that respect I am aware that in several instances occupiers were forced during the troubled period to give consents to people who came around to them in order to get coursing rights.  The occupiers did not think the coursing rights of any great value, and they simply signed the documents put before them without any valuable consideration, without having the advice of a solicitor or anyone else.  I suggest that consent which is mentioned in the section should be given after the passing of this Bill, and that where there are existing consents they should not be binding on the occupiers.  I have also seen that some coursing clubs that got consents from occupiers have actually sub-let their sporting right to game preservation associations for the purpose of stocking the land with game, altogether ignoring the rights of the occupiers.</P>
      <P>In some respects I would be in favour of having this Bill more stringent for the preservation of game.  For instance, I do not see that it is made illegal to shoot hares. I think it is regarded by most people as a very unmanly thing to shoot a hare under any circumstances, and I think there should be an amendment in the Bill to prevent that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards hunting by harriers and beagles, there should be some regulation made so that masters and those responsible for these packs should take steps to see that when the day's hunting is over the dogs are collected and brought home.  It <Col N="202" /> sometimes happens that the dogs are left to get home of their own accord, and that in a great many cases they remain hunting all night.  The Minister should have some control over the masters of such dogs before he gives his certificate to them, to see that they observe the conditions, and that those in charge will be responsible for them when they take them out.  It is quite different with men engaged poaching.  I see by the Bill that hunting in the close season is stopped.  Drag hunting takes place in the close season and consists of running a drag across the country in a straight line and going through meadows and corn crops.  These hunts disturb the young game, because young hares especially resort to meadows and corn fields, and very often many of them are killed by these dogs.  I presume the Minister will say that the occupier can always take steps to prosecute those responsible.  It is hard for the occupier to identify them.  There appears to be no one responsible, and very few of them, in some cases, would be a mark for damages.  I think some amendment should be put in to that effect, as it would strengthen the Bill and, at the same time, save the occupiers from serious injury being done to crops.  I am in favour of the Bill, but I hope that the amendments which I suggest will be inserted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that the interests of the farmers have been considered in the chorus of praise with which this Bill has been received.  Like Senator Linehan, I am very much in favour of the rigorous protection of game, but I am also in favour of preserving, as far as possible, the interests of the farming community.  I am greatly surprised that Section 28 (1) has been allowed to pass in its present form:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It shall not be lawful for any person to burn or otherwise destroy between the 1st day of April and the 14th day of July (both days inclusive) in any year any gorse, furze, whin, heath, <Col N="203" /> fern or greg-ling growing on any lands not then cultivated or in course of cultivation.</P>
    <P>Nobody would condemn as strongly as I would the burning of heather while the young grouse are being hatched, that is between the 1st of April and the 14th of July, and I consider that period long enough.  But there are many mountains in the west of Ireland where there is not one pack of grouse, but where there are hundreds and thousands of sheep, the sole mainstay of farmers.  In the County Kerry and other places we know that in order to make these mountains of any value to the farmers who have to live by the grazing of sheep, it is necessary to burn the heath sometimes in the spring so that the farmers may have the benefit of the young shoots which come up in the following spring. Sometimes it may not be possible to set fire to a mountain before the 1st of April because, on account of the state of the weather, it will not take fire.  The heath belongs to the farmer, yet here you have an absolute prohibition against a man doing what he likes with his own land.  I leave it at that so far as burning is concerned.  I am absolutely opposed to the burning of heather if there is any sort of prospect that it contains young grouse or the nests of birds. Here we have a clause which says:</P>
    <P>It shall not be lawful for any person to burn or otherwise destroy between the 1st day of April and the 14th day of July any heather....</P>
    <P>Is he not to be allowed, if he thinks it is the proper way, to grub his own land?  Is he not to be allowed to cut heath if he thinks it is the proper way to keep down overgrown heath, and let the new shoots grow? I do not think the interests of farming have been sufficiently considered in the drafting of the Bill, and I echo what Senator Linehan said, that the farmers ought to have been consulted. <Col N="204" /> There is another class of person whose interests should be considered, and that is the farmer's son.  I notice that a protection order can be made in relation to hares, but that where a protection order is made &ldquo;it shall not be lawful for any person while such order continues in force to kill or take hares in the county or part of a county to which such order relates by any means other than by coursing with not more than two dogs let loose from slips in pursuit of the hare.&rdquo;  Gentlemen will come out from the local county town and they will have a slip and all the other accoutrements of the coursing match &mdash;but farmers' sons have no slips.  I would be in favour of deleting these words &ldquo;from slips&rdquo; and allowing farmers' sons to course if the gentlemen from the cities are allowed to course.</P>
    <P>There was another matter referred to by Senator Linehan which I think deserves attention.  Permission to preserve was obtained from farmers some years ago when they were not as firmly settled in their holdings as they are now.  I do not think the State should take advantage of the permission then granted, and I think when the State legislates it ought to legislate in respect of permissions which shall hereafter be granted.  In that way, I think, what has been said by Senator Linehan is perfectly sound.  On the main provisions of the Bill I think it is highly desirable that game should be preserved. The only way to preserve game is to make it in the interest of the farmers to preserve it.  They are the people who will preserve it.  If they are not conciliated, if their interests are not looked after, and if some encouragement is not given them in the preservation of game you might as well be talking to the idle wind.</P>

      <P>Might I ask if the Minister would be willing to extend the date for the preservation of snipe to the 1st of October?  We have until the 31st August but the <Col N="205" /> snipe are very small then and hardly worth shooting.  It is not sporting to shoot them then as they are hardly able to fly.  Lots of them follow the path of the partridge and disappear.  I think it would not be any harm to extend the time for another month in order that they would become game birds and game objects.  A lot of people might like to boast about how many snipe they shot without stating whether or not the snipe were able to fly.  Different species of birds have been exempted and dates have been altered.  I think it is very important in the case of snipe to increase the period of protection for one month until they are in full flight.  They are not birds that bring in very much income; you do not often see them exposed in the shops, but they are more sought for than any other game bird.  It is a very small point, but I hope I will be supported on the Committee Stage, for the sake of sportsmen especially, in suggesting another four weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Alluding to what Senator Gogarty has just said about the close season for snipe, as this Bill was originally introduced into the Dáil the close season was to the 1st of October.  Other persons were strongly in favour of the close season for snipe being the 12th of August, and finally a compromise was arrived at by which the 1st of September was taken as being the opening day.  There is a good deal to be said on both sides.  I think Senator the Earl of Granard was right when he said that really it is a battle between the east and the west.  The snipe shot in September are not home snipe at all; they are foreign snipe.  The home snipe have gone before that date, and the foreign snipe come to the midland and eastern counties before they come to the western counties.  I think most people are agreed on that.  The eastern counties people think they lose really good shooting of the foreign snipe when they come first if the season is put back to the 1st of October.  Personally, I have an <Col N="206" /> open mind on the question, because I happen to be a western man, and all my snipe shooting was done in County Mayo where the close season was always the 1st of October.  The close season for snipe varied from county to county.  The Dáil finally decided upon this date and possibly on the Committee Stage the Seanad may make up its mind about it, but I venture to suggest that this compromise to the 1st of September is not a bad compromise because the 12th August had very definite supporters in the Dáil and outside.</P>
      <P>There was a great deal said about the ownership of shooting rights. Of course this Bill has nothing to do with the ownership of shooting rights.  Shooting rights remain vested in the persons in whom they were vested before this Bill was introduced. This Bill does not purport to transfer the rights of property from one person to another at all.  It only purports to enable, as far as it can, those in whom sporting rights are vested to make the best of the asset which they possess. Senator Linehan said a good deal about hunting and dogs being loose and drag hunts going through fields of corn in midsummer.  I do not know whether they do or not. We may come to that on the Committee Stage.  I think on the Committee Stage I will leave the defence of harrier hunts to Senator Colonel Moore, whom I know was for some years master of a pack of harriers. Possibly he will answer Senator Linehan's attack on masters of harriers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very interesting speech was made by Senator the McGillycuddy, and I will consider the suggestions that he made, with very great care in the time at my disposal.  But in the first place I would like to say that this is not the end of game legislation.  There never is finality in legislation, but I hope this Bill will commend itself to the House as a good beginning in legislation upon this subject.  I entirely agree with Senator Bagwell that the Government cannot develop game shooting. If the owners of the land and the <Col N="207" /> owners of the game rights, do not set to work to develop their shooting rights, no government can do it. My hope is, that under this Bill certain game protection associations will come forward and have themselves recognised and authorised. Then we will be able to consider the question of the formation of a consultative council, or the question of whether some of the money which is raised by gun licences might not be spent to advantage in the preservation of game.  All these things can be considered after this Bill has been working for some time, and we can see if there is a genuine desire to form game associations and to develop the shooting of game.  But I think at present the suggestions, admirable though they are, of Senator the McGillycuddy would not be quite feasible.  No doubt the formation of a consultative council would be a very excellent thing, but where could you get persons to act on a consultative council until you had game associations recognised throughout the country?  If you went round and got persons who were well-known shooters there would immediately be a very much louder outcry on the same lines as Senator Linehan went on, if you picked the big men only and did not consider the small men at all.  My hope is to see the small farmers come together and co-operate.  They may be small farmers in the sense that they pay very small rents, but they may have 500 or 600 acres of land, held at ½d. or 1d. an acre, which might be very useful if the game on it were preserved and might bring them in a great deal of money. Those are the people who I would desire to see forming game associations. If there are associations of that kind formed and if there is a general desire on the part of the people to work out this question for themselves, then I think this question of having a consultative council, or the question of devoting a certain amount of State funds to the development of game preservation, would be feasible.  But at <Col N="208" /> present, admirable though I think the suggestions are, on the whole they are premature.</P>

      <P>The amendments in my name on the Paper are Government amendments.  I move:</P>
      <P>Section 1.  In line 30 to delete the word &ldquo;is&rdquo; and before the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; in line 31 to insert the words and figures &ldquo;is sent by Dáil Eireann to Seanad Eireann for its recommendations under Article 38 of this Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Bill as it stands, the resolution of either House or the vote of Seanad Eireann which would lead to the setting up of a Committee of Privileges to determine whether a Bill is or is not a Money Bill must take place before whichever of the following events will first occur: (1) the expiration of seven days from the day on which the Bill is certified by the Chairman of Dáil Eireann to be a Money Bill, or (2) the return of such Bill by Seanad Eireann to Dáil Eireann under Article 38 of the Constitution. It has been argued that a delay might occur between the certification of a Money Bill by the Chairman of the Dáil and its transmission to Seanad Eireann, and for that reason the seven days provided for in (1) might elapse in whole or in part before the Seanad would have an opportunity of exercising its powers under this provision.  I might say here that Senator Connolly's amendment, which is sandwiched in between two amendments in my name, is practically in line with one of the amendments in my name, that in fact Senator Connolly's amendment aims at remedying this.  Its effect would be to alter (1) to read as follows: &ldquo;the expiration of seven days from the day on <Col N="209" /> which a Bill certified by the Chairman of Dáil Eireann to be a Money Bill is received by Seanad Eireann. The seven days' period would then run, not from the date on which it is certified, but from the date of the receipt of the Bill by the Seanad.</P>

      <P>These Bills are sent by hand to the Seanad, and they reach here practically on the same day as that on which they are sent. The days are practically identical, so that both amendments are directed towards the same object, but the advantage in favour of my amendment is that the words &ldquo;sent to the Seanad&rdquo; are used in Article 38 of the Constitution.  They are a sort of basic term.  The 270 days in which we may hold up a Bill date from the sending of the Bill by the Dáil to the Seanad, and also there is a further period in Article 38 of 21 days within which the Bill must be returned from the Seanad, and that also dates from the sending of the Bill to the Seanad.  So that to bring these days in line and not to introduce another date into the Constitution it is suggested that the time should be when the Bill is sent by the Dáil to the Seanad.  A Bill will reach the Seanad on the same day as it is sent, and Senator Connolly's amendment practically amounts to the same thing.</P>

I am not clear about that. If it will only be sent when the Seanad is in session, what is the objection to the words &ldquo;is received by Seanad Eireann&rdquo;?  If it would be sent only when we are in session surely it is very easy to change the word to &ldquo;received&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;sent.&rdquo;  Frankly I cannot see Senator Kenny's point that his amendment and mine mean the same thing.  I think that mine is more intelligible, that it will definitely give us a seven days' period from the time of receipt.  His is from the time it is sent.  If he can satisfy us that the time of sending is the same as the time of receipt I submit he has no argument against my amendment.  I do not know that I am very much concerned about the point of the Constitution.  My point is that we ought to be clear that we will have seven days to consider this from the receipt of it.  I do not think that the amendment proposed by him gets us any further than the position laid down in the first clause of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not think we need spend very much time in discussing whether or not the two amendments are the same, but I think we have got to consider whether the Government's amendment means what the Seanad last week more or less decided it would like.  I did not understand that Senator Connolly wished that the words &ldquo;received by Seanad Eireann&rdquo; should mean &ldquo;in session,&rdquo; because while if there was an unlimited time for consideration I would agree that it would be desirable that it should be in session, I would like to suggest to him and to the House that it ought not to be when we are in session, but that immediately, at the earliest possible moment after the Bill is sent here, the Clerk should notify every member, and that the seven days should run from then.  My reason for that is that there are only twenty-one days altogether, and that if we were to wait until a meeting of this House were summoned, and then had twenty-one days running and the seven days for the Committee to <Col N="211" /> meet, and if they decided that the Bill was a Money Bill, we might never have the chance of considering it at all, because although Senators might challenge the decision of the Ceann Comhairle, that is no proof that the Committee might not decide that the Ceann Comhairle was not right.  In that case, if we allowed twenty-one days to elapse we would not have the Bill before us.  Therefore, I think that the Government's amendment is reasonably satisfactory and is the best way to meet the situation.</P>

      <P>If Senator Kenny is right in saying that his amendment is the same as Senator Connolly's amendment, I do not see why he introduced his amendment at all, because Senator Connolly's amendment was first on the Paper, and if it met the situation there is no reason at all for this discussion on Senator Kenny's amendment.  But Senator Kenny's amendment does not meet the situation.  I have inquired rather closely into the matter. This is legislation dealing with the Constitution.  I think everybody will agree that it is desirable that it should be clear, precise and definite, and that it should meet every possible situation likely to arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find that there is no statutory provision for the sending of any Bill from Dáil Eireann to Seanad Eireann; there is no actual machinery for the sending up of a Bill, and there is no time limit.  It is probably a matter that was overlooked in the general course of business. As to the time when a Bill passed by the Dáil is to be sent to the Seanad, there is no provision at all.  As I say, this is a constitutional measure.  Senator Connolly's amendment would make the matter very precise.  There can be no reasonable objection to it from a legal point of view or from a constitutional point of view.  If the Seanad is to have seven days to consider whether a Bill is a Money Bill or not, it is desirable that they shall have the actual seven days, and it is desirable that the time should run from the date when the <Col N="212" /> Seanad received the Bill.  Whether it is the Seanad in session that is to receive the Bill, or whether it is the Chairman or the Clerk, is a matter which I for one would be prepared to leave to the discretion of the persons responsible.  But I think no loophole should be left, that the seven days should be given to the Seanad from the day when the Bill is received.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asked to construe legislation here, but my impression is that the words &ldquo;received by the Seanad&rdquo; would be receipt by the official of the Seanad&mdash;that is, the Clerk or the Chairman.  That is what I should say.  Suppose a Bill is certified to be a Money Bill by the Chairman of the Dáil on Friday evening, there is no provision for the publication of that certificate to any person; there is no provision requiring the Chairman of Dáil Eireann, or the Clerk of Dáil Eireann, to forward that Bill with that certificate to Seanad Eireann.  There is no time limit within which they are to do it.  Surely that ought to be a matter of legislation, a matter which would be put absolutely beyond doubt or dispute.  Senator Connolly's amendment does put it beyond doubt, because instead of saying that the seven days shall run from the day on which it is sent, it provides that the seven days shall run from the day on which it is received by the Seanad&mdash;that is, by the permanent officials of the Seanad, as I take it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an extraordinary weakness on the point put forward by Senator Comyn and Senator Connolly and that is that nobody can explain what is meant by &ldquo;received by Seanad Eireann.&rdquo; Nobody has attempted to explain it, and I thought that Senator Comyn, having some knowledge of law, would have been prepared to advise his brother Senators that he would require some little support for his amendment if we were to adopt it, because it would leave things worse than they are.  As far as the sending of Bills by Dáil Eireann to Seanad Eireann is concerned, we shall have had seven years experience at the end of this week, I think.  During that time we have had a very large number of Bills and none of them were delayed.  I do not believe that a single Bill was delayed an hour. On one occasion, I think, a Bill passed shortly after midnight and possibly no responsible officers of the Seanad were here to receive it then. But it was sent.  As far as the <Col N="214" /> allegation is concerned no allegation of delay of any sort or kind can be put on record, and the words are mandatory.  The Bill is to be sent; Bills have always been sent, and our experience over seven years has been that no delay in sending has taken place.</P>
      <P>The second point was Senator Comyn's statement that we were limiting the Seanad to these seven days.  As a matter of fact, this Bill is extending the period from three days to seven, and during these seven years when a large number of Money Bills were sent up no question of any kind arose.  As I said on the last day, the term &ldquo;Money Bill&rdquo; is one which does not admit of any elasticity, as the Ceann Comhairle is bound by the terms that are laid down in the Constitution regarding that, and as no question has arisen regarding their interpretation. This is to deal with a situation which might arise in which there was a question of doubt as to whether or not a Bill is correctly termed a Money Bill.  The sending by Dáil Eireann is already in one or two places in the Constitution.  There is no such description given by the framers of the Constitution as &ldquo;received by Seanad Eireann,&rdquo; and the necessary steps will be taken by the Seanad to ensure that on particular occasions meetings will be summoned to consider this matter.</P>

It seems to me quite clear, and it has <Col N="215" /> always been understood in the Seanad that the Chairman of the Seanad represents the Seanad and that when a thing is sent to him it is sent to the Seanad.</P>

      <P>He is such an excellent President that, no doubt, everything will be all right in his time.  One can quite imagine that whoever has the duty in the Dáil of sending up Bills may wish to do perfectly right, but things are lost <i>en route</i> very often; people sometimes lose their purses on the road, and a particular Bill may be lost on the road, may be put into the post or into an office and may be taken away by somebody who has no right to take it away.  All these things may happen.  I do not say they are likely to happen, but they may. They may not have happened for the last seven years, but on the other hand they may have for all we know, without the attention of anybody having been called to it.  It would be quite easy to change the word &ldquo;sent&rdquo; to &ldquo;received.&rdquo;  The time when the Chairman of the Seanad receives it on behalf of the Seanad is the time on which we should go. Why quibble about these words &ldquo;sent&rdquo; and &ldquo;received&rdquo;?  &ldquo;Received&rdquo; is what is meant, theoretically. It seems to me that the simpler and the easier thing would be to accept this amendment, which cannot be wrong, instead of having some other thing which may not turn out to be right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made the only argument that I desire to make on the amendment.  What I want to state is this&mdash;it has already been stated by Senator Colonel Moore&mdash; that now for the first time we have got some idea of what sending means and what receiving means.  I may say that both are equally obscure to me still, and I do not know that the President has made the matter any clearer.  He said that the question of receipt is not defined. I suggest that neither is the sending period clearly defined.  What constitutes sending, I still do not know; whether it means sending to the Cathaoirleach or sending to the House in Session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of a definition we must, I think, only take what the usage has been.  During the past seven years the usage has been that, when a Bill has passed through all its stages in the Dáil, it is sent to Seanad Eireann&mdash; that is, to the Clerk of the Seanad. If that is so, then the sending of a Bill to the Clerk of the Seanad constitutes sending in the absence of any clearer definition in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of any more specific explanation of the meaning of the word &ldquo;sending,&rdquo; if the usage has been to forward a Bill to the Clerk of the Seanad that, I think, constitutes sending in the sense that the word is used in the Constitution.</P>

      <P>I contend that sending and receipt are almost identical. If a messenger is sent with a Bill that has passed all its stages in the Dáil and he hands it to the Clerk of the Seanad, and if that constitutes sending, then sending and receipt are practically identical.  Senator Connolly's amendment would, I think, after hearing the discussion that has taken place, be an improvement; that the receipt of the Bill should run from the time the Bill is received by the Seanad in session.</P>

What I am now asking the House to accept is the second portion of our amendment, which reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If any member of such Committee constituted as aforesaid ceases to be a member or for any reason becomes incapable of acting as a member thereof, the remaining members of such Committee shall constitute and act as the Committee of Privileges for the purpose of this section.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some doubt as to whether it is necessary to make this provision.  The Committee of Privileges has the right, I understand, to appoint such members, as it is advised, in the ordinary normal way.  If a person ceases to be a member of the Committee through death, resignation or something of that sort, my information is that the Committee of Privileges is entitled to fill up the vacancy.  If that is so, and I think that it has worked out in that way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid not.  I think the point made by the President is right in regard to committees appointed in the ordinary way by the House.  But this is the case of a committee specifically provided for in definite terms in the Constitution itself.  It is a matter of very grave doubt whether any less number than that actually provided for in the Bill as now amended can act.  It is because we have a very grave legal doubt that the committee would be valid and entitled to act that we are <Col N="220" /> anxious to add these words.  If there was no legal doubt on the matter we would not wish to add these words.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 1:</P>
      <P>Section 2.  After the word &ldquo;which&rdquo; in line 9, page 3, to insert the word &ldquo;only.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we had this Bill before us on the last day, I directed my remarks principally to Section 24. When I came to look at the section, I saw that the whole weight of it depended on the definition of &ldquo;archæological object&rdquo; which is given in Section 2.  I think there are very strong reasons why my amendment should be inserted.  I have examined the definition, as it stands, very carefully.  Having done so, I came to the conclusion that, as far as I was concerned, I could make no sense out of it.  I presume the House will agree that an archæological object must be archaeological.  The meaning of the word &ldquo;archæological&rdquo; in the dictionary is &ldquo;archaic&rdquo; or &ldquo;very old.&rdquo; I take it the House intends that the object of this Bill should be the preservation of the antiquities of the country. We see in the definition that the expression &ldquo;archæological object&rdquo; means any chattel.  A chattel is a thing that can almost be anything. All sorts of things are described as chattels&mdash;cattle, horses, and so on. The definition speaks of &ldquo;any chattel whether in a manufactured or partly <Col N="222" /> manufactured or unmanufactured state which, by reason of its antiquity, or the archæological or historical interest attaching thereto.&rdquo;  I want to draw the attention of Senators to the words &ldquo;or historical interest.&rdquo;  It does not say &ldquo;and historical.&rdquo;  Historical is not added to the antiquity.  An historical object need not in the least be an archæological object, and an archæological object need not in the least be an historical object.  There may be no history connected with it at all and yet you find the words in the definition &ldquo;or historical.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I take it that the House never intended that the definition of &ldquo;archæological object&rdquo; should be in the words that we find in Section 2. I suggest that the words &ldquo;or historical&rdquo; in the definition destroy the effect of the words in front of them. The reason why we should be very careful in this matter is that if the crimes and iniquities of the kind described in a later part of the Bill are committed by any person and a conviction is recorded that person will be liable to a fine of £50 or six months' imprisonment or both.  I can imagine a case coming before a judge where some one is accused of having done something or another to an archæological object.  The judge turns to the definition which we are discussing and tries to make out what an archæological object is.  He finds there the words &ldquo;or historical.&rdquo; I submit that an historical object can be proved to be not an archæological object at all.  In my opinion if the judge is to go by the definition which we find in the Bill he will come to the conclusion that he cannot give any decision in the case at all.</P>
    <P>This definition requires to be very seriously considered by the House. The matter is so serious that, I think, we cannot come to a decision on it to-day.  I personally cannot understand what the section means.  I hold that some of the words in this definition make out an archæological object not to be an archæological object at all.  It reminds one of the old joke: when is a door not a door?  When it is ajar.  I think this definition is <Col N="223" /> nearly as bad as that.  An archæological object need not be an historical object at all, and a historical object need not be an archæological object, and yet both are mixed up in this definition.  I am not sure that the problem which this definition presents would be solved even by the insertion of the word &ldquo;only&rdquo;.  I think if the words &ldquo;or historical&rdquo; were deleted that the definition would be quite sensible.  The definition would then read, &ldquo;by reason of its antiquity or the archæological interest attaching thereto&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I also wish to draw the attention of Senators to the words in the definition &ldquo;has a value substantially greater than its intrinsic value.&rdquo;  If the object has not that value, then the Bill cannot deal with it at all. If the Bill is passed as it stands it will be impossible for anyone to sell any of these things, because their intrinsic value is taken away from them.  The position, I submit, would be this: that no real archæological object, as described in this definition. can ever be acquired by the State and the Minister cannot interfere with it.  As I have said, this Bill provides very heavy penalties.  Those convicted of certain crimes under it will be liable to six months, imprisonment or a fine of £50 or both.  Therefore, I say the Bill requires far more consideration than has been given to it.  I suggest that more time should be given to the consideration of this Bill.  The House can consider whether I am talking sense or nonsense.  I am talking sense if there is a great deal of nonsense in this particular definition. Even if the House thinks that I am talking nonsense, I suggest they should take more time for the consideration of this Bill and think well over it before they vote for it.</P>

      <P>The amendment is a perfect example of how inefficient talent without experience can be.  I listened to Senator Jameson's attempt to disentangle the section. To a lawyer with less ability the <Col N="224" /> construction is perfectly plain.  It is meant by the definition of an archæological object to cover articles which are ancient, and articles which though not so ancient have historical value.  The best way to find out what the meaning of the section is, is to imagine the example of the bell to which Senator Miss Browne referred as having been sold at Christie's some time ago.  The St. Senan's bell from County Clare would be an archæological object by reason of its antiquity.  It would be an object having a special value also by reason of its workmanship, and it would be an object coming within the definition by reason of its historical associations.  Therefore, it would come within all three definitions. Take the Treaty Stone of Limerick.  That is not very ancient, but it has great historical value.  I am sure it has a value to the Irish people far above the intrinsic value of the stone.  That is an object which would come within part three of the definition.  I should say that it would be an archæological object not by reason of its antiquity, for it is only a couple of hundred years in existence.  There may be a difference of opinion as to whether it is an archæological object, but it certainly is of historic interest.  If either of these terms is struck out the Treaty Stone of Limerick would get no protection under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am opposed to the amendment proposed by Senator Jameson.  The amendment says: After the word &ldquo;which,&rdquo; in line 9, page 3, to insert the word &ldquo;only.&rdquo;  Here then is what the Senator means: &ldquo;The expression &lsquo;archæological object&rsquo; means any chattel, whether in a manufactured or partly manufactured or an unmanufactured state, which only by reason of its antiquity or the archæological or historical interest attaching thereto has a value substantially greater than its intrinsic value.&rdquo;  If that word &ldquo;only&rdquo; were inserted it would deprive of protection a good many works which are of interest on account of the excellent workmanship expended on them by Irish <Col N="225" /> artists and by Irish hands.  Let us take the Cross of Cong.  That is of high value apart from its intrinsic value.  It has high value because of its antiquity.  If only one hundred years or fifty years old it would have tremendous value because of its workmanship.  I do not think it is intended that an article of such workmanship as the Cross of Cong should be freely exported.  Another argument used by Senator Jameson in which there is no substance is that if you prohibit the exportation of an archæological object it will at once lose all value except its intrinsic value.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the necessary thing for an article to possess archæological value is that it must possess a value substantially greater than its intrinsic value.  That is the guiding principle.  Surely there are many archæological objects which would have no intrinsic value, and then they could not be archæological except they possessed a value greater than their intrinsic value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>What I understood Senator Jameson to say, and I shall be very glad to be corrected if I misunderstood him, was that if you prohibit the export of these articles they will at once lose all value except their intrinsic value.  There is nothing in the Bill so far as I know preventing sale within the country of any object of archæological value. There is a prohibition as regards selling for export without the consent of the Minister.  That is the only prohibition.  Senator Jameson said that if you prohibit export the article will lose all value except its intrinsic value.  I say not, because there are people in Ireland who would buy it and who would pay more for it than its intrinsic value by reason of the interest attaching to it.  I urge the House not to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In my opinion Section 24 should be deleted as it really does not belong to the Bill.  I think <Col N="226" /> that should be allowed to stand over so that a better section could be introduced. According to Section 24 it would be impossible for anybody to dispose of an archæological object except it is sold within the country, and that would entail great hardship in some cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure the Minister will not agree with the suggestion of Senator Guinness.  If it is desirable to have a year's free sale of archæological objects of all kinds you might have a regular procession of tourists from America looking for these objects to export them from this country within the next twelve months.  I am not affected by the argument of Senator Jameson, which seemed to concentrate on the definition of historical interest.  Even without a close legal definition you can understand what is meant by its antiquity or archæological interest. &ldquo;Historical interest&rdquo; raises rather difficult questions, because you are not dealing with antiquities.  You are not dealing with a hundred years back.  Take articles of sentimental value, whose antiquity extends, say, to only 1916.  I am not urging that even these shall be exported without licence, but I can see the difficulty of requiring from a person who has such an article in his possession that he has reported it to the Keeper of Irish Antiquities and seeks a licence for export of that article.  The definition of &ldquo;historical interest&rdquo; ought perhaps to be found in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I will not argue with Senator Comyn, but I stand by my statement.  An individual who is in possession of an article of sentimental value by reason of its historical interest must report the existence of these articles to the Gárda Síochána or the Keeper of Irish Antiquities.  I think there is a certain difficulty in the term &ldquo;historical interest,&rdquo; and while I would decry any freedom being given for the sale of these articles of historical interest for export I think it is too narrow in its meaning.  It might be more clearly defined as having not merely historical interest but historical interest and some antiquity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>The real difficulty of the definition is that it contains the word &ldquo;historical.&rdquo;  The Parliamentary Secretary, in the Dáil, admitted that his object was to exclude from the purview of this Bill articles which were of purely artistic and cultural value as distinct from archæological or historical interest. He has done that, but he has kept in the word &ldquo;historical.&rdquo;  If that is kept in the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; ought to be added, for it would make it clear that articles like old silver and Waterford glass were excluded.  I object strongly to the use of the word &ldquo;historical.&rdquo;  Unfortunately there is no amendment which meets the point, but it is such an important point, and is going to affect so many people in the country that I would urge on the House what Senator Jameson has proposed.  I suggest that a week should be taken for the consideration of the matter to see if this definition could not be put in some form which would carry out the real object in view and at the same time not work out any injustice. Things may be of great historical <Col N="228" /> value, such as manuscripts or papers, that do not relate to this country at all but relate to England, France or some other country.  They are of historical interest, and is their export to be prevented?  That was not intended.  It is clear that the definitions have not been thought out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>This definition has given us a good deal of trouble all through.  As to the point referred to by Senator Brown, and other Senators, &ldquo;historical&rdquo; would include objects of other interest besides Irish.  You might have something connected with Egyptian, Italian, or English history which would be equally excluded under this.  I believe that if you adopt a hard and fast definition and say &ldquo;things of purely Irish historical interest,&rdquo; then you may knock out things that have become of historical interest in Ireland although they were not manufactured here.  The fact that at a particular stage in the history of the country we imported objects, say, from France or England, gives them a certain association with the country, and they are indicative of the state of culture here at that particular time.  I would be glad if the Seanad held up the Bill for a week so as to enable us to arrive at a definition that would give more satisfaction. <Col N="229" /> I realise that the section as drafted gives rise to a certain suspicion on the part of most people.</P>

      <P>Section 1.  To add at the end of the section the words &ldquo;other than game birds within the meaning of the Game Preservation Act, 1929.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The definition of wild birds in the first section of the present Bill includes all wild birds.  A certain number of wild birds are now within the provisions of the Game Preservation Bill, and therefore the two measures are going to overlap.  The trouble about overlapping Bills is that where for the same subject matter there are different penalties it is very difficult to make up your mind under which to go.  There ought not to be different penalties for the same matter in two Bills.  If the amendment is accepted it will include pheasants, partridge, woodcock, etc., which are mentioned and which are more amply protected by the Game Preservation Bill than by this Bill.</P>

It was alleged on a previous occasion that it is a very cruel practice, as the birds sometimes escape off the bird-lime and spend a miserable time.  That may happen, if the bird-lime is not of the proper quality.  There is no more cruelty in using bird-lime than in fishing with a hook where a defective line is used.  In that case the fish will escape with the hook tied in it, and some people do not regard that as cruelty at all, but think it quite legitimate. I am not going to say whether it is or not, but the very fact that that happens should not be a reason for preventing the use of rod fishing.  The capture of birds is regarded as a pastime with some people.  I know several people who spend half-holidays and Sundays in the country, and their amusement is the capture of birds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are not in a position to become members of golf clubs, or to take part in other amusements which would keep them in the open air. The chief benefit of all these amendments is that city people who have to spend their time in the smoky and vitiated atmosphere of the city get an opportunity to spend some hours in the open air.  I daresay that is the chief object of golf.  It is a mistake to object to poor people who cannot afford this luxury spending their time in the open air.  There are others who make a living out of capturing birds, but as a result of this section a number of them will lose their employment.  I do not see any provision in the Bill for securing other means of livelihood for them.  They may possibly be thrown on the rates at a time when we are all grumbling about the rates being high.  It is very inopportune to add to the unemployed at the present time.  All forms of sport involving the chasing of animals, birds, and fish might be regarded as cruelty to <Col N="234" /> some extent, either in a mild or in an aggravated form.  In fox hunting the animal is chased by 40 or 50 hounds and is sometimes captured and his body rent asunder by his pursuers.  Some who follow fox hunting do not consider that cruel, while others do.</P>
    <P>Then there is the coursing of hares, several of which are killed at each meeting.  That might be regarded as cruelty.  There is horse racing where sometimes the whip and the spur are used.  I daresay that many of the supporters of this clause enjoy one or other of the sports I have mentioned, where cruelty is certainly involved, but who consider themselves doing great good by preventing cruelty to birds.  I would ask them to look at this matter from the point of view of others.  Those who engage in the pastime cannot very well take up other forms of amusement, and I hope the Seanad, before agreeing to the section and throwing many people out of employment, will seriously consider the matter.</P>

      <P>I very much regret that an amendment to this effect should have appeared on the paper at all, but I still more deeply regret that the House has had to listen to the arguments by which the Senator who has just spoken recommended his amendment to it.  He told us that if good bird-lime is used there will be no cruelty, because the birds will certainly be caught.  I will take him at his word.  But it is not only the birds that will be caught which are being sought for by these sporting gentlemen who are out on Sundays for open-air amusement; it is not only the birds that are being caught.  Unfortunately there are thousands of other small birds caught by bird-lime that will not let them get away.  It cannot be got off their feet and their necks are wrung.  I can hardly imagine the attitude of mind of the Senator when he recommends his amendment by saying that if the section is carried in the form in which it is it will prevent the <Col N="235" /> youth of this country, who cannot afford to join golf clubs, going out in the open air, and will deprive them of their Sunday amusement. Well, if they cannot amuse themselves in the open air without this horrible cruelty to birds.  I think they had better stay at home.  The Senator was also very perturbed over the fact that we will be destroying the livelihood of a certain number of people.  I do not believe we will, but we will be destroying the mode by which a number of very idle people make a certain amount of money by catching birds for export. I admit that you are going to put an end to that.  It is not a business that ought to be protected, and I strongly urge the House to scout this amendment.</P>

The cock birds which are the songsters are wanted but the hens are not wanted.  They are thrown aside to die and they are very lucky if their necks are wrung.  With regard to the suggestion that people will be deprived of living, my experience is that the people who go in for this practice never did an honest day's work in their lives, and never will.  They are idle people who live by this horrible trade, if I might call it a trade.  I join with Senator Brown in regretting that such an amendment should come before the House.

      <P>For the first time I have to disagree with Senator Linehan.  I have seen this practice of catching birds and I look upon it as the height of cruelty.  It is one that should be put down.  I agree <Col N="236" /> with what Senator Miss Browne said about those who spend their time in, and make a trade of bird catching as idlers.  I know that if they were asked to do a solid day's work they would not do it, and would not know how to do it.  I think it is nothing short of a disgrace that linnets and goldfinches should be caught in country districts with bird-lime and taken away and sold.  It is looked upon as a source of revenue by the idlers who indulge in it.  I think that that practice should be put down and that birds which are natural ornaments and assets to the country should be preserved.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="237" /> I object entirely to any native wild bird being confined in a cage. I feel that the arguments I used at the last meeting of the Seanad cover the matter adequately.  This practice is, I believe, one of the cruellest in this country.  Whatever may be said about shooting a bird, to me that is much more preferable than keeping it all its life in a cage. Since the amendment was put down it has been argued that there are bird fanciers, people interested in birds, and others who get a certain amount of pleasure by keeping birds as pets or domestic friends.  I never could see that, and I cannot understand it now.  I suppose it is a question of a particular point of view, and that one is either for or against it.  Personally, I am in favour of every native wild bird being allowed free, whatever may be said for caging canaries or birds not native of this country.  I feel somewhat similarly in regard to them, but the difficulty might be that foreign birds that are caged might die by being released, as they would not be able to survive in this climate.  I am not in a position to speak on that, but in many cases it would be better if their necks were wrung than to keep them imprisoned in cages.</P>

If the amendment were passed a tremendous amount of argument would be raised, and it would be a hardship to these birds if they were released.  Possibly, if he reconsiders the matter he might put down a date, say, five years or three years hence, after which these birds could not be kept.</P>

      <P>I would be very glad if we could successfully carry an amendment like this, that is carry it without getting the opinion of the public up against us, and perhaps affecting the fate of the Bill in the other House.  I very much object to seeing wild birds in cages, but the cruelty is very largely mitigated by the fact that they are taken when very young, and are confined all their lives.  If you let them out now they could not fend for themselves and would die.  If this amendment were carried there ought to be a clause put in the Bill that the owner of these birds should be obliged to destroy them painlessly.  It is asking too much and even in the time limit that Senator The McGillycuddy suggests would be difficult to carry out.  It could not be carried out because at the end of five or six years, or whatever period would be put in the Bill, you would have the same difficulty.  People would still have these pet friends, which are all kindly treated.  They do not suffer, and are well fed.  Except for the fact that they cannot get out they are not in any way cruelly treated.</P>

      <P>My superficial sentiment tends to support this amendment, but I really feel that it is far in advance of any public opinion that can be rallied, and that the reasons for it are not quite convincing. It confines the prohibition to native wild birds, and while Senator Connolly would like to make it a general prohibition, he feels that there may be reasons for allowing foreign wild birds to be caged. His sympathy prevails in respect of the native wild bird, but it does not extend to the foreign wild bird.  But a bird in a cage is just as much hurt if it had been hatched in the Canary Islands, as if it had been hatched in Ireland, so that from that point of view there is no reason for confining it to native birds.  The argument put forward by Senator Linehan on another <Col N="239" /> amendment, has a very definite appeal to me, and when we talk of cruelty to birds and yet encourage all kinds of torture of other animals in the name of sport, there is a contradiction of minds.  But if we are thinking not merely of the effect upon the bird but of the effect upon the human who captures and imprisons it, against that I put the very evident fact that in the towns and cities, particularly in the cities, there are many thousands of children who do not ever hear a bird sing except when it is caged and hanging out of a bedroom window.  Undoubtedly you have to put the pleasure that so many thousands derive from the song of the caged bird against the effect upon the character, the mentality and the feelings of the person who does the caging.  I am leaving out of account the sentimental regard for the bird's own feelings. But I think that it will go a long way towards preventing the remainder of the Bill from passing if you insert this amendment.  Undoubtedly this provision, if passed, will raise the active protest of a very large number of people, and in that way I think that feeling against the Bill as a whole will be engendered. Therefore, I think it would be inadvisable to press this amendment.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Johnson's arguments with regard to people who wish to keep singing birds in their houses.  I am sure that it is quite well known to everybody here that it is the wish of a great many tradesmen and people who are working in shops to keep birds in cages in order to hear them singing.  I object to the wholesale way in which wild birds are caught with bird-lime and exported. I have seen hundreds of birds taken in Kildare for that purpose, and I look upon it as a downright act of brigandage to deprive any district of its birds.  But I would be very sorry if anybody who wished to keep a bird should be deprived from doing so.  I know a great many people who like to keep singing birds and who breed them in cages <Col N="240" /> in their own homes.  As has been stated, if these birds were liberated they would not be able to live, especially those which are bred by people in their own homes.  I know one friend of mine who puts a piece of sod in a lark's cage.  I do not know whether the lark is foolish enough to imagine he is at liberty or not, but he treats his owner to as much singing as he would hear in the open.  I think it would be very hard on these people if they were deprived of keeping birds in their houses.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that the sense of the House is against me. I would be quite willing to put any time limit or period into the amendment if that would help to meet the wishes of the House.  My point is that by allowing the caging of birds in my opinion you justify the capture of birds by bird-lime or some other means.  The criticisms I have heard of the amendment have not convinced me that it is a right or a desirable thing to cage birds.  My reason for limiting the amendment to native wild birds was, as I stated, that we can control native wild birds; the others are not indigenous to this country and are usually born in captivity.  Arguments have been used about the sports of fishing, hunting, and shooting, but we are not arguing about these at the moment.  If we were I would have a very definite opinion with regard to them too.  Senator Sir John Keane mentioned the Zoological Gardens.  In my opinion they are the greatest exhibition of cruelty to <Col N="241" /> animals that I know of.  I will withdraw the amendment until the Report Stage, and I will consult with Senator Brown to see how the spirit of it could be embodied in the Bill.</P>

In order to put Section 8 in force, that is, in order to get protection for the eggs of any bird, you have to get the county council to apply to the Minister and to state the reasons why they want protection for the eggs which they mention in their application.  It has, therefore, to go through the county council.  I do not think that there are any county councils in the Free State which will not take very good care of the farmers. There are very few of them where the majority of the members are not themselves farmers, and they may be trusted to take care that an application to prevent the taking of eggs will not include the eggs of birds of a destructive nature like the poor house sparrow.  This has been the law for more than twenty years; it is not a new provision but has been in operation since 1904.  Therefore I ask the House not to accept the amendment.</P>

    <P>This is another case of overlapping, because the birds which are mentioned in the First Schedule as it stands comprise thirteen which are game under the Game Bill.  This amendment is to exclude those, so as to prevent overlapping.</P>

      <P>I put in the guillemot because they may be taken to include the kittiwake also.  Senator Brown does not agree with me, but as a farmer of practical experience I know that the guillemot, the kittiwake, and the lark do great damage to corn in some seasons.  I have not the slightest doubt about that.  Of course I live near the seashore, and the experience of farmers who live inland may not be the same.  I see no reason whatever why a farmer should not be allowed to protect his crops from injury by these birds.  As the Bill stands he will not be allowed to do so.</P>

      <P>I am also a farmer who lives near the sea and who is familiar with the habits of sea birds. I am sorry to differ from Senator Butler, who is also a farmer, but as far as my experience goes all kinds of guillemot are perfectly harmless to crops, as also is the kittiwake. We have very large numbers of these birds in county Wexford, on account of the large areas of slob-lands there, lands reclaimed from the sea.  I have consulted people in my own part of the country, and their experience is that neither the guillemot nor the kittiwake eats corn.  However, I am only speaking for my own part of the country.  I do not wish to differ from another farmer.  I know what the farmers' troubles are and I do not want to increase them in any way, but as far as my experience goes neither of these birds does any harm.</P>

      <P>Senator Butler hears the song of the lark as well as everybody else, and I am sure he appreciates it very much.  I suppose the lark does eat a few of the seeds as they come up, but it also eats the grubs that destroy the corn.  I think if Senator Butler would put the credit down against the debit he would find that the balance is very <Col N="247" /> much in favour of the lark, and I think he ought to leave the lark in the Schedule.  The guillemot and the kittiwake are just gulls.  We have a large number of gulls, both on the wing and on foot, and I would not be inclined to say much in favour of them.  But I certainly would be very much in favour of the lark.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Seanad not to accept this amendment either.  As far as the lark is concerned it is true that at certain seasons of the year the wild larks flock&mdash;not native larks as much as those that come from other places&mdash; and about the month of September or October they do infest the stubble fields, but they really only eat grain that has been shaken out of the corn already, and they do not do any harm.  Until last week I never heard the kittiwake charged with the crime of eating crops.  I have since consulted the highest authority on birds in this country and he assured me that the kittiwake is an absolutely marine bird, that it does all its feeding on the shore in salt water, and that it really never touches the farmers' crops.  As to the guillemot I am not so sure.  I think it is very likely that he and a number of his fellow gulls do in the autumn get a meal off the farmer's corn occasionally.  But the farmer forgets that these gulls attend his ploughing in myriads in the spring and gobble up quantities of noxious grubs that would otherwise damage his crops.  They are his friends in the spring but his enemies in the autumn.</P>
