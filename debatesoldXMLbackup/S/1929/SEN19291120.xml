    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is well known to members of the House.  It was introduced as a result of the recommendation, I think I might say the almost unanimous recommendation, of a Joint Committee. <Col N="10" /> The Bill has been a considerable time in the Dáil, and while it was there a certain amount of nervousness was apparently aroused, with the result that some amendments were introduced to safeguard the Dáil.  The object of the Bill of course is to make it possible for this House, if it is really dissatisfied with the declaration of the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil that a Bill is a Money Bill, to have a reasonable chance of questioning it by providing a period of seven days, which is a short period enough as it stands, within which to question the decision.  The amendment inserted in the Bill provided that if the Committee did not make a decision and report within twenty-one days, then the decision of the Ceann Comhairle shall prevail and shall be definite.  That, I take it, was introduced lest the influence of the Seanad on the Committee might make them delay and make no report at all.  Therefore, the constitutional provision that there are only twenty-one days to consider a Money Bill might be of no effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me, when we come to consider this Bill in detail, while we should undoubtedly approve of the principle, we shall be obliged as a result of the amendment to make some safeguard for the Seanad. There is no provision at all in the Bill that the Dáil will appoint three members.  There is also no provision that they will meet within twenty-one days for the purpose of appointing three members.  As we know, it is not at all uncommon for a number of Bills to be sent to this House and for the Dáil to adjourn for a number of weeks, coming back afterwards to consider any amendments we may make.  It seems to me that if this Bill is to be effective there will have to be some provision to deal with the situation, should either House fail to appoint three members.  I think that the proper procedure would be, in the event of setting up a Committee of Privileges and of either House failing to appoint three members, that the Committee should be given power to act without waiting for the appointment of these <Col N="11" /> three members.  If that is not done, the provision regarding a report within twenty-one days may, through inadvertence, operate so that this House may be unable to have the matter considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>There seem to be other points, in addition to those raised by Senator Douglas, which I should submit for the consideration of the House.  There does not seem to be any provision for communicating the certificate of the Chairman of the Dáil to the Chairman of the Seanad in this Bill, so that the Chairman of the Dáil might certify and his certificate might remain during the seven days in which we have a right to call for a Committee. Another question also arises.  I see that the Committee is to consist of three members elected by the Dáil and three by the Seanad, with a chairman who shall be the Senior Judge of the Supreme Court, able and willing to act.  That means the same person in all cases.  I would recommend to the Seanad the adoption of an amendment so as to provide some kind of rota, because probably the judge's decision might not be acceptable&mdash;undoubtedly it will be according to his own judgment and good sense&mdash;to a section of the House, and it may be desirable to have a rota of judges of the Supreme Court from which one would be selected to act as chairman.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Senator meant by saying that the certificate of the Chairman of the Dáil would remain during seven days.  When the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil certifies a Bill as a Money Bill, he does it openly; everybody knows it, and that fact is communicated to the Seanad without any subterfuge.  It remains, not for seven days, but until it is upset. Machinery for upsetting it is prescribed here, in the event of objections. As regards the Supreme Court Judge, it is not necessarily the same person.  Various things might happen.  If the Chief Justice, who is the Senior Judge, were unable to act <Col N="12" /> or were to vacate his office, that would not mean the same person and so on down along the list.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose that the reason that this Bill is not certified as a Money Bill is because of the inclusion in it of the third section. All the rest of the Bill, as regards the money to be given to the college in Galway, is purely a matter of money.  There is some reason why an increase in the annual grant should be given.  I do not suppose that any member of this House would at all object to the education imparted in Galway College being made as efficient as possible by having sufficient grants to carry it on, but when we come to Section 3, I wonder whether the House has studied it.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It shall be the duty of the Senate of the National University of Ireland, the Governing Body of the College, or the President of the College (as the case may be), when making an appointment to any <Col N="13" /> office or situation in the College, to appoint to such office or situation a person who is competent to discharge the duties thereof through the medium of the Irish language, provided a person so competent and also suitable in all other respects is to be found amongst the persons who are candidates or otherwise available for such appointment.</P>
    <P>Many people would say that that is of no importance, probably because such an individual does not exist at present.  Probably there may be one or two, but there cannot be many more, persons who are capable of teaching Latin, Greek, Mathematics, Medicine, Surgery, or anything else in the Irish language.  If this is merely meant as an expression of opinion, that at some distant day we shall have the Irish language so spoken in learned circles that men capable of filling these posts can be appointed, there is not very much in it, but one ought to look at it a little further.  One has the reputation of the Free State a bit at heart, and when you think of any senate of a university that is bound to make appointments under such an order of that kind, and when you think of the senates of the universities of the world looking at what we, Free Staters, are doing, I am afraid that everyone of us must say that we are putting education at a very low level. Of course, it may be possible for people to teach these other subjects through the medium of Irish, but the ordinary individual who is educated in a university or college must know that he himself must first of all have a competent knowledge of the Irish language if he is to be taught in that language.  The first thing that one would say as regards poor Galway College is that there cannot at present be under-graduates there who could possibly take their education in that way.  We know exactly what state the Irish language is in in this country.  How could any class of under-graduates be got together at present to study medicine, surgery, mathematics, or any other subject if the mode of teaching is through the <Col N="14" /> Irish language?  Surely professors in a university should be chosen because they know the subject which they are going to teach and not because they have a little knowledge of something else which has nothing to do with the subject which they are going to teach.  Why it is necessary to tack on that section in the Bill I cannot see, though everyone of us is perfectly willing to pass the Bill and to help Galway College in every way possible.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose that at present it is any use opposing the Bill because that clause is in it.  I think a great many of those who are listening to me have as much interest in Irish education and the reputation of our Irish colleges and universities as I have, and I do not think that we should let it go out amongst the universities of the world that that is the kind of education which the Free State is trying to put forward.  This, in my opinion, is a very great pity. That it cannot be carried out, and that it will probably not injure Galway College at present I perfectly agree, but when you take it as an expression of what the two Houses of the Oireachtas propose to do with their universities, and the kind of standard which they propose to apply to the professors and lecturers in the universities as to the knowledge which they must possess, I think it is a very great pity.  If it has to be done, it has to be done.  It may be a gesture, but it is one that I would be very hard pressed to defend in any university centre in any part of the world.  I think that in Ireland we ought to try, if we can, to keep our heads in the air and see that the education imparted in our schools and universities is fit to be compared with the educational systems of other countries, and that the men who teach in our schools and universities are chosen with as high a standard of competence as could be found anywhere.  I do not think that anybody could defend this clause in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if it is wise to deal at any length with the remarks made by Senator Jameson. <Col N="15" /> Senator Jameson is, in my opinion, running true to form.  He represents a certain opinion that still exists in this country, and that is apparently oblivious of the spiritual and national outlook of the country. I will try to deal with one point that he mentions, and it has reference to the position we occupy in the eyes of university people throughout the world.  It has been to me always a humiliation to meet university people from other parts of the world, and the main humiliation in meeting them arises from the fact that the universities in this country up to the present have shown no distinctive mark any more than there might be in universities in Birmingham, London or Glasgow.  University visitors from other parts of the world on their first visit here are invariably amazed that the Irish language, Irish folk-lore and the linking up of folk-lore and tradition, and all that the Irish language stands for, are, to a great extent, neglected in our universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that Senator Jameson is aware of the very live activities in all the universities in Northern Europe.  In those universities a great deal of money and labour is being expended in an attempt to link up folk-lore, traditions and the old cultures of different nations. That activity is mainly directed through the different university groups.  In Ireland at the present time we have people visiting in order to study the Irish language and ancient Irish culture.  They go to the Gaeltacht in order properly to understand these things, so that ultimately they will be able to link up the traditions of Gaelic culture and associate them with the traditions of their own culture and their folk-lore at home.  The attitude adopted by Senator Jameson is typical.  It is something that we have heard enough about in the Seanad to leave aside for good.  It is the intention of the people, of the present Government, and of a Government that may come in the future&mdash;at all events, it is the intention of the two big parties <Col N="16" /> at present in the country&mdash;to see that the Irish language is made a national issue.</P>
    <P>With regard to Galway University, I would remind Senator Jameson that it is situated at the nearest possible cultural point to the Gaeltacht itself and in that area practically 45 per cent. of the people are Gaelic-speaking.  Surely it is not too much to expect that what I might call the minor university of Ireland will devote its attention in some form to the development of Gaelic culture in that area.  I do not think the people whom Senator Jameson represents have any grievance.  We have two universities in Dublin, one in Cork, and one outside our scope&mdash; Queen's University, Belfast&mdash;and surely it is not too much to expect that at least one university, and that, perhaps, the smallest and the least endowed, will get a chance to rehabilitate in this country its national traditions.  With these remarks I will leave Senator Jameson to his own thoughts and to your mercy.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this is the opportune time, but I would like to suggest one thing in regard to this Bill.  In the apportionment of this grant, if the administration have any control over the expenditure of it, there should be some attempt to direct that a certain amount of the increased grant should go towards the more intensive development of the literary side of the language coming from the Gaeltacht.  I also suggest that a certain portion of it should be set aside for the gathering together, the recording and the safe keeping of such vocal traditions as still exist in the Gaeltacht.  There is no doubt that each year that goes by sees a certain amount of the folklore of the country going into the grave.  I understand from those who are competent to speak on the matter, that a very considerable amount of folklore has been lost during the last few years.  I venture to make the suggestion to the present administration that they should advise the university authorities in Galway to devote special attention to this side of the matter, namely, the preservation of folklore.  There is <Col N="17" /> something there that we should save from being lost.  Once it is gone it can never be recovered; not all the grants that the Oireachtas can make will revive it once it has passed away.  It is, as I say, a question of daily and annual loss.  This loss is going on constantly.  The older people who have this folklore are dying out.  I do not want to labour the matter.  I am sorry that there is no one here, so far as I know, who would be likely to bring this matter up.  There are lots of people who are much more competent than I to speak on such an important matter. I urge strongly that a recommendation be issued from the Government to the Galway University authorities that a portion of this money should be set aside for the purposes I have outlined.</P>
    <P>There is one other point in connection with the administration of Galway University just as in connection with other universities.  Do we get any record of how the money is apportioned and spent throughout the various universities?  I have no doubt that the money is wisely spent in the best interests of education in the universities, but I see by the last financial returns that university accounts are audited by the Department of the Comptroller and Auditor-General. I think that is the position.  I do not know whether the actual disbursements of the amount of the grant, etc., are made known, or whether they are available to the public generally or to the members of this House.  On the expenditure of the money in the other educational departments we do get a very clear analysis.  I am not for a moment suggesting that the money voted for the universities is money that is badly spent.  I would like to know, and it would help us to sustain our interest in the various branches of education if we could know, how this money is spent. If it were possible it would be most helpful to have enlightenment on that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the lamentable phrases that Senator <Col N="18" /> Jameson has poured out before us, I think none of us can feel very sorry that he is disappointed in this Bill.  He has sung the swan-song of the old régime.  He is trying to rake up the old spirit and to keep it on.  The truth is that it is hopelessly dead.  It is peculiar at this time that he and others like him have not tried to accommodate themselves to the views of the young people of this country, the people who are growing up with different ideas.  They come from a different set of people.  Of course Senator Jameson and those he represents have never tried to do that.  They have always tried to hold on to the old traditions which are dying out, and which have become in the last few years hopelessly washed out. Of course, Senator Jameson, like many other people in this country, has no idea of what the state of the Irish language really is.  These people imagine that that language is completely dead, that no one wants to revive it, and so on; or else they think it is an attempt at a revival of some antiquated language like Hebrew or some such language. The Senator ought by this time have learned that it is nothing of the kind.  He ought to have learned that the Government of this country, whichever side is in power, is determined to make the Irish language the language of this country, the spoken and written language of this country, and that any lamentations by him and others are merely beating the air and are quite useless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator speaks about the Irish language as being at a very low level, and he said that if he had to defend the low level in education here before any university he would be sneered at.  The truth is that all intelligent and thoughtful people who come to this country from such places as Germany, Norway or France regard the Irish language as being the language that should be kept up in the country.  They think that every effort should be made by the Government and the people to keep it up.  People of that kind who come over here attach more importance <Col N="19" /> to the revival of the Irish language than to any other activity of the Government.  Therefore, Senator Jameson is entirely wrong when he speaks of the Irish language as being at a low level in the matter of education. I do not think that it is really necessary on my part to spend much time over this matter, because what I say is already admitted by thoughtful people.  I would, however, urge Senator Jameson to try as a sensible man to get it into his head and into the heads of other people like himself that all this talk against the Irish language is unwise. By doing that, they are setting themselves up against the opinion of the people and the public life of the people in this and every other country.</P>
    <P>In every country all over Europe the universities are engaged in teaching these small languages which were being crushed out by greater languages; and we look upon ours as the greatest of these languages.  They speak German in Bohemia, and they speak the French language in Belgium, and so on.  All these languages are being taught in the universities.  In Ghent they are establishing a university which is to be purely Flemish.  I know that Flemish is more widely spoken in Belgium than Irish is in Ireland, but we all know that this is a matter that requires to be built up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak on this measure, because I expected that the Second Reading would receive general assent.  I am in favour of this Bill chiefly because of this third section, and because I believe that this third section is to be put energetically into operation. I cannot allow to pass unchallenged the statement that was made by Senator Jameson that there are not two people in this country capable of instructing pupils through the medium of the Irish language, and that there are not two pupils in Ireland capable of receiving instruction in the Irish language.  That statement, to my mind, simply shows that Senator Jameson is entirely <Col N="20" /> oblivious of the culture that is growing up around him.  He is oblivious of the fact that even before this Irish language revival there were many teachers, and those the best teachers, who were capable of instructing pupils in the Irish language. There were some pupils who were capable of receiving that instruction in Irish, and I was one of them myself.</P>
      <P>There is always something heroic in the attitude of the man who stands up to defend lost causes.  I remember reading about a man who burned himself in his own house sooner than receive the light of Christianity from Saint Patrick.  He was the last of the pagans.  There is something heroic about being the last of the pagans.  I would like to impress upon the House as forcibly as I can the need for the revival, or rather the preservation, of the folk-lore of the West which has been referred to by Senator Connolly.  Some Senators may not know that in the West there is still a Gaelic civilisation, possessing a very high culture. Senator Jameson and others would be willing to admit that amongst the poor people in the West of Ireland there is a refinement which is not to be found amongst the poor in other parts of the British Isles, a refinement of culture and a nobility of character which they find it hard to explain.  But I will give him the explanation now.  These things are a survival of the culture which existed in Ireland, and particularly in the West of Ireland, more than 2,000 years ago.  That culture and that refinement are not yet dead.  They survived like the Irish language, and they will survive, and I hope that this university which is being endowed&mdash;not very liberally&mdash;is being endowed for the express purpose of preserving the refinement and continuing that refinement and that Irish culture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that in time Senator Jameson will become a convert.  I am certain he will, because I do not see how any man who has a patriotic or honest outlook can fail to become a convert to the preservation of this <Col N="21" /> Gaelic civilisation.  Now, I hold that you cannot have Gaelic civilisation in this country revived unless you have schools and unless you have a university in which to foster it. Neither can you have a Gaelic State. I hope to see as an adjunct to, or as part of, the Gaelic revival a Gaelic university in the West of Ireland, with high culture and with professors of great attainments&mdash;a university that will be spoken of in all parts of the world.  Senator Moore mentioned that in Ghent at the present time they are attempting to revive the Flemish language and to establish it as the spoken tongue in that university.  Quite right and proper. The Flemish tongue as spoken in Belgium does not compare with the Irish tongue from the cultural and philological point of view.  The Irish language was the language of a great many European countries at one time.  I do not pretend to be a scholar, but scholars will tell you that from the philological point of view, from the cultural point of view, Gaelic is more interesting, and certainly more important, than the tongue which we are speaking here to-day.  I am sure you will give this Bill a Second Reading, and I am going to vote for it on the express understanding that the clause which is so objectionable to Senator Jameson is going to be put into full force and operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Out of sympathy with one who has often played a lone hand in this House, I would not like it to go forth that Senator Jameson is the only one who holds, in substance, the views that he expressed. Senator Comyn drew a picturesque metaphor of the heroic persons who defended a lost cause. I could draw an equally picturesque metaphor of the brave persons who attempt to prevent people from rushing to their doom, and I am not at all certain that, in effect, that sentiment is not held by many people who, Senator Comyn suggests, are his supporters.  I go about the country and I do not find this fierce enthusiasm for the compulsory revival of the Irish language that I <Col N="22" /> hear expressed by public representatives. If only for that reason I regret that the Government cut into the Constitution and repealed the Article dealing with the Referendum. I feel bold to assert that if there was an honest Referendum to-day on a clear-cut issue such as this, and if people were left without pressure to express their opinion as to whether they wished the language to be compulsory in education, there would be an overwhelming answer in the negative.  I do not believe that Senator Comyn's sentimental feeling is shared by the rank and file of the people.</P>
      <P>But, after all, this is not a matter of lost causes or sentiment, or tradition, or what is going to be; it is a matter of right or wrong; it is a matter of common sense.  Is the country and is Galway College going to prosper under a doctrine such as is implicit in Clause 3?  I do not say that if you had everything equal in other respects there would be any harm whatever in teaching sciences through the medium of Irish if it were possible. But implicit in that clause is undoubtedly almost an instruction that the scales shall be weighted in favour of instruction through the medium of Irish.  As Senator Moore knows, one very ardent Gaelic advocate in the Dáil pointed out how absurd that was, that there are no text books in any of these scientific subjects.  Another Deputy was questioned as to whether such teaching was taking place, but he said he was unable to give a clear answer. Of course, it is common knowledge that it is impossible, and will be impossible for many years to come, to teach sciences like higher mathematics, medicine, and the other arts, through the medium of Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the issue?  I agree that if you could find a complete and isolated civilisation in the Gaeltacht and if Galway College were only asked to produce men to fill openings in the Gaeltacht, there would not be very much harm.  But we know that that is not the case; we know that there is a large surplus, <Col N="23" /> and that if Galway College, or Galway University&mdash;I am not quite sure which it is&mdash;is going to be used to the fullest advantage there must be a large export of pupils to outside the Gaeltacht&mdash;I do not necessarily say outside the Free State.  In those conditions picture a young man who knows that he cannot find an occupation in an Irish-speaking district.  Is he going to a university where the scales are so much weighted, where instruction is biased in favour of the Irish language?  I say no.  That is the test to apply.  That overweighs all the sentiment.  Bread and butter comes first, unfortunately, in this world.  You may have all your high ideals, but those noble sentiments do not cut very much ice if people cannot earn bread and butter.  After all, is that not the acid test of all practical things in this world?  I think that all Senator Jameson has suggested was that we should go slowly, not try to force the pace, and keep sentiment more in line with reality.</P>
    <P>There is no difference of opinion with regard to Gaelic folklore and scholarship.  Nobody would accuse me of being an ardent advocate of Gaelic instruction, but I would be glad to see its scholarship developed, to see a Chair set up for the preservation of Gaelic traditions and all that Gaelic civilisation stands for. But that is quite a different matter from trying to force the teaching of practical subjects through the medium of the Irish language, if people cannot find an opening in this country for their qualifications hereafter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that any of the Senators who have spoken have really read the Bill very carefully. According to its Title it is &ldquo;to make provision for increasing the annual grant payable to University College, Galway, and for securing that persons appointed to offices and situations in that college shall be competent to discharge their duties through the medium of the Irish language.&rdquo;  The third section has apparently been very hastily read by most Senators.  After pointing out: <Col N="24" />&ldquo;It shall be the duty of the Senate of the National University of Ireland, the Governing Body of the College, or the President of the College, when making an appointment to any office or situation in the college, to appoint to such office or situation a person who is competent to discharge the duties thereof through the medium of the Irish language,&rdquo; it goes on to say: &ldquo;Provided a person so competent and also suitable in all other respects is to be found amongst the persons who are candidates or otherwise available for such appointment.&rdquo;  I do not think that Senator Moore, Senator Comyn, and Senator Connolly read that very carefully.</P>
      <P>There might be something to be said in respect of the point that was put by Senator Jameson if it were not for that clause.  That is an important clause.  It practically ensures that a person appointed to a professorship in the college shall not be appointed by reason of his knowledge of the Irish language unless he is competent in other respects.  I do not think that the most hardened supporter of the Irish language would claim, or could claim, more than that.</P>

    <P>This college is situated in an Irish-speaking district.  Apart altogether from any sentiment in connection with the matter, it must be remembered that a considerable number of people in that area speak the Irish language.  They ought to be afforded the same university facilities as other people.  I do not think that that would be denied, even by those who might not otherwise agree with the proposal.  This is the most suitable college in respect of which it would be possible to have such a policy as that, and allowing that that is so, there is a sound commonsense reason for having that college to function in such a manner as to accommodate a large proportion of our students.  It is perfectly true that text-books are not now available, but I would expect that we ought at least, no matter what views we have on the Irish language, if we accept Irish citizenship, to hope to <Col N="25" /> live to see the introduction of such text-books.  I would certainly put this point very strongly, that it is not the purpose of the Government, nor is it, so far as I know, the purpose of any political party, to get persons into university positions whose only qualification would be a knowledge of the Irish language. That would absolutely defeat the purpose.  University education is one of the most important services in the State.</P>
    <P>I do not know that I could subscribe to all the criticisms of Senator Jameson and his friends that were uttered by some Senators.  I should say, on looking over the history of the Irish movement for the last seventy or eighty years, that the real stalwarts in support of the culture and the language we have heard about came from the very people that Senator Jameson has been so closely associated with.  I do not think it will be denied that such remarkable men as O'Donovan, O'Curry and others came from Dublin University.  Their work remains as a monument to them.  The support of the Irish cultural movement, and of the Irish language movement, is not the preserve of any class in the country.  It ought to be the pride of all parties, and they should do all they could to contribute towards making it a success.  But I think that we ought to start out with this at any rate, that we are not going to stand for a State in respect of which a passing knowledge of the Irish language is to be our hope or our aim.  What we are looking to, and what we hope to get, is a real scholarly knowledge of that language, and a scholarly knowledge of other subjects, if possible, through that language, and the sooner the better.</P>

      <P>I do not know why it is that Senator Johnson is anxious to be informed, because I presume, as far as he is concerned, he is fully informed with regard to the Bill.  I think it would be wasting the time of the Seanad if I went into any great details in regard to the history of this Bill, because I am sure the facts are well-known to Senators.  As Senators are aware, a certain dispute arose in regard to the award of compensation to civil servants who retired in consequence of the change of Government.  Litigation followed, and a decision was ultimately given by the Supreme Court.  The civil servants concerned secured permission to appeal to the Privy Council, and an appeal was heard.  A decision, or an advice shall we say, was given by the Privy Council which was regarded by the Government of the Saorstát, and by the British Government, as being contrary to the intentions of the signatories to the Treaty, and as, in fact, giving something to the appellants in the case that they were not entitled to.  There were negotiations between the two Governments, negotiations which were necessary in order that their views might be brought into accord on the interpretation of the Treaty.  As I already stated in the Dáil, we regarded the judgment given by the Supreme Court here as the true interpretation of the particular section of the Treaty which was affected.  The British Government, whatever individual members of it might think, were bound, in their position, to regard the view of the Privy Council as giving the true interpretation of that section of the Treaty.  That <Col N="27" /> meant that the two Governments were in form, shall I say&mdash;rather in form than in fact&mdash;in disagreement with regard to the interpretation of the Treaty.</P>
      <P>This agreement brings the two Governments into accord once again. As I have already explained, it imposes no burden on the Exchequer or the taxpayers of the Saorstát.  The civil servants who gave notice of retirement before the 1st March got compensation on the scale recommended by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, but the difference between the amount calculated on that scale and the amount calculated on a scale in accordance with the judgment of the Supreme Court is provided for by the British Government. So far as civil servants retiring after the 1st March are concerned, they get their compensation on the basis of the Supreme Court's judgment. The Bill sets out more clearly certain matters which were contained in the Act of 1920 as carried forward by the Treaty.  In these matters of detail the Bill follows the decisions that were already given by the Wylie Committee in cases that came before it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggested that there should be an explanation given of the import and purpose of this Bill, because it seemed to me to be too important a Bill, raising extremely important issues, to be left to the House without an explanation, and I am not sure that even the explanation the Minister has given satisfies the requirements of the case.  In my view, the Bill that is before us, and the circumstances out of which it arises, bring to public light in these countries questions that will have repercussions for many years, perhaps generations, and I venture the prophesy that the case of Wigg and Cochrane versus the Attorney-General, will be cited in constitutional history in the future as the turning point in the whole constitutional relationships between Great Britain, the Irish Free State, and the British Dominions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="28" /> I think there are at least two very serious issues raised by the presentation of this Bill.  The Minister has pointed out that it arises out of a claim made by two persons, representing a large number of other persons, against the Attorney-General, in regard to the compensation that was to be awarded them on their retirement from the service of the Free State Government.  The claim was decided in favour of the plaintiffs&mdash;the civil servants&mdash;in the court presided over by Mr. Justice Meredith.  The State appealed to the Supreme Court which decided, first that as civil servants the plaintiffs had no right whatever in court &mdash;they had no justiciable right&mdash;and second, even if they had, the judgment of Mr. Justice Meredith was faulty, and that the amount they had claimed as compensation could not be calculated in the manner decided by Mr. Justice Meredith.  Following that Supreme Court decision the Civil Service transferred officers sought special leave to appeal to the Privy Council.  The case was formally against the Attorney-General of the Irish Free State.  The Attorney-General resisted that application for leave to appeal to the Privy Council.  Leave was granted, nevertheless, and the Attorney-General, on behalf of the Irish Free State, appeared and pleaded the case of the Irish Free State against the appellants, the civil servants, before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.  It will be remembered that this case, in fact, was cited by the late Minister for Justice, Mr. Kevin O'Higgins, as the kind of case, if any kind of case could be, which might reasonably be appealed to the Privy Council.  This was the kind of case that might be so appealed, and as seeming to confirm his opinion expressed in the Dáil, the Irish Free State Government did in fact appear and plead the cause of the Irish Free State before the Privy Council.</P>
    <P>The advice of the Privy Council was to confirm the judgment of Mr. Justice Meredith, thereby overruling the decision of the Supreme Court of <Col N="29" /> the Irish Free State.  So that what was in fact the law under which the Civil Service transferred officers were living and acting was declared by the Privy Council to be that which had been affirmed by Mr. Justice Meredith.  The advice of the Privy Council was subsequently made a rule of court in Mr. Justice Meredith's court.  Speaking as a layman, I imagine that meant that the law, as decided by the courts of the Free State, was such as Mr. Justice Meredith had pronounced.  The judgment of the Free State court, therefore, was in favour of the plaintiffs, but the Executive Government of the Free State, in almost as many words, stated bluntly, and if one might say so, almost blatantly, that they were not going to obey the judgement of the court.  They defied the judgment of the court of the Irish Free State.  That was the position for quite a considerable number of months.  Though I am not aware of all the facts in regard to who paid and the amount paid, I understand that not until the spring of this year was the judgment of the Irish Free State court against the Executive Council of the Irish Free State obeyed by that Executive Council.  It seems to me that is a very serious position for the Executive Council of the country to have taken up.  I think it is extremely serious as an example to citizens generally as to how they ought to treat the courts of the Irish Free State.  It is no doubt true that the position which the Executive Council has taken has been that the law is as the Supreme Court of the Irish Free State decides.  If they had stood by that decision, I think they could have been supported, and I think they would have deserved entire support from all of us, but when they appeared and argued the case before the Privy Council, it seems to me that they, by that fact, accepted the position that whatever the Privy Council decided as the law was to be the law, and that they would obey it.</P>
    <P>Therefore I say there has been an issue raised of very great moment indeed, so far as I have stated it. <Col N="30" /> But other issues have been raised possibly even of greater importance, because what I have so far dealt with may be rather formal than actual, and may not have any practically serious consequences, though as an example of how the courts of the Irish Free State ought to be treated, I think it is very serious.  A bad example was set by the Executive Council. If any excuse or justification could be made for the action of the Executive Council it could only be, I think, on the assumption that they divined in advance something of the character of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in their hearing of the particular case.  The Committee of the Privy Council which heard the case and decided in favour of the appellants&mdash;that is, of the transferred officers&mdash; consisted of the Lord Chancellor of the time, Lord Justice Cave, and two ex-Lord Chancellors, besides one who had been, or was at the time, head of the Scottish Judiciary. They gave their judgment. It was reported, and it was made a rule of court by the Irish courts. A couple of years afterwards during which there had been a considerable amount of controversy and discussion the matter was brought up in the House of Lords and, strange as it may seem, two of the judges who had sat on the Judicial Committee, one of them being ex-Lord Chancellor Viscount Haldane and another Viscount Dunedin who was a Scottish Lord, made a statement to the effect that in coming to their decision they had blundered.  Lord Birkenhead, who was Secretary for India at the time, speaking with his authority as a lawyer, supported the case made by Viscount Haldane and Viscount Dunedin by presenting a statement which was alleged to have been made by the presiding judge, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Cave, within 24 hours of his death, in which he also is supposed to have said that a mistake had been made.</P>
    <P>It is important I think that the House should be made aware shortly of what actually occurred.  Viscount Haldane said that this decision concerned, <Col N="31" /> not only those civil servants who had been transferred to the Irish Service, but also a large body of civil servants here&mdash;that is in Great Britain&mdash;&ldquo;and far from it being a question of the pension of individuals it is a question which affects the pensions of the whole body of English civil servants who come within this decision.  Consequently&rdquo;&mdash;and I ask the House to bear this in mind&mdash;&ldquo;the English Treasury have bestirred themselves since the case.  I only wish we had had the English Treasury before us at the hearing so that we might have had the information which was largely necessary in order to dispose of this question.&rdquo;  Because of the fact that the judgment had effects upon the whole body of English civil servants, it was necessary to reconsider the judgment.  Lord Haldane said: &ldquo;It is a question for careful inquiry, because the effect of the conclusions of the judgment in this particular case, if it is taken literally, is to give a vast number of persons, who have no more title to the money than any of your lordships individually have, sums which will be paid some of them out of the English Treasury, some of them out of the Free State Treasury, and others out of the Northern Ireland Treasury.&rdquo;  I draw attention specially to the point that the English Treasury bestirred themselves after the judgment was delivered.  I do not think anyone going through this discussion in the House of Lords could come to the conclusion that it was because of a sudden knowledge coming upon the individual law-lords that a mistake had been made, but that somebody after the judgment had been delivered intimated to them that probably a mistake had been made&mdash;somebody representing or speaking on behalf of the English Treasury&mdash;and because of a certain political effect of the judgment those who had decided the case felt bound to come to the House of Lords and declare that a reconsideration of the judgment ought to be made.</P>
    <P>Viscount Haldane said that &ldquo;Viscount <Col N="32" /> Cave, in a most careful and painstaking judgment, applied the broad conclusion of principle and applied it with a knowledge that there was a whole series of Treasury Minutes, but without any clear knowledge of the effect of the whole series of Treasury Minutes, without any clear knowledge of the effect of the Minute of March 20th, 1922, which really applies to this case.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Viscount Dunedin followed and referred to the fact that there was only one judgment given in the Privy Council.  &ldquo;This judgment,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was written by Lord Cave, and it was the duty of those of us who, like my noble and learned friend and myself, had it circulated to us to find out if any mistake had been made.  We did not find it out, and I am sorry for it.&rdquo;  So that two of the judges came to the House of Lords to confess the fact that they had signed the judgment, which involved considerable sums of money, possibly very large sums of money, without having satisfied themselves on the facts of the case.</P>
    <P>Then we have Lord Birkenhead, with the assurance which no doubt his qualifications justify, stating: &ldquo;I affirm my own opinion, not without experience of such matters, that it was indisputably and unarguably wrong.&rdquo;  Further he said: &ldquo;I have examined this case pretty closely.&rdquo; He went on to say: &ldquo;The attention of those of their lordships who decided this matter was not directed to a Minute upon which, in my judgment, and in the judgment of those who are advising his Majesty's Government upon such points, that decision depended.  Had the attention of their lordships been directed to the existence of that Minute, it is inconceivable that the passage to which reference has been made in the judgement of that most careful judge, Lord Cave, could have been found.  There is no trace in the records of the case of that Minute.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have in my hand a printed copy of the records of the case which the appellants prepared and supplied to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and in those records, though <Col N="33" /> it is alleged there is no appearance of the Minute in question.  I find reference to the Minute in many pages and the actual Minute itself, and some comments upon it, occupy twelve pages of this printed book. In the light of the discussion certain rather extraordinary developments took place.  While it was allowed that the judgment in respect of two individuals, who though appearing as representatives, nevertheless appeared in their individual capacity as Messrs.  Wigg and Cochrane, that the judgment in their case would hold, there was to be a reconsideration of the issues in view of the allegation or the assertion that the judgment in the first case had been faulty, because attention had not been directed to the existence of a particular document. And so a new committee was set up, to which was referred the whole case.  The new committee consisted of five very eminent judges.  They reconsidered the whole case, no doubt in the light of the discussion in the House of Lords, but certainly having full knowledge of all the documents in the case.  Strange as it may seem, in the light of the statement of Lord Birkenhead that no competent lawyer could possibly have come to such a decision, these four eminent judges came to the identical decision of the original Judicial Committee.</P>
    <P>The reason why it is necessary to draw attention to these matters is because, as I said earlier, the only possible justification for the action of our Executive Council declaring that they would not take cognisance of the result of the appeal to the Privy Council, is that they must have had foresight, they must have been satisfied beforehand that the court which was to decide such a case was not competent to decide the case, not merely by virtue of constitutional incompetency, but by virtue of, perhaps, the political character of the court.  I would remind the Seanad of the very careful statement made by the late Minister for Justice, Mr. Kevin O'Higgins, in which he said: &ldquo;I ask that we <Col N="34" /> recognise, in the first instance, that this is a court, that we may have to consider whether it is a good court, a useful court, or a necessary court. I submit that it is not one of those three things.  It is a bad court, a useless court, and an unnecessary court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Nothing that I have said gives strength to the statement that it is a useless court or that it is an unnecescourt, but I think the evidence points conclusively to the fact that it is a bad court, and will justify this State and all concerned with this State in restating what has been said by Ministers and others of us, that every legitimate and possible effort should be made to make it impossible that any case affecting the Irish Free State will ever again go to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.</P>
    <P>I said that, on the confessions of the judges who constituted the court, they have allowed themselves to sign judgments to which they did not give full consideration.  I am sure that there are people who know more of what happened behind the scenes, and I am sure that the impression that one would get from the reading of the discussion in the House of Lords could be confirmed &mdash;that impression being that some influences, which I state must have been political, were brought to bear upon the judges who formed the court after they had come to the decision.  To my mind, those facts justify the statement that it is a bad court, and one which ought not ever again to be invoked in reference to any case in which any citizen of this State is concerned, and that the Executive authority of this State should make it quite clear and incapable of misunderstanding that that authority will not be allowed to be used to give effect to any decision or advice tendered by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.</P>
    <P>As to the Bill that we are asked to pass, I think it does substantial justice to the claims of the civil servants. It will be impossible after this Bill becomes law to assert that these transferred officers have no <Col N="35" /> justiciable rights.  At any rate, the first decision of Mr. Justice Meredith will be confirmed by the passing of this Bill.  In the main, it is true to say that the method of calculating compensation which he decided will also be made statutory with certain modifications, which modifications are acceptable to the civil servants who have been transferred.  Therefore, I think that the agreement entered into has resulted in the preparation of this Bill should become statutory, and that we should pass the Bill as presented to us.  But I think it is necessary that the facts leading up to the presentation of this Bill should be placed on record, and that there should be no possibility in the future that a court outside those established under the authority of the Government and Parliament of the Irish Free State should have jurisdiction over any citizen of the Free State.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to go into the legal arguments brought forward by Senator Johnson, but I should like to ask one or two questions as to how this decision and the Bill which we have before us affect us in the way of precedent in future action.  One would gather from Senator Johnson's speech that we want to discourage in every way any appeals to the Privy Council.  What I should like to know from the Minister is, can we not take adequate steps to prevent a citizen of the Saorstát from making an appeal to the Privy Council, and if such an appeal is made, what line of action the State, as such. should take? Should it be represented there in a defensive attitude or should it refuse to make any defence&mdash;in other words, should it refuse to recognise the court and, if so, what steps ought we to take to ensure that the Executive will refuse to recognise the court?  There may be difficulties in the way&mdash;constitutional difficulties&mdash;but I should like some clear definition as to what is in the Executive's mind on that matter.  I feel that the big majority of Irish citizens will stand behind them in <Col N="36" /> their attitude to preserve the complete jurisdiction of the courts at home.  I want to put it as simply, as concretely, and as directly as possible, and ask if the Minister will be good enough to give us an indication as to what the actual position is at present, and what action the Executive proposes to take in regard to any such future case.  With regard to the Bill there are one or two amendments which we may possibly have on the Committee Stage, but these deal more with possible pitfalls in the administration of the Bill itself.  But we would like to have an indication from the Minister as to what action he will take in connection with any such appeal made to the Privy Council in future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister's answer should be perfectly simple.  It is within the competence of the State to repeal the Article in the Constitution which gives the right of appeal to the Privy Council.  Why does not the Senator himself, instead of making the unfortunate speech he has made, in his activities as a legislator, bring in a Bill instead of <i>ad hoc</i> giving the citizen a right with one hand and taking it away with the other, which, I submit, is questionable, if not dishonest.  I must say that I felt deeply for the dignity of the House when I heard Senator Johnson speak, especially coming from a person so experienced, so able, and who is generally so fair-minded a Parliamentarian.  If it came from some wild man on the hustings, I would not have been surprised.  But, here in an Assembly where we should value our sense of fair play, to hear him say that political influences were brought to bear upon the members of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and that they did not give their judgment on the evidence, and that they were, in fact, tainted in their judgment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation. If the Senator heard me correctly he would have noted that I said &ldquo;after the judgment had been <Col N="37" /> delivered.&rdquo;  When I speak of political influences, I mean executive influences which are political.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied to accept the correction.  I put it in this way: that after the judgment had been delivered, Lord Birkenhead made a speech which, as the Senator criticised him, I will say was just as unfortunate as the speech which Senator Johnson has made here.  Lord Birkenhead made an unfortunate speech, as the outcome of which, not a further court, but a further committee of inquiry was set up.  It was not judicial I submit&mdash;it was quasi-judicial, and was to reconsider the whole case and report on the evidence that it heard. Senator Johnson suggests that political influence or executive influence was brought to bear upon these judges or persons so that they should not do their duty.  I think that suggestion was unworthy of any member of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not refer to any influence brought to bear on the second Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.  I said that the discussion in the House of Lords could only lead to one conclusion, and that was, that some influences were brought to bear upon the judges, who had first of all come to a judgment, to bring them into the House of Lords to confess that they had made blunders.  I say that again.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that we are dealing here with a concrete position arising from one judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.  To have a debate upon the whole position as to future appeals to the Judicial Committee is, I think, straining the question before us a bit too far.  I think we ought to confine ourselves, as much as possible, to the particular decision.  I allowed Senator Johnson to go somewhat far, but I think we ought to confine ourselves to the fact that a decision has been given and that this particular Bill is in agreement with that decision and is for the purpose of implementing it.</P>

      <P>I accept your ruling, but I hope that you will permit me to question the further remark made by Senator Johnson, that appeals to the Privy Council were unconstitutional.  After all, it is an Article of our Constitution which gives the citizen a right to appeal to the Privy Council.  On what ground Senator Johnson contends that right cannot be exercised constitutionally I fail to see, unless the Senator stands for playing fast and loose with our own Constitution.

      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The civil servants were thrown over because the British Government did not want to pay their civil servants such high pensions.  I pass from that.  It seems to me that the fault of the whole of the proceedings, as Senator Johnson said, was that the Minister attended at the Privy Council at all and implicated this country in the question of the Privy Council.  The position constantly stated in this House and agreed to by Ministers was that it ought not to apply.  Someone may ask what should be done.  My idea of what should be done is not to bring forward appeals of this sort, but to ignore altogether what the Privy Council decides to do, because although there is a clause in the Treaty that people may be allowed to appeal to the Privy Council, there is no means of carrying the result of that out in this country.</P>

      <P>I beg pardon. Under the Constitution I should have said.  Of course, we could change the Constitution, as Senator Sir John <Col N="40" /> Keane has already said.  These things happened before.  They happened before the Act of Union, and I say the present condition is very like what existed before the passing of the Act of Union.  We have a precedent there for what has been done. Before the Act of Union, when the Irish Parliament was sitting, a case was brought before the English Privy Council, and that body gave certain orders and sent them over to Ireland to be carried out.  A certain sheriff did actually attempt to carry out the orders of the Privy Council, and what happened?  As far as I can remember, an order was sent to arrest the sheriff for carrying out the orders of the British Privy Council, and he was thrown into prison, and the Irish Parliament passed a resolution prohibiting these things being done in future.  That is about the state of affairs we ought to have here. We ought not to be subjected to those decisions in England by English lawyers and judges which were shown, in this case, to be hopelessly wrong in one way or another.  I do not care to go into the question.  The whole thing was thoroughly muddled up on the other side, but it is quite clear that we ought not to be ruled in that way.  In any other cases where constitutional issues may arise we ought to prevent such a thing from happening.  I do not think it is worth while going much further.  I have given my opinion, and a great many other Senators will be of the same opinion, that we ought not to allow any appeals to the Privy Council at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the discussion, whether in order or out of order, has helped to make one matter perfectly clear&mdash;that this whole story is a somewhat sorry one, and that if ever there was a case where two Governments should come together and make an agreement, this is a perfectly clear case.  It, therefore, seems to me that on the exact issue of the Bill itself a clear case for it, in principle, has been made. You, sir, have ruled that we ought not to discuss the issue as to whether or not appeals to the Privy Council <Col N="41" /> should be allowed.  My view on that in public and in private is, I think, well known, and therefore I need not repeat it.  To do so, in view of your ruling, would be to risk being ruled out of order.  But, I think, according to your ruling, that we can discuss the question whether this particular appeal was or was not a proper one.  On that I would point out that, under the wording of the Constitution, one of the difficulties is&mdash;I say this with great respect to Senator Sir John Keane&mdash;that there is not any absolute right for anybody to have a case heard by the Privy Council.  There is a provision which states that the decision of the Supreme Court shall in all cases be final and conclusive, it shall not be reviewed, or be capable of being reviewed, by any other court, provided that nothing shall impair the right of any person to petition his Majesty for special leave to appeal.  Now the right to petition for leave is not the right to be heard.  The question is, when and how the Privy Council shall and may hear such petitions, or grant leave to have a petition heard.  That depends upon constitutional law and usage within the British Commonwealth of Nations.  I think it is a perfectly reasonable thing to say that, under the present usage, the number of appeals that can be heard are extremely few and far between. Personally I feel in regard to the Wigg-Cochrane case that it was one of those border-line cases, and consequently was extremely difficult to decide.  Most of the cases, to my mind, are clear; that is, the usage has been so established that where the Executive Council of the State concerned objects, appeals from individuals shall not be heard.  That has been set out by the Privy Council itself, though later members of the Privy Council have not followed the decision of their own body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I entirely agree with Senator Sir John Keane that portion of Senator Johnson's remarks were unfortunate. I think Senator Colonel Moore's remarks were more unfortunate still.  I do not think that it <Col N="42" /> is dignified for this House, or any member of the House, to discuss in this House matters as to improper conduct in other States.  I am quite well aware that in another Parliament, in high places but under effective protest, similar action took place with regard to our Government and our Parliament.  But I see no reason why we should follow a bad example set elsewhere.  For my part, I think it would be very much better&mdash;in this I am expressing my own personal views&mdash;if that bad conduct in other Parliaments were left for discussion in the public Press and elsewhere, and not in this House, and that we should protest against discussions elsewhere in any effective way that we can as to matters already discussed in this Parliament, which is a supreme Parliament that no one can legislate over.  I know that my view is not held by everybody.  The Irish correspondent of a Sunday newspaper protested against the view of the present English Government in which they stated that these matters ought not to be discussed.  I hope that in the Parliament of the Irish Free State we will rigidly decline to discuss the actions of Governments elsewhere in relation to our Government as well as our Government's actions with regard to them.</P>

      <P>In regard to the point raised by Senator Johnson which, I think, he said himself was formal rather than actual&mdash;the neglect of the Executive Council to act on a rule of court made by Mr. Justice Meredith after the first Privy Council trial&mdash;we were advised that there were good grounds for an appeal against that ruling making the Privy Council decision a rule of court.  It was a ruling that was given by the judge <i>ex parte</i>, the Attorney-General not having been heard.  We believe that had we appealed against that ruling we could have got it set aside.  We did not take an appeal because that would only have started a circle of litigation, and we had already proposed to deal with the matter in <Col N="43" /> another way.  If we did not propose to deal with the matter by legislation, we would have had no alternative but to act either on the ruling made by Mr. Justice Meredith or take steps to have it set aside on appeal.  I think that Senator Johnson's own statement that the matter was formal rather than actual, is quite correct.  The ruling then made on the books by Mr. Justice Meredith was contrary to the judgment of the Supreme Court, and the fact that we did not proceed to act hurriedly on it was no indication that at any other time there would be undue delay in acting on the ruling of the court.  Senator Sir John Keane asked why we did not repeal Section 66 in the Constitution.</P>

But I do not think that the wiping out of that proviso would alter the position in the least.  The right of appeal to the Privy Council, in so far as it may still exist, has its roots in Article 2 of the Treaty, dealing with the relationship of the Government and Parliament of the Irish Free State to the Crown and of the relation of the Crown to the Irish Free State The Government are anxious to have this matter of appeals completely abolished.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a constitutional growth and constitutional development since the time the Treaty was accepted, as well as since the time the Constitution was first enacted.  I think that, as a matter of fact, the right of effective appeal to the Privy Council is already dead, and for this reason: that although the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is, in fact, a court, in form it is an advisory body.  The Judicial Committee hears a case and tenders a recommendation to the King.  That recommendation is produced at an ordinary meeting of the Privy Council and an executive order is made in accordance with the recommendation. It seems to me that the position that has been reached since the Imperial Conference of 1926 is such that, even if the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council were still to be able to hear appeals, it would be wrong to issue an executive order except on the advice of the Executive Council here.  If that is the correct position, there would be no more executive orders issued on any recommendation that might be made by the Judicial Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think also there is perhaps a good deal in what Senator Colonel Moore said&mdash;that is, if an executive order were issued, it is not for any court here to act on that, but to wait for legislation.  An appeal to the Privy Council is an anomaly in the present state of development in the British Commonwealth of Nations. It is a complete anomaly.  Although it was not possible to dispose of the matter at the last Imperial Conference, I doubt whether, especially after the blunders connected with the Wigg-Cochrane decision, and the discredit into which the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council fell in connection with it, there is anybody who will want to maintain it.  I said the other day in the Dáil that for all practical purposes appeal to the Privy Council was dead, and that we only wanted the British to give it a decent burial.  There will be no more appeals taken, and <Col N="45" /> if there are, I believe they will produce no results.  They will be ineffective, because we have the machinery which we used in the copyright case, and in the Lynham and Butler case, to make them ineffective, apart from the other line or method I have indicated.  I think all that remains is to persuade the British that in future there can be and should be no appeal to the Privy Council, that appeal to the Privy Council should be entirely abandoned, and that both sides should agree to any legislation that may be necessary to have the whole appearance of the right of appeal to the Privy Council wiped out.</P>
    <P>Senator Connolly asked what steps we would take if there were further appeals.  I can say this much, that the Attorney-General of the Irish Free State, or any person representing him, will not again appear before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.  If the Council should still hear private litigants and decide on the suit of private litigants, and reverse the decisions of the Supreme Court here, we would take whatever steps may be necessary, whether by legislation or otherwise, to make the effort of the Privy Council to reverse the decisions of the Supreme Court here ineffective; that is, pending the time when we can get agreement with the British Government to wipe out the appearance of the right of appeal, and to abolish the whole idea of appeal to the Privy Council.  I do not want to say anything about the Board which tried this case, or the Board of the Privy Council to which it was referred again.  We might have been satisfied not to fight this question of appeal to the Privy Council if the Judicial Committee had adhered to the lines which were laid down by Lord Haldane in his judgment in the first case that was brought for leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee. We found that we were not in fact going to be treated as, for instance, South Africa was, because appeals have very seldom been granted in the case of South Africa.  They should have been refused in cases <Col N="46" /> like the Lynham and Butler case and the Wigg-Cochrane case.  They were not refused, and there seems a disposition on the part of members of the Privy Council to allow appeals to be heard freely and frequently from the Irish Free State.</P>
    <P>Distance is not a factor that prevents appeals going to the Privy Council from the Irish Free State, as it does in the case of South Africa and Canada.  It became clear to us that we would have to take a strong line against appeals to the Privy Council, and that with their disposition to hear appeals, and with the disposition of litigants and members of the legal profession here&mdash;distance not interfering&mdash;to carry cases a stage further, we would have the Privy Council hearing appeals as a matter of course, just as the House of Lords heard them.  There is another factor in our case which is not present in the case of appeals from Canada and South Africa. There are, I think, no anti-Canadian and no anti-South African lawyers on the bench in Great Britain, but there are undoubtedly anti-Irish lawyers on the bench in Great Britain, and I do not think that from a court such as that the Irish Free State could have confidence in getting justice that perhaps other countries might have.  For these reasons, and also because of the feelings that were engendered by the proceedings in connection with the Wigg-Cochrane case, and because of the fact that constitutional growth and development were taking place, it has become more and more clear every day that this appeal to the Privy Council is an anomaly.  We have for a considerable time decided to take every step that we could to bring it to an end, and while the matter has not yet been formally wound up it is in process of being so.  As I said in the Dáil, I do not think that Deputies or Senators need be very greatly troubled about the question of future appeals to the Privy Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my voice to the chorus of approval with which this Bill has been received in the Dáil and, as far as I know, in the country.  Those of us who have been working for a number of years in the Royal Society of Antiquaries and in the local societies throughout Ireland for the objects of the Bill are exceedingly pleased that at last the Bill has been introduced, and that this country, with regard to the preservation of ancient monuments, will be brought into line with other countries of Europe.  I am sure the Bill will have the approval of this House and that there will be no dissentient voice here.  No matter how great our enthusiasm or how hard our work, we had to look on at many of our ancient monuments being destroyed before our eyes.  We were powerless to prevent their destruction. I could give innumerable instances for the necessity of the arm of the law being used to prevent their destruction.  In every part of the country everybody has seen national monuments crumbling into decay, and, still worse, being torn down by vandals who had no care for the history or traditions of the country or its culture.  There are one or two cases that I would like to mention. Within the past year a ruin, an interesting old castle, near Dungarvan, County Waterford, was blown up by dynamite or some other explosive.  I do not know the reason, but it would be interesting to know what became of the stones.  About five years ago an Ogham stone was discovered in good condition on the Great Saltee Island, about five miles off the coast of Wexford.  It was removed about two years ago without the knowledge of the owner, and nobody knows where it is.  Such occurrences will be impossible in future.  Section 14 will, of course, prevent excessive destruction, but <Col N="48" /> we hope also that it will be possible under that section to deal with people who scratch and scribble their names on ancient abbeys and churches.  They do not actually destroy but they deface and injure them.  That may seem a trivial matter.  It is done by thoughtless people.  We hope that the Bill will not only prevent the destruction of national monuments but will arouse an interest in them and in their history.</P>

      <P>This is really a very important measure and it is time that it was introduced.  I am delighted to see that the Government has favoured its introduction, as our national monuments are among the most important of our national possessions and their preservation should be a national duty on the part of everybody interested in the intellectual progress of Ireland.  Furthermore, we might take a leaf out of the book of foreign countries where they find that their national monuments are a very considerable source of revenue.  There is nothing so attractive to a tourist as a national monument or antiquarian object in whatever part of the world it may be found.  Our national monuments have suffered through very great neglect, and I am sorry to say, as Senator Miss Browne reminded us in her maiden speech, on which I congratulate her, that our national monuments have been very gratuitously and very grievously damaged time after time.  It may be that public ignorance has to some extent been responsible for this damage, but, unquestionably, cupidity and pecuniary benefit have been largely responsible for such damage.  Once the Bill passes, such proceedings will be at an end.  I am particularly delighted to see that in the Bill the idea of local committees is to be instituted.  Local committees and local councils consist of people who are naturally interested in matters of local interest, and it is to them that I look forward with great hope for the successful operation of this measure, which, I trust, will pass <Col N="49" /> through the House very speedily, because the sooner it passes the better.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Bill.  As regards national monuments, I think we are indebted to the Ordnance Survey Department for the maps that have been made which show nearly all the ancient monuments in the country.  I have before me a map of a very small district consisting of four or five parishes in the locality between Mallow and Cork.  There are marked on it one Ogham stone, four stone circles, five cromlechs, a ruined abbey and two large forts, in addition to other interesting objects.  I understand that the stone circle and the dolmen mark the burial place of persons who were distinguished in ancient times.  I do not know what the exact age of the stones would be, but they are probably a survival of the period corresponding to that of Tutankamen in Egypt.  These circles have been carefully preserved by the occupiers on the lands on which they stand. Although the occupiers were often short of stones for use on the land I know no instance in which stones have been removed from these circles.  It is also important that caves should be preserved.  In this respect there is a remarkable cave, known as the Mitchelstown Cave, although it is situated near Ballyporeen in County Tipperary.  It was discovered about seventy or eighty years ago, and had it been in any other country it would have been written up and put forward as an inducement to tourists to visit that country.  I understand that this cave cannot be equalled by any other cave in the world.  I do not know whether it would be possible under this Bill to get possession of it, but I think that an effort should be made to bring it more under the notice of people who visit the country and to make access to it easier.  It would not cost very much to put it in such a way that people could visit it without danger.  As regards the finding of objects of archaeological interest, I think that the finders ought to get, at least, the intrinsic value of the <Col N="50" /> articles, because it is hard to expect people who find such objects to hand them over without getting some compensation. These are matters, however, which can be discussed on the Committee Stage.  With the main principle of the Bill I am in entire agreement.</P>

      <P>I also am pleased to see this Bill brought forward by the Government.  It will be very popular with people who are interested in having our ancient monuments preserved.  Such monuments have to a great extent been hopelessly neglected.  In this matter, however, force of example can do a great deal.  In this regard I may mention that a great deal has been done by a friend of mine, Father Devitt, of Clongowes College, a great authority on ancient monuments. I know that in County Kildare, at Clane, where there is an ancient monument, much has been done to improve it by building a wall and renovating the entrance. Such improvements are an indication to visitors that the people of this country have respect for the memory of the dead.  Such monuments are, in a way, history in themselves. As I have said, the Bill will undoubtedly prove to be a most popular measure, and I have great pleasure in supporting it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to call attention, as showing the necessity for this Bill, to the fact that a few years ago a farmer who happened to be in possession, for the time being, of the Hill of Tara, got it into his head that the Ark of the Covenant was to be discovered there. There was a long story about it, and some people came over from England and proceeded to dig up the whole place.  Of course, those who were interested in the matter were very indignant, and I remember that there was a good deal of talk about it at the time.  I remember that the late Arthur Griffith was very upset about it, and he and my brother went up there with a few others.  There was a skirmish with this gentleman as to whether he should be allowed to dig up the place <Col N="51" /> or not.  Ignorant people who do things like that have got to be stopped somehow.  Another suggestion I would like to make is that a little money should be spent to excavate the caves, because a great question arises as to whether this country was inhabited in palaeolithic or neolithic times.  These caves have never been excavated, as they would have been had they been situated in other countries.  A few hundred pounds would go a long way towards excavating them.  Some of the monuments go back an extraordinary period.  The cromlechs go back to the year 3500 B.C. or sometime about the period the Pyramids were built.  They are of very great importance as showing the great development of the country at that time.  They show that the people were able to combine to work together, bring stones many miles over the country and put them up on these hills.  These people were not uncivilised; they were certainly not savages.  I welcome the Bill, and I hope that some money will be advanced for the purpose of excavating the caves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support this Bill.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary between now and the Committee Stage to take into consideration two or three suggestions with a view to strengthening the Bill.  I should first like to refer to Section 18 which deals with the control of advertisements on national monuments.  The section provides that by-laws may be made by a local authority, and I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to see whether that is quite sufficient.  The local authority may be an urban council, a county council, or a county borough, and if the local authority is not very much concerned, I would like it to be possible for some higher authority to preserve national monuments from hideous advertisements. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would look into that with a view to seeing whether that particular section might not be strengthened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (3) of Section 21 states <Col N="52" /> that the persons to be appointed members of a local advisory committee shall in every case be persons having practical experience or special knowledge of architecture, archaeology, or some kindred subject. I should like to raise the point there that a local committee may be desirable in many urban districts and of the total number&mdash;I think it is three or five&mdash;it may be only possible to get two persons with a special knowledge of architecture or archæology. You may have another person quite fitted to serve on the committee, who has a special interest but not that special practical knowledge that seems to be required by this sub-section. It would seem to me that if we were not to include that special interest in archæology or some kindred subject, we might make it more practicable for the committees to be set up in cases where the narrow limits of the sub-section would prevent such committees being set up.  In Section 22 it is provided that every person who finds any archaeological object shall, within seven days after he has found such object, make a report of such finding to a member of the Gárda Síochána, but there the section ends.  There is no obligation on the Gárda to do anything, and it seems to me that it is incomplete, unless there is an obligation on the Gárda to report to the Commission or at least to some authority which has charge of this matter.  I submit those suggestions to the Minister with a view to his consideration and in the hope of strengthening the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the suggestion which has been made by Senator Johnson with a view to strengthening the Bill, and also to make some suggestions of my own.  I am greatly afraid that if these monuments are left indiscriminately in the care of persons who are not highly qualified, any improvements which are made on them will be destructive instead of preservative. We have many examples throughout the country where works of art, ancient works of art of that great century, the thirteenth, have <Col N="53" /> been almost destroyed by so-called improvements.  There was another matter referred to by Senators Linehan and Johnson.</P>
      <P>With reference to archaeological objects, such as bronze swords and things of that description&mdash;and I may say I have seen two that were discovered within the last couple of months&mdash;it is quite right and proper that a report of the discovery should be made.  It is also proper that a police officer, if it is reported to him, should send forward a report to the Dublin Museum.  There is no provision at all made for the preservation of the actual things discovered. Let us say that a man discovers a bronze sword of the civilisation which we say has not yet passed and which exists in this country.  There is no provision with regard to the preservation of that sword.  Apparently under the Bill the finder is entitled to keep it.</P>
      <P>There is another class of object which does not, I think, come within the scope of the Bill.  If we are amending this measure I think we should introduce some amendment that will cover what I have in mind. I refer to a cannon which was used in wars that took place about 120 years ago.  These were the wars in which the gallant Colonel's ancestor, the first President of the Irish Republic of the day, met an honourable death.  One of these cannon was found some time ago in a County Mayo bog.  It was transferred by a public official to a place fifty or sixty miles away, and it is now used as a very ornamental pier for his front gate.  It ought to be possible to have an article like that regarded as an object of archaeological interest and preserved.  I do not think it can be preserved under the terms of this Bill.  I hope that if we do introduce an amendment dealing with matters of that character it will not be regarded as a party affair.</P>

When they hear of a discovery, can they not take action without somebody reporting the matter to them?  From my own knowledge of the country I am afraid that a great many people, if they hear of their neighbour digging up a sword or something of value, will not be inclined to report the matter to the Gárda.  Perhaps the section covers that matter, but in my opinion the more power that is given to the Gárda the better.  Somebody remarked that the Gárda Síochána should not get work of this kind, but I think that they would be quite willing to assist as far as they can in this matter, and it will be all the better to place ample power in their hands.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see that this Bill has got a very good reception and I hope that the same spirit will prevail during the remaining stages. There were only a few points raised that it will be necessary for me to advert to.  With regard to Senator Miss Browne's point about scratching and otherwise interfering with ancient monuments, I do not think there should be any fear in that connection because Section 14 gives very wide powers.  In fact, I do not think it would be possible to get any words other than those in the section that would give wider powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Linehan inquired whether compensation would be given for finding archaeological objects.  Of course it would be quite impossible for the State to undertake to compensate everybody who would find articles that would come within the definition of archaeological objects. When a person makes a find and the Keeper of the National Antiquities Section in the Museum considers it is an object worth preserving from the national point of view, he will purchase <Col N="55" /> that object for a fair amount. Under the Bill it is not obligatory on him to give for the object such a price as it would fetch in the international market.  Suppose, for instance, that such a thing as the Book of Kells were discovered in the country.  It would be utterly impossible for the State to purchase that, and at the same time it would not be right that it should go out of the country.  It is not intended to take charge of all the archaeological objects which may be of national importance; so long as they are preserved in the country the purposes of the Bill are sufficiently met.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnson apparently was talking from a different copy of the Bill to that which I now possess.  He must have had the copy of the Bill as introduced.  I had some difficulty in following him because there was the Bill as dealt with on the Committee Stage in the Dáil and then there was the Bill when it had passed the Committee Stage.  Under the present Bill one can report either to the Gárda Síochána or the Keeper of Antiquities in the National Museum. The Gárda Síochána being the servants of the Government will report to the proper authority.  I will look into the other points that were raised before the Committee Stage and see what can be done to meet them.</P>

      <P>I ask the leave of the House to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend and consolidate the law relating to the protection of wild birds.  Very shortly stated, the object of the Bill is this: The existing law for the protection of wild birds consists of six British Acts of Parliament which we took over when the Free State was established.  They began in 1880 and they go on to 1908.  Each of them either repeals, amends, or adds to certain provisions of the others with the result that the law is in a state of great difficulty and confusion.  The present Bill repeals <Col N="56" /> all those Acts, codifies all their provisions, and, in addition, includes provisions that were comprised in the short Bill for the protection of birds which passed this House in 1927, and one other provision which prevents the exportation of certain birds such as singing birds from this country.  I have got the support of five other members in the House.</P>
      <P>Leave granted.</P>

      <P>I ask the House to adopt the following motion:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That it be an instruction to the Committee on Procedure in revising the Standing Orders of the Seanad to make provision for the appointment of a Standing Committee whose function it shall be to examine all orders and regulations made by Ministers of State which are required by statute to be laid before the Oireachtas, and when they deem it necessary to report to the Seanad respecting the purpose and effect of such orders or regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a matter which I referred to in the course of another motion. That was a motion made a year ago, but it was at that time associated with a wider and more comprehensive proposition.  I was advised then that had I dealt with one subject alone it probably would have been adopted without question.  The Seanad will be aware of the fact that in the course of British legislation, and also in the course of Free State legislation, it is provided that to carry out the purpose of certain enactments Ministers may make orders and regulations.  In some cases orders and regulations must be laid upon the Table, and before becoming effective must receive approval by a positive vote of both Houses.  Those cases are rather few. In the great majority of such cases, where orders take the place of enactments, it is required that such an order be laid upon the Table, and if within a given period, usually twenty-one days, under Free <Col N="57" /> State legislation either House passes a resolution annulling or disapproving of such order, such order shall be no longer effective.  The importance of these orders varies very greatly.  The great majority of them are purely formal and deal with Departmental matters, and I think would be quite out of the range of ordinary statutes.</P>
    <P>Some of the orders that are capable of being made by Ministers do, in fact, alter the statutes and make very serious changes in the law.  To give an instance of that, I may say that we are living since 1923 under the Local Government Temporary Provisions Act.  I have referred to this before, but it is worth repeating.  It was intended that that temporary Act should be supplanted by a permanent Act within a year. It is now 1929, and this Act passed in 1923 is still a temporary Act.  It will be re-enacted, I suppose, before the end of the year.  Under the provisions of that Act the Minister has been enabled by orders to alter the whole law relating to the relief of the poor and to a considerable extent the law relating to local government. Those alterations have been effected by orders laid upon the Table.</P>
    <P>Both Houses of the Legislature and each individual legislator have had the responsibility of disapproving of them.  In order to do that the legislator should bring before the House at least some reason why any order of the kind should be disapproved of.  I am not passing any comment as to whether these orders or regulations are good or bad.  I am drawing attention to the fact that statute law may be altered by the exercise of the Minister's powers. The Minister makes that alteration by order to be laid upon the Table. The Defence Forces Act is alterable, or I should say the administration portion of it is alterable by the orders laid upon the Table.  It is true to say that the original Act of the National Health Insurance has been entirely altered and would not now be recognised as being the law prevailing to-day.  The alterations <Col N="58" /> therein have been effected by orders laid upon the Table.</P>
    <P>This question has had a good deal of publicity lately as part of a very much wider question through the publication of a book by an eminent judge.  I am not at all asking the House to make any comments&mdash;bad, good or otherwise&mdash; upon the question raised in the recently published book of Lord Hewart.  But one aspect of the question is an aspect that I am asking the House to deal with and that is to say where the statutes allow of orders to be made by a Departmental Minister, which orders have the force of law, and where such an order is laid upon the Table thereby imposing upon the Legislature the responsibility for seeing that its intentions are not violated, that this House at any rate should depute a number of its members to exercise a special supervision and examination of those orders.</P>
    <P>Responsibility to-day is equally placed upon the sixty members of the Seanad and, I suppose, the 152 members of the Dáil.  But because it is so diffused I think I am not exaggerating when I say that that responsibility is not given effect to. These orders are not examined. Nobody knows whether they carry out or depart seriously from what the individual believes to have been the intention of the Legislature. What I seek to have established is that a Committee of the House shall have the very special duty placed upon them to examine these orders as they are laid upon the Table.  As I have already said the vast majority of them are formal, and will not occasion any difficulty.  Some of them may occasion difficulty.  And I think that the Committee would obviously have the right of seeking advice and information from the Department concerned as to the intention and purpose.  If it appears entirely innocuous or merely departmental, the Committee will have no need to take any further action.  But if the Committee is of opinion that certain important issues are raised it would be incumbent then upon the <Col N="59" /> Committee to report to the Seanad of the purport and possible effect of the order.  Then if the Seanad desires it can take action.  If the Seanad thinks there is nothing requiring action to be taken, the order would pass without any further comment.</P>
    <P>What is aimed at in this resolution is that some special responsibility should be devolved upon a Committee of the House so that the orders made by a Minister which have the force of law should have, to a greater extent than at present, the consent of the Legislature, or at least this House of the Legislature, and that closer examination would be made of these orders so that possible departure from the intentions of the Legislature by order should not be made without such matters being reported to the Seanad.  I do not think it is necessary to go into greater detail.  The matter is extremely important and I think it is right and proper that this House should take upon itself this function whether the other House does it or not.  It would I think answer some part of the indictment that is made against the parliamentary system and against that alleged defect in the parliamentary system which allows executive authority to legislate without the practical sanction of the Legislature.  I beg to move the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion, which I think is a very useful one. I do not intend to speak very long upon this subject, which is most important. There is a tendency in modern legislation to take away power, both from the Parliaments and the Courts, and to concentrate it in the hands of Ministers.  It is often said that that is a tendency which is inherent in modern legislation. Whether that is so or not.  I <Col N="60" /> think it is incumbent on this House at least to know what it is doing when it allows rules and regulations to remain on the Table without any comment, or without any examination by members of the House.  There are certain statutes which have been passed, even in the short time that I have been in the Seanad, which provided for the making of rules by a Minister.  These rules have often invaded private rights, and they frequently provide that a Minister is to be the sole judge as regards private rights.  They prevent the individual from appealing, even to the Minister.  Some of the rules which have been made under Acts of Parliament passed here have even gone so far as to authorise a Minister to ignore the law of the land. These things all happen.  It is said that it is necessary to give Ministers these great powers.  It is sometimes said that the public have this protection, that the rules are not to have the force of law unless they receive the assent of the Dáil or of the Seanad, as the case may be.  The only way in which they do receive the assent of the Dáil or the Seanad is that they are laid on the Table of the House.  Sometimes they have to remain on the Table of the House for three weeks, sometimes longer, sometimes shorter.</P>
      <P>I take it that the object of Senator Johnson's motion is to see that it shall be the business of somebody to read these orders, and when they are read and examined by a small committee, that they shall be brought before the House in case they offend against the law or against the Constitution, or in case they violate to an excessive degree the private rights of the citizen. Senator Johnson has well said that it is the business of 153 men in the Dáil and of 60 men and women in the Seanad to examine these rules. Speaking for myself, I do not think I have examined one set of rules: what is the business of everybody is the business of nobody.  Consequently, these rules are never examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I support the motion is this, that it is advisable, in the public <Col N="61" /> interest, in the interests of Parliament, and for the purpose of securing the rights of individuals, that some committee of three, four, or five members should be induced to take upon themselves the duty of examining these rules and of reporting to the Seanad the result of their examination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. Barrington Mr. Barrington">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrington</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself quite in agreement with the arguments that have been put forward both by the proposer and the seconder of this motion, but I suggest that the motion will have to be amended if the idea that Senator Johnson has in view, and with which, I think, we are all thoroughly in accord, is to be carried out.  It states: &ldquo;That it be an instruction to the Committee on Procedure in revising the Standing Orders of the Seanad to make provision for the appointment of a Standing Committee.&rdquo; It seems to me that this is an urgent matter, a matter that ought to be dealt with as soon as possible, and it would be postponing the appointment of this committee for a very long time if we adopt those words.  I suggest that Senator Johnson might agree to the substitution of these words, or words which would have the same meaning, which would really carry out what he stated to be his object: &ldquo;That the Seanad appoint a committee of seven members to be selected by the Committee of Selection, whose function it shall be to examine all orders.&rdquo;  That would bring the matter to a head at once. I believe it is a matter that should not be allowed to go on any longer, but that it should be decided at once.</P>

      <P>I am not rising to discuss this motion, but to ask the Senator who sponsors it to agree to deferring further consideration of it until the next meeting of the Seanad. It raises certain important issues, and certain implications have been read into it by Senator Comyn which I think it is important to analyse fully before we arrive at a decision. Certainly if Senator Barrington's amendment were agreed to now we would be precipitated into a decision which we might, upon further consideration, <Col N="62" /> find was not the happiest decision to arrive at.  I do not want to debate the matter; I do not want to deprive myself of the right of discussing it on a future date if what I suggest is agreed to, but I am not approaching it in a spirit of antagonism. I would like more time to consider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out the undesirability of adjourning a debate of this kind.  I think a decision might well be taken on the motion now.  I am not obstinate on that, but it seems to me that the justification for the adjournment of the debate was the speech of Senator Comyn.  I want to say at once that the purpose of the motion is not at all to set up a committee of critics of the Ministry, or of persons who are fearful that Ministers are doing things very harmful and wrong as against the citizen.  I do not want it to go abroad that this is a motion which is directed against the executive authority.  It is rather a motion which seeks to throw upon the Seanad, in a more effective manner than the present practice achieves, a duty which it has already.  I think it would be wrong if the impression was to go abroad that this was a motion directed against an executive of any kind, and that therefore the Executive should resist it.  If the House would agree with that view and realise, too, that the motion as drafted is an instruction to the Committee of Procedure that when they are revising the Standing Orders they shall bring this as a further proposal, a proposal which at the moment does not exist in the Standing Orders, and may not, without such an expression of opinion from <Col N="63" /> the Seanad, be embodied in the revised Standing Orders, which I understand are under consideration by the Committee on Procedure, it will be still possible for the House to consider whether this should be an established rule, because when the Standing Orders come to the House in a revised form, as I suppose they will before many weeks are over, the House will have every opportunity of deciding whether this should be one of the Standing Committees. With that made clear, I think that the adjournment ought not to be approved of, and that the House might well take a vote on the motion itself.</P>

      <P>Any observations of mine were not intended to reflect on any particular executive.  This is a matter which is occupying the attention of legislatures not merely in this country but in every European country at the present time.  The tendency of modern legislation is to leave it in the hands of Ministers to make rules which in fact are statutes. It has been referred to in England, and I think in other countries.  This is not the first or the second time <Col N="64" /> that it has been referred to here, and any observations of mine were simply intended to preserve the powers of Parliament and, as far as possible, the rights of individuals.  I hope in voting on this motion nobody will take any observations of mine as intended to be of a Party character. They are simply prompted by the desire to see that constitutional privileges and individual rights are preserved, as far as possible, in the tangle of legislation that is going through this Parliament.</P>
