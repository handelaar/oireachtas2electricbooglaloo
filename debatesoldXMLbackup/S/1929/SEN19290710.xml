    <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, no remedy or relief, whether by way of damages, injunction, costs, expenses, or otherwise, shall be recoverable or granted in respect or by reason of an infringement in Saorstát Eireann before the passing of this Act of a copyright by this Act declared to subsist or deemed to have subsisted in Saorstát Eireann.</P>

      <P>I move the deletion of the section, not, I am afraid, in the hope that the amendment will be accepted, but to ask the House to consider seriously the arguments by which I wish to support the amendment. I referred to the matter on the Second Reading, and then my arguments were cut somewhat short by the intervention&mdash;the quite courteous intervention&mdash;of Senator Brown, who suggested that I was misinformed.  I have since had a conversation with the Senator, and I think he will agree now that I was not misinformed, and that the case I stated was correct.</P>

      <P>I was the person misinformed. I stated on the last occasion that I understood that the case which was on appeal to the Privy Council was not going on.  I did so hear, and I understood that it was not going on, but was merely adjourned.</P>

      <P>The whole difficulty covered by this Bill is concerned with copyright during what has been called the interregnum period&mdash;between the Treaty and the passing of the Act of 1927.  I think I am right in saying that it was the intention and the wish of the Government that British copyright should be effectively preserved in the Free State during that interregnum, and that that should be effected by the Act of 1927, but apparently, owing to some mistake in drafting, that was not effected. The High Court ruled that it was, but on appeal to the Supreme Court that ruling was reversed.  The object of the present Bill, therefore, is to put that right, and in future the law will be as it was at first hoped, and copyright during that period will be protected.  An action was taken by a society known as the Performing Rights Society against the Bray Urban District Council for infringement of copyright.  As I have said, the High Court upheld the Performing Rights Society, but the Supreme Court reversed that.  The Performing Rights Society is an international society which acts on behalf of most of the leading authors and music publishers all over the world, certainly in Great Britain. Exercising its powers under Article 66 of the Constitution, it applied for leave to appeal, and in due course the leave to appeal was granted.  My information is that it was granted largely on the grounds that this was not a domestic issue and in no way similar to the Lynham and Butler case, which provoked similar legislation which was sought to be defended on the grounds that it was a purely domestic issue.  I do not think that there can be any doubt whatever that this is wider than a domestic issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of Section 4, which I seek to delete, would be that no appeal could proceed and the Performing Rights Society which, I am informed, has incurred costs of well over £1,000 would be prohibited from exercising its right under the Constitution, and, presumably, would have to suffer a loss to the extent of <Col N="1211" /> those costs.  I do not suggest that to a wealthy society of this kind&mdash;I imagine that it is wealthy&mdash;that sum is a very important matter, but the principle is very important.  During the debate on another Bill we heard arguments advanced as to the sanctity of the Constitution in reference to the national language.  I rather suggested that another opportunity would arise for testing the feelings of this House as to the sanctity of the Constitution, and here is the opportunity.  This body has a perfectly constitutional right to prosecute their appeal under the Constitution. That right is now being taken away by Section 4, and I suggest that we are acting wrongfully and unwisely and are damaging our national prestige for fair dealing in the action we now propose to take.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that this Society is better able to stand these costs than the Bray Urban Council.  I suggest that that has nothing to do with the case at all.  It is dominated entirely by the principle of whether a citizen or a litigant who has a right granted to him by the Constitution should proceed to exercise that right without the interference of a retrospective Act of Parliament. It may be argued why should the Performing Rights Society proceed at all in this case, knowing full well that legislation would shortly be introduced to put matters right?  I suggest that it had no information whatever that legislation would be introduced.  It had a knowledge, or it should have had a knowledge, that the intentions of the Government were entirely in its favour.  There is a further argument, if such were necessary, that the intentions of the Government were in its favour, because I understand that the Attorney-General appeared in person at the hearing of the application for leave to appeal and argued in favour of the contention of the Performing Rights Society.  I am open to correction if that is wrong.  On the other hand, Senators might argue that as the damages in this case would be merely nominal why should the Bray <Col N="1212" /> Urban Council have proceeded to appeal?  I have no doubt that if they had to pay damages, which is doubtful, and had submitted to merely nominal damages, nothing further would have been heard about the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they had not been incurred at that stage.  The costs were incurred by the appeal to the Supreme Court, which was taken by the Urban Council and not by the Performing Rights Society and, further, the application for leave to appeal to the Privy Council, which, as we all can imagine, knowing what lawyers' charges are, is a very costly matter.  I suggest that, if the Government wish to satisfy the equities in this case and to avoid what I submit is a very humiliating position, they should at least not deprive this body of an opportunity to exercise its rights under the Constitution, and if they offer to pay the costs of the Performing Rights Society, I have no doubt everything would be all right, because in future, as we all know, the Performing Rights Society would be secure.  Therefore I move my amendment, and I would like to hear what the Minister has to say about it.</P>

      <P>Like every lawyer, I have a rooted objection to retrospective legislation.  The first instance of it that we had was in connection with an appeal under a Land Act, and the legislation which prevented that appeal was, I think&mdash;I am speaking only from my own recollection of it&mdash;really intended to raise the serious question as to whether an appeal of that kind, on a matter of our own domestic law, ought to be allowed to go to the Privy Council. That was the excuse for taking that action.  The present case is not like that at all.  It is a very curious case, because as far as our wisdom went we thought we had provided for the continuance of copyright in the interval between the Treaty and the passing of our own Bill that dealt <Col N="1213" /> with copyright.  We thought we had done that, in the wisdom of both Houses, and I say I still think we had done it.  However, that is neither here nor there; the Supreme Court has decided otherwise.</P>
      <P>The situation as to restropective legislation in the present case is this: It is really not a question of principle; it is a question of hardship and commonsense.  Admittedly, in this case there is no real damage; it is only a few shillings.  The real question is this very large sum of taxed costs.  I do not think that my friend, Senator John Keane, is right in thinking that the bill tots up to £1,000 for what we call party and party costs, but it is a very substantial sum.  Surely, therefore, it would be a hardship on this Society if it had to pay its solicitor's bill of costs, and if it had to pay, not only party and party costs, but solicitor and client costs, which are very heavy.  That is an admitted hardship. On the other hand, I understand that there are ten or fifteen small actions for similar sums of a few shillings in each case which have not been proceeded with yet, and which are not really of very much importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I think the Government should do in this case is to consider whether they can divide the hardship or provide against it in any way, and the conclusion I came to is that, on the whole, it would be better to let each side bear its own portion of the costs, and as the law was being put right, the question would never arise again.  We are bound to put it right, since the Government could not allow this infringement of what they intended to be the law of copyright to go on, and therefore they were bound to introduce this Bill and pass it as quickly as possible. As I say, there must be a hardship one way or the other.  They have come to the conclusion, rightly or wrongly, that each side will have to bear its own burden.  I do not know whether the Minister for Finance, in a soft moment, would consider the question as to whether the Department of Finance ought to pay these costs or not.  However, that is <Col N="1214" /> not a question for the House, but for the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Sir John Keane.  I think it is most unfair that when parties engage in litigation the State should intervene and deprive one party of a farthing of the costs or expenses which they may become entitled to.  This is retrospective legislation.  It purports to affect the rights of parties who have already incurred expenses and costs.  The costs and expenses incurred are a definite and ascertained sum, and if the State intervenes to prevent one party from succeeding, I think in all justice, when the amount of the loss has been ascertained and is a fixed sum, it ought to intervene on principles of fair play.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is here.  He is directly concerned in this Bill and in the general principles involved, and as we have also the Minister for Finance present, I think it ought not to be impossible in the present case for them to indemnify the persons to whom Senator Sir John Keane has referred.  They are only a few, the sum is very small to the State, but it is a serious thing for the individuals whose rights or whose chance of success and of getting their costs of this expensive litigation are to be taken away by this retrospective legislation, and it is certainly a thing that ought to be considered by the Seanad.  If we do it at all, we ought to do it in a large and generous way, and be perfectly fair to individuals.  We should not introduce legislation for penalising individuals and deprive them of their chance of recovering costs by reversing a judgment.  I think something ought to be done by the two Ministers, who are here, on the lines suggested by Senator Sir John Keane.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Thomas Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Senator Brown's objection to retrospective legislation, but apparently this is a distinction with a very important difference.  There is no doubt whatever about it that we did intend our legislation to <Col N="1215" /> cover these cases.  Apparently, through a fault in the drafting of the Bill, our intention was not carried out.  But in addition to that, it seems to me from what has been said by Senators who are in a position to know, that an injustice is to be wrought upon some litigants. Unless the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Industry and Commerce puts forward something to change my view, I shall certainly support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators speak of an injustice to litigants.  What about the injustice to the nationality of this country?  Why should our Supreme Court be liable to have its decisions reversed by an outside authority?  The law is there.  As I said previously, when that law was passed it was never the intention to permit appeals to the Privy Council.  Our position was to be based upon the law and constitutional practice of the Union of South Africa.  If anybody was in doubt, the proceedings that took place on the Land Bill ought to have made all and sundry know that this country is an autonomous State, equal in status to and in no way dependent on any other State, whether in its external or internal affairs, and its Supreme Court ought not to be superseded by any outside court.  When a gentleman representing the Fianna Fáil idea stands up and suggests that we should go to England, that we should allow our Courts to be superseded&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Senator knows perfectly well the issue involved. He and the Party he represents here <Col N="1216" /> have been standing for the ideal of an independent country, but here he asks the Minister for Finance to tax us to the extent of £1,000.  We want to have this country free in all respects, and free in respect of the Courts which we have set up.  This economy Party ought not to allow themselves to be led away in this matter.  It has been definitely decided by legislation that the Courts of this country are to be final.  The Constitution says that they are to be. The prerogative of the Crown is there, but the prerogative of the Crown was put there because we could not keep it out.  At the same time, while it is there, it has been agreed between the contracting parties that small cases and cases of this sort should not go to the Privy Council, and that the South African precedent is to be the guiding line.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak in this debate, not as Minister for Industry and Commerce, but as Minister for External Affairs on account of the matter at issue being an international one.  I am very glad that Senator Wilson raised one question as he did.  The prerogative, in so far as it remains in the Constitution, is a matter which must be faced on this point.  It was faced on the Land Bill of 1926.  At that time, the late Minister for Justice stated that when the Constitution was under discussion promises had been made that the preservation of the prerogative would be very much more a theory than a fact and a practice, and to fortify his view he read a statement made by Lord Haldane, in giving judgment in the first case that ever came before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council with regard to leave to appeal, in which Lord Haldane recognised that there was an analogy with South African practice.  On the matter of leave to appeal, Lord Haldane said: &ldquo;It becomes with the Dominions more and more or less and less as they please,&rdquo; and the Minister for Justice then said on the Land Bill that as far as we were concerned, it was our pleasure that it would become <Col N="1217" /> definitely less and less.  He referred to the leave to appeal as being obsolescent, and declared that it was our intention to make it obsolete as quickly as possible.  To those who are concerned with the sanctity of the Constitution, I will say this: We will always uphold the sanctity of the Constitution, but it is a matter of public knowledge that we were in debate with the British Government with regard to the Privy Council at two Imperial Conferences. Once was at the 1923 Conference, when the matter was left over.  The second conference that dealt with this showed that in so far as it had been left over it was left over in the state in which it had reached the Conference of 1926.  It was left just as found&mdash;a right of appeal in the Constitution, the extent of that right questioned and limited by the Land Act of 1926, and that legislative effort recognised on the other side as a most ingenious means of preventing any appeal to the Privy Council.  We sought at the Imperial Conference of 1926 to get this residue of the prerogative done away with, and our declared intention was to follow the South African example and to make it less and less as time went on, in Lord Haldane's words, until it finally disappeared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one issue raised here.  The matter is in dispute.  In the meantime it is left in the position in which the Imperial Conference of 1926 found it.  We are dealing with this case that has arisen.  There has been talk as to the rights of individuals.  Senator Sir John Keane said that through some error in drafting the original Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Bill, this situation arose.  By no means did it arise from any error in drafting of that Bill but from a misunderstanding as to the effect of an Article of the Constitution in gripping certain things which were in existence on the 6th December, 1921.  As to whether or not these properties were gripped by the Constitution and carried forward into our statutes there is still considerable legal doubt.  That legal doubt has been expressed here <Col N="1218" /> to-day.  We, however, accept the decision of the Supreme Court as final and that decision proves the law relating to copyright to be different to what we think the legislature intended. In this Bill we are endeavouring to establish the law as we always intended it to be.  It has been declared that after a certain date in 1923 copyright did not any longer continue and was not gripped by the Act of 1927.  That is the final decision of a Court that we regard as the final authority in legal matters.  We accept that.  Let us take the Performing Rights Society, about whose costs and damages Senator Comyn is so aggrieved.  Supposing we accept the law as laid down by the Supreme Court and refrain from introducing this amending and retrospective legislation.  What is going to happen the Performing Rights Society?  Not merely do they not get their costs, but the principle and the property for which they are fighting, in comparison with which the costs are negligible, both go by the board. The situation is that the copyright they seek to have upheld cannot be upheld.  We are amending the law retrospectively in favour of the Performing Rights Society, and we are doing so, not because of the Performing Rights Society's case, but because it was always the intention of the legislature that there should be no breach in the continuity from 1921 until the Act of 1927 became operative.  We were taking up the standard we always took up.</P>
    <P>There is another party to the litigation&mdash;the Bray Urban Council. What about the situation of the Bray Urban Council?  The Bray Urban Council have, in fact, acted in a way which has now been upheld by the Supreme Court of this country, finally as far as we are concerned, as being legal.  Why should we penalise the Bray Urban Council? We have to amend the law. We have to make it what we always intended it to be.  In the meantime, certain parties have suffered.  We say to those who wish copyright to be preserved without break of continuity that since the Supreme Court has decided against them a break is <Col N="1219" /> shown to have occurred and their property is, in fact, lost.  But to do them the justice we always intended should be done we are amending the law retrospectively to carry forward the property concerned.  This question of costs really does not matter to any great extent.</P>
    <P>In one part of his remarks Senator Comyn spoke as if the Performing Rights Society was bound to succeed on leave to appeal being granted.  It is very doubtful after the analysis made by the Supreme Court, that that decision would be reversed.  If there was to be such reversal of decision, that would give the Performing Rights Society the right to the property which they seek, plus costs.  We re-establish their right to the property, we cannot give them costs.  At any rate, we are not going to have the Privy Council to determine that matter, which is definitely and decidedly a domestic matter.  It may be argued that it is not, that in the case of copyright, which has its bearings outside the country, we should be more particular about outsiders rights than about our own. The effect may be international, but the legislation is a domestic question and the amending of it is a domestic question.  That is the point.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court has found the law not to be what we intended it to be.  How is that to be rectified?  Is it by allowing an outside body to decide contrary to the Supreme Court, or to treat the decision of the Supreme Court as final, and to amend the law?  This is a domestic matter, pure and simple.  It is not a matter in which an injustice has been done to people and that we are refusing to rectify it.  We say that we are going to preserve their property for these people.  We are going to have that done by legislation.  We are not going to have it done by the decision of a Court operating as if superior to our Supreme Court.  I would find it impossible, speaking either as Minister for External Affairs, or speaking as the Minister who is responsible for industrial and commercial property <Col N="1220" /> legislation, to make any recommendation to the Minister for Finance that he should meet the costs of the Performing Rights Society.  I offer the Seanad this Bill in its entirety.  If it be accepted by the Seanad that Section 4 be dropped, that these people should have a right to appeal and a gamble for their costs the Seanad may, perhaps, give them that choice but they must also give them the consequences of that gamble.  If the appeal fails they will have not merely their costs, but they will also lose the right to their property, for we cannot allow them to pick out the retrospective provisions of this Bill which suit them and discard the single clause to which they have minor objections.  If the proposals work any injustice at all it is going to be a very small one, and we have to judge between the two sets of parties&mdash;the Bray Urban Council, who went on what they thought to be the law, and who are declared by our Supreme Court to have been acting legally, and the people who also went on what they thought to be the law and who have been declared not to have the rights that they thought they had.  We say that as between these two we take the decision of the Supreme Court as final, and on that the costs have gone against the Society.  We accept that, but we are amending the law as far as the property is concerned.  We give back the right to the property, as we always wished to have that preserved, but we are not giving costs.</P>

      <P>After what the Minister has said there is very little hope that the Seanad will delete this section.  I would like to make one or two observations on the general principle involved.  I have not got my references here, but my recollection is fairly definite on the point with regard to the late Minister for Justice and his opinion as to the Privy Council appeal.  In the case of Lynham and Butler I am nearly sure I can substantiate that he said that it stood alone, that there were cases where appeal would <Col N="1221" /> be justified, quoting the Wigg-Cochrane case.</P>

      <P>We have to use our own intelligence as to whether this is a domestic or a much wider question.  I suggest to the Minister and to the House that it is most unsatisfactory for a litigant to be in an indefinite position of less and less.  If that is the intention of the Government, why not pay the costs, bring forward a Bill, repeal Article 66 of the Constitution, and let people know where they are?  But do not allow Article 66 to give people rights, to have them exercise those rights and to incur costs, and then obliterate these rights <i>ad hoc</i> by retrospective legislation.</P>

      <P>This motion gives an opportunity to the Seanad which it is deprived of by the fact that the Budget statement is made in the Dáil.  I think the opportunity should be availed of to make some general comments upon the tax system and the finance scheme that is at present operating and, with the permission of the House, I propose to analyse somewhat the position.  The Bill makes provision for finding a sum of twenty million odd pounds as tax revenue.  The Minister's statement on the Budget showed that the estimated tax revenue was £20,436,000, and the non-tax revenue £3,528,000. For the purpose of the figures I have to place before the House I want to deduct the revenue which is received for the Post Office services.  That is to say, we have £22,193,000 to deal with on the side of revenue.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce made a statement in the Dáil a week or two ago that was very pertinent and extremely important in respect of this matter.  He pointed out that by the figures produced by the Census of Production on the industrial side, and also by the figures which were provided by the Statistics Department with regard to agriculture, we had a net agricultural output in 1926 valued at £53,500,000, and in respect to other productive activities the estimated <Col N="1223" /> output was £31,500,000, that is to say, a total of £85,000,000 was the agricultural and industrial output of this country in 1926.  We may add to that, sums received as dividends on foreign investments, £12,500,000; pensions paid by the British Government to citizens of the Saorstát, £2,100,000; emigrants' remittances estimated at £2,200,000, or roughly let us say, £17,000,000 under these heads, making a total money value of £102,000,000.  There may have been changes and some additional amounts; there may have been changes in market values for 1928 and 1929 as contrasted with 1926, but one might say, in round figures, that the sum upon which the State can draw is round about £100,000,000 to £110,000,000.</P>
      <P>We are now asked in this Bill to provide amounts for making up a sum of £23,000,000, of which £20,500,000 is to be tax revenue.  I think that is a very important fact that 20 to 25 per cent. within one or two per cent.&mdash;it does not materially alter the argument&mdash;of the total earnings of the country are taxed for the purpose of expenditure under Government auspices.  I think it is well that Senators and the country generally should appreciate that as a very important fact. It is a very high proportion.  When I say that I am not asserting for a moment that it is badly spent, that it is unwise or unjust or uneconomic to draw from the total fund such a sum to be expended for Government services.  I can conceive, and I think I could argue successfully, that a great proportion of that money is more wisely, more judiciously, and more economically spent for the welfare of the country than it would be if it were spent by the individuals who earned it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purposes for which this money is collected have to be taken into account.  I find from an analysis of the estimates and expenditure according to the finance accounts of previous years, certain very important details that I think the House should be made aware of. <Col N="1224" /> I am taking the sum provided for in the Estimates, added to the sum which will be expended out of the Central Fund.  When one hears, as one does hear, so much about the cost of Government, I point out that what are Governmental services strictly, such as the costs of the Departments, army, police, prisons, law courts, and revenue, is rather less than £6,000,000 or 25.2 per cent. of the total expenditure for various national services.  I said it is possible that the money expended through Government channels is more wisely, more beneficently and more economically spent than it would be if spent by the individuals who originally earned it.  I want to support that by certain figures.  I take it that no one will openly avow that there should be a reduction in the amounts spent on old age pensions. Few will assert that the amount spent by the State, that is the State contributions to unemployment insurance, should be reduced, that the housing grants should be reduced, or that the State contribution towards health insurance, hospitals, sickness prevention services or local government should be reduced.  These various items which must be met if we are to keep up our reputation for humanity and civilisation, would otherwise fall upon individuals, either through the rates or through private charities.  At present they are moneys collected by the State and expended by the State, as I aver, more economically and beneficently than would be the case if the money was paid out by the individual.</P>
    <P>The total cost of social services is £3,368,000, or 15½ per cent. of the total expenditure by Government. Then we have what I call economic services&mdash;aids to rates, local loans, public works, beet subsidy, road fund, agricultural credit, agricultural grants, local taxation grant. Land Commission and a deficit on the Post Office.  These are services which are not strictly Governmental responsibilities in the old and narrow sense, but they amount to £4,477,000, or 19 per cent of the total expenditure. Property losses and personal <Col N="1225" /> injuries amount to £513,000, or 2.2 per cent of the total expenditure. Debt charges, including the annuity to the British Government in respect of local loans, amount to £2,555,000, or 10.8 per cent., and pensions amount to £2,061,000, or 8.7 per cent. I give these percentages because I am drawing special attention to the fact that the services I have enumerated under the heading of social services, economic services and aids to the rates, as well as education, amount to 53 per cent. of the total expenditure. So that in fact, when we are dealing with government proper it is only 47 per cent. of the sum in question which may be charged as Governmental expenditure.</P>
    <P>These facts, I think, should be taken serious note of by anyone who is inclined to discuss the problems dealing with taxation and with national expenditure.  The fact that we are spending so large a proportion of the national income through Government channels forces us to ask the question: What is to be the tendency, and how are we going to minimise the burden so that this high proportion of the total revenue collected by the State can be reduced? I am very firmly convinced that it is not by a reduction of the national charges we are going to make any improvement.  In fact, I believe that the inevitable tendency which cannot be resisted will be to increase and not reduce the amount that has to be nationally raised by taxation or otherwise.  I venture to prophesy that as we proceed, perhaps in the very near future, we shall find that the tendency of politics here will be to range ourselves on one side or the other of the proposition that the social services and the economic services, paid for out of Government funds will have to be increased, certainly maintained, and that the charges will almost inevitably rise rather than fall.  One side will say that the maintenance of these economic and social services is paramount and essential, while the other side will say that at all costs they must be reduced. I think that will be the issue upon which parties will decide future political alignments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1226" /> The Bill before us deals not so much with expenditure as with revenue, and here again we ought, I think, to analyse the figures which have been presented to us from time to time, and I make the attempt to put before the Seanad certain results of the analysis which I have been able to make.  I am taking the figures for 1927-28, which are the latest figures submitted to the Oireachtas. I do not think the present year's figures will vary very much. They will vary slightly here and there, but in general it will be found that these figures will be applicable to the present year's expenditure as well as 1927-28.  An analysis of the accounts for that year shows that of the total sum received&mdash; £20,356,000&mdash;by tax revenue, 65 per cent. was received through customs and excise, whilst 35 per cent. are in a group which I call taxes upon property and property-owners, such as income tax, estate duties, corporation profits, licence duties, motor vehicle duties, etc.  Taking that classification I find that the propertied class, if I may use the term, paid in that year 36.50 per cent. of the total tax revenue of the country. Taking a similar classification for Great Britain, they paid 62 per cent. of the total tax revenue of that country.  The duties upon intoxicating liquor and tobacco&mdash;this is a very important figure, and I ask the House to take note of it&mdash;totalled 49.50 per cent. of the tax revenue of the country for that year.  That is to say, what may be called voluntary taxation, taxation which may be thrown off by the individual and may not be incurred if he so wishes, amounted to half the total tax revenue of the country.  The taxation on clothing and household goods provided 6 per cent., food 4½ per cent., pleasure, entertainments and sundries 3.50 per cent.  I think these figures are illuminating, and will help the Seanad to get a better perspective when dealing with the problem of taxation and how that bears on the community.  Possibly some of my friends will say that I am giving a handle to the propertied <Col N="1227" /> class, and announcing to them the fact that they are bearing a grievance inasmuch as though they only constitute a small proportion of the population they bear 36½ per cent. of the total taxation.  I make the very rough&mdash;it is not scientific&mdash; estimate that the class which bears this income and property tax constitute not more than one-tenth of the population.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, some three or four years ago, made the statement&mdash;he did not assert that it was scientifically accurate&mdash;that the number of income tax payers in the country was probably from 60,000 to 65,000.  I do not know whether later experience has confirmed or altered that figure, but, accepting it as fairly reliable, I think we may take it that that class of the community, with their families, would constitute round about one-tenth of the population of the country.  I ask the Seanad to bear this fact in mind that, according to the Revenue Commissioners' returns, the total income of income tax payers for the year in question amounted to £53,000,000. That is to say, that half the total national income was appropriated by&mdash;I am not using the term in any invidious sense&mdash;or shall I say, enjoyed by one-tenth of the population.</P>
    <P>I want to draw attention to the direction and the tendency of our fiscal legislation in recent years.  For the financial year 1923-24, a married couple with three children, enjoying an income of £2,000 a year, all of it derived from investments, paid in tax £393.  For the current year they would have paid £236.  That is to say, they will have saved, comparing this year with the year 1923-24, a sum of no less than £157. A similar family, with an income of £5,000 a year all of it derived from investments, would have saved £588 for the year 1929-30 as compared with the year 1923-24.  Bear in mind that during this time the incidence of taxation has fallen with increasing weight upon the poorer sections of the community.  During that period <Col N="1228" /> when food and other household taxes, small proportionately as they are, have been increasing, the call upon the wealthier taxpayers has been very greatly decreased.  When one thinks that in these four years a married couple with three children with an income of £5,000 a year, all derived from investments, will have saved the sum of £588 in the payment of tax while the poorer sections of the community are having their taxation increased, one feels rather ashamed at the tendencies.</P>

What exactly it will be I cannot say.  If the Senator is trying to get me to make the admission that taxation upon food falls more heavily upon the poorer elements of the community, then I admit that at once.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the figures before me, but I am taking the fact that the total revenue of the country derived from taxes on foodstuffs&mdash;customs and excise&mdash;has increased as compared with that year. Taking the year 1925-26, and comparing it with the year 1929-30 the relative figures are that 61 per cent. of the total revenue was derived from customs and excise duties in 1925-26 and about 67 per cent. in the year 1929-30.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Senator what he alludes to as food? If all this revenue comes under the head of customs and excise, it seems to me that all of it might not be considered as food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think sugar is usually considered food, and, for finance purposes, even beer would be considered as food, as well as jam, currants and raisins.  I want to deal now with the class of people who are not deriving their income from investments, and to make a similar comparison to show the tendencies of our income tax laws and of our legislation generally.  I want to refer to earned income.  I find, comparing this year with the year 1924-25, that a man and his wife and three children, with an income of £400, will have had a reduction in his income tax of £2 5s. 0d. a year.  In the case of a similar family, with an income of £500 a year, the reduction will be £7 15s. 0d.  Where the income is £600 a year the reduction will be £11 5s. 0d., and if it is £700 a year the reduction will be £27 7s. 6d.  When we come to the £1,000 a year man, his reduction will be £73 10s. 0d. When you compare those reductions with the concurrent tendencies in Great Britain&mdash;perhaps it would be better if I were to take Northern Ireland for the purpose of this comparison&mdash;where the Free State income tax payer had a reduction of £7 15s. 0d. on an income of £500, the man in Northern Ireland had a reduction of £12 odd.  When we come to the £1,000 a year man, in the Free State the reduction is £73 10s. 0d., while in the case of a man in Northern Ireland or Great Britain, with a similar income, the reduction is £39.  My point is that the tendencies in this State have been to reduce the proportionate burden upon the wealthier section of the community and, at the same time, to restrict and lower the social services.  The tendency to reduce the social services, concurrent with the tendency to reduce taxation upon the wealthier section of the community, is to me an indication that we are not appreciating the <Col N="1230" /> relative values of human life and property.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go into details in respect to the present Bill, but I thought it well to point out these particulars and to give some indication of the facts which lie below the figures that are frequently placed before us.  I think that what I have said clearly indicates a difference of outlook upon social and economic policy and necessarily also upon our fiscal policy.  I have said that the big fact of taking some 20 to 25 per cent. of the total national revenue to be spent through Government channels, considered alongside what I believe to be the necessity for increasing rather than reducing the social economic services which are paid for by the Government, shows the importance of concentrating upon the productive activities of the country, and how necessary it is that there should be a speeding up of such activities as can be effected by Government policy to ensure greater agricultural and industrial production.  There must be a larger fund than one of one hundred and five or one hundred and ten million pounds out of which to pay for these social and economic services. I do not know whether at this stage it would be in order for me to discuss whether the Government policy, both on its agricultural and on its industrial side, is satisfactory towards the increasing of that national production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought so, and therefore I will not proceed on that line.  I ask the House to take serious notice of some of the figures which I have given, particularly the figures which I have just quoted in regard to expenditure&mdash;that at least one-half of the sum spent on national services, whether raised by taxation or otherwise, is spent on services which would otherwise have to be borne by the individual or through the rates, and if it were not so borne it would mean that there would be <Col N="1231" /> a considerable decline in the social standard and the moral qualities of the people of the country.  The conclusion that I want to enforce by further argument on another occasion is, that there should be a very keen concentration upon the absolute necessity for increasing the total fund out of which these revenues have to be drawn.</P>

      <P>What I have to say will, perhaps, be a little more definite than what the last speaker had to say.  Unfortunately, the Minister for Finance is absent from the House just now, but I want to get information from him as to some figures here.  I notice that in the Estimates for 1929-30, provision is made for spending £29,540,000, whereas the revenue is only estimated to produce £24,500,000.  That leaves, roughly, a deficit of £5,000,000.  The deficit last year was something in the neighbourhood of £4,000,000.  The question of this very large expenditure, which Senator Johnson seems to approve of, touches everyone, and perhaps all of it may not be necessary.  Taxation must be based on what the people can afford to pay.  I want the Minister for Finance to explain, to a superficial observer like myself, why the sum of £1,170,000 is paid to the British Government for pensions to ex-members of the Royal Irish Constabulary.</P>

      <P>What the Cathaoirleach has said may be quite true, but I do not understand it. What I am endeavouring to do now has always been allowed here.  In fact, I have done it myself on several occasions.  What I am trying to do at present is to get some information from the Minister.  We very rarely have the opportunity of <Col N="1232" /> seeing him here, and if a Senator does not avail of his presence to get information on points such as I am dealing with, then that opportunity may not come again for a long time. I want the Minister, if he would kindly do so, to give me an explanation on the point I have raised.  I do not profess to be very well up in these matters and that is why I am anxious to get the information.  I have heard that the Minister did give an explanation of this in the Dáil some days ago, but as the official report was only issued this morning, I have not been able to consult it.  As far as I know this matter has never been explained in the Seanad.  The payment of this sum of £1,170,000 to the British Government for pensions to the Royal Irish Constabulary ought to be considered as a non-party question. It is a mere matter of finance and of law.  I am not going to raise any division on the question, but am merely asking for information. What I have to say on the matter I will put in this way: In the Treaty of 1921 there were two Articles which dealt with finance, Article 5 and Article 10.  Article 5 has since been abolished by the arrangement arrived at in 1925.  Article 10, which remains, deals with pensions to public officials and to the police. Perhaps I had better read Article 10.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrington</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure laid down in this Bill will, I believe, have the effect of very materially simplifying questions in regard to the collection of revenue, and with that I am in thorough accord.  There are two sections in this Bill which, I think, injuriously affect this country and to which I wish to direct the Minister's attention.  I would appeal to him that he should, either by regulations to be made for administering the Bill when it becomes an Act, or by some modifications of the Bill itself, make such alterations as will carry out the objects I wish to bring to his notice.  Section 10 provides that if a man sells, shall we say, £1,000 worth of War Loan, on which, of course, he is taxed at present, and re-invests that money in England he will be unaffected.  But if he sells £1,000 worth of Saorstát Eireann Loan and re-invests what it realises in the Free State, he will be subject to double income tax.  That is to say, he will have to pay income tax on what he received in the preceding year on his £1,000 worth of Saorstát Eireann Loan.  But, if he re-invests the money in Irish securities, the income tax arising from the investment will be deducted at the source or before he receives anything. Therefore, he will be in the <Col N="1235" /> position of paying double income tax for the time being.  That, I suggest, will give rise to a great deal of trouble, as well as to a certain amount of discouragement to people to invest their money in Irish securities.  I am endeavouring to address myself to the subject divested of all technicalities, as they might conceal the real meaning.</P>
      <P>Clause 12 takes power where a business is discontinued to go into the accounts of that business for the preceding year and, where it is found there is any shortage, to collect extra revenue.  That is quite right; but it takes no power, if the business has not developed to the amount of the tax, for giving a refund to the taxpayer. It seems to me that is a little bit unfair.  I am only putting these things forward because, perhaps, they may have escaped the Minister's attention, and so that he may see his way to correct the matter in some way.  Obviously, if he taxes a man for revenue that has escaped taxation in the previous year, he should also have power to refund in a case where more taxation than was justified had been levied.</P>

      <P>The value of Senator Johnson's figures would be very much more enhanced had he included the poor rates when he was dealing with social services.  If he had included the rates he would find that a very considerable amount is spent on social services, and that the percentage would be very much greater than he has indicated.  I again want to deal with the old question of the basis of assessment for income tax as regards the farmers.  The present law is that the farmer is taxed on the annual rateable value of his place.  That would appear to be just, but in the way the income tax operates it means that the farmer pays twice, because he is first charged as an owner under Schedule A, and then as an occupier under Schedule B.  The result is that he is paying income tax on the basis of twice his valuation.  It is considered by many people that the rateable value of a farm is roughly the amount of income <Col N="1236" /> derived from the farm.  There can be no question about it but that it is unjust to charge a man income tax twice on his income.  The Minister may say that the farmer has the option of coming under Schedule D.  Most farmers are not good bookkeepers.  The farmer is a manufacturer as well as a shopkeeper. In connection with manufacturing firms there is a costing department.  The farmer is not skilled in bookkeeping, and is not able to calculate the cost of production, and he lets the Revenue Commissioners carry on with the basis of assessment under the Bill, which works out very unfairly.  He sends on the papers to an income tax expert, and he pays more to the income tax expert than to the Revenue.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister should make a farmer liable for income tax on half his valuation.  That was about the position before the war I want the Minister to get back to that, and at the end of the year he will be just as much in pocket. Under the British regime payment was on one-third of the valuation.  I raised the question of the assessment of rates on agricultural lands before but very little attention was given to it.  I consider that there is a great injustice inflicted upon the occupiers of land by reason of these rates.  Farmers have been taxed for the purpose of providing food for the poor, subsistence allowance to able-bodied workmen, and other matters of that kind.  Surely that is a State job and should not be dependent on the income of the farmers, for that is what it amounts to.  The farmer pays rates on his valuation, which is his income.  A shopkeeper in a town pays rates, not on his income, but on the value of the house he occupies, but the farmer has to pay rates on the rateable value of his holding, which is not income, as well as income tax. If the Minister had to pay 5/- or 6/- in the pound income tax out of his salary then he would understand the position of the farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of the small holder with a valuation of £30.  He will probably pay 5/- or 6/- in the <Col N="1237" /> pound on that.  Take the case of a person with an income of £1,000 a year.  He might live in a house with a valuation of £30, and he will pay, say, 5/- in the pound on the £30 towards the upkeep of the social services, and the £1,000 is left untouched. Is that just?  This is an English system.  It came into vogue in England in the time of Queen Elizabeth.  It was due to the fact that the poor used to get subsistence allowance from the monasteries, and when these monasteries were dissolved by Henry VIII. this iniquitous law was introduced.  In England they have now found that it was wrong, and they have now abolished rates on lands.  We want the Minister to abolish them here, not because England has done it, but because it is just.  Community services should be paid by the community&mdash;services such as the care and maintenance of the mentally defective, the destitute poor, and unemployed able-bodied workmen. These are national services and the burden of their upkeep should be borne by the taxpayers rather than by the ratepayers.  Why should the farmer above any other class be obliged to maintain the poor and pay for the upkeep of public institutions?  I hope the Minister will give us an indication that as far as reasonably possible this matter will be tackled.  If some new rearrangement of local government is necessary the farmers will not much regret a curtailment of local authorities in the country areas.  With regard to the loss which would follow the de-rating of land, I think the Minister when dealing with it last was exaggerating.  Twopence extra duty on sugar would meet the whole thing, but I do not believe that Deputy Johnson would agree with that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to several matters that are covered by the Finance Bill, to make certain suggestions, and to ask one or two questions.  We all appreciate the various points made by Senator Johnson, and I think we also appreciate the difficulty of the Minister <Col N="1238" /> for Finance when he realises that however desirable these social activities are the bill must be footed.  In connection with the death that took place last year of a former prominent citizen there was a considerable loss of death duties.  I think it might be claimed that he had acquired a very considerable amount of his large fortune through the activities of his business operations in the Saorstát.  I think it is rather a hardship when such an event occurs that the State wherein most of this money was accumulated should not to any degree share in the very heavy death duties which were due on his decease.  I suggest that that is a matter the Minister for Finance should consider.  I would suggest that it is a possible source of revenue to the State.  If the matter cannot be dealt with in any other way, then I think he ought to seek some protection in the creation of a company law whereby it would, practically speaking, be impossible for a nonresident to have such large interests, and to give the benefit of these interests, including income tax, death duties, and so forth, to a State or country outside the place where the money was made.  I think it is a hardship in the case of a huge concern making huge profits for many years and having accumulated interests here that the State should suffer from the absenteeism of the main proprietors, or any of them, with the resulting loss of income tax and death duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to income tax itself, there always seems to me to be an anomaly in the incidence of taxation as regards the allowances granted to fathers of families.  The first child, I believe, is allowed for at the rate of £36 a year, and subsequent members of the family are allowed for at the rate of £27.  I venture to suggest that the position should be exactly the reverse, namely, that as a family increased there should be an ascending scale of allowances, on the ground that while a man of a certain income might have one child without any great inconvenience from the point of view of income, as his family increases the proportionate <Col N="1239" /> value of the income earned diminishes.  I suggest that the taxation should be entirely the reverse. Let it be small for the first child, and be gradually increased in the case of subsequent children.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnson has discussed social services.  I for one am in complete agreement with him.  I think that if we realise the tendencies and necessities of the position that we must increase rather than decrease our social services.  That is why we must have a certain amount of sympathy with the Minister in finding the necessary money to do these desirable things.</P>
    <P>There is the question of unemployment insurance, and what is called the dole that is given as corresponding to the insurance payment to the unemployed worker.  It may be premature to raise this issue, but I think it would be a desirable thing for administrators, members of the Dáil and Seanad, and all citizens, to see if we cannot visualise the position whereby we would eliminate the dole altogether and have a form of guaranteed employment&mdash;that is to say, that every able-bodied citizen would be provided with work.  There should be no difficulty, in my opinion, in organising economic and reproductive work within the country. Surely when we have so many big jobs, such as forestry, drainage and the development of untilled land which is lying derelict and is not in many cases being economically exploited&mdash;when all these things are faced there should be no difficulty, in my opinion, in assimilating all the unemployed or potentially unemployed. It would improve the character of the people of the country if when a man is out of a job the State could place him in employment. The present unemployment exchanges could be made a bureau of distribution of man power, and perhaps a guiding force within a particular area for the utilisation of such man power.</P>
    <P>I think we are all agreed that the system of the dole is a pernicious one.  Men after being a period on <Col N="1240" /> the dole become unemployable.  Their character seems to go, and they frequent the betting offices and the publichouses and stand at the street corners.  A former decent citizen who is unemployed for a certain period and gets the dole, after hanging around becomes unemployable. When such men get employment, and I speak from experience, it is practically impossible to get decent work from them.  It is not adding to the dignity of our citizens to put them on the dole.  That is a system that does not improve the character of the people we want to see employed.  At the same time we must realise that we cannot leave them to starve. Senator Wilson has spoken with regard to the farmer.  There may be a great deal of justification for his argument&mdash;I have no doubt there is. I am far more concerned to know what is to be done with the human element employed by the farmers, the agricultural labourers.  At present they are nobody's children. They are not paid the dole, and how a great many of them live in the off season I do not know.  They come in shoals to me when the harvest season is over.  They get employment from March until the end of October, and then they have to drop off.  That is a thing that does not help to make good or decent citizens.</P>
    <P>I would like to know in what way the problem has to be solved.  I contend all of that labour could be assimilated; but it is a difficult problem.  It should be faced in a non-party spirit, and tackled in such a manner that it would not be looked upon as charity, but a measure of national duty.  I cannot speak with regard to the potential development possible in agriculture, but I can speak with some experience as regards industrial development, and I want to say here and now that the industries of the country are in a very delicate condition indeed. The future is not at all bright. People talk of a protection policy, and argue that by tariffs we are increasing the cost of living and not getting anywhere, and that we are encouraging an uneconomic and <Col N="1241" /> slovenly development.  There may be something in that.  I ask Senators to consider what manufacturers are up against in this country.  In the first place, we are catering for a market slightly under 3,000,000 people&mdash;a very limited market indeed. We are also catering for one of the poorest buying populations in the world, that is to say, that the buying capacity of this small group of under 3,000,000 in the way of manufactured articles is less than, perhaps, any other community that has any pretentions to civilisation. The result is that the manufacturer in this country is expected to produce as good an article at as cheap a price in competition with the mass-producing manufacturer, who is catering for, in the case of England, Scotland and Wales, 40,000,000; and in the case of the United States, 110,000,000, and with a large export trade.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not, we will have to face it: Are we going to develop from the point of view of industrial development of this country? If we have made up our minds that we prefer not to, well and good. If, on the other hand, we want a reasonable amount of industrial development and manufacturing production going on, then we have to face the question of tariff walls, and higher tariff walls than we have at present.  Even with tariff walls, and I say this after serious consideration and a number of years' experience, industry is not going to be established except at somebody's cost.  When the manufacturers try to develop they find that they are up against the competition of manufacturers in mass-producing countries. Whether the manufacturer, or series of manufacturers, are going to stand the gruelling business of losing money annually on industry I do not know.  Whether it is the national duty to stand by a national industry until developed I do not know.  One or the other must be done if we are to have an industrial future.  Therefore, when people talk of the possibility of raising revenue from tariffs, and the hardship inflicted on the main body of people by the imposition of tariffs, they <Col N="1242" /> have got to realise it in these terms. There is a point in the economy of the State below which we cannot go. Senator Johnson has dealt very fully with that.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter which I will touch on merely in an interrogative way.  Recently, there was a tariff imposed on woollen goods. There was a subsequent amendment whereby cloths to a certain value were to be admitted free.  That, I believe, was as the result of arguments put up by the Woollen Manufacturers' Association, or agents, I do not know which, but I understand of that cloth there is needed about 1,000,000 square yards in this country.  The factories had already laid themselves out to make that cloth, which I believe is mainly used for the ready-made trade.  I would like to ask the Minister what is the position with regard to this matter.  In conclusion, I would like to stress the necessity for taking action with regard to company control in this country, so as to prevent not only the loss of income tax but heavy death duties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMacLoughlin" hpid="Mr. MacLoughlin Mr. MacLoughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>My chief interest in the Finance Bill is in regard to Section 23 which raises the exemption limit on imported tweeds from 1/6 to 2/6 per square yard. As the Seanad will remember, the Tariff Commission investigated the question of tariffs on woollens for a period extending over two years. They visited a good many mills in this country and across Channel and made themselves acquainted with the conditions of output and capacity. They made an unanimous recommendation that there should be a tariff of 25 per cent., or 20 per cent. with the Imperial preference, on tweeds weighing seven ounces and upwards, and that goods costing 1/6 per square yard and under should be exempted.  This recommendation was adopted unanimously by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It met with very little opposition, if any at all, but as soon as the terms of the recommendation and the report were made known, the ready-made manufacturers made <Col N="1243" /> a case that the Irish woollen mills could not produce a cloth suitable for their trade, and that the raising of the tariff from 15 per cent. to 20 per cent. on imported ready-mades was altogether inadequate to meet the case.</P>
      <P>After two months' pressing the matter was referred back to the Tariff Commission, with the very curious result that the exemption limit was raised from 1/6 per square yard to 2/6 per square yard.  This was a complete surprise to the woollen manufacturers, because the decision of February was revised in May, almost before they had time to look around them; and it was more surprising considering the fact, as disclosed in the Report, that the Commission had gone very exhaustively into this question of cheap cloths for ready-mades; that, in fact, they had studied every aspect of the question, and they produced costings in the Report showing that, even assuming that the contention of the ready-made manufacturers was correct, that they could not get suitable cloths in this country but would have to import them and pay the duty on them, they would still have from 1/9 to 5/11 per suit to their advantage as against imported ready-mades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The woollen manufacturers contend that the case made by the ready-made people will not bear investigation, because they say that they are quite able to manufacture cloths suitable for ready-mades. They admit that they could not manufacture the very cheap end of the material, costing 1/6 per square yard, but they say that they could manufacture cloths from 1/10 to 2/6 per square yard, or from 2/10 to 4/- per trade yard.  It is the admission of these cloths at from 1/10 to 2/6 free of duty that is causing all the trouble, and that, according to the contention of the woollen manufacturers, does away with all the beneficial effects of the tariff; in fact the woollen manufacturers say that the ready-made people never placed an order for these cheap cloths&mdash;that <Col N="1244" /> they never went to the mills and gave them a firm order.  One of the mills has made the statement that since the tariff was passed in February they had made from 1,000 yards to 1,500 yards weekly of these ready-made grades, and they were getting the cloths gradually introduced when the change in the tariff suddenly and unexpectedly took place, with the effect that the trade in these cloths ceased and orders for over 12,000 yards were cancelled. I think only one firm of ready-made people were approached to see if they could make up the cloth, and it was found so satisfactory after one order that this additional order of 12,000 was placed which was cancelled after the exemption was given.</P>
    <P>I understand the attitude of the Minister is that as soon as he is satisfied that the woollen manufacturers are able to make cloth for the requirements of the ready-made trade, he will have the tariff readjusted to what it was originally.  He has declared that his policy is to have as much cloth made in this country as is possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Connolly said that 1,000,000 yards of this cheap cloth was required annually, that Irish mills have gone into this question and they state that, as at present equipped, they are able to produce and would guarantee 900,000 of the 1,000,000 yards at prices varying from 1/10 to 2/6 per square yard.  They are prepared to give a definite guarantee. Twelve out of the twenty mills that applied for this tariff will guarantee that they will produce a certain yardage every year and, further, that they will start delivery within eight weeks from the receipt of a firm order.  All this cloth would be made from Irish wool, spun into Irish yarns, and if it is the policy of the Minister to get as much cloth as is possible made in this country, I would invite him to adjust his exemption limit so as to have this 900,000 yards made from Irish cloth instead of having English shoddy substituted for it.  I suggest, therefore&mdash;and <Col N="1245" /> I have put down a recommendation for the Committee Stage &mdash;that the period during which it would be fair that the exemption would operate should be reduced from five years to one year, because if the Minister maintains the exemption at 2/6 per square yard for five years, as is contemplated in this section, he will seriously impair the measure, not only by decreasing employment, but by opening the door to fraud.  Everybody knows that there are unscrupulous traders who will certainly find means for evading the tax, and false prices in invoices are not entirely unknown to the officials of his Department.  Very few people who are not experts would be able to tell the difference between cheap tweed at 1/6 and 2/6 a yard, and it is extremely difficult for anyone &mdash;and it might puzzle some experts&mdash; to tell the difference between cloth at 2/6 a trade yard and cloth at 4/6 a trade yard, and cloths costing a 1/- more.  Therefore, this exemption may allow in tweeds at any price up to 6/- per yard, because it is a great temptation to certain traders across the Channel to send in goods costing 5/- and 6/- a yard and have them invoiced at 4/- and 5/-.  I believe that even at the present time it is being done, that tweeds are being invoiced as faulty or damaged, so that the sooner the door is closed to that kind of fraud the better.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a matter that was raised in the Dáil by a respected member of the Labour Party. He made the charge against certain Irish mills that they were importing yarns instead of making them at home.  I think that that charge was based on an entire misconception of conditions in the woollen trade.  It is a common practice for mills to specialise in the spinning of yarns and for other mills to specialise in weaving and finishing, the latter buying their yarns from the spinners.  In making worsted cloths yarns are never spun in the mills that weave and finish.  That is also the case in Scotland, where mills <Col N="1246" /> making the higher class Scotch tweed invariably buy their yarns instead of making them, because the making of them is a highly technical process requiring great skill in the dyeing and also requiring very expensive machinery.  One carding machine required to deal with the finer grades of wool costs anything from £4,000 to £5,000, so that the small mills, whose machines are worn out or which are not able to deal with the finer yarns, must buy them.</P>
    <P>Large mills with up-to-date machinery occasionally receive orders for cloth for which they cannot produce the yarns, so that when we examine this there is not so much in the charge as there would appear to be. The mills do not swell their profits by buying yarns, because they lose the profits that they would make by manufacturing the yarns, and I do not think there is any evidence that would warrant the Deputy in saying that manufacturers are not meeting their obligations to the community. At any rate, the yarns for these classes for which I am advocating the raising of the exemption will all be made at home.  I hope that the Minister will reconsider the exemption limit and that he will give that help to the business that the Tariff Commission originally found due to it, because we must recognise that, after agriculture, this is the basic industry of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point that Senator MacLoughlin has raised as to the spinning, several years ago one of the largest woollen manufacturers in the country explained to me that he had endeavoured to get all the woollen manufacturers to combine to establish and run one or two spinning mills to make their own yarns, but that he was unsuccessful.  I think when these people are getting a tariff some pressure ought to be brought to bear upon them to try to combine to get the spinning of their yarns done in this country, and I think when they are able to combine to get a tariff the Minister might suggest to them that they should combine to <Col N="1247" /> an equal extent to have the spinning of their yarns done here.  It appears that there would be hardly sufficient demand from any one mill to justify it in establishing a plant for its yarns, but if all the mills combined it could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister for an explanation on a question which is quite different from that which we have been discussing. It deals with Part II. of the Bill.  I understand that in the main, except as otherwise provided, Part II. comes into force on the 6th day of April, 1930, and that that in effect means that income tax on profits earned in a trade or profession for the year ending April 5th next will not be taken with the average of the previous two years, but that income tax will be paid on the full profits for the year ending on April 5th next and will be due in January, 1931.  In Section 14 a very fair and, I think, adequate provision is made for losses.  It is provided, if I read it correctly, that in any year of loss that loss will be deducted from any of the following six years as soon as may be, and it is further provided at the end of Section 14 that this will apply to the year ending 5th April, 1930.  Now all of that seems to be adequate and satisfactory.  But what is not quite clear to me is what will happen in the case of a trade or profession where there was a loss in the year ended April 5th, 1929, or in the year ended April 5th, 1928.  If there was a loss in the year ended on April 5th, 1929, for the sake of argument, that loss would, of course, be taken with the average, and although there was a loss in that year the firm concerned would pay some income tax, assuming that it had a profit in the previous two years. They would, therefore, get a certain amount of redress, but they would not get full redress, if my reading of the Bill is correct, in so far as the change takes place on the 6th of next April.  In other words, if there was a loss in the year ending April 5th next, they get full redress for that loss; if the loss happened in the year <Col N="1248" /> that ended on April 5th last they will get only part of that loss, because the average system will not be continued. I would be glad if the Minister would say if that is correct, and if so, does he not think that it might be met?  If my reading of the Bill is correct, it seems to me that Section 14 ought to be extended to provide for losses in the two previous years, in so far as those losses have not been met by an adjustment on the basis of averages.</P>
      <P>There is a matter in connection with the new motor duties that seems to me somewhat harsh, although it will probably only apply to a very small number.  Under the Bill the tax which was paid last January for the full year expires automatically on the 30th June, and a new licence has to be obtained at the new rate.  The unexpired portion is allowable as a set-off against the new tax; but if the owner of a bus &mdash;and it applies in some small cases &mdash;does not feel that he can make a profit and pay the new tax, and does not take out a new licence, he gets no set-off and he loses the balance. He must take his bus off the road unless he pays the increased duty, but if he feels that he cannot pay the increased duty, then the licence which he took out for a longer period than the six months&mdash; in some cases for a year&mdash;will be useless. He will lose the licence and also the money, which I think is rather a hardship.</P>

      <P>On the subject of income tax, there is a matter to which I would like to refer, because it entails a very real hardship to the taxpayer, and in some cases really amounts to a denial of justice.  It has to do with the appeal from an assessment, and it applies specially to assessments under Schedule D, affecting profits of a trade or profession. Income tax under Schedule D is assessed by the Inspector of Taxes.  When the taxpayer gets that assessment he is told, very properly, that he has a right of appeal if he is dissatisfied with it.  Formerly &mdash;and, indeed, I think still&mdash;there were two ways of appealing.  He <Col N="1249" /> could go to the County Court Judge, and now to the Circuit Judge, and his alternative was to go before the Special Commissioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying applies only to an appeal on a point of law.  He goes before the Special Commissioners, two very experienced gentlemen, who hear him in a back room in the Castle, where he goes with his solicitor, if he employs one, and his counsel.  He is met on the other side by a very experienced Revenue official and an inspector, and the case is argued out round the table, in the absence of the Press and of everybody else, absolutely <i>in camera;</i> and the matter is duly decided by the Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If either side is dissatisfied with the Commissioners' decision on a point of law, they have a right to go by what is called a case stated to the Circuit Court.  The case is stated by the two Commissioners. It states the facts, the figures, and the arguments that were presented to them on both sides, and it states, shortly, the question of law which is to be decided by the Circuit Court. That is stated with the utmost fairness to both sides.  I have never known a case, in my very long experience, where the Commissioners did not state a case absolutely fairly.  Before they finally state it, they send a copy of it to each side, and they are willing to listen to any suggestions that may be made to them as to how the case might be better stated.  But when it comes into Court, the case stated is heard with the public and the Press there. It is a very great hardship on many taxpayers to have their private affairs, the figure of the income from <Col N="1250" /> their business or from their professions, discussed in open court.</P>
    <P>The result of that is that a great many taxpayers do not go by way of appeal in a case stated on a point of law, simply because they do not like to have their affairs discussed in public.  I have known many cases of that kind in my own practice.  I have known a case or two where the Special Commissioners decided in favour of the taxpayer, where they stated the case entirely in favour of the taxpayer, a case involving some hundreds of pounds of actual tax, not of assessment, that the man would have to pay if their decision was wrong, and I have known at least two cases where men refused to go on with the appeal, although having a case stated in their favour, simply because it would expose their affairs.  That is a very great hardship. I was going to say that it was a sort of statutory blackmail, but, of course, there is nothing in the nature of blackmail in it, because the Revenue officials, just like the Commissioners, are absolutely honest, honourable and fair-minded men, but they have a zeal, and a very natural zeal, in working for their Department. It sometimes reminds me of the zeal that is spoken of in Scripture&mdash;&ldquo;The zeal of your house has eaten me up.&rdquo;  Be that as it may, there is this real hardship, a real denial of justice because a man does not like to have his affairs exposed to the public.  The remedy for that would be very simple&mdash;that on the application of either side the appeal should be heard <i>in camera</i> in the Circuit Court.  There could be no objection to that.  The Court reporter would be there to take down the legal arguments, and if the case is worth reporting he would do it for the Law Reports.  That is very fair, because it is reported, not in the name of the taxpayer, but as X., Y. or Z., and nobody knows about it, so that as far as that is concerned there would be no objection to hearing cases of this kind <i>in camera.</i>  I have put down a recommendation to that effect which I hope to move in Committee.</P>

      <P>This is the first Finance Bill discussion I have taken part in in which somebody has not congratulated the Minister for Finance. As one who has not usually done that, I should like to congratulate him on a record Budget&mdash;he has left things alone&mdash;because I have a great belief in the blessings of tranquillity, not only in law, but in administration; and, further, I believe if we allowed our financial masters to work and shut out Parliamentary discussion for a couple of years, possibly the country would benefit.  If this Budget is an indication of tranquillity, I hope it will be also a headline for other legislative measures. I do not propose to follow Senator Johnson into his academic and interesting arguments on the burden of taxation.  I will not for a moment accept his view that social services are, necessarily, always properly provided by the State, and are always wrongly provided by the individual. I would rather accept the view that money spent by the <Col N="1252" /> State is generally wastefully and uneconomically spent, that it is expended on account of all kinds of pressure and lobbying, which is really inimical to good business.</P>
      <P>On the figures supplied, I would point out to Senator Johnson that apparently taxation on food and clothing combined is only ten per cent. of the total taxation raised from Customs and Excise.  Of course that is assuming that you do not consider alcoholic drink as a necessity or as coming within the category of food.  I shall be very glad, also, to avoid this opportunity of entering into a discussion on the tariff question, believing that the whole thing is utterly and entirely unsound; in fact, it is one of the few things that reconcile me to the advent of the Labour Party on the other side of the Channel.  They have decided that they will not have anything to do with tariffs or safeguarding.</P>
      <P>Coming to the measure itself, I would ask the Minister to consider the hardship that could prevail in business in proceeding abruptly on to the previous year's basis in the case of trade.  Under the English Act they are not doing that; they allow a year of transition.  I have put down a recommendation to that effect.  One cannot draft amendments to the Finance Bill without assistance, but the effect of my amendment would be that during the two years 1930 and 1931 it should be optional in the case of traders only to have the right to go either on the three years' average or on the previous year.  In the English statute there are two pages of closely printed matter dealing with that.  I do not suggest my amendment meets it, but it could be done if the Minister wished to do it and the draughtsman set to work. I would ask him as a matter of principle to consider the codification of the Income Tax Acts.  We are working on a series of statutes that have been scattered over twenty-one years.  I think the last codification was in 1908.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, eleven years.  We have had a change of Government in the meantime, and the income tax law has become more and more complicated.  I suggest when they have got over the difficulty of altering the basis that the Minister should get his officials to work on the codification of these Acts.  It is perfectly bewildering to try to follow some of these clauses. Take Section 4 (1), for instance:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Assessments under Schedules D and E of the Income Tax Act, 1918, except&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) such assessments as the Special Commissioners are empowered to make under section 124 of the Income Tax Act, 1918, or under Rule 7 of the Miscellaneous Rules applicable to Schedule D of the said Act, or under Rule 7 of the Rules applicable to Schedule E of the said Act.</P>
      <P>Take Section 5 (8):&mdash;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 10 of the Finance Act, 1927 (No. 18 of 1927), shall be construed and have effect as if a reference to sub-section (7) of this section were substituted for the reference therein contained to sub-section (3) of Section 136 of the Income Tax Act, 1918.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, this is another tax on the taxpayer.  He must, unless he is extraordinarily brilliant, consult an expert.  You have the legal profession and the medical profession, and now you have the profession of income tax experts, practically as necessary as either of the others and, of course, a burden to the taxpayer. I would like to ask the Minister something about another matter.  I will not criticise him, because on the face of it he could hardly stand up to criticism.  It has reference to Account No. 22 in the Finance Accounts, the statement of capital assets and liabilities.  I do not suppose it purports to be anything except a traditional account; it has been there always, and was carried over from the old regime.  It sets forth the debt, and then a certain <Col N="1254" /> number of what are called capital assets.  Of course, they are entirely fixed assets.  The expenditure, for instance, on the Shannon Scheme is taken as a capital asset, but that is no more a capital asset than all the buildings and all the physical property that the State possesses everywhere, and it is nothing more than a general arbitrary selection of assets.  Some of the assets seem exceedingly doubtful. For instance, the asset of one million advanced to the Unemployment Fund.  Will that ever be repaid?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is being repaid at £300,000 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I fancy it will rather mean a subsidy.  Surely the Unemployment Fund must be a heavy drain on the State.  I accept the statement that it is being repaid. It is being repaid out of the surplus of the Unemployment Fund.  If that is so I accept it, but I am surprised. But surely, of far greater value would be a statement&mdash;it could only be an estimate&mdash;of the revenue assets and liabilities for&mdash;I think&mdash; there may be a real danger in not revealing them.  For instance, one knows that all accounts due by the State are not settled by the end of the financial year.  I do not suggest that it happens, but there is a danger that if things were tight a large number of current liabilities would be held over, the taxpayer would never know anything about them, and the Budget position would not be a true one.  The same thing applies, of course, to revenue assets. I imagine there must be very considerable sums not collected on account of income tax.  The date when payments should be made is past, and the payments have not been made.  I know that a very large sum of money is owing there. I hazard the guess that probably the exact details with regard to the Conjoint Office are not known.  The figure most probably runs into £1,000,000.  I will come back to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that if he is to add to the utility of these accounts he should include, if only an estimate, a statement of the <Col N="1255" /> revenue&mdash;assets and liabilities.  I am not going to labour the form of the accounts.  I have done so previously, but I say that until the Minister gets into the position where he can decentralise administration he will never get a true psychology in financial affairs.  He will have the Departments warring with the Department of Finance.  One knows the continual war that goes on between the spending Departments and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to say something about the Conjoint Office. The Conjoint Office is deplorably slow.  I know cases where it has the figures for three years and not even an assessment has been given.  The fourth year is now going on, and the figures have been asked for again. Surely that must represent a considerable sum of money to the State.  Surely it has power to make representations to whoever is responsible for the delays that occur.  It is very hard on taxpayers who have the misfortune, or good fortune, to be dual residents that they should have three or four years' liability piling up and that they should have to make provision to meet it.  On account of three years' taxes being unassessed my estimate of £1,000,000 being due to this country by the Conjoint Office or through its services is not excessive.</P>
    <P>I have a recommendation down to delete Section 17, but that is merely for the purpose of arguing it in further detail.  Possibly the Minister may be able before that time comes to give some information to the House as to these very vague terms to which I have referred or to give some definition of them.  Section 17 (2) says:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this section shall affect the basis of assessment in the case of any office or employment held or exercised occasionally or intermittently in Saorstát Eireann by a person who is not continuously resident there.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Occasionally or intermittently&rdquo; are the words I stress.  They may have a meaning in law, but I <Col N="1256" /> should say if lawyers get hold of them they will become exceedingly vague, and still more &ldquo;continuously resident.&rdquo;  We know what &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; means, but now we have these new terms which are very vague.  The Minister will agree that they should not be included in the Bill if they are liable to provoke indeterminate litigation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with a great deal of what Senator Sir John Keane has said about the Minister not having made any great change, which is highly commendable.  I notice that in Part IV. of the Bill, dealing with Corporation Profits Tax, he has retained a thing which he promised me years ago would be altered at the earliest possible moment.  It was a tax which was established to get war profits.  It is a war tax of the most undoubted character, and I do not see how anyone could defend its retention in this Bill.  The tax applies only to a few large firms in this country.  All public utility companies are let off.  I will not labour the point, as I am sure the Minister knows what has been said against it as well as I do, and has his own reasons for keeping it on. But I would say that with a tax which has such an extremely bad foundation, it would be much better if some other means were found of getting revenue from the same firms. It is an unjustifiable tax on an industry which was put on for purposes that long ago ended, and it should now be got rid of.  I think it is a great blot on the present Bill, but I will not say any more in that respect now.  I suppose the Minister's answer will be that he cannot do without the money.  Some other means ought to be found of dealing with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Johnson said that we should speed up agriculture and industry. As far as I know, agriculture is being speeded up, and on the right lines.  The market outside this country is being watched, our goods are being pushed and advertised, and it is there probably that our farmers are going to make their money.  Senator Connolly has <Col N="1257" /> rightly stated that we have a very small market in this country, but if we think that we are going to establish considerable industries in the Free State, depending entirely upon the inhabitants of the Free State, we are making a great blunder. If we speed up industries by putting duties upon goods which the mass of the people require, such as clothes and boots, undoubtedly the cost which Senator Connolly says someone must bear, will be borne by the poorest people&mdash;the working classes.  It is at their expense these things are going to be done.  We are told that a great deal of employment will be given, but it is an experiment, and I would suggest that where the Government proceed to speed up by putting on duties, they should be extremely careful about what they do.  The people who may be injured have no voice in the matter at all, or, probably they do not know much about it.  It is for the Government and those concerned with the taxation of the country to see that any experiments that are made are very carefully watched, and that the cost of materials across the water and here are always looked into.  The reason why the cost of living here is higher than in Great Britain should be looked into very carefully also.  The speeding up of industry in our home market by such measures as these is risky and dangerous, and the people who are paying the cost do not know that, and have not much chance of saying anything for themselves.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that if the Free State is to go ahead in industry it must look to the large markets of the world, it must follow what is going on at the other side of the Channel.  We must join in Empire marketing arrangements which, I believe, our agricultural people are doing.  The State ought to look after the industries which are trying to establish themselves in markets abroad and, if it can, help them.  I know that some measures are being taken along these lines, but I know also that money is not, <Col N="1258" /> to any great extent, being supplied to assist in what I might call the State advertising of goods produced in the Irish Free State.  We have a great handicap to make up when we go across the water.  The State should help us to get over that handicap.  I am sure that something could be done in that respect. Take the steamer that recently went round Scottish and English ports with exhibits of Irish goods. That was only a small tentative display, but similar things could be done on a larger scale.  I do not believe that any money whatever is being spent at present by the State in assisting such schemes.  I hold that the fostering of the export activities of Irish industrial enterprises is one of the very best ways that the Government could assist industry here.  That would be better to my mind than risky experiments. We have had an exposition of the woollen experiment by Senator MacLoughlin.  I doubt if any Senator could understand what it was all about.</P>

      <P>I would as soon attempt to give an exposition of the spirit trade.  It showed one thing quite clearly: that there was a tremendous amount to be said, and that it was a very big matter.  Even when the Minister tried to help one section he was probably injuring another section.  That was evidently quite clear.  You should look at that sort of difficulty and danger, and also look at the position they are in at present in Great Britain, where all the enterprises that have been assisted and helped by way of preference are in the greatest doubts, whether the duties are or are not going to be taken off, and whether the people who put their money into these industries will lose it, and also their business.  From the point of view of the ordinary business man <Col N="1259" /> the fostering of enterprises by these artificial means is a risky and a dangerous thing.  We should rather try to foster the foreign trade in the industries we have.  We will never have any large industrial activity in this country unless we can get foreign trade&mdash;trade outside what we can do amongst our own small population.</P>
      <P>I mention these matters because remarks made on the subject would lead one to believe that a great many people believe that a great industrial revival can be secured by fostering industries by means of these duties. It is a dangerous thing, and I hope the Government will never go far along those lines without doing what I understand they always do&mdash;carefully considering each case, making it a tentative one, and never adopting as a general policy the establishment in the Free State, by protective duties, of certain industries which they hope to foster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only deal briefly with the points that have been raised.  Unfortunately, I did not hear all Senator Johnson's speech, as I had to go to the Dáil, but I understand that he argued that our tax policy was wrong, because the proportion of revenue that came from what might be called the property owning or wealthier classes was less than in Great Britain.  It is so because of the circumstances. The fact is that there are not the accumulations of wealth here that there are in England.  I remember pointing out once before how a 5/- income tax here only produced about one-fourth of the revenue per head of the population that a tax of 4/- or 4/6 would produce in England. That is, that no matter to what extent we put on income tax here we could not get the same proportion of our total revenue out of income tax as is got in England.  The reason is not in the policy of taxing wealth less heavily than in England, but simply the difference in circumstances. I do not think I need go any further into that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Johnson that <Col N="1260" /> there is what I regard as an inevitable tendency to increase national charges.  There is a demand from almost every quarter for new State services of some kind, and that demand, however it may be resisted, must lead from time to time to new activities, whether they are social or whether in the nature of economic development, undertaken by the State.  While we must take care and proceed as carefully as possible in that direction, I think that tendency arises out of the increasing complexity of modern life, and that it is a tendency which is going to continue for a very long time.</P>
    <P>Senator Barrington raised a question about the possibility of a man being doubly assessed.  He suggested that if, say, War Loan was sold and invested in Land Bonds, the owner of the income might be doubly assessed under the new arrangement.  There is provision in Section 151 of the Income Tax Act of 1918 to meet that case, and the taxpayer would be entitled to relief as a person doubly assessed for the same cause.  With reference to Section 12, where a business is discontinued, I think what is provided there is simply the converse of the position when an industry is started, and it seems to me to be a fair provision. There is a similar provision in existence in Great Britain.  If we had not the provision that is set down in that section, we might find that businesses were nominally discontinued after a year, when they had made large profits, and nominally re-started, by some technical trick, in order to avoid liability for tax.  It is necessary, therefore, to have means of getting tax from revenue that has been actually earned in the business.  As I say, we have a converse provision for the advantage of the taxpayer in the case of a business which has just commenced operations.</P>
    <P>The question of farmers' income tax has been argued very often in the Senate, and I have pointed out here before that, so far as farmers, who have no other source of income than their agricultural profits, are <Col N="1261" /> concerned, the question of income tax is of no importance.  I have gone into it, and I think I once gave an estimate of the amount we get from such farmers in the whole Saorstát as being less than what would be required to pay the cost of the electric light in the Dáil and the Seanad for a year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my argument. If you reduce it you would have no trouble at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It really becomes important when it affects farmers who have other sources of income&mdash;shops, investments or other things.  The owner of a business premises is liable to income tax under A and D Schedules in the same way as a farmer is liable under A and B.</P>
      <P>The question of rates on agricultural land is a very much bigger question.  As to the actual rating system itself, I think that is rather outside the scope of the Finance Bill.  So far as the question of de-rating is concerned I have not very much to add to what I already said. It is obvious that local government would have to be radically reformed if we were going to undertake de-rating. In my opinion, local government, as we know it, would have to be abolished because, as I pointed out, de-rating is a very much bigger proposition here from every aspect than it is in Great Britain.  If we were to abolish local government there is no doubt that the cost of services now carried on by local bodies would increase tremendously. I believe that a great deal of that increased cost would be wasteful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, if any central authority tried to administer home assistance the expenditure would easily be treble, or perhaps quadruple the present expenditure.  Again, I believe that if roads were controlled by the central authority we would be continually having the type of debate described in the Dáil as &ldquo;a bog road debate,&rdquo;&mdash;everyone getting up and asking why particular roads were not improved&mdash;so that people <Col N="1262" /> condemning expenditure one day would be asking for expenditure for their own districts the next day.  I believe that the cost of roads, if run by the central authority, would increase very much beyond the present level, and I do not think that increase would be justified.  The same thing applies to mental hospitals and to practically all the other services. It is a question as to whether some new form of local government could be evolved, which would prevent the whole pressure for increased expenditure falling on the Minister for Finance, and, at the same time, prevent people who were actually controlling the money from developing a spirit of recklessness which would be liable to arise if they had no responsibility for raising it.  It is really a big question on that side, apart altogether from where we would find the £2,000,000 or so that would be required to do it on the present basis of expenditure.  I do not know whether 2d. on sugar would go very far towards providing the income.  It must be remembered that the increase would fall very heavily on people who could not afford it, while some of it would go towards the relief of others who were much better off.  The raising of the revenue would be a difficult thing. In my opinion, it would not be fair to concentrate on a single tax and it would be necessary to try to get it by a number of taxes which would spread the burden as well as it could be spread.</P>
    <P>I have indicated before that the question of de-rating, simply from its political aspect, requires further consideration.  There is a demand for it.  That demand, because there is de-rating in the adjoining areas, is bound to continue.  The Government must consider the whole thing in the most thorough way, and, if there is a method of doing it, which I hope will be beneficial to the community, that method should be adopted. After further examination if it proves that, on the whole, in our circumstances the adoption of de-rating would be harmful we would have to stand on that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1263" /> Senator Connolly mentioned the question of the loss on death duties. We did certain things with a view to getting death duties in the case indicated.  As a matter of fact, very large sums could have been saved to the estate of the deceased if the methods which were pointed out in our legislation had been adopted. However, they were not.  There was a loss of revenue to the Exchequer here, and there was a very big loss to the estate.  It is difficult to know what to do.  It is necessary for us, when so many people here have investments in England, to have some form of double tax relief so far as death duties are concerned.  If we had no such thing people who have investments in England, and who could manage to live in England, who have not many investments here, except perhaps houses, and who live here because they spent their lives here, and even made their money here, would go to England, and we would lose all, so that it is necessary to have a system of double tax relief in respect of death duties with Great Britain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister ever considered the question of having death duties on the same basis as income tax?  Has that been explored?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>We are very anxious to have that, but unfortunately the British Exchequer is not willing to make an arrangement with regard to death duties similar to that made with regard to income tax.  The arrangement that was come to was the best possible arrangement that it was possible to get agreement on when the matter was discussed.  It has been touched upon from time to time with a view to re-opening it, but at present I do not see any possibility of doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking the double tax agreements as a whole, they are very favourable to us.  The income tax arrangement is extremely favourable to us, but the death duty arrangement is unfavourable to us.  On balance, the existing agreements, as they stand, are in our favour.  They are very <Col N="1264" /> good agreements, from our point of view.  There are firms which have been registered in England, and even though they own property here they are controlled in England.  I do not know that it would be easily possible to get any arrangements made which would cause firms to change their residence or domicile.  We have adopted a provision whereby there is an increased rate of Corporation Profits Tax payable in the case of a firm which has no colonial register established here.  I think the result of the arrangements made a couple of years ago will be that firms which carry on business here, and have shareholders here, will establish these colonial registers here. In that case, we will get the whole of the death duties falling due in respect of shares held by someone resident here, and on the colonial register of a company established here.  One death did occur two or three years ago where a very substantial sum would have come into the Exchequer if the firm, in the shares of which most of the estate was invested, had actually been on the colonial register here.  As it was, they were liable to tax in England and they were liable to tax here.  We only got the proportion that was due to us under the double tax relief arrangement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not possible, in a sense, to protect ourselves in the case of an individual belonging to a company whose main manufacturing business is situate in the Saorstát?  Would it not be possible <Col N="1265" /> for us to protect ourselves by some system of control such as the maintenance of a residence in this country where the company is operating?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that we can do nothing in that case beyond what we have already done, that is, by an adjustment of the Corporation Profits Tax to force the company to establish a register here or, in default of establishing a register here, to pay excess duty here year after year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, might I suggest that it would be possible to make it uneconomic for them to do otherwise than to register here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Than by establishing a register here?  That has already been done.  That would give us the entire death duty in the case of shareholders resident and domiciled here.  Of course, it will not affect the shareholders outside the country as it would if the register was actually registered and controlled here. I do not want to discuss this individual case, but the firm, in fact, is registered outside the country. Senator Connolly mentioned the matter of children's allowances.  I agree that there is no reason why the allowance for the first child should be greater than in the case of the others.  It is intended, when revenue considerations permit, to increase the children's allowances somewhat.  It is intended to make the allowance for all children the same.  There is no dole, strictly speaking, here now.  We have applied the system of the dole only to uncovenanted benefit.  At present the only benefit that is paid is the covenanted benefit arising out of stamps put on cards in respect of the worker who gets it.  I do not know that that covenanted benefit is such a bad thing as the Senator seemed to suggest.  I know that the dole, when continued over a long period of years, had undoubtedly a demoralising effect on people, and if there had been any other way of meeting the situation that had arisen then the dole would have been <Col N="1266" /> entirely indefensible.  It is not easy to give guaranteed employment, and above all, it is not easy to give employment that is economically reproductive. The Senator mentioned forestry and drainage.  Forestry is not an economic proposition.  I would say that about half the money spent on afforestation is lost.  As regards the other half, at best only 50 per cent. of it is reproductive. So far as drainage is concerned, it is highly unproductive.  There are very few drainage schemes that will give any substantial return at all. Those few are being attended to, and along with the others that are not so good will soon be finished with.</P>
      <P>A great deal of the drainage work to be done may improve a little land, but when you take into account the cost of that improvement it would be little better, from the point of view of reproductive results, than if you were simply to spend money in employing men to dig clay out of a hole and to throw it back again.  Probably that would give a certain amount of employment, but that is about all you could say for it.  As to a great deal of the drainage work that one hears suggested, it would be very difficult for the State to find economic reproductive employment on that for people who might be out of work.  Then, as regards whatever employment the State might give, a great lot of people would not be fitted for it. Furthermore, if they undertook that kind of work for any period of time it might, to some extent, serve to unfit them for their normal occupations, in the way, for instance, that certain people who do fine work with their hands would be rendered incapable of doing that work if they had to handle a pick and a shovel for any period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of providing employment, instead of giving an allowance to a person who is out of work, is a very difficult one.  If you were simply dealing with seasonal unemployment, I could not see any great objection to the unemployment insurance system.  If, for instance, <Col N="1267" /> a man is working at a trade in which he is liable to have two or three slack months in the year, it is quite reasonable that he should continue to live in the place where his normal employment will be provided, and that he should receive an allowance and wait for the time until normal employment for him will become brisk again.  There is the problem of dealing with people who have been long periods out of work, and of people who have, perhaps, never been in work owing to the abnormal economic circumstances that have existed during the past few years.  That is a very difficult problem.  If we are to solve it, and I think we must face it, we can only solve it as a result of big expenditure. I do not believe that we can solve it on any basis of giving men work that will pay for itself. If we are to face it, we must do so by deciding to provide employment, and make up the loss from the point of view of the Exchequer.  There, again, you are up against great difficulties. If you take men who are unemployed and set them, at the expense of the State, to produce something, the making of desks, for instance, immediately you have the people who are normally engaged on that trade on the war-path. From that point of view alone, this matter is full of tremendous difficulties. At one time there was some suggestion made to this effect, that instead of paying unemployment benefit to people out of work that a contribution on a wage percentage basis should be given to firms or local authorities that would employ them.  There is a great deal of objection to that, and after a good deal of consideration it was dropped.  I am not sure whether the proposal was defeated in the Seanad or not, but at any rate it was dropped.  I think that the proposal to drop it was actually made here in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with what Senator Connolly says about industrial development.  I believe that we must have industrial development <Col N="1268" /> here.  I think I said before that there is no possibility of employing more people here on the land than are at present employed on it.  They may be differently distributed on the land, but I do not think that more people can be employed on the land than are employed on it at present. Perhaps if circumstances were better less would be employed on the land.  I think that if there is to be progress, whether by way of increasing population or anything of that sort, there must be industrial development.  I think it is a worthy kind of national expenditure to set up industries here which will hereafter become rooted and be a permanent source of employment.  I agree entirely with Senator Connolly that, taking this question as a whole, somebody has got to pay.  You may sometimes impose a tariff which will lead to the setting up of an industry at no cost to the community, but that is the exceptional case.  In general, if we take a group of tariffs we find that for the industrial progress made and the results obtained from them the community have to pay.  The Government has had in mind the other side of the case, which was put by Senator Jameson when he said that we ought to move carefully in the matter.</P>
    <P>It was because we felt that the agricultural producer, who is our main producer, is having a difficult time, and that he can only bear a limited burden in return for future benefits that may come to the country by way of increased industrial activity, that we set up the Tariff Commission.  We set up the Tariff Commission so that proposals for tariffs might be examined, and so that the implications of them, so far as possible, might be clearly seen before they were imposed.  Nothing has occurred which would change our attitude in regard to that matter.  We feel that it was right, and is right, to use tariffs for the increase of industrial activity, but on the other hand we must use those tariffs with some moderation or they may, on the whole, result in an economic loss rather than in an economic gain to the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1269" /> Senator MacLoughlin talked about the changes in the woollen tariff. The position there is that the woollen manufacturers gave the Tariff Commission to understand that the cheaper cloths, cloth valued at more than 1/6 per square yard, which are required by the Wholesale Clothing Manufacturers' Association, would shortly be produced by them to the extent, or nearly to the exent, required by the Wholesale Clothing Manufacturers. When a tariff had been imposed, and when discussions took place about this particular matter, the woollen manufacturers then said that these cloths could not be produced for a considerable time.  When the woollen manufacturers had made that statement the Tariff Commission came to the conclusion, and we accepted their recommendation, that the exemption limit should be extended temporarily, and consequently the second Financial Resolution dealing with woollens was introduced.  The woollen manufacturers recommended an increased tariff on wearing apparel.  The Tariff Commission felt, and I think myself they were right in their attitude, that no further increase should take place in the tariff on wearing apparel, except following an application for an increased tariff, and after a full consideration of that proposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMacLoughlin" hpid="Mr. MacLoughlin Mr. MacLoughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is wrong in saying that the woollen manufacturers recommended that.  I think that all they did was to acquiesce in the suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  They acquiesced in the suggestion.  The two bodies came with the recommendation to the Tariff Commission to increase the tariff on wearing apparel.  The Tariff Commission did not accept that but instead increased the exemption limit. The woollen manufacturers were surprised, and, I suppose, annoyed at the change.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and myself have had interviews with them since.  We have had interviews with <Col N="1270" /> the Wholesale Clothing Manufacturers, and I must say that it is extremely difficult to find out what are the real facts of the matter.  I know that I met a deputation of about eight or ten woollen manufacturers. I asked them would they be able to supply to the extent of, say, 80 or 90 per cent. of the cloths between the limits of 1/6 and 2/6 per square yard that might be required by the wholesale manufacturers.  They told me that they would be able to supply that proportion in about eighteen months.  A day or two after I had a letter from them saying that they would be able to supply them in six months.  It is extremely difficult, as I have said, to get at what are the real facts of the position.  The Wholesale Clothing Manufacturers on the other hand doubt whether a reasonable proportion of the cloths that they require in these grades will be available for them for a very much longer period. I have already stated in the Dáil that our desire is to cover woollen cloths to the greatest possible extent by the tariff, and to have most of them made here.  That was the view that was taken, too, by the Tariff Commission in making their original recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be quite willing, at any time, to alter the terms of the woollen tariff back to that which was fixed in February last if I were satisfied that the woollen manufacturers could supply somewhere nearly approaching the whole of the requirements of the Wholesale Clothing Manufacturers along those lines. It may be that point will be reached well inside of five years.  It may be that the manufacturers will make a bigger effort and that their efforts to meet the requirements will be successful, but I have no hope myself that they will be able to do it within a year, in spite of their own statement which is now made that they would be able to do it in six months. In view of the previous statement of theirs, I doubt that very much, but I certainly would have no objection to shortening the period to two years.  If the manufacturers had not <Col N="1271" /> made an effort before the end of two years to meet the requirements of the trade, we would certainly have to put a section in the Finance Bill continuing the present exemption limit.  On the other hand, if the manufacturers had risen to the requirements of the situation it would be possible for us to let the provision dealing with woollens to lapse and have the 1/6 exemption limit restored.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Minister mean by rising to the requirements of the situation?  Does he expect manufacturers to make tweeds without having definite orders for them?  Up to the present the ready-made people have never put down definite orders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid they are like two spancelled goats, and that it is very hard to get any agreement between them.  I do not expect them to manufacture cloth for which they have no orders.  What they can do is, they can get out samples and offer them and show that they are prepared, not merely to take orders at some future time, but that they are prepared to take orders as soon as the Wholesale Clothing Manufacturers will give them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point that I personally have not examined.  I think the position is, that in certain grades of cloth Irish wool will be used, but I am not in a position to say that Irish wool will be used in all the grades.  Some of the cheap cloths are, to the fingers, really fine cloths.</P>

      <P>The Minister can see that the matter is of some importance in the consideration of this question.  It has general economic reactions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It has.  At present we are very desirous that they should make those cloths.  We are very desirous that we should be able to restore the tariff to the original scope, but on the other hand, I believe that some of these Wholesale Clothing Manufacturers have very recently extended their industry because of the wearing apparel tariff.  We are satisfied that some of them could not continue if they were deprived of a substantial portion of the protection that is given them by that tariff, so that we must have some assurance that the woollen manufacturers will be able to meet the greater part of the demand of the Wholesale Clothing Manufacturers, if not at the British price, then at something near that, before we could go back to the original position.  I think myself that the two year period is not too long.  It is not as if it were an industry which actually existed to any extent that was in danger, or was a branch of industry that was in danger of disappearing.  In actual practice there has been comparatively little manufacture of these cloths, and that by only one or two mills.  There is only one small mill that was prepared to specialise in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Douglas asked a question about allowing for losses that had been incurred in business in the year ending the 5th April, 1929, or in the previous year.  That is a matter I would be prepared to consider.  There is time enough to consider it between now and this time next year.  An amendment, if considered necessary, could be introduced into the Finance Bill next year and could take effect then.  The same thing would apply to the point raised by Senator Sir John Keane.  That is a point that, if thought desirable, could be introduced by way of amendment in next year's Finance Bill.  With regard to the point raised by Senator Brown <Col N="1273" /> about the hearing of appeals <i>in camera</i> in the High Court and Circuit Courts, that is a matter that was brought to my notice for the first time in the Dáil this year.  I had never heard any complaints myself in regard to that matter before.  I have not yet had an opportunity of consulting people who, I think, ought to be consulted about it.  I would like, for instance, to have the point of view of the judges on the matter. So far as I am concerned myself I do not see any great objection to it provided it takes place at the instance of the taxpayer.  It would perhaps be a rather new procedure to have laid down that if an important point of law&mdash;a point of law of fundamental importance&mdash;should arise that it should be argued <i>in camera</i> in the courts.  I do not think that I could come to any final decision on that at this stage of the Bill. I am interested in it rather from the general public point of view.  I see no objection to it from the revenue point of view.  Of course, I could not introduce anything like that into this Bill because if I were to do that, then, to begin with, I think, perhaps it would no longer be a Money Bill. Perhaps the matter can be discussed more fully when it comes along later.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane raised the question about certain items in the finance accounts.  These accounts are of a limited scope showing certain capital assets and liabilities of the Exchequer and not of the State.  I think that if you want to show capital assets and liabilities of the State there might be a great deal of dispute as to where the line would be drawn.  A Conjoint Office was established in 1926.  There were very considerable arrears at the time due to the existence of cases which were not easy to settle in the absence of such an office.  The arrears which then confronted the officers dealing with the work have not yet been overtaken.  It does not mean that we are out of revenue in respect of cases that have not been dealt with because there have been payments on account.  There have been very substantial payments on account in cases that have not yet been disposed <Col N="1274" /> of.  There are certain cases in which I am afraid the Conjoint Office will always be a bit slow. These are cases where acute differences of opinion arise between the two revenues.  I do not know whether anything can be done that has not been done to have the work hurried up.  Both revenues are naturally anxious to have the work hurried up.</P>
    <P>There is always a demand when it comes near the end of the year for money, and I think the Conjoint Office gets conjoint pressure.  The words to which Senator Sir John Keane objected, &ldquo;employment occasionally and intermittently exercised,&rdquo; are words which are actually in the British section, and I presume that they are good words for the purpose.  They were at any rate adopted by the draftsman who had all the considerations before him.  It is necessary, of course, to deal with employment which is occasionally or intermittently exercised, otherwise on the basis of the preceding year you could have a man earning income this year and not earning any the next, and again earning the next year a very substantial sum with no income tax liability at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the same apply to the words &ldquo;continuously resident&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The words &ldquo;continuously resident&rdquo; are also, I think, in the British section, but I am not so sure of that.  So far as Corporation Profits Tax is concerned, I have never regarded that as a tax suitable for permanent retention in our scheme, but it is a tax which gives a substantial sum, and which serves certain other purposes.  It is a tax which in certain cases gives us the equivalent of death duties which we could not otherwise recover.  I had one or two proposals for getting the equivalent of these death duties by taxes other than the Corporation Profits Tax, which, perhaps, if adopted, would have resulted in some substantial diminution of revenue <Col N="1275" /> which we could not have afforded at the time.  I hope it will be found possible before very long to drop the Corporation Profits Tax and to get a substantial part of the revenue which at present comes from that tax levied on another basis.  I do not know.  I have not given very much consideration to the question which was raised by Senator Jameson, that of advertising abroad.  It is a matter which has had the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture.  I think a fair amount has been done one way or another, not necessarily by newspaper advertisement but by exhibitions, and so forth, for agricultural products.  I do not think as much has been done for industrial products.  There is, I think, only a certain small number of industrial projects in connection with which money could be profitably spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the products of our industries do not sell abroad, and have no hope of selling abroad. They cannot meet the ordinary competition with which they are faced at home without tariff protection.  So far as they are concerned, any expenditure in regard to them by way of State advertisement would be useless.  As regards the others, I think exactly the same theoretical case can be made out for expenditure as can be made for expenditure by way for community expenditure in the imposition of tariffs.  I think in both cases one can urge some objection. One can urge there are risks that even with community expenditure in the protecting of home industries one should not take.  These industries may not take root, and the money that people were forced to expend on them for a period may turn out to be lost.  So far as the export industry is concerned, it may happen that legislation outside and changes in tariffs by another country may cut off the export trade.  There is a risk there that the money expended may be lost. Therefore, I think there are risks in both directions.  I think that the <Col N="1276" /> same sort of case in principle can be made out for extending the export market of an industry which is really in a position to compete abroad as can be made for helping an industry at home which is going to occupy the home market.</P>

    <P>(2)  Every totalisator licence shall operate to authorise the person to whom it is granted (who shall be named in the licence) to set up, maintain, and work a totalisator at the place and on the occasion or occasions or during the period specified in such licence but subject to the conditions and restrictions set out in such licence and to the regulations made by the Minister under this Act.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Minister may charge such fee for the grant of any totalisator licence as he shall think fit, and any such fee may be either a single payment or a series of periodical payments and may be either of fixed or of variable amount, and in the latter case may, if the Minister so thinks fit, be calculated by reference to the sums staked by means of the totalisator to which the licence relates.</P>
    <P>(4)  A totalisator licence may, as the Minister shall think fit, be granted in respect of any one or more specified places or in respect of all places of one or more specified classes or descriptions in Saorstát Eireann or any <Col N="1277" /> specified part of Saorstát Eireann and may be granted for one or more specified occasions or for all occasions of one or more specified classes or descriptions occurring during a specified period.</P>

      <P>Section 3, sub-section (1).  To delete the section and to substitute therefor a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) A Circuit Court Judge may, if and whenever he thinks fit, grant to any person a certificate entitling such person to apply for and obtain from the Revenue Commissioners a licence (in this Act referred to as a totalisator licence) to set up, maintain and work a totalisator within the area included in the jurisdiction of the said Judge for such period not exceeding one year and subject to such conditions and restrictions as may be set out in such certificate.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have not studied the particular section, but I believe the general principle of this amendment, and of other following amendments is that the control of the operations of the totalisator will be placed in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>This, the first amendment of a series, would completely upset the Bill.  It would mean that the person looking for a licence would have to satisfy the Circuit Court Judge in order to get a licence.

The Revenue Commissioners, for instance, grant licences in the case of publicans.

I think we must have one licensee for the totalisator and that it would be impossible to have a number of firms running totalisators. This is wholly and solely a matter of revenue.  If there is reason at all for intervention it would be absurd to have a judge deciding whether a totalisator was to be set up, say, at Leopardstown or not.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Comyn's main objection, from the constitutional point of view, was not to this section, but to Section 6, where the Minister has the right to fix the maximum penalty.  This particular section only gives the Minister the right to come to a bargain with the licensee of the totalisator. You are not going to have a totalisator set up in every racecourse, and you must have some particular body responsible who are going to set up this very expensive machine and work it in the interests of racing. The constitutional objection does not apply to Section 3 as it does to Section 6, for this is really administration and not legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there would be any great difference in having the Revenue Commissioners instead of the Minister for Finance. In this case the Commissioners would not issue licences.  They might refuse to issue licences, so that the Minister would be forced to bring Section 4 into operation and have the Revenue Commissioners. It might leave the Revenue Commissioners in the position of holding up the grant of a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, perhaps, a point of constitutional value in connection with this.  The Commissioners give power to issue licences and, according to sub-section (3), charge fees.  This is very like the power to levy taxes within certain narrow limits.  I do not wish to make a great deal of the difference between the Minister making regulations and issuing licences, and the Revenue Commissioners issuing licences, although the Revenue Commissioners are looked upon as a kind of judicial or semi-judicial authority, and that takes them out of the category of a political Ministry.  I do not think the point is made specially for this Bill, but in its effect it is a precedent of a constitutional character.  Touching the same problem, I have put in an amendment regarding the fee to be charged to the effect that such fee shall only be chargeable after having the sanction of the Dáil.  I <Col N="1280" /> think that is important.  As the section stands, it gives the Minister power to make charges without legislative sanction.  In my opinion, that is rather unwise.  If I understood Senator Comyn rightly, when he was speaking on this he touched on an aspect of the question I had raised on Section 6.  While I recognise that all these sections were in the original Bill I think they were allowed in by mistake, and that they should not be in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The Revenue Commissioners shall charge a fee for the grant of every totalisator licence, to consist of the sum of one pound sterling, payable on the issue of such licence, together with a further payment or series of periodical payments to be calculated at the rate of five per cent. on the sums staked by means of the totalisator to which the licence relates.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is that the charges shall be laid down in black and white in the Bill.  As it stands, the Bill allows the Minister to do as he likes.  I think it should be laid down clearly what is going to happen.  The making of arrangements by issuing Orders has become a great deal too common. It is much better to have it set out definitely what the charges are.  As regards the 5 per cent., I understand from Senator Parkinson that they have already offered 2½ per cent. and they are prepared to accept that.  Let that be put down. All I want by the amendment is that it should be clearly set down what is to be done instead of leaving it to somebody to be making changes as often as they like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>If 5 per cent. were charged the totalisator could not possibly operate.  The proposal here is to charge the licensee 2½ per cent., and those who are going to operate the totalisator have agreed to that. <Col N="1281" /> What is proposed in this section is to enable the Minister to make a bargain with the people who are going to run the totalisator.  But even if it were necessary by common consent to alter that bargain it will be a matter of detailed examination of the accounts.  Those who are licensed to work the totalisator would be free from any increase if the totalisator is able to work successfully and pay its way at 2½ per cent.  Whether the totalisator would be able to pay 2½ per cent. would depend on circumstances, such as the tax on bookmakers and things of that kind.  The whole matter is difficult.  You cannot get firm figures on this particular matter, because it is entirely a new question.  The only way to work it is to enable the Minister to make his bargain with people to whom he sees fit to issue the licence.</P>

      <P>I suppose the public have to be taken into account.  Is not this 5 per cent. the amount which would be deducted from the winnings of the public who have made the bets?  If the tax is too high and the public will not stand it the totalisator will be a total failure.</P>

      <P>There has been a good deal of talk about this Totalisator Bill.  I understand the 2½ per cent. basis is going to be fixed for 15 years.  I do not think we should walk in to unknown territory and tie ourselves to a charge on the basis of 2½ per cent. for 15 years, especially where there is mutual uncertainty as <Col N="1282" /> to how this thing will work.  We should have a year's trial and then an equitable basis could be arrived at.</P>

      <P>I would like to point out to Senator Connolly that this totalisator is to be run as a nonproprietary undertaking.  It is not to be put up by people who expect to make dividends or profits of any kind.  To provide totalisators for the whole of the racing would take £50,000 or £60,000.  No non-proprietary body would dream of assuming the responsibility of undertaking the expenditure for the setting up of machines of that kind without the assurance of a reasonable period for their operation.</P>

      <P>Am I to understand the working of this section is to effect a tax on a bet that is made through the totalisator, just as a bet is taxed under the operations of the Betting Act?  In that case surely it is reasonable to say the sums that are to be levied on the people should be stated in the enactments, or at <Col N="1283" /> least they should be fixed ultimately by the legislature and not the Minister. That is the only point I fix upon, and I think the intention of the Senator in putting the amendment down is not so much on account of the fixing of the rate as to having embodied in the Act whatever the figure may be.  That should be embodied in the Act, and not allow the Minister the privilege or liberty to rise or fall and fix any sum he wishes under the name of a licence duty, but which is in fact a tax upon the people.  I think that is utterly unconstitutional.</P>

      <P>Take into consideration the statement that has been made by Senator Parkinson, that the running of the totalisator will not be by a proprietary concern, but that it will be run and operated not in the interests of making of profit.  This is rather an experiment, and is in the interests of the horse-breeding industry. In view of that fact, and considering that it is an innovation, it is desirable that the section should be elastic and that the Minister should have the opportunity of having the totalisator in operation a short time before he definitely lays down the rules with regard to the fees to be charged.</P>

It seems to me, from the declarations we have heard, that we have a crowd of benefactors who will give their services free in the working of the totalisator.  Experience of that kind is rare in this country, particularly when one goes in for horse-racing.  Would the Minister explain to those who are ignorant on the matter the principle of the totalisator?  It is suggested that 2½ per cent. of the total should be paid for the State.  I do not know if the rest will be distributed among the winners who back horses.  Are we to take it for granted that the gentlemen who work the totalisator are to get no remuneration?</P>

Instead of being opposed to it, I am an advocate of the totalisator.  I have seen it worked often and have occasionally risked some money on it. The matter I am concerned with is the substitution of the Revenue Commissioner for the Minister.  I do not see any harm in that, and the Minister himself says there is no difference.  I understand from what I have heard, it is more constitutional that the Revenue Commissioners shall have the power rather than the Minister.  I must say that I have great confidence in the control of the Turf Club and the National Hunt stewards.  I think it could not be put into better hands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 3.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(6) Where the Minister grants a licence to any person or persons to operate in any place or places or where the Revenue Commissioners set up, maintain or work a totalisator at any place or places the persons having the management of such place or places shall provide a place or places whether in a building or not where licensed bookmakers may carry on their business and to which the public may resort for the purpose of betting, and the charge to a licensed bookmaker and to any assistant accompanying him for admission to such <Col N="1287" /> place or places for the purpose of the licensed bookmaker's business shall, in the case of a licensed bookmaker not exceed five times the amount and in the case of an assistant not exceed the amount of the charge made to members of the public for admission to the place or places where the licensed bookmaker intends to carry on his business.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In asking the House and the Minister to give some consideration to this amendment I draw attention to the fact that the term in the Bill leaves it within the power of owners of racecourses, if they set up, maintain and manage a totalisator, to exterminate the bookmakers.  I think it is only reasonable that bookmakers should have the right to enter any racecourse, as they have done hitherto, and that the owners should not be in a position to demand exorbitant or prohibitive fees for entrance to the ring.  The Bill does not provide for these rights, nor is power given under the section which gives power to the Minister to make regulations to compel third parties, such as racecourse owners, to recognise the right of the bookmakers to enter the ring and to carry on their business on reasonable terms.  The amendment is intended merely to secure to the bookmaker the right to enter as heretofore at a reasonable price.  It is quite possible that those who run totalisators may say to the bookmaker: &ldquo;You may come in all right but we will charge you special fees,&rdquo; and to make the fees such that it would be impossible for the bookmaker to carry on.  I remember hearing in the Dáil the Minister and others supporting the Totalisator Bill stating that the rights that the bookmakers had up to the present would be protected. I am informed that the Turf Club and others associated with this movement have given an undertaking that the bookmakers' rights will be protected, but I think, in view of all the circumstances, these guarantees having been given, they ought to be put into the Bill to make it clear, because we can imagine the <Col N="1288" /> possibility of the totalisator not doing very well, and those in charge of it saying: &ldquo;It cannot do well, because we have competition.&rdquo;  If they are free to do so, they might make some rule to prohibit bookmakers from coming in in competition.  It is on that account that I ask the Minister to give this consideration, and I recommend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to accept this amendment, though&mdash;I am not stressing this point&mdash;I heard some people suggest that instead of having this five times the amount, it should not exceed £5, and that his assistants should be charged at the ordinary public rate.  However, that was only a point put to me.  I am quite prepared to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WalterNugentBart" hpid="Sir Walter Nugent Sir Walter Nugent">
      <NameTxt>Sir Walter Nugent</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been said that the Turf Club gave an undertaking.  They did not give an undertaking, and they do not think that such an amendment as this is necessary.  I can quite understand that executives might make it expensive for bookmakers to come in, or might prevent them.  We are not going to stand against this amendment. I ask the Minister, if he accepts it, as he said he would, to protect the bookmakers themselves, to protect the racing public and to maintain the authority of the Turf Club by inserting these words after the word &ldquo;bookmaker&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;provided they are not disqualified persons under any recognised rules of racing.&rdquo;  I take it that the Senator will accept these words in the interests of the racing public and in the interests of the bookmakers themselves.  It would make the position of the racing authorities impossible if they were not inserted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesParkinson" hpid="Mr. Parkinson Mr. Parkinson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parkinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking on behalf of the Control Board, I may say that they will have no objection to the implications in Senator Byrne's amendment.  But we suggest, in the interests of the bookmakers as well as in the general interest of racing, that it should be a fixed sum of £5 for the larger ring and £1 for the <Col N="1289" /> outside ring, and that the assistants should be allowed in by paying the ordinary admission fee paid by the public.  That would ease the situation in many ways by preventing covetous owners of race tracks from raising the price to the public in order that they could charge the substantial amount of five times the entrance fee to the bookmakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point that might be cleared up before we proceed further.  Senator Byrne spoke of some understanding being reached, or being implied, in connection with the Turf Club that would deal with the bookmaking fraternity fairly.  That is, I think, on the assumption that the scope of the Bill is confined to horse racecourses. Supposing there is a proposal to operate the totalisator in connection with greyhound racing, what would happen to the fund then?  Are the profits to go to the development of horse-breeding?  I want to draw attention to the fact that, as far as I can understand the Bill, its scope is not confined to horse-racing, and I think we should at least understand that there are possibilities other than horse-racing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am totally opposed to this amendment, because I do not think that bookmakers are any great advantage.  But I would agree that they should be allowed into the racecourses if there were no licensed bookmaking houses in towns, where I think they are an absolute pest and have done the greatest possible harm.  I think that nearly everybody agrees with that.  If the bookmakers could be confined to the racecourses I would not mind this amendment passing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the point of view expressed by Senator Milroy. The Bill deals with certain apparatus. It does not necessarily mean the totalisator that the race-track owners and the Turf Club have in mind at the moment.  It will deal with any kind of machine that satisfies the definition, to be used in any kind of place, enclosed or outside race meetings, or in a bookmakers' <Col N="1290" /> club.  That will all depend upon the Minister and upon the Minister's discretion. The proposal is that we should intervene and say that the proprietors of these race tracks, which it has been emphasised are private bodies, shall be compelled to do a certain thing, to admit certain people to do certain business on their property, as a condition for the issue of the licence by the Minister.  We are to put into the Bill certain conditions which the Minister must adhere to before he grants a licence, but we are not prepared to put into the Bill anything for the protection of the public in regard to the fee that is to be charged by way of duty. There seems to me to be a contradiction there, considered from the point of view of the legislature, that is hardly defensible.  We should be more concerned about the necessity for keeping the fixing the charge upon the public under the control of the legislature more definitely even than the protection of the bookmakers. I should have thought that the interests of the bookmakers, from what I used to hear of them from Deputy Shaw, as to race meetings generally, would have been quite secure in the keeping of the owners of the race tracks.  I am very doubtful indeed as to the advisability of putting this kind of provision into the Bill, leaving to the Minister the right to make conditions and restrictions. We are asked to say in respect of bookmakers what those restrictions shall be, and I do not think that the Seanad should agree to limit the Minister's rights in that respect, if they are not prepared to limit his rights in respect of the very much bigger thing&mdash;the fixing of the charges to be made to the racing public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Senator Johnson quite misunderstands the reason why I drew attention to this aspect of the matter.  I drew attention to it to emphasise what I thought was the equity of Senator Byrne's proposal, that there are other possibilities in the scope of this Bill that have not been discussed up to the present&mdash;where the <Col N="1291" /> understanding of the Turf Club and other parties would in no way operate, and where, though there might be no statutory power to exclude this particular section of the community from race meetings, they could be excluded in another way&mdash; by exorbitant charges.  I have no interest whatever in racing of any kind, but I want to dissent very strongly from the reflections which Senator Moore has passed on these people.  He referred to the pests which have been produced by the betting houses.  I think it is quite well known to anyone who knows the circumstances that the regulation of their business by the legislature did a great deal to eliminate certain abuses and certain evils which were associated with it and has raised the matter to the position that at least that section of the community has been given a statutory right.  When they are under the protection of that, I think it is not fair to treat them as if they were pariahs or pests of society.  This amendment is to protect this section of the community.  I think it should be passed for that reason, and I see no reason why there should be any further discussion on the matter, seeing that the Minister himself has agreed to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not regard this as being by any means in the interests of bookmakers.  It represents itself to me as being in the interests of the public, because it is just possible&mdash;I do not think the possibility is very great&mdash;that if we had not this the race executives might exclude bookmakers from the courses and force the public to bet with the totalisator to the public's disadvantage.  This will ensure that there will be competition and that the terms offered by the totalisator must be at least as favourable as those offered by the bookmakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to Senator Milroy's point about setting up the totalisator elsewhere, under Section 2 no bookmaker could set up a totalisator in his own premises.  Section 2 prohibits a person who has not a licence from setting up a totalisator, and <Col N="1292" /> the intention is to give no licence for a totalisator except the licence that will be given to this body.</P>

If you agree that such men should be admitted the racing executive must let them in, and, of course, all their authority would be gone.  The amendment I suggested was to add at the end: &ldquo;provided this shall not apply to defaulters under any recognised rules of racing.&rdquo;  That is in the interests of the public, because otherwise these men would go on in and bet with people.</P>

      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with Senator Sir Walter Nugent's object, but it seems to me that &ldquo;recognised rules of racing&rdquo; is rather a loose phrase to put into an Act of Parliament.  What are the rules of racing?</P>

      <P>They are made in every country in the world by the Turf Clubs of those countries and by the National Hunt Committees. They are inter-changeable: a man warned off in England is automatically warned off in Ireland, in France, in Germany, and everywhere where the rules are recognised. A horse belonging to a man running under unrecognised rules would not be allowed to run under the rules, and a horse disqualified in England would be disqualified here, in France and everywhere else.  That is in the interests of horse-racing generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is easy for anybody conversant with racecourses to understand the object that Senator Sir Walter Nugent has in mind.  He has in mind the fact that at a certain period of the year each bookmaker has to be licensed&mdash; the course men and the men who bet in offices.  A man may get his licence in the beginning of the year and shortly after may become a defaulter, but he will not be debarred from practising as a bookmaker until the next period of renewal.  In the meantime a report may have been made to the stewards of the Turf Club that he is a defaulter.  The custom is that a defaulting bookmaker <Col N="1294" /> is refused admission to the ring, and the object which Senator Sir Walter Nugent has is that when a bookmaker becomes a defaulter under the rules of racing, he is disqualified from being admitted to the ring, and he is not entitled to bet there at all. It is only fair to say that the respectable men among the bookmakers will approve of this course being adopted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hooper</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no quarrel at all with the object of Senator Sir Walter Nugent's amendment.  My point is that the phraseology is rather loose and is bad to put into an Act of Parliament.  We all understand what the rules of racing are, but I do not think that they have had any statutory recognition so far, and we are apparently giving it now.  The object of the amendment might be secured equally well by some other words.  I cannot suggest them now, but I think we ought to be careful before inserting these words.  Perhaps it might be feasible to hold this amendment over until the Report Stage and to have the phraseology decided in the meantime.</P>

      <P>I think the words suggested by Senator Sir Walter Nugent should have been given notice of so that we could see how they would affect the Bill.  I am not <Col N="1295" /> against them, but I would like to see how they affect other clauses in the Bill.  It might come up on the Report Stage.  The Minister has stated that he is prepared to accept my amendment as it stands, and on the Report Stage he would consider Senator Sir Walter Nugent's amendment.  In the meantime I do not think it would be fair to fix the maximum at £5 for the inner ring and at £1 for the outer ring.  There are many decent small men who go to the outer ring, and £1 would mean something to them.  I suppose Senators would be surprised to know that the earnings of some of these men might be only £2 or £3 at the end of a day. The charges mean something to them.  In view of what the Minister has said, I suggest that we should pass the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 3.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) Where a licence is granted to a person to operate in a place or places the persons having management of such place or places shall not make a charge to a licensed bookmaker or his assistant in excess of the amount of the charge made to members of the public for admission to the said place or places where the said licensed bookmaker intends to carry on his business while a duty continues to be payable under Section 26 of the Finance Act, 1926.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is right to ask bookmakers to pay any increased <Col N="1297" /> fees as long as the percentage they are paying at present is being paid, and I ask the House to support that view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesParkinson" hpid="Mr. Parkinson Mr. Parkinson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parkinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out to the House that it is the public and not the bookmakers who pay the tax.  The bookmakers merely act as tax collectors for the Government. They do not pay the tax.  The public pays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if that is a perfectly accurate statement.  I am not an authority on racing, and only on very rare occasions have I been on racecourses.  As I understand it, there is a 2½ per cent. tax on wagers here, while on the English courses there is no such tax.  The licence fee in England is about £2, but here it is about £10.  It may be, as Senator Parkinson suggests, that the public pays, but the point is, if the position were the same here as in England, that 2½ per cent. would go into the pockets of the bookmaker, so that the bookmakers lose, and Senator Byrne's point is that while that position remains he should not be asked to pay excessive entrance fees.  With this consideration in view, I understand the Betting Committee's Report recommends the removal of the 2½ per cent. wager tax on the course, and the idea, as I understand it, was if and when that recommendation is carried out, that the extra charge for admission would be considered as equitable, but for the moment there is considerable doubt about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a drafting error in the amendment which I ask the leave of the House to have corrected. The words should be &ldquo;Section 24 of the Finance Act of 1926&rdquo; instead of Section 26.</P>
      <P>Amendment, as amended, put and declared lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 3.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(6) If any such excess amount is made payable by the licensed bookmaker under sub-section (6) hereof the proceeds of such excess amounts shall be applied <Col N="1298" /> to such purposes and in such proportions as may be provided by the Minister in the regulations in respect to the profits derived by the Revenue Commissioners from the working of the totalisator by them under this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think this amendment will recommend itself to every member of the House.  The object is to do exactly what is promised by the totalisator.  What I want to ensure is that any increased charge made for the admission of bookmakers will go towards benefitting horse-breeding and horse-racing.  I will be very frank.  May I say that the object is to prevent racecourse committees raising the fees beyond the ordinary charges, and to give no encouragement to racecourse executives to raise fees.  The intention is that the increased charge should go towards the object that Senator Parkinson and others have mentioned, the encouragement of horse-breeding.  The matter may seem to be a small one, but there are four race meetings to which it would mean at least a couple of hundred pounds a meeting each year.  I know nothing about the smaller meetings, but I would say that it is worth while getting this money for the fund proposed for the encouragement of horse-breeding and racing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesParkinson" hpid="Mr. Parkinson Mr. Parkinson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parkinson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  Any regulation made under this section may provide that any contravention or breach thereof shall be an offence triable summarily and may prescribe the penalty or the maximum penalty which may be inflicted on persons found guilty on summary conviction <Col N="1300" /> of such offence and may also provide that such penalty shall be an excise penalty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>

      <P>Section 6, sub-section (3).  To add at the end of the sub-section the words:&mdash;&ldquo;Provided that no regulation made under this section prescribing a penalty or a maximum penalty for breach thereof shall come into operation unless and until it has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and approved by each such House.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This and the next two amendments have the same effect.  They are not worded in the same way but they would remove the objection which Senator Johnson, Senator Comyn and I raised on Constitutional grounds to the Minister having power by regulation to create an offence and to prescribe the punishment for it.  That is positive legislation, and ought not to be in the hands of a Minister.  I do not know if Senators saw the very interesting speech that was made by the English Lord Chancellor a few days ago at the Mansion House in London, in which he stated that there was a growing danger of legislation being delegated to Ministries and Departments. A certain amount of it cannot be avoided in the very complicated state into which the administration of our laws has got, but this is a long way beyond the line which can be drawn between what is positive legislation and is really administration. The Section gives the Minister power to make an offence a thing which is not an offence under the criminal law and then to prescribe the penalty.  I think that is going beyond what we ought to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest as an alternative to the amendments on the paper an amendment which I have circulated, with an addition as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 7 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>7. If any person contravenes any of the conditions or restrictions subject to which the Minister has issued a totalisator licence under this Act or contravenes any <Col N="1301" /> regulation made by the Minister under this Act he shall be guilty of an offence and shall for each offence on summary conviction thereof be liable to an Excise penalty of five hundred pounds, And then to continue&mdash;</P>
    <P>(3) Every regulation made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and if either such House shall, within the next subsequent twenty-one days on which it has sat after such regulation is laid before it, pass a resolution annulling such regulation, such regulation shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
    <P>This power of regulation is really proposed to be taken because of the difficulty of foreseeing what may arise from the working of the totalisator. A great many of the points will be covered in the licence, that is, restrictions and conditions will be laid down fairly elaborately, so as to safeguard the revenue, and to see that the totalisator is not operated in some way that was not intended.  It may be necessary to have some regulations and it is necessary if there are to be regulations that there should be a penalty.  As I said there will be only one licence.  It is going to be a big affair and I think the penalty for an infringement of a condition laid down in the licence, or for an infringement of a regulation designed to safeguard the revenue, must be a substantial regulation.  I suggest therefore fixing the penalty at £500, and then so far as regulations are concerned they would lie on the Table of each House and could be annulled by either House. I propose that rather than having them passed by both Houses for this reason, that both Houses might be adjourned for three months, that a development might make it necessary to have a regulation or that if the Houses were sitting it might not be possible to submit a regulation to them on account of the Parliamentary programme or disturbed political conditions and get it dealt with <Col N="1302" /> promptly.  This will only affect one big corporation.  It may never be used at all, but it should be inserted as a safeguard in view of the unknown ground we are venturing on in connection with the totalisator.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not seen the amendment but, to a large extent, from what the Minister has said it takes away the objection I had.  It certainly prevents him prescribing a penalty which the Oireachtas would do if the amendment I suggested were passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an amendment down to the same effect and I am satisfied, as far as I can understand the amendment without having seen it, that it meets the main objection I have to the section.  The reason for desiring that there should be positive approval of any regulations was the fact that penalties were prescribed, and I see, too, the probable difficulty that might arise if the regulations were made during a period of recess.  I do not know whether the proposed amendment removes the objection entirely regarding a breach of the regulations being triable summarily.  I do not know if the drafting meets that point.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>In the main I am satisfied.  The Minister gave an assurance that it is intended to grant only one licence, and that in itself seems to me to raise a difficulty.  The Oireachtas is asked to legislate in terms which presumes the possibility that there will be innumerable licences issued.  We have to act, not according to what the Minister tells us is his intention, but according to what we are prescribing to be done under the law, and we have to act on the assumption that many licences may be issued, and that all kinds of machines called totalisators may be in operation. I do not think the legislature should always pass Bills on the assumption that what the Minister intends will limit the effect of these Bills.  I shall be quite prepared to approve of the general intention of the amendment which the Minister <Col N="1303" /> read, to carry out the intentions I had in my amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I had an amendment in the same terms on the paper, but in view of the Minister's statement I will be quite satisfied to withdraw it.  There is still in my mind one disquieting feature, now that we have come to this stage of the Bill.  That is that there is no percentage, apparently, to be fixed as regards what the public is to contribute to the totalisator.  There is 2½ per cent. which goes to the Minister. We do not know whether the Turf Club, the Phænix Park Executive, or any other body will say that there should be 3½ in addition to the 2½ the Minister is going to collect.  We do not know whether it will be 10 per cent.  While Senator Parkinson has made it perfectly clear that no individual as a totalisator owner is going to benefit, still we cannot get away from the fact that, if a certain amount goes to the race funds of the various race committees, and if, as a result, the control board that operates the Phænix Park and other meetings gets a substantial amount of the totalisator fund, and automatically these organisations, which, I believe, are limited liability companies, are changed from losing concerns into profit-making concerns, then obviously the shareholders are going to benefit.  I suggest that the Minister should put down his foot as regards what the public should pay, as I take it that the public in the end will pay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It will cost the public 10 per cent., but we cannot be absolutely firm about it until we see how it works.  In the first instance the licence will provide that not more <Col N="1304" /> than 10 per cent. must be deducted, and that the rest must be paid out, but it may turn out that the cost of working the machine would be 8½ per cent.  I do not anticipate that. We do not know, but if it turned out that 10 per cent. was not sufficient to run it, and if it was necessary, and if the public would still bet with the machine when it was 12 per cent., it would have to be done.  There can be no firm figure at this stage.  It is like giving an estimate about a business that has not been started, and the Senator knows that estimates put forward are often wrong.  With regard to anything that may go for racing we will set down in the licence when we have worked it out, restrictions on that, and we will see that it is not going to put money into the pockets of shareholders.  If money goes to race executives we will have conditions in the licence to enable us to check the destination of the money which will ultimately go for prizes, or for something other than dividends.</P>

There was a serious shortage of food in the City of Cork on one occasion when there was a very big demonstration there.  The Cork Deputies are now making provision that such a state of affairs shall not occur again.  I stress the fact that there is to be no increase in the hours of opening and that the change is proposed to suit the convenience of the people.  I trust the House will see its way to pass the Bill.</P>

      <P>I want to raise a question that does not arise on the Second Reading, because I am very doubtful as to the wisdom even of passing the Second Reading of a Bill of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a Bill passed in 1927 dealing with the sale of intoxicating liquor.  It was piloted through the Dáil and the Seanad by the late Minister for Justice.  A great deal of discussion took place on the question involved here, the hours during which public houses should be open in the four county boroughs and in the rest of the country.  The question raised in this Bill was discussed very fully on the Second Stage, the Committee Stage and, subsequently, on the Re-committal of the 1927 Bill. Certain amendments were accepted by the House and by the Minister, notwithstanding the pressure that was brought upon him regarding the four county boroughs.  That pressure was to the effect that the four county boroughs should be placed in the same position regarding gatherings, such as football matches, hurling matches and so on, as the rest of the country.  The Minister resisted that very strongly and gave reasons for his resistance.  The Bill was then passed.  A few weeks ago a Bill was introduced by Senator Hooper dealing with the Sunday on which the Centenary Celebrations were to be held in the City of Dublin.  It was pointed out on that occasion that this was one day in a century, that there was an immense concourse of <Col N="1306" /> people expected, and that the facilities to enable people to get food would be inadequate unless the public houses were also available.  Very great stress was brought to bear upon the exceptional circumstances that were likely to prevail.  It was pointed out that the event was a very exceptional one, and a special Bill was passed dealing with the one day in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Now Cork, not to be behind Dublin, seeks to have a similar Bill passed in respect to a somewhat similar celebration that is to take place in Cork on Sunday, the 14th July. It is said that somewhat similar conditions may prevail in Cork if anticipations are realised.  Cork is not satisfied with that.  Cork says: &ldquo;We will go one better than Dublin. Dublin has shown the way, but we want not only the occasion of a great centenary celebration of a religious character but a sports event which is to take place in the following week to justify an alteration in the law.&rdquo; There will be many sports events of a similar kind in the county boroughs during the summer.  Why we should be specially requested to pass a Bill dealing with an occasion of that kind for Cork for one day alone I cannot understand.  It seems to me to be entirely cheapening the legislature, to be using it for very local and very selfish purposes, and to be more or less asking the Oireachtas to treat itself as a cricket club, a football club or a debating society which might alter their rules and practices for one occasion.  The legislation I refer to was passed after very serious discussion indeed.  There was a great deal of public agitation.  The authorities and the Minister for Justice stood firm in insisting on the hours that were fixed in the original Bill.  Of course there was no anticipation then of these very special occasions such as the Centenary celebration, but there was anticipation, and the point was discussed upon various Stages of the Bill, of the crowds that would gather at football matches and the like.</P>
    <P>I think that this Bill ought not to pass the Seanad in its present form. Even if it is to pass the Second <Col N="1307" /> Reading, it ought to be passed only on the assumption that Sunday the 14th is retained in the Bill and that Sunday the 21st shall be excluded. If the promoters of the Bill are prepared to concede that at this stage, I, for one, shall withdraw opposition to the Second Reading.  But unless they do that, I shall certainly oppose the Second Reading, and I hope the Seanad will agree with that point of view.</P>

      <P>I just wish to say that I was talking to the Deputy who moved this Bill in the other House.  I understood from him that if the point of objection mentioned by Senator Johnson was persisted in, there would not be any serious objection to amending the Bill in that direction.</P>

      <P>I beg formally to move the motion standing in my name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Cobh (Queenstown) Gas Order, 1929, proposed to be made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and laid in draft before the Seanad on the 5th day of July, 1929, under sub-section (4) of Section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, be approved.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel it is absolutely necessary that we should have an explanation.  This order is a document of twenty-three pages, and it proposes to re-enact, under different forms, a certain Act setting up the Cobh Gas Company, giving them certain rights and privileges.  It is completely altering, as far as I can <Col N="1308" /> gather, the conditions under which this gas supply is continued.  It seems to me when such an order is proposed to be made the people of Cobh should have the opportunity of making any objection or criticism they may have to make.  They should, at least, be made aware of the fact that the order is about to be made.  The Seanad, before it approves of such an order, should give the people of Cobh the opportunity of declaring themselves on the matter.  This is very like the passing of a Private Bill.  We have laid down very strict regulations and rules regarding the passage of Private Bills.  I do not think it is necessary we should go through all that procedure, but there is something involved in an order which takes twenty-three pages of closely printed matter to explain itself.  I do not think the Seanad should be asked to pass this without giving an opportunity to the people concerned to express themselves, and to Senators to look over it and see if there is anything serious involved.  We should not be asked to approve of this to-day, and to act in a perfunctory fashion in connection with the matter.  I suggest that the motion should be left over for consideration until Wednesday next.</P>
