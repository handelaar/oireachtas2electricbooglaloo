      <P>I move amendment 1:&mdash;Section 14, sub-section (1).  To delete in line 60 the words &ldquo;within three months,&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;as soon as may be.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a simple amendment, but the need for it is obvious.  It is probable that the time required by the Minister for Local Government for an examination of the designs and the plans will be more than three months.  The object of the amendment is to meet that contingency.  Obviously, it would not <Col N="382" /> be desirable that the time which the Department might require for an examination of the plans and the designs should be limited to three months, if it was likely that a longer period was essential.  This amendment is moved with the object of making provision to meet a situation of that kind.  It is not to be implied, and is quite unlikely, that this will cause unnecessary delay in expediting approval to plans and designs submitted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. DOWDALL Mr. DOWDALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOWDALL</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was examined very carefully by a Joint Committee. As the Bill left that Joint Committee it was, in effect, an agreed Bill. There is a good deal to be said for Senator Milroy's amendment, but I would suggest to him that the words &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; are rather indefinite. If he would agree to a modification of the amendment I would suggest that it should read &ldquo;as soon as may be, but not later than six months.&rdquo; That would give six months instead of three.  I know that the Local Government Department is anxious to expedite the passage of this Bill, the object of which is to proceed with the construction of a work that it is hoped will help to relieve the congestion of traffic in the city.  I hope the Senator may be able to accept the suggestion that I have made to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I understand it, the preparation of plans and designs for a work such as that contemplated here usually takes a much longer period than six months, probably twelve months or eighteen months.  The period at the disposal of the Department to enable it to make all necessary inquiries should not, I think, be limited, and it is with that object the amendment was moved.  The period at the disposal of the Department to enable it to make all necessary inquiries and to secure skilled advice should not be shorter than the period which the promoters of the Bill themselves had when preparing their plans and designs.  If the circumstances are such that a less period than six months would suffice for that examination by the Department, then I have not the least doubt but that sanction would be given, but to tie the Department down to a fixed <Col N="383" /> period would have the effect of putting restrictions on it which, possibly, might not have the results that Senator Dowdall thinks.</P>

      <P>I am not insisting on the alteration which I have suggested to the Senator because I have some reason to believe that the Local Government Department is anxious to expedite as much as possible the re-construction of Butt Bridge.  I simply thought that the words &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; were rather indefinite.  I do not want to press the point that I have put forward.  I would like to know from the Minister if he has any objection to this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FORAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest to Senator Dowdall that he should press the alteration he has mentioned&mdash; namely, the insertion of the six months period.  Everyone familiar with the neighbourhood of Butt Bridge is fully aware of the urgency of this work.  If the period for the giving of approval for the plans and designs is left indefinite, as Senator Milroy's amendment, if carried, will leave it, then it may be that this work will not be proceeded with as soon as it should be.  If Senator Dowdall's suggestion was adopted, it would prevent anybody pigeon-holing this.  The widening of Butt Bridge is urgently required, and there should be no excuse left to the Port and Docks Board, or to anybody else, to cause a further delay.  The widening of the bridge is a very necessary development in that part of the city.</P>

      <P>I move Amendment 2:&mdash;Section 14.  To add at the end of the section, a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  Any expenses incurred by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in relation to the approval or disapproval by him of the estimates, designs and plans referred to in this section shall to such extent as shall be certified by the said Minister be paid to him by the Board and shall be defrayed by the Board as part of their expenses under this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not think that this amendment will require any lengthy discussion.  It is possible that the examination of the plans and designs may involve the employment of expert advice.  The object of the amendment is to provide that any expense involved in that way shall not become a charge on State funds, but that it shall be borne by the promoters of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>Simple as this amendment may appear, there is behind it a very big principle.  I, with Senator Dowdall, was a member of the Joint Committee that considered this Bill.  We were engaged on it for fourteen or fifteen days.  All the details in connection with it were thoroughly investigated by the Joint Committee. The different interests concerned were represented before the Committee by a great array of counsel.  The Committee, after a great deal of labour, arrived at what was practically an agreed Bill.  It should be borne in mind that what this amendment means is that the ratepayers in what is known as the &ldquo;bridge rate area&rdquo; are to be saddled with any expense that may be incurred by the Local Government Department in examining the plans put <Col N="385" /> forward in connection with the widening of Butt Bridge or the erection of the transporter bridge.  I think that some consideration should be given to these ratepayers.  The rate on the people comprised in that area, which embraces the city and the county of Dublin, will certainly not be less than 2d. in the £ on their valuations.  There is the old saying, that it is the last straw that breaks the camel's back.  I think it would be most unjust and unfair to mulct the ratepayers in the &ldquo;bridge rate area&rdquo; with whatever expense may be incurred by the Local Government Department in having the plans submitted in connection with these works examined.  These ratepayers would have no control over the expense involved.</P>
      <P>I think that the people in the &ldquo;bridge rate area&rdquo; are doing their share in helping to ease the transport situation in the city by contributing an additional 2d. in the £ on their valuations. It is unfair, after the thorough investigation that was made by the Joint Committee into this Bill, an investigation at which not only the Department of Local Government but other Departments of the State were represented, as well as all other interests concerned, to come along now and make these ratepayers responsible for any expenses that may be incurred by the Department of Local Government in examining plans submitted.  This is a new principle that it is now sought to introduce into the Bill.  It did not come before the Joint Committee.  I do not think that it ought to be accepted, and I therefore propose to oppose it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>For once, I find myself in thorough agreement with Senator Farren.  In my view, this amendment opens up a very much larger question than at first sight may be apparent.  I am certain that both the Port and Docks Board and the Minister for Local Government are very well served by expert engineering advice.  When proposals of this sort are put in, that the promoters of a special Bill of this kind can be saddled with the cost of further expert advice which in all probability may be quite unnecessary, the care is not always exercised <Col N="386" /> in curtailing expense that would otherwise be the case.  I very much incline to the view that the ratepayers might be saddled with expense under this Bill.  I do not think for a moment that the Minister, of his own accord, would propose to saddle them, but representations might be made and pressure brought to bear to saddle them with more expense than would otherwise be necessary, and that in fact would be unnecessary.  I, therefore, oppose the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. DOWDALL Mr. DOWDALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOWDALL</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that this was practically an agreed Bill, I was very much surprised when I got those amendments.  When I got the amendments I saw a gentleman connected with the Department of Local Government, and a gentleman employed by the Port and Docks Board. I learned that this amendment is merely a device, in case it should be necessary for the Local Government Department to call in consulting engineers, to meet the expenses incurred. Senator Farren is aware that, in the course of the proceedings before the Joint Committee, it transpired that when Butt Bridge was constructed it was then envisaged that possibly at some time in the future a widening of it would take place.  In view of that, arrangements were then made to lay down foundations to carry the widened bridge.  Many years have passed since then.  It may be that these foundations are perfectly sound to-day, or it may be that they are not.  In view of that, the Department of Local Government may think it desirable to call in a consulting engineer.  The expense involved in that way will, I think, be comparatively small.  In view of the fact that this is an agreed Bill, and as both parties are anxious to have the work involved carried out as soon as possible, and as both agree that the object aimed at in this amendment is not unreasonable, I will ask Senator Farren to withdraw his opposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to what Senator Dowdall has said, I would just like to make a few remarks.  He referred to the foundations of Butt Bridge and the possibility that more money would have to be spent in connection with them.  I would like to point out that provision is made in the Bill to meet a contingency of that sort.  The point at issue here is this: that when the plans are submitted to the Department of Local Government that Department will be entitled to call in expert advice to examine them.  The expense involved in calling in expert advice will come, not out of the pockets of the general taxpayers, but out of the pockets of the ratepayers in the city and in the county of Dublin who live in what is described as the &ldquo;bridge rate area.&rdquo;  I object on principle to that.  For instance, if a housing inquiry is held in any particular district, and the Local Government Department sends down one of its inspectors to hold the inquiry, the expenses in connection with it are paid out of the pocket of the general taxpayer.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, the ratepayers who reside in the &ldquo;bridge rate area&rdquo; which, as I have said, comprises the city and county of Dublin, are doing their part in helping to solve the transport problem in the city by agreeing to pay not less than 2d. in the £ on their valuations in connection with the works to be carried out under this private Bill.  That surely is enough to saddle them with without adding the further expense that would fall on them under the operation of this amendment.  That is my reason for opposing the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>The position, as I understand it, is this, that if this amendment is not passed and the Department of Local Government is obliged to call in expert advice the expenses involved will fall on the general <Col N="388" /> ratepayers of the country.  What we are now trying to decide is, whether such expense should be borne by the ratepayers in the city and in the county of Dublin who come within the &ldquo;bridge rate area,&rdquo; or by the general ratepayers of the country.  Is that the Senator's point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case of course, those of us who live in Dublin will probably vote with the Senator.  I would like to hear the views of the Minister as to why this expense should not be a general charge on the country. I think it ought to be part of the duty of a Government Department to do this work and pay the necessary charges themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. GOGARTY Dr. GOGARTY">
      <NameTxt>Dr. GOGARTY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know what is the bridge rate.  If it falls on those who live in the immediate vicinity of the transporter bridge, then I would like to point out that some of the very poorest people in the city are housed in that area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. GOGARTY Dr. GOGARTY">
      <NameTxt>Dr. GOGARTY</NameTxt>
      <P>I see that it embraces the county and city of Dublin. I think that, inasmuch as the bridge cannot be limited in the advantages that it affords.  Senator Farren's contention is perfectly right&mdash;that the incidence of the expense should not be limited to one definite area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasEsmondeBart" hpid="Sir THOMAS ESMONDE Sir THOMAS ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Senator Farren is perfectly right in the plea that he has made on behalf of the ratepayers in the city and county of Dublin.  In so far as an investigation by the Minister for Local Government is concerned, it is only right to point out that the expenses of the Minister's Department are defrayed out of the pockets of the general taxpayers. As far as I can see, if it should happen that the Department of Local Government think that expert opinion would be advisable in connection with the work to be done under this Bill, then, under Section 55 of the Bill, they have, as far as I can understand it, ample facilities for recouping themselves any money expended in the obtaining <Col N="389" /> of that expert opinion.  Section 55 states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>All costs, charges and expenses preliminary to and of and incidental to the preparing, applying for and obtaining and passing of this Act or otherwise in relation thereto shall be paid by the Board in the first instance, but shall be charged to and repaid out of moneys to be raised or borrowed by the Board under the powers of this Act.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that, so far as the Department of Local Government is concerned, the position is perfectly plain in the Bill.  If it is necessary for the Department to obtain expert advice, they can do so, and as regards the expense they can go to the general taxpayer and ask him to pay the bill. Senator Farren is actuated by the desire to protect the interests of the ratepayers in the &ldquo;bridge rate area,&rdquo; and I think that in doing so he is perfectly right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>In the building of the Waterford bridge, 17 or 18 years ago, the principle was laid down that there was to be an area of contribution comprising several counties.  The idea underlying the principle was that the people from these counties benefited to some extent by the use of the new bridge, as people from these counties attended the fairs at Waterford.  They came from places as far away as Carlow, Wexford and Kilkenny.  A proportion of the repayment of the sum expended in building the bridge was allocated over the counties for a term of years relative to the advantage which approximately the bridge gave to the people using the bridge.  For instance, 25 per cent. of the expenditure was levied off the city of Waterford, 25 per cent. of the expenditure off the county of Waterford, and then there was a decreasing allocation going down as low as 4 per cent. as regards the counties farthest away.  The same principle is involved here.  The people in Connaught do not care whether there is a Butt Bridge there, or any other bridge crossing the Liffey.  They are not going to get any direct or indirect benefit from it&mdash;not even from a bridge of gold across the Liffey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that principle which applied in <Col N="390" /> the case of the Waterford Bridge, and bridges generally, is sound, it seems inequitable that people in far away places who could never, by any stretch of imagination, derive any benefit from the bridge, should be responsible as regards its cost, as they will be if any portion of the expense is to be borne out of the general funds.  If the principle I have mentioned is applicable in one place, it ought to be in another, and it would give reason and substance for what is contained in Section 55 of the Bill, that the expenses should be borne by the people within a certain definite area, and people who will, in the ordinary course, derive benefit, some more and some less, from the re-construction of this bridge.  I am absolutely opposed to placing any portion of the expenses in connection with this proposal on people other than those defined in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It surprised me to hear the speech of Senator Kenny, for it is practically analogous to the proposition that the people of Connaught have nothing whatever to do with the transport of goods out of Dublin for the convenience of commerce.  The Senator says that it does not matter anything to these people, that no matter what the bridge was made for they have nothing to do with it, and therefore they ought not to be called on to bear even the most infinitesimal fraction of the cost.  The very principle the Senator has advocated is already embodied in the scheme.  The Minister comes in as representing the people of Connaught, and as representing the people of Waterford, Kerry and Dublin, and the country as a whole, and he wants to conserve the general public interests.  He says: &ldquo;I must have a supervising watch over the designs,&rdquo; as representing the public of the country as a whole and not the public of Connaught alone or of Dublin alone.  He says: &ldquo;I insist on my Department examining these schemes&rdquo;; and then, &ldquo;The City of Dublin and the surrounding area must pay for my Department's work.&rdquo;  It is not quite correct for Senator Dowdall to assure us that this proposition refers only to the calling in of consultants. It may refer to that, but there <Col N="391" /> is nothing confining the proposition to the payment of consultants.  It refers to any expenses incurred.  If a particular engineer at present in the Department of Local Government, a civil servant, was occupied for six months in examining the plans and designs, the expenses incurred by him, and his salary while engaged on that work, could, under that section, be charged against the scheme, inasmuch as it is a national proposition.  The Minister speaks on behalf of the State as a whole, and claims supervisory authority. Then surely that is a debt that ought to be paid for out of State and not local funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are wandering a little bit from the main point.  Both the Department of Local Government and the Port and Docks Board are very efficiently and capably advised I am sure.  It is absurd to say it is necessary to go to the expense of employing further advice when you have those advisors in these Departments. That is a matter that has been considered and threshed out over and over again.  If an amendment of this sort finds its way into the Bill there will be less desire on the part of the Local Government Department to curtail expenses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill under discussion has been brought forward by a public board to enable them to do certain work.  The Committee to whom the Bill was referred in the first instance decided in a certain way, that it was of definite interest to a certain area, over which it has said that the entire cost of the expense of this particular Bill and the carrying out of the work will be borne, except that a small portion of the cost of maintenance of the transporter bridge will be borne by the Port and Docks Board in the future.  The cost of the passing of this Bill through the Oireachtas is not going to be borne by the taxpayer.  It is going to be borne by the bodies that are made responsible for the payment of the work that has to be carried out, as well as the payment for the passage of this Act through the Oireachtas.  The amendment which it is now sought to <Col N="392" /> have inserted is to make this clear.  In so far as the Department has a supervisory responsibility in certain matters, and has a certain staff for carrying out that, the service of that particular engineering staff, in so far as responsibilities are put on them by the Bill, will be available without any extra cost to anyone.  Here is a Bill which is of special importance to a certain area. There are certain other special classes of work being done in this case arising out of local circumstances.  The Department of Local Government has no engineering staff capable of saying whether a particular type of transporter bridge is suitable or not.  An examination of the details of the plans of the transporter bridge would be necessary, and it may be that the Minister for Local Government when he comes to examine the plans may have to get outside assistance, and may have to employ a consulting engineer.</P>
      <P>In so far as expenses are likely to be incurred outside the ordinary work and estimates of the Department for a matter specially connected with the city of Dublin and its environs, we consider that these are not normal charges to fall on the Department. They should not normally fall on the Department but on the ratepayers, and special charges like that should form part of the cost of dealing with this whole piece of legislation.  It is rather stretching the point to say that the people of Connaught are concerned in this particular matter.  If so why do we not have the area of charge spread as far as Donegal?  The area of charge is a very definite matter.  I take it that it marks the area of interest because so far as Dublin and its environs are concerned they amass wealth from the country as a whole in giving this particular service.  If you are not going to saddle the taxpayer with the cost of getting this particular piece of legislation through the Oireachtas, then it is pointless to saddle him with any particular additional services that the Local Government Department may have to undertake because of the exceptional nature of the work that is to be done in connection with it.</P>

      <P>Certain amendments have been put down in my name following the usual practice.  Amendments 3 and 4 are related to one another, and they are of a purely technical character.  Amendment No. 3 is: &ldquo;To delete the words &lsquo;for that purpose,&rsquo; in line 22.&rdquo;  The object of the amendment is to bring the provisions of the Bill into accordance with the practice according to which the Local Government Department has apportioned the amount of the Collector-General's annuity between the county and the city.  The amendment of Section 32 is merely for the purpose of removing any doubt that the Collector-General's annuity is in future to attach to the bridge rate instead of the bridge tax, which ceases to be levied. I move the amendment.</P>

That portion deals specifically with the amount to be paid of the Collector-General's annuity, and how it was to be allocated. It was intended to allocate it in a different way.  I would like to point out that having already altered Section 26 as regards the provision of a method by which the annuity was to be paid, I think it would be unreasonable not to accept some form of amendment which would replace the part of the section which has been eliminated.</P>

What we are doing in this amendment I am afraid we do not know.  Whatever happens, so far as this Bill is concerned the responsibility for any miscarriage or crux that will eventuate as the result of the change in Section 27 will lie on the head of Senator Kenny who has proposed the amendment.

      <P>This Bill was examined by the Joint Committee which considered it in great detail. Counsel explained the position and went to a great deal of trouble in looking up Acts dealing with the questions involved.  The matter was of a highly technical character.  Members of the Joint Committee, I have no doubt, understood after counsel's explanation what was intended.  They were not conversant with the details, nor would the counsel only they had Acts for reference. I am sorry there is no Senator who can get up and make clear the difference between a bridge rate and a bridge tax, but it was made perfectly clear to the Committee that this extension of the bridge was urgently necessary. The promoters of the Bill went to enormous cost, and they proved the urgent necessity of carrying through the widening of Butt Bridge.  I would ask the House now to facilitate the passage of the Bill.  Like Senator Farren, I was rather surprised when I got these amendments, but I consulted an official of the Local Government Department and an official of the Port and Docks Board, and they both assured me&mdash;and I might say I had a word with the examiner of Private Bills also, who is an honest broker between the two parties&mdash;that the amendments were superior drafting to what was in the Bill.  I do not think the House should take the responsibility of holding up this urgent work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to hold up the Bill.  I am as anxious to facilitate its going through as any Senator, for I recognise the urgent necessity <Col N="398" /> for dealing with the traffic problem, and it cannot be satisfactorily dealt with until this Bill becomes law. I do not object to the widening of Butt Bridge or the erection of the transporter bridge, both of which I believe to be necessary for solving the transport problem.  My objection is that changes of the kind proposed should not be brought in now, having regard to the fact that the Committee passed the Bill after the most exhaustive investigation of its details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all that, considering that representatives of different Departments of the Government were present, and that the Committee had the Bill before them for months, that they had sent to them certain proposals with regard to amendments which the Committee agreed to and inserted, I think it is unfair at this stage to throw at us amendments such as these.  In my opinion the amendment that we have passed was one that introduced a new principle, and that amendment I opposed.  Senator Kenny said that this amendment was as clear as possible, but it is not very clear to me.  As far as I understand it, the principle contained in the amendment is this: that the amount to be paid by the different areas, that is, by the County Council for the County area, and by the Corporation of Dublin for the City area, will be furnished annually to the Secretary of the County Council and the Town Clerk of Dublin.  They will be told the amounts they are to collect. In the Bill it is being provided that the Board shall inform them of the amounts that they are to collect for each year.  But the proposal in the amendment, as I understand it, if I do understand it, is that the Collector-General shall intimate to them the amount that they are to collect, and that after they have collected the money in the usual way, as all the rates are collected, either by payment in the office or to the rate collectors who call at the individual ratepayer's house and collect in half-yearly moieties, in October and at the end of the financial year, they are to pay 5 per cent. towards the expenses of the Collector-General's salary.  If they do the work and if he does nothing, why should they pay <Col N="399" /> for the Collector-General?  If the ratepayers are paying the rate collectors to collect the rates, why should they pay 5 per cent. of the amount that is collected for the Collector-General's salary?  As I said before, I am not sure whether I understand the amendment, but I am giving my views on it as I think I understand it at the moment.  I think it is unwise, at this stage in particular, to introduce an amendment of this nature.  I am somewhat familiar with the proposals, because I sat on the Committee; but it is unfair to other Senators who did not sit on the Committee, and who have not had an opportunity of studying the Bill.  I think well enough might have been left alone, and that these amendments, which are bound to cause friction, should not be introduced.  I do not want to postpone the Bill; there is nobody more anxious than I am that the Board should get these facilities and that the work should proceed.</P>

      <P>In this case I agree with Senator Farren, and I think that Senator Dowdall has really stated what is the crux of the whole situation. It is quite evident that the draftsman has said that this is a better draft than that of the Bill.  That is making this House more useful by giving an opportunity to the draftsman to get his best and latest ideas carried out, and that is all that the House is being asked to do.  Nobody has said that this is altering anything; it is not a question of any rate falling on the whole country, or anything of that sort.  But for the House not to take the advice of the draftsman, when he says that this is the right way to put it, is a thing that I think none of us would be justified in doing.</P>

This may have been the draftsman's proposal&mdash;I have no doubt it is&mdash;but it is not the draftsman who will ever be held responsible; the Oireachtas would be held responsible, and while I have every confidence in the statement that this is a better draft, because this is the last thought <Col N="400" /> in the matter, as has been pointed out, this Bill has gone through Committee after very careful consideration.  Now it is brought to us in a new form, with very little explanation as to what that form means, and we have had no time to examine it for ourselves.  It seems to me that the right thing to do in this matter is to give us at least another day to consider it, to postpone this discussion until to-morrow, so that we may have a chance to satisfy ourselves that there is nothing revolutionary in this amendment.</P>

      <P>I am quite willing to withdraw the amendments in favour of this proposal to postpone consideration of them, because I am quite sensible of the fact that Senators are at a very considerable disadvantage in not having the Bill before them.  You cannot really see the point of an amendment unless you have the original text of the Bill before you to see in what respect it is proposed to alter the original text.  In my position as Vice-Chairman I have no responsibility in this matter at all; I have only formally proposed these amendments, which were tabled in my name.  I can quite see that they would eventually make for a better Bill, but if the Bill is to be improved in any way by the deliberations in this House, Senators should get full time to study the Bill in its present form and see the bearing of these amendments on the clauses concerned. Taking that view, I propose that consideration of the amendments be adjourned for a week, as the whole matter is, to my mind, very technical.</P>

      <P>We have just heard from the Chairman that the practice in Private Bill legislation is that Senators must apply to the Examiner of Private Bills to get a copy of a Bill.  To adjourn this matter would eventually mean the annulling of Private Bill procedure, because it practically means that everybody who takes part in the debate must have a copy of the Bill and that every member of the Seanad must apply for one.  We are altering in a very rapid and hurried manner our methods of Private Bill legislation, and I would ask the House to pause for a moment.  I do not know much about this matter, but I do know that all our Standing Orders and regulations for Private Bill legislation were extremely carefully thought out, and for us in a hurry to adopt a motion to adjourn a matter like this so that we can study the Bill means putting a burden on this House which was never contemplated. It was never dreamt for a moment that we should take up and consider a Private Bill which has been threshed out by a special Committee, appointed to take this burden off the House, and that, when the Committee have threshed it out, as Senator Farren and Senator Dowdall have done, we should not take their advice at all, that we should proceed as if the Bill were an ordinary one.</P>

The point I am making is that it is suggested that the House should adopt the <Col N="402" /> principle that we should get copies of the Bill and study it.

      <P>Well, it has not been the practice, and the House is not supposed to take the burden on itself of reading Private Bills through and debating them in the House in the manner suggested.  I would like to warn the House that this is a very serious thing, far more serious than it appears to be on a first inspection, because if we are to deal in this way with every Private Bill, if the House is to proceed to criticise it, to take no notice of the advice they get from the Committee that considered it, we shall be turning this House into a committee for Private Bill legislation, which is not what the House was intended for, and which is not a burden that, in my opinion, the House is capable of taking on itself.  We really ought to take a far more serious view of this than to adjourn it with the avowed object that Senators shall get the Bill, read it through and debate it, paying no attention whatever to what the Committee has decided, after it has spent probably a couple of weeks of hard work on it.  Supposing we give half an hour or an hour to reading the Bill, do you think we will be qualified to debate it and understand it as well as the gentlemen who sat for two or three weeks considering it?  If that attitude is taken up you will ruin the chances of getting Private Bills brought forward and put through.</P>

      <P>We must be very careful.  I, as your Chairman, cannot allow any Bill to pass out of the custody of the Seanad until it is law.  We retain custody of a Bill, and a Senator has an undoubted right to criticise a Bill at every stage.  I cannot refuse a proposal from a Senator to adjourn consideration of a Bill, if the House so wishes, in order that it may study it.  I agree with Senator Jameson, that in practice it is not very wise, but still I cannot refuse a motion to adjourn it.  If it likes the House can now accept that proposal or it can reject it.  If I might express a personal opinion, I agree absolutely with what Senator Jameson says.  I think that in reality this is a storm in a teacup. This amendment is not of any danger to the whole scheme, it seems to me.  You have already deleted in Section 26: &ldquo;including such sum if any as the Minister for Local Government and Public Health certifies to be the proportion of the Collector-General's Annuity under Section 66 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, properly chargeable against the Bridge Rate under this Act and including the allowance of 5 per cent. specified in the next following section as and for costs of collection and irrecoverable rates and office expenses.&rdquo;  If you look at what is on the Paper, you will see that the greater portion of it deals with specific matter which you deleted in the previous section, and the small portion at the end is of very slight importance. I would appeal to Senators to consider it now on its merits and to vote accordingly.  Of course, the Bill is your Bill, and until you pass it you have complete power at every stage to consider it and to do what you like with it.</P>

      <P>Anybody who has sat on a Private Bill Committee of this nature knows that what happens is that substantial agreement on various <Col N="405" /> vital matters is reached in open committee. That happened in this case, and then the various clauses, as amended, and the matters settled in the various clauses, were left with Professor Thrift, who was Chairman of the Committee, the Examiner of Private Bills, and the solicitors and counsel for the various interests concerned so that they could be drafted into the Bill. The Bill was in a rough stage, one amendment was very frequently consequential on another, and what was really dealt with in that way was the matter of re-drafting.  Every detail of any consequence was agreed to, not only with the members of the Committee but with the parties who were promoting and opposing the Bill, and to say that this is introducing amendments of any substantial nature after the work of the Committee is finished, is, to put it mildly, a misstatement.</P>

Is this a new position for this particular Bill, is it a position that already exists, or is it somebody that is to be appointed to collect the tax?  In the old days we all knew how the bridge tax was collected.  We got particulars on the ordinary rate form.  It was collected by the local authorities, the same as the poor rate.  If this is a new method and a new appointment I think the public should know about it.</P>

The difficulty that presents itself to anyone looking at the two first pages of the Bill arises from the fact that a dozen special Acts of Parliament, from 1848 <Col N="408" /> to 1920, are referred to.  These Acts have been modified and altered from time to time, and the term &ldquo;Collector-General&rdquo; is now used to explain an official who was embodied in previous Acts whose duties are now performed by the treasurers of the county council and the corporation.</P>

      <P>I would like to point out that it is apparent from this amendment that the Collector-General does not exist, and, moreover, is not really referred to.  It is only his annuity is referred to.  That is a salary that was payable under old Acts of Parliament to the Collector-General.  It was an office that existed before the year 1898, and although the Collector-General does not now exist, his salary exists, and is paid to other people.  I think what is meant is to preserve the salary and the proportions in which the salary was payable by the various rateable hereditaments.  The bridge rate was one rate that contributed to that salary. As I understand, the amendment&mdash;I have not got the Bill&mdash;is simply to preserve the liability for payment of the proportions of the salary.</P>

      <P>The tax that was formerly in existence will cease after this Bill goes through on 1st April as a bridge rate is being substituted for it.  The tax was for the upkeep of all the bridges crossing the Liffey up to a certain point.  That proportion of the Collector-General's annuity was really paid by the Corporation as he was an existing officer.  The amendment simply preserves the old practice and does not in any way alter the liability.  The bridge rate will be substituted for the bridge tax and the bridge rate will cover a more limited <Col N="409" /> area than the bridge tax.  There is a slight difference in the Schedules but not very material.  Otherwise there is no alteration in the ground work of the Bill.  The bridge tax will cease to be levied after April 1st if the Bill passes.</P>

      <P>I think in view of the amendment that was previously passed there is no sense in refusing to pass this amendment.  The bridge rate was levied to pay off outstanding loans that were used for the purpose of building bridges.  The bridge tax was devoted to the maintenance and the improvement of the walls and the bridges.  It is proposed in future that the bridge tax will cease to be levied, and that the expenses for the upkeep of the bridges will be incorporated in the bridge rate. That means that there will be one rate covering the repayments of principal and interest of loans that were borrowed for the building or extension of the bridges, as well as the amounts required for the maintenance of the quay walls and the existing bridges.  In these circumstances I think there is no sense in refusing to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Title>PUBLIC BUSINESS. - LOCAL ELECTIONS (DUBLIN) BILL, 1929&mdash;SECOND STAGE.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Local Elections (Dublin) Bill, 1929, be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought someone was going to make a justification for this Bill.  Apparently it is not intended that that practice should be followed, and I want to say a few words with regard to it.  It seems to me that there is no justification whatever in postponing the elections for Dublin City or County to a date not later than the 30th September, 1930, meaning that there will be no elections for another 18 months.  I predict that there will be no elections in 18 months.  There has been on the stocks for a couple of years or more a proposal for a reconstitution of the administrative authority for Dublin City and County.  It has been suggested that that Bill will be brought forward, and, presumably, passed in time to allow the elections to take place before September, 1930.  We have no assurance whatever that elections can take place in that time.  The Bill has not yet been drafted.  There have been <Col N="411" /> no consultations, which, I presume, will be found necessary between the Department of Local Government and the various councils which still exist, and I would imagine that there will be such consultations before the Bill comes to a final drafting.  The Bill has then to be submitted to the Dáil and the Seanad, and, I have no doubt, will get a very close scrutiny, and will probably be considerably amended.</P>
      <P>I shall be astonished if all that can be gone through in time to allow the elections to take place before the 30th September, 1930.  I would be inclined to ask the House to agree, instead of passing this Bill in its present form, that the elections be postponed until, say, the end of June of this year, and that the elections, in fact, of the new councils shall take place before the end of June of this year, and let them sit, let us say, for two but not for three years. In the absence of such elections we shall have a continuation of the rule of the Commissioners in Dublin City in place of the Council, and Commissioners in place of the Guardians, and we shall also have a continuation of the present councils in the urban districts outside Dublin and in the rural districts.  I think it is fairly well admitted that the councils under the shadow of dissolution are not taking the keen, active interest in the work of administration that they would have if they thought they were going forward for re-election in a few months, that there has been, in fact, a lassitude and, in some cases, carelessness about the work of the councils.  That is not good for local administration, and if it is to be the case that these councils, which were elected nearly four years ago, are to go on for another eighteen months without any prospect of having to go before the electors again, they will become a little tired, weary and careless at their work, and local administration is not likely to be tuned up to the highest pitch of efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is the case of the Dublin Commissioners for Poor Law and the Commissioners for borough administration. Whatever may have been the justification for their appointment, whatever may have been the defects <Col N="412" /> which they are supposed to have remedied, and which no doubt they have remedied, justification for the continuance of the Commissioners has passed; they are no longer necessary for the remedying of the defects in the old administration, if those defects existed. The position regarding the Commissioners in place of the guardians and the council is that never, I think, in the experience of any Dublin citizen now living, and perhaps for very many years before that, has there been so little sense of civic inquiry, civic responsibility, or care about civic affairs as there is to-day.  We do not know at the present time to whom the Commissioners are responsible.  They are not responsible to the citizens, and I am not sure to what extent they are responsible to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I would like to have some clear intimation from the Minister whether he is answerable to the Oireachtas for the work of the Commissioners.  Is he prepared to answer to the Dáil or to the Seanad for the conduct of the Commissioners in their work?  One cannot get any precise information or anything to rely upon either in the Dáil or the Seanad as to their conduct of certain very important public works that have been undertaken by them, and that is quite an unsatisfactory state of things.  One assumes, of course, that everything that is being done by the Commissioners is being done in order, for the good government of the city, and for efficient administration, that the law is being faithfully observed, but where any question arises as to departure from legal rectitude one cannot get any satisfaction; nobody is answerable, and there is no one to call the Commissioners to order, nobody to inquire as to whether the Commissioners have or have not stepped aside from what they would be strictly bound to do.</P>
    <P>I am going to illustrate that by reference to a certain matter which has been brought to my notice, and which I hope the Minister will be able to deal with and give some information upon. The Commissioners for the Poor Law adopted a scheme some months ago in regard to the giving of relief to workless men.  There had been a refusal to put into operation what is known as <Col N="413" /> Section 13 of the Local Government Act.  Instead of giving relief, the Commissioners decided that they would employ a certain number of men on certain public work at a certain rate of pay, and as it appears to me from information I have been able to get&mdash; it has not been easy to get it confirmed from authoritative quarters&mdash;the Commissioners, instead of giving relief, adopted the method of entering into what is in fact a contract for certain public work, and in the carrying out of that contract engaged unemployed men, and paid them a very low rate of pay.  In the normal course of operations of work, such as the clearing of sites for building houses, it might be presumed that it would be done by ordinary contract, or by direct labour by the City Council, but instead of doing that, in the guise of giving relief to the unemployed poor, the Commissioner said: &ldquo;We will clear this site; we will give you this work to do; we will give you a rate of pay which is very much lower than anything paid elsewhere, and we will call it relief.&rdquo; Now the benefit of that presumably goes either to the Corporation&mdash;that is to say, the City Commissioners&mdash;or to the future tenants or owners of the houses that are to be ultimately built on the site.</P>
    <P>I am referring now to the clearing of a site and to the laying out of new roads in connection with a proposed building scheme beyond Glasnevin.  I am told it is outside the city boundary, but that the City Commissioners are interested in the building scheme.  I am not sure whether that is correct or not, but it is clear the work is being done by the guardians, or the Commissioners for the guardians, and it is the kind of work which would be done normally by contractors.  Instead of obeying the ruling of the guardians&mdash;as I understand the guardians, as also the city council, have a standing order to the effect that they shall pay normal rates, as agreed upon with the trade unions&mdash;they have employed this particular kind of labour at the rate of 10¼d. per hour, are getting the work done at that cheap rate, and taking it out of the poor.  There have been attempts to get this matter elucidated, but up to now the attempts have failed, <Col N="414" /> and I would like to know from the Minister whether the Commissioners have authority for doing this work, and if he will indicate what is the legal authority that they have for doing that particular kind of work in the way they are doing it.</P>
    <P>The position seems to me to be that this particular kind of work is being done at the expense of the standard rate of pay ruling in the city for work of the kind, that the need of the poor unemployed man is being taken advantage of to get this work done cheaply, with the effect&mdash;whether that was or was not the intention&mdash;of generally lowering the standard of the labourers' pay in building operations or in the preparation of sites for building work. This is a matter of very serious concern to a very large number of people in the city.  It is a matter of importance to know whether the Commissioners are exceeding their legal powers in doing this work, and from the point of view of this Bill it is important to make this comment, that nobody is in a position to call them to order or to examine the authority under which they are acting. They are irresponsible, and they may depart from every rule, transgress every practice in carrying out their duties as Commissioners, and nobody has the right to inquire as to their authority or as to the wisdom of their actions.  Because the Commissioners are in this position I want to cut short their reign as much as possible.  I, therefore, think the Bill should not be allowed to pass in its present form, that, in fact, the Seanad should do its best to secure that the rule of the Commissioner in his present irresponsibility should cease as soon as possible, and that the Bill, before it leaves this House, should require that the elections should be held at a date not later than 30th June, 1929.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the advice tendered by Senator Johnson was only in order to make a conventional intervention in the discussion rather than to tender a serious suggestion to the House.  There are, it is generally known, proposals under consideration for a very comprehensive scheme of municipal government, for an enlarged area in the vicinity of Dublin.  I have <Col N="415" /> not noticed any particularly enthusiastic clamour amongst the citizens of Dublin for the restoration of the Dublin Corporation.  If there was evidence that public opinion was insistent on the immediate restoration of that body there might be some argument; but even Senator Johnson commented on the absence of interest in these matters, or said something of that nature.  That seems to indicate that the citizens and the ratepayers of Dublin are not in any particularly urgent need of the Corporation, or are not in any particularly urgent hurry to have the Corporation restored, as I presume it would be restored at the date that Senator Johnson suggests, in practically the same form as it existed before its dissolution. But the practical consideration is: What is the use of setting up such a body within the next few months when the scheme which is to transform the whole problem, functions and conceptions of municipal government within this area is going to be dealt with at a comparatively early date?  You would have gone to the trouble of having an election, and you would have gone to the trouble of creating a body, and one of your considerations would be, practically, the dissolution of it or the merging of it in a larger scheme. Probably you would create additional distraction for the consideration of this new proposal now exercising the Department concerned.  I think that no argument was put forward by the Senator that should influence the House in delaying the passage of this Bill.  He certainly did not put forward anything convincing, in present circumstances at any rate, for the reconstitution of the old Dublin Corporation. The real reason for the present Bill is that the greater Dublin scheme is in the course of preparation.</P>

      <P>As Senator Milroy has said, Senator Johnson's proposal would mean that the seven urban district councils, the five rural district councils, the county council and the municipal council would, in fact, be elected before the 30th June.  You would have the expense of all these elections.  You would have fresh bodies coming into these councils for <Col N="416" /> a few years while the actual proposals dealing with the new Greater Dublin arrangement were being put before the Oireachtas.  The grounds of the inquiry covered by the Commission that dealt with Greater Dublin were very wide and exhaustive, and practically any evidence that is available on the matter is enshrined in the evidence given before that Commission and reflected in the report of the Commission.  As regards further consultation between the local bodies already in existence and the Department of Local Government as to the framing of the Greater Dublin Bill, and the getting of information likely to be of use when dealing with that Bill, all that information, I may say, has been got by my Department. The information has been fully sifted for my purposes by a small Committee composed of officials in my Department. I had no application from any existing bodies, and no representations from any other people outside, that on any particular headings they required to have a discussion with me at present.</P>
      <P>As to how far proposals for dealing with the position of Greater Dublin are advanced, I may say that they are pretty far advanced.  I think that if the position were to be this: that we were to have thirteen fresh bodies elected and had to deal with them as consultative bodies in the actual working out of the proposals in regard to Greater Dublin, that we would get no fresh light on the situation.  Instead, we might have a very great amount of unnecessary discussion and difficulty. There are certain financial, engineering, administrative and general co-ordinating aspects of these proposals that can be put down very plainly and systematically for such public discussion as may be required.  There will be ample opportunity for such discussion as may be required on behalf of the Oireachtas. In view of that, I think that no interest of a public, private or national nature can suffer by the way in which we propose to proceed in this particular Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Johnson says that we may not have full time before the 30th June, 1930, to discuss this matter.  I rather hope that we will.  I would sooner postpone the date at which the election would have to take place to the 31st <Col N="417" /> December, 1930, than have to take the alternative in Senator Johnson's proposal. I think that the Senator on reflection would perhaps agree to that, too.  I take it that it is not necessary to argue that in order to get the proposals put up and sufficient time to have them examined, it is necessary to extend the date of the election to at least the 31st December.</P>

      <P>It is not the opinion of the Oireachtas generally that local representation should be abolished. The position that I would like to be in is this: to have the Bill introduced before the Summer Recess so that during that period all interested would have an opportunity of studying it.  I think it would be possible to get the Bill through the Dáil in the Autumn, and have it dealt with by the Seanad in the Spring.  I explained in the Dáil the undesirability, from my particular point of view, of having the change take place, say, on the 1st April, 1930, even if we were in a position to bring about a change then.  I do not think, with the very intricate financial disentanglements that will have to take place, that it would be suitable the change should take place at a time when the new rate was being struck.  My desire is that the present bodies would strike their rate for the twelve months in the year beginning 1930, that the new bodies would come into existence before September of that year, and in that way have sufficient time to see exactly where they stood before being called upon to deal with the estimates and the striking of the rate for the following year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Johnson raised a question as to the responsibility of the Commissioners in the city of Dublin, as to whom they are answerable, and as to my responsibility in the matter.  My responsibility in the matter of the conduct of the municipal government of <Col N="418" /> Dublin is exactly the same as my responsibility for the conduct of the work of a county council or a municipal council.  Only in the general way that I am answerable for the government of such bodies am I answerable for the government of the city of Dublin.  I am answerable for the fact that I keep Commissioners there under present circumstances, but beyond that the Commissioners in Dublin are vested with the full powers, duties and responsibilities of the old Dublin Corporation. The same applies with regard to the Commissioners acting in the place of the old Board of Guardians.</P>
    <P>The Senator complained of certain action taken with regard to the employment of a certain class of people and of certain work that is being carried on outside the city.  He suggested that a system had been adopted of getting work done at a cheaper rate than it would be done at if the work were carried out at the normal labour rates paid to Corporation workers or by contract. The position was this, that at a time when a greater amount of work was being done in the building trade in the city of Dublin under the Housing Acts than in any previous year, and when the peak of unemployment over the winter period&mdash;unemployment is usually higher in the winter time than at any other period of the year&mdash;was, say, 20 per cent. lower than it was last year, the Commissioners had to deal with a certain relief situation.  Everyone who has any experience of the city knows that there is a certain class of persons in it whom some people would call unemployable.  For one reason or another, this class is not able to give a full day's work.  That may be due to a long period of unemployment, to accidents, or to misfortune of one kind or another, but at any rate they are left in the position that they cannot be described as able-bodied men.  The Commissioners considered how they might best help to solve the problem that presented itself as regards that particular class.  That occurred at a time when there was more work going on in the building trade in Dublin than there had been in previous years.  Prior to that the Commissioners had decided to begin the development of some of their land outside the city.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="419" /> At this time they decided to utilise this particular class of persons on the development of this land.  They did not get from the men they employed a full day's work in the ordinary sense. They paid them at a lower rate of wages, but there is this in connection with the work&mdash;it bears on Senator Johnson's suggestion&mdash;that while the Commissioners were getting the work done at a cheaper rate, the carrying out of that work at a normal cost has been estimated.  The Commissioners, even at the present rate of pay, expect to lose, such was the output of these men, compared with what the output would be at the ordinary normal cost. If, by any chance, the cost of the carrying out of this work at the rates that have been allowed for this particular class of persons is less than the estimated cost at normal rates, the Commissioners will distribute whatever saving there is over by way of bonus to the men who have been employed up to the present.  This particular class of persons exists, and if they cannot be dealt with to some extent by the Commissioners in this particular way, of relieving them and giving them an opportunity of winning themselves back to work and to a state of able-bodiedness, then I would like to hear from the Senator his proposals as to how that particular problem might be settled.  In so far as the Commissioners are carrying out this particular work, they are acting completely and entirely on their own responsibility and their own powers.  I know of no law that they are transgressing. The Senator suggested that it was difficult to get information from an authoritative quarter as to what was going on there.  I cannot agree that there is any difficulty in that matter. As far as I know, the matter has been discussed between authoritative representatives of labour bodies and the Commissioners on, I think, a number of occasions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of what the Minister has stated, I would like to say that I am opposed to the extension of this Bill to the 30th September, 1930, for this reason, that I am absolutely opposed to the principle of compelling <Col N="420" /> people to pay rates and then giving them no voice as to the manner in which these rates should be expended. That is a wrong and a bad principle.  The Commissioners were appointed without any authority under any Act of Parliament.  The Corporation was dissolved and the Commissioners have been in office for the last six years.  In my opinion, during all that period there has been ample time for the Government to take such steps as would enable representation to be afforded to the citizens of Dublin who pay the rates.  I think it is an outrage that the citizens of Dublin who pay in or about £1,000,000 a year in rates, have no right to say how their money should be disposed of.  Senator Milroy professes to be very innocent. He said he did not hear anybody clamouring to have an end put to the system of Commissioners in the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but I understood the Senator to say that he did not hear anyone clamouring for a change in the present position of Commissioners. If the Senator has any doubt in his mind in that respect, I would invite him to attend a meeting of any section of workers in the City of Dublin, when he will hear their views with regard to this system of Commissioners.  He will hear what they have to say about it.  It is all very well for the Minister to say that the proposals with regard to Greater Dublin are now under consideration, and that they need to be carefully considered in their various aspects.  We know that a Commission was set up to consider proposals with regard to Greater Dublin.  We are all in sympathy with that, but we think that too much time is being spent on the consideration of the proposals submitted. The Commission referred to reported to the Government nearly two years ago.  Surely the Government have had ample time to consider the proposals submitted by that Commission.  It is not fair that the Government should come along at this stage with the proposal that there should be a further <Col N="421" /> postponement for eighteen months, and expect the House to agree to that.</P>
      <P>I do not say that the old Corporation should be set up as it was.  I never said that.  I have often said that I beheved some change was necessary. What I do object to, as a Dublin-born citizen, is the stigma that is being cast on this City of Dublin by the system of having Commissioners&mdash;the disgrace that the citizens of Dublin are not fit to carry out their civic duties and responsibilities. That has been going on for the past six years, and now we are told that there can be no election before September, 1930.  The Minister's predecessor promised that elections would be held in March, 1929, for the election of a new Corporation in Dublin.  This is March, 1929, and to-day we are asked to postpone for a further period of eighteen months the election of a popularly-elected body in this city.  I do not think that is fair. The citizens of Dublin ought not to be treated in that manner by anybody.  If the intention be to adopt Mussolini methods and to refuse the ratepayers of Dublin the right to say how the rates they contribute should be spent, then let that be said out honestly and have done with it.  Do not be putting it off from year to year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to what has been said by some Senators, I wish to point out that the people I represent here are not satisfied with the system of Commissioners as it is practised in the city today. On every occasion when they find it convenient to do it the Commissioners by their methods have done their best to reduce the wages of the ordinary working man to that of a pauper and starvation level.  While they do that in the case of the ordinary working man, the higher officials with salaries of £1,000 a year have been given increases.  I could name officials in the Dublin Corporation whose salaries have been increased by the Commissioners from £1,000 to £1,250, while the three Commissioners themselves have had increases of £200 a year.  They did that while the labouring man's wages were brought down to a starvation rate.  That is the result of the Commissioners' work. While that is being done, the ratepayers of Dublin are denied the opportunity <Col N="422" /> of expressing their views on the matter. I think that it is not fair that the affairs of the city of Dublin should be carried on in that fashion.  I think that every decent ratepayer in Dublin would be prepared to endorse the views that I have expressed on this matter.  I have always admitted that a change was necessary as regards the government of the city.  The old system was antiquated and worn out.  Modern times call for modern methods.  What I object to is the disfranchisement of the ratepayers of Dublin for this long period of six years.</P>
    <P>There was a slogan in the old days, &ldquo;No taxation without representation.&rdquo; That, I suggest, was a good principle to go on.  The position in Dublin is that the ratepayers are to go on paying their rates but they are to get no representation.  They have been disfranchised for a period of six years, and now we are told by the Minister that this is to continue for another eighteen months.  We have no guarantee that even at the end of the eighteen months the citizens of Dublin will be afforded an opportunity of deciding how their civic duties and responsibilities should be carried out.  These are my main objections to the Bill.  I know that it is not feasible to restore the Corporation on their old lines.  What I complain of is the delay in giving the people representation, and of the further postponement that is now to take place.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Corporation was dissolved before the Cork Corporation. The representatives of the city of Cork in the Dáil and Seanad, as well as prominent people in Cork, got together and said that they wanted an end put to the Commissionership system in their city.  They regarded that as a stigma on their city, and said that an effort should be made to remove it.  I give them every credit for that.  I admire their civic pride.  They said: &ldquo;We want the stigma removed from our city. We think that a Bill should be introduced immediately to give the citizens a say in the government of their city, of which they are very proud.&rdquo;  I admire the Cork representatives for the action they took.  The result was that the Cork City Management Bill was <Col N="423" /> introduced.  It was passed through the Dáil and is now an Act.  That is what has happened in the case of Cork, though the Corporation there was not dissolved until long after the Dublin Corporation was dissolved. Dublin seems to be nobody's child.  As one Dublin-born citizen I protest against it, and I say that it is an outrage that the stigma that has remained so long on this old city should be allowed to remain on it for a further period.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What was passed after they were dissolved was the permanent legislation contained in the Local Government Act of 1925.  The Senator spoke of promises made by a previous Minister.  As a matter of fact, the alleged promises could only have been made by me.  When the Local Elections Bill of 1927 was before the House I was pressed to promise that legislation dealing with Greater Dublin would be introduced in time to come into effect as from the 31st March this year.  I said that it would be more advisable that the Dublin Corporation situation would be dealt with before the Cork situation, but that I saw signs that the Cork situation might be dealt with earlier if certain things happened. As events transpired, it was possible to bring the Cork situation to a fruitful issue earlier than I anticipated. For that reason the Cork Bill was dealt with and has now become law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the Cork situation, there is this to be borne in mind, that there you were dealing with one municipal area.  In the case of Dublin, you are dealing with, I think, nineteen different areas.  You have about thirteen councils, operating at the moment, and the finances of these will need to be <Col N="424" /> disentangled.  It is consequently a very complicated situation, and I have had very excellent reasons for dealing with the Cork Bill before the Dublin Bill. It is not correct to say that there were any promises, as the Senator suggested, to deal with the Dublin situation before March, 1929.</P>

      <P>I am tempted to suggest that the sub-title of this Bill should be &ldquo;Hardy Annual.&rdquo;  From year to year, Senators are regaled with these little Bills as if they were rare and refreshing fruit.  In reality they are hardy old plants that for the last five or six years have been sapping the vitality of the country.  There have been a good many millions of money expended during that period.  Year after year, they contain the suggestion that they are merely small Bills of a temporary nature and that permanent legislation will be introduced later. This Bill contains a similar suggestion. Last year the Minister, like his predecessors, announced that the Bill was of a temporary nature.</P>
      <P>I suggest that permanent legislation be introduced.  Now that the Minister is dealing with the re-organisation of the Army, I ask him whether he is in the position to give a definite statement as to whether he will introduce legislation of a permanent nature this year. As things are, we must oppose Bills dealing with the Army until it is reduced and placed on a basis which is economic as far as the country is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how many Senators know what they are asked to re-enact.  This is an Act containing 246 sections and 8 schedules.  It deals with the government of the Defence Forces of the State.  It gives the Executive Council authority to set up a Defence Force.  It contains provisions whereby discipline in those forces can be maintained.  It gives a great deal of authority to the Defence Forces over <Col N="425" /> the average citizen in matters such as billeting, requisitioning horses and cars, and arranging the allowances that would be paid for such requisition; the rights of the officer over the soldier, and the rights of the soldier and the duties of the soldier, especially the duties.  That Bill was introduced in 1923, and no single section of it has had any consideration by the Dáil or the Seanad.  There has been a certain amount of Second Reading discussion in the Dáil, but there was no Second Reading or Third Reading discussion, and no Final Stage discussion in the Seanad.  The whole 246 sections and 8 schedules passed without one minute's discussion.  That Act has been re-enacted year after year, and each year there was a promise that within the next twelve months a permanent Act would be introduced.  We are still waiting for the permanent Act.  On the occasion of the 1923 Bill certain views were expressed in the Dáil hoping that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The scheme of organisation, the scheme of administration, the various grades of commissioned rank from General downwards will not be taken as establishing any vested interests for those officers of higher rank in case a future Dáil decides upon a different scheme of organisation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When this was then being discussed the Minister for Defence at that time said he was going to introduce a permanent measure which could be fully discussed within six months of that date.  The objection was raised that the passage of the Bill in a temporary form might be said to be giving the higher officer a certain amount of right in his position which would entitle him to a certain amount of remuneration or payment in the case of a change in the scheme of organisation.  The Minister for Defence at the time made these remarks:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I thought I made it clear that all commissions held at the present time are temporary commissions, and that all commissions that would be held under the present Act would be temporary commissions also.... The present holders of either high or low ranks in the Army do not hold them as vested interests of any kind.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="426" /> The general impression he gave us was that they were temporary commissions, and that the pay they received, or would receive under future regulations, would be in the nature of remuneration for loss of time in the service they were giving, and would not entitle them to anything in the way of vested rights.  We are familiar enough with the fact that within the last year or two there has been a considerable amount of compensation&mdash;I think that is the correct word to use&mdash;paid to officers who had been induced to retire by the offer of compensation, notwithstanding the fact that the Oireachtas has been living under the assurance that these were temporary commissions, and that there was no right or authority under the Act to appoint officers to anything but temporary commissions, and therefore, there were no vested interests of any kind being created.  It is important to know that this Act which is supposed to be temporary entitles the Army authorities to enlist a soldier for twenty-one years, and there is frequent reference to twelve years' service.  The section regarding the billeting and victualling of soldiers seems to be copied from antiquated legislation that does not fit in with the requirements of the country.  There are references to a constable.  I do not know who is the equivalent of a constable in the Gárda Síochána, whether it is the Guard himself or the Superintendent, but the constable has certain rights and powers under this Act which we are asked to re-enact.  There are certain provisions regarding apprentices, and a whole series of provisions that are very doubtful as to their fitness to our conditions, but they have been re-enacted year after year.  They have never had any discussion or consideration by the Dáil or Seanad.  Senator Connolly has just spoken, urging that there should be permanent legislation, and that we should know exactly where we stand in regard to a permanent scheme of organisation.  There was a good deal of discussion in the early stages when the Bill was being first examined as to the desirability of providing for a standing Army at all, and I think that if a section of the community which was represented by the spokesmen who <Col N="427" /> made these proposals were still of the same mind there would be no standing Army.  The position may have changed, The section of the community which, as I said then, put forward those views may have revised their judgement and may prefer to retain the present system, but the opportunity for discussing that matter has never yet been given. I think the Minister in charge ought to state for the assurance of the Seanad what is his view of the present position and of the future, how soon that future will be provided for, and what is the present state of the organisation of the Army.</P>
    <P>I want to come to a matter a little more abstract and perhaps a matter of more permanent importance. What we are providing for in this Bill is intended to implement the Constitution.  It is provided in Article 46 of the Constitution that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Oireachtas has the exclusive right to regulate the raising and maintaining of such armed forces as are mentioned in the Scheduled Treaty in the territory of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann), and every such force shall be subject to the control of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is as definite as anything could be.  I am anxious to know from the Minister whether every such openly armed forces in the territory of the Irish Free State are subject to the control of the Oireachtas.  &ldquo;The Oireachtas has the exclusive right to regulate the raising and maintaining of such armed forces as are mentioned in the Scheduled Treaty&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;  The armed forces mentioned in the Scheduled Treaty are in paragraph 8.  I will leave out the question of coastal defence for the moment.  In paragraph 8 of the Treaty it is provided:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With a view to securing the observance of the principle of international limitation of armaments, if the Government of the Irish Free State establishes and maintains a military defence force, the establishments thereof shall not exceed in size such proportion of the military establishments maintained in Great Britain as that which the population of Ireland <Col N="428" /> bears to the population of Great Britain.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is one reference in the Scheduled Treaty to armed forces.  There is this reference to coastal defence:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Until an arrangement has been made between the British and Irish Governments whereby the Irish Free State undertakes her own coastal defence, the defence by sea of Great Britain and Ireland shall be undertaken by His Majesty's Imperial Forces.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then there is this reference:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government of the Irish Free State shall afford to His Majesty's Imperial forces: (a) in time of peace such harbour and other facilities as are indicated in the Annex;&rdquo; and &ldquo;(b) in time of war or of strained relations with a Foreign Power such harbour and other facilities as the British Government may require for the purposes of such defence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are references to armed forces in Article 46 of the Constitution.  It may be pointed out that the Annex referred to in the Treaty does not specifically deal with armed forces at all. &ldquo;Harbour defences to remain in charge of British care and maintenance parties.&rdquo;  It is not necessary for a man or a group of men to take care of maintenance defences, and there is no reference in any of these paragraphs dealing with defence to armed forces, but even if there were, Article 46 provides that &ldquo;every such force shall be subject to the control of the Oireachtas.&rdquo; I want to know where and in what way the armed forces which are in British uniform at Berehaven, Lough Swilly and places around the coast, are subject to the control of the Oireachtas, and are raised and maintained by the Oireachtas.  I do not believe that the Oireachtas has any control whatever over those armed forces.  It seems to me to be a distinct departure from the requirements of the Constitution that there should be any armed forces within the Free State which are not raised and maintained by the Oireachtas and subject to the control of the Oireachtas.  If the Minister has not already given consideration to that matter it is one which I hope he <Col N="429" /> will immediately take into account. If he thinks it does not require consideration perhaps he can give his answer immediately.  I do not press for an immediate answer, but I would ask that if the rights which are secured to the Free State under the Constitution are being violated or abrogated in any way, he should insist that those rights shall be maintained, and that all armed forces within the Free State, whether called British care and maintenance parties or not, should be brought under the control of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>Both Senators who have spoken have referred to the absence of a permanent Act.  Last year in introducing this Bill I did say in the other House that a permanent Bill would be introduced at the end of the period of that Bill, but immediately I entered upon a very comprehensive scheme of re-organisation, and as I progressed with it, it became apparent to me that it would not be of any advantage to the Army or the State to commit ourselves to a permanent Act based on an Army which was at the moment in a state of flux.  That organisation has gone ahead up to this day, and my experience of entering into unwarranted optimistic prophecy naturally deters me from going out of my way to give any promise the fulfilment of which I am not able completely to guarantee. We introduced a temporary Army Act in 1923, and the very temporariness of that Act has brought the whole Army up for discussion, not merely on Estimates, but on the re-introduction of this Bill, and so far as lack of consideration by the Oireachtas is concerned I think the temporary nature of this Bill has brought it more than usually into the power of the Oireachtas to discuss and, by discussion, to control the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Johnson says that it is a very long Bill.  It is a long Bill, and it is a very complicated Bill.  Its length and complication, and the whole complicated system necessary in dealing with armed forces, for they need more rigid discipline and control than ordinary citizens, is one of the factors making <Col N="430" /> for the postponement of a permanent Bill.  I wish to tell Senator Johnson quite frankly that I regard the Army as a permanent institution.  I regard the officers at present in the Army as having some security of tenure, and it is on those postulations that I work. Senator Johnson referred to the position of the Government regarding billeting and the requisitioning of cars. Everybody knows that in the Army you have to take into account abnormal times as well as normal.  You have more or less to trust the Minister in control of the Army not wantonly to go about billeting or requisitioning cars. I think it would be hard for anybody to point to a case of billeting or requisitioning of cars since normal conditions of social order have been established. Such special rights have to be incorporated in the Act having regard to abnormal circumstances, but I think that during my time in office, and I think I can say that of my predecessors, these powers have not been applied in normal conditions.  In abnormal conditions, when the existence of the State is dependent on the operations of the Army, the Army must be given all the power it needs to sustain the State.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnson spoke of vested interests in the Army, and he seemed to question the need of a standing Army. I must say again quite frankly that I regard an Army as impossible in this country without a standing Army.  I regard the Army in this State as a permanent institution.  As far as this Bill is concerned the Seanad is only committing itself to the 31st January of next year, but there will be further legislation to continue the Army after that date, as I consider it one of the necessary institutions of the State.  I was not sure of what Senator Johnson said when he spoke of the control of the Oireachtas over armed forces.  I thought he was referring to certain illegal organisations in the State.  This, of course, goes outside my sphere as Minister for Defence, but as far as the Constitution is concerned the Schedule to it is an integral part of the Constitution. We know there are certain places in which there are care and maintenance parties, and these places are armed.  I do not want to speak <Col N="431" /><i>ex cathedra</i> on a matter which is outside my province on this Bill, but it does seem to me, to give an <i>ad hoc</i> legal interpretation of a document, that if you had in a document that which is a very integral part of the Constitution, men occupying fortified armed places, that that does cover the existence of those armed men.  If those men march out from those places bearing arms they only do that in so far as we permit them to do it. There is no inherent right in their position to enable them to march across the country as armed men.</P>
    <P>We know that there was a dastardly attack by criminals on some of these men at Cobh some years ago, and anyone who cares anything for our national reputation will feel that there is some justification for those men taking precautions against similar things happening in the future.  But so far as these places are concerned, when the document read out by Senator Johnson was drawn up, these places were armed places, and the men who occupy these places can be declared to be armed men, for if a man is standing in front of a marine gun he is armed equally with the man who carries a rifle.  The Treaty provided for the temporary holding of armed places by men, and therefore it is implied these men are there armed.  When they march out and carry arms they do so only in so far as we permit them to do so.  In the actual position there is no actual breach of the Constitution, and the Constitution includes the Schedule to the Treaty.  Naturally nobody has more reason to regret that this is a temporary Bill than I have. I am anxious that there should be a permanent measure as soon as possible, if only that the vested interests of the men in the Army may be more clearly established.  I have sufficient reliance on both Houses of the Oireachtas to believe those men have that security of tenure independent of a permanent measure which I intend to bring in, but I have to consider what the best interests of the State and the Army demand.  I do not feel at this moment that I would be in a position to bring <Col N="432" /> in a permanent measure adverting to every possible need of the Army in the future and indicating the organisation which is most suitable for the Army.</P>
    <P>Most Senators know that during last year we reduced considerably the standing Army making it the framework, which was to be filled in by other organisations such as the A and B reserves, and the Volunteer reserves. We have progressed in that direction with extraordinary speed.  I feel I have done that, and that nobody could expect me to do more. Senator Robinson, and anybody with any intelligence who knows the realities of administering an organisation like the Army or a Department of State, anybody who adverts to the difficulties there, must recognise that the movement in that direction has been as complete as could humanly speaking possibly be done within the period.  I hope to bring in a permanent Act as soon as possible.  I do not want to be pressed beyond that, for having promised that when the other Bill was introduced over a year ago I found when it came to the Estimates that it would not be possible for me having regard to the interest of the Army to proceed with it, and I had to get up and say that the promise I made could not be fulfilled.  I do not like promising when I am not completely certain of being able to fulfil the promise.  All I say is that by passing this Bill the Seanad provides for next year, and either during that time or at the end of it we will have to produce a permanent Act, or will have to come back again to the Seanad, when the Seanad will again have the opportunity of considering the whole Army question.  It seems to me that the lack of a permanent Act has added to and not taken from the powers of the Oireachtas over the Army.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the second Report of the Joint Restaurant Committee do lie on the Table of the House, and be printed and circulated.&rdquo; The history of the restaurant amounts to this: Up to 1926 it was rather an unprofitable speculation, it did not pay its way; in 1927 the accounts about balanced, and I am glad to say that during the year 1928, under very careful management <Col N="434" /> and with great watchfulness, which resulted in entire satisfaction to the patrons, there was a profit of £487 12s. 3d.  Now with our better catering equipment and more comprehensive methods, with the same vigilence and organisation, we hope to be able to show better results in the future.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.50 p.m. until March 20th.</P>
