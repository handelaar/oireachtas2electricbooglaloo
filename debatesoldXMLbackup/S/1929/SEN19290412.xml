      <P>Senators will notice on the Order Paper the following resolution which was passed by the Dáil:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That it is expedient that a Joint Committee of the Dáil and the Seanad be set up to consider and report on the question of the amount of the allowance which should be paid to members of Seanad Eireann;</P>
      <P>That seven Deputies represent the Dáil on the said Joint Committee.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The resolution is of very considerable importance to the Seanad, and I think, at a late hour on Friday afternoon, when many members have gone home, we ought not to discuss the matter.  With the permission of the Seanad I will put it down for consideration on the next day on which the House meets.</P>

      <P>There is nothing of very great importance in this Bill. It is an amending Bill to the Principal Act which was passed in 1927. Most of the sections here deal with the working of the office, postponing certain things that had to be done within a limited period.  The period was found impracticable in working and it is considered that it ought to be extended.  I might direct the attention of the Seanad particularly to two sections, one of which is Section 5, under which the powers of the Minister are clearly defined in accepting patents, and how he should deal with them.  Section 7 brings in a new matter, making it necessary for a patent agent to reside as well as have his place of business in Saorstát Eireann.  In Committee I intend to move an amendment to that section extending the time when it will come into operation for three months&mdash;to give three months grace to wind up business at present in the hands of the offices.</P>

      <P>As one who took considerable interest in the Committee that was originally formed to consider the terms of the Bill before it was introduced I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary a few questions.  He alluded to one matter, that a patent agent must reside in the Free State.  Now, in the case of a great many patentees, who have no patent agent&mdash;and a great many of these patents are held by people, or may be held by people, who do not reside in the Free State, and who would not reside in it under any circumstances&mdash;I have been asked to inquire if this clause covers cases of that kind where the patentee has no agent and does not reside in the Free State.  There are many such instances.  I will give an instance of how the clause would work.  Let us take the case of the Ford factory in Cork.  There are a good many patents in connection with the manufacture <Col N="133" /> of motor tractors.  The people who hold the patents are naturally in America, where they live. You could not expect them to come and live in the Free State.  Would they be affected in any way by the clause?  I also want to ask another question.  The Bill proposes to repeal several sections of the original Act.  The Parliamentary Secretary has not given us any particulars as to how they affect the original Act. Would he kindly do so?</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary for information, and whether he would develop the policy more under which the Government is taking powers to acquire and develop Government patents.  Some of us feel that that is a business that could more properly be done by ordinary industrial methods, and we would like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary some convincing reason for the rather marked change in policy that is foreshadowed by these powers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. Barrington Mr. Barrington">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrington</NameTxt>
      <P>There is power under the Act, as the Parliamentary Secretary is doubtless aware, to hold patents and licences of right, and when a patent or licence of right is endorsed, the Patent Controller has powers to fix the price at which that patent may be acquired.  Will that apply in the case where the Minister proposes to acquire a patent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is important. It contains a number of very important amendments to a very important and very technical Act, and I confess that I am in entire ignorance of the original Act and of the <Col N="134" /> effect of these amendments.  But in view of the fact that this very important Act was passed so recently, following upon a long consideration by a specially selected Committee, it seems to me that the Seanad ought to obtain from somebody who is responsible an explanation as to what difficulties have arisen to require these amendments so soon.  A mere statement that these are only office changes, merely administrative, is not very satisfactory.  That is hardly enough to justify the Seanad in making changes in an important Act which was passed only after a long consideration, after even, I think, a second edition was produced.  Certainly, while having no reason for opposing the Bill, I have no reason for supporting it, except that the Minister wants it.  The Parliamentary Secretary has not given us any justification for supporting a change in the law, and surely it is somebody's business to justify to the House a proposal for a change in the law.  It is not entirely true, of course, to say that the present Bill deals only with administrative office matters, because it does deal, as Senator Sir John Keane has said, with one or two much more important questions than mere office questions. So far as I understand the duty of this House, it is that at least it should be convinced of the necessity of a change in the law before it consents to it.</P>

      <P>I would like to follow Senator Johnson in his very pertinent remarks.  This Bill deals with the very important question of copyright and with patents for inventions.  This is a world-wide question, and it has been occupying the attention of various legislatures for many years.  I think it is surely due to the Seanad that we should have some explanation as to what these changes mean from somebody who is responsible for the Bill.  I have looked through this Bill, and I want to raise the point, though this is hardly the time, which might be raised on most Bills, and that is that there is very often too much legislation by reference.  In this Bill <Col N="135" /> there is not so much legislation by reference as is usual.  Legislation by reference is a most objectionable proceeding, and hitherto most of the legislation in the Free State has been legislation by reference.  The result is that the public, and even the legal profession, are confused about what some of these Bills may happen to mean.  This Bill is not a particular offender in that respect, but I would like to enter my protest to this practice, and I will repeat it on every occasion that legislation is attempted by reference to Bills which this Seanad may not quite understand.  I think this question of patents and copyright is a very important one, and we should have some responsible person, some Minister, to explain what we are asked to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before anybody goes further into the question, I was prepared to take the amendments to the Act seriatim and to give an explanation of the reason for each amendment, but I thought that on Friday evening the Seanad might not care to be wearied by details as to these changes.  They are really amendments to the Principal Act. Before any other Senator speaks, I would like to explain the sections of this Bill.  Section 2 amends Section 19 of the Principal Act.  In the Principal Act, Section 19, the acceptance of a complete specification in London is equivalent to the acceptance of a complete specification here.  The object of this provision is to save the expense of the searches necessary before the acceptance of a complete specification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 19 (5) and the Rules it is necessary to lodge in the office, within one month of the acceptance in London, a copy of the accepted specification and drawings, certified by the London Controller. This period of one month has been found to be too short.  There are a number of such accepted specifications in the office which have been lodged later than that, and consequently they cannot be proceeded <Col N="136" /> with.  That is the reason for extending the time.  Under Section 3 a patent granted in London before 1st October, 1927, is, under Section 29, valid in Saorstát Eireann without registration here, but such patent will lapse, under Section 33, if renewal fees are not paid as they fall due.  The object of Section 26 (6) is to secure that our Controller shall have on his register a complete record of such British patents.  Under this sub-section he will refuse to accept the renewal fees unless all the documents that he requires relating to such patents have been lodged. Section 45 (4) as amended by Section 5 of the Bill, shows the documents which must be furnished to the Controller.  It is simpler to refer to Section 45 (4) in Section 29 instead of setting out a list of the documents in full, because in that section the list of documents is set out.  Under Section 4 a patent granted in London before 1st October, 1927, the date of the commencement of Part 1 of the Act, is, under Section 29, valid in Saorstát Eireann without registration here, but it will, under Section 33 (1), lapse in Saorstát Eireann unless renewal fees are paid here as they become due.  The prescribed time for the payment of any renewal fee is before the expiry of the year next preceding the year in respect of which the fee is due.  Under Section 33 (2), the Controller is empowered to extend the prescribed time for six months, the object being to allow patent agents to communicate with their clients all over the world as to whether they wish their patents kept alive in Saorstát Eireann or not.  This period has been found to be too short, and twenty months from 1st October, 1927, is now proposed as being necessary for the business of the office.</P>
    <P>The reason of the substitution of &ldquo;any fee&rdquo; for the &ldquo;first fee&rdquo; is as follows: the patent year of a British patent might expire on the 15th October, 1927.  The first renewal fee payable in Saorstát Eireann is that in respect of the period 1st to 15th October, and is immediately due. The time for the payment of this fee as the Act stands can be extended for six months, when another renewal <Col N="137" /> fee, namely, that for the succeeding patent year, becomes due before the 15th October, 1927, and the time for the payment of this fee cannot, as the Act stands, be extended, The amendment is intended to remove this anomaly.  The importance of the amendment is limited by the fact that the Controller can only extend the time up to the 1st June, 1929.  It is necessary to give the amendment a retrospective effect. With regard to Section 5, this amendment specifies the documents which must be lodged with the Controller in the case of a British patent.  All these documents are required by Rule 51 of the Patents Rules, 1927, but it is feared that without the present amendment, Rule 51 might be ultra vires the Act. There has been, in fact, no complaint as to compliance with Rule 51. Although a British patent granted before 1st October, 1927, is valid in Saorstát Eireann without registration here, the Act makes provision for having a complete record of all British patents and entries relating thereon on our register.  This is essential for the proper working of the office.  This is effected by making it obligatory under Section 29 (6) and Section 45 (4) to furnish all the entries on the British register relating to the patent before the payment of renewal fees: if they are not furnished, the Controller will refuse to pay the renewal fees, and the patent lapses.  On drafting the Act, it was not observed that there are no renewal fees payable in the case of Patents of Addition which are dealt with in Section 35.  Consequently, there may never be a record of such British patents on our register.  The proposed amendment has the effect of compelling the furnishing to the Controller of the entries on the British register relating to Patents of Addition, under penalty of lapse of the patent if this be not done.  The date, 1st January, 1932, is taken as being the date before which, having regard to the payment of renewal fees, all ordinary British patents will normally be on our register, and as affording <Col N="138" /> quite sufficient time for furnishing the required particulars.</P>
    <P>As to Section 6, compared with the repealed Section 46, this section empowers the Minister to take an invention or patent and to develop it in various specified ways.  The chief criticism in the Dáil was in respect of the powers of the Minister to dispose of such rights acquired by him, and to develop them commercially, without the control of the Oireachtas.  It appears to have been thought that the control provided by appropriation under sub-section (3) was not sufficient.  The Dáil passed the section on the introduction of the following modifications:</P>
    <P>(a)  Under (d) the sanction of the Minister for Finance is required to the sale or lease of a patent, or the grant of a licence, by the Minister.</P>
    <P>(b)  Every Minister shall lay before each House an annual report of whatever he may have done under (d) and (e) (that is, in respect of disposal of State rights and commercial development), and may, if he thinks it expedient, lay a report of what he has done under the other paragraphs.</P>
    <P>As to the point raised with reference to this by Senator Sir John Keane, as to what was the policy underlying the acceptance of the development of a patent of this kind, the Minister explained in a statement on this question that it is only in very exceptional circumstances that he would accept the responsibility conferred on him by the section.  There is one such exceptional circumstance at present.  The Minister has accepted a patent, as is pretty generally known, but it is not intended that a practice would be made of any such procedure.  As will be seen by the section, the matter is pretty well watertight as regards the rights and privileges of the Oireachtas in keeping sufficient control over any development, and in the working of the patents under the powers the Minister gets under this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesNicholasDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will now deal with Section 7.  The deletion of the words &ldquo;the firm and&rdquo; and &ldquo;the company and&rdquo;&mdash;I think this is the point that Senator Barrington wanted to refer to&mdash;in Section 62 (b) and (c) respectively, is proposed for the following reasons.  Under Section 63 the conditions of eligibility to be entered on the register of patent agents clearly apply to individuals only and not to firms or companies.  There is no test of eligibility for the registration of a firm or company.  A firm or company must not, therefore, be registered as such.  But the amendment <Col N="140" /> does not affect the provisions of Section 62, that a firm cannot hold itself out as a &ldquo;patent agent&rdquo; unless every partner of the firm is registered. Similarly as regards a company. The words &ldquo;the firm&rdquo; and &ldquo;the company&rdquo; are not in the corresponding section of the British Act.  On drafting our Act we did not observe that the introduction of these words created an inconsistency with Section 63.</P>
      <P>This amendment makes it necessary that as well as having a place of business in the Saorstát a patent agent must also reside in the Saorstát. Under Section 66 a design registered in London before 1st October, 1927, can be entered on our register, without going through an ordinary application to register a design, if it is done within six months after the 1st October, 1927. This period has been found to be too short.  A large number of applications to enter such designs on our register cannot be proceeded with owing to the lapse of the six months. The proposed amendment will extend the period up to 1st June, 1929. In our view that is sufficient time in which to have our register properly compiled.  Of course, the principal work of the Controller has been the compiling of a proper register so that he would have transferred from the British Register all the necessary details as well as registering of new patents.  This amendment must be retrospective in order to give the necessary power to register those we have at present on hands. Section 9 is the same as the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reasons for the amendment of Section 10 are somewhat complicated. The intention of the proviso to Section 154 (1) is to enable the imposition of &ldquo;licensing conditions&rdquo; on the copyright acquired by an author (being a citizen of a non-Convention country).  The outstanding country outside the Convention is the United States of America, and in order to facilitate the protection of copyright here a rather involved procedure has to be gone through. This was to meet our promise that we would take whatever steps might be found possible to secure that <Col N="141" /> books like &ldquo;My New Curate,&rdquo; copyrighted in America, would be put on our market on reasonable terms. An American citizen might, we considered on drafting the Act, get copyright here either by publication here under Section 154 (1) (a), or by Order under Section 175 if his book were published in America. But in the course of the preparation of the Order under Section 175 relating to America, we found that the American law gives no copyright to our authors on the ground merely that their books are published in this country.  To get copyright in America they must publish and print in America, and, being aliens, they cannot even do this without the making of a Presidential Proclamation. The Presidential Proclamation will be made in return for our Order under Section 175.  We have a reciprocal understanding on this point.</P>
    <P>Since American law gives no copyright to books published here, but does give copyright to our authors of unpublished books, it is proposed to similarly restrict our Order under Section 175 so as to give protection only to the unpublished works of American authors.  Since then our Order under Section 175 will not relate to published works, there will be no opportunity of applying the &ldquo;licensing conditions&rdquo; by means of such Order.  But as we will make an Order under Section 175, in order to get the Presidential Proclamation, it is proposed to omit the words in the proviso to Section 154 (1) in order to enable us to impose the &ldquo;licensing conditions,&rdquo; even though an Order under Section 175 be made.  In a reference to (b) in the section, it has been pointed out to us that while the Convention does allow us to limit the period of an author's control over translations of his works in the manner set out in Section 154 (2) (a) as it stands it does not allow us to limit his control over performances of translations of dramatic and musical works, which is also the effect of the sub-section as it stands. The amendment is intended to make our law conformable with the Convention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesNicholasDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator studies the Principal Act and the amendment he will see that the amendment clarifies the position considerably from the manner in which it is left by the Principal Act.  Coming to Section 11, the expression &ldquo;British Dominion&rdquo; is not clearly defined in the Act.  In Section 3 it is merely defined as including certain countries. In preparing the Orders under Section 175 a doubt consequently arose as to whether such Orders could be made applicable to British protectorates or territories.  The proposed amendment is intended to remove this doubt.  With regard to sub-section (b) of the section, under the Convention we are bound to restrict the period of copyright we give to foreign works to the period of copyright allowed by the law of the country of origin of the works.  As Section 175 stands, we must give them the same period as the Act gives to our own citizens.  The amendment is intended to give us power to comply with the Convention. We are bound by the Convention and want power to comply with it.  Section 12 makes it clear that the copyright in notes issued by the Currency Commission belongs to the Commission; and also makes such copyright perpetual instead of the ordinary period, under Section 156, of the life of the author and fifty years after his death.</P>

      <P>The statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary will be of great assistance to Senators in their study of the original measure, and also of the Bill which is now proposed. I would like to assure the Parliamentary Secretary he will find the more frequently he comes here, what those of us who have come here recently have found, that the Seanad takes itself very seriously.  A statement upon a code of this description is very necessary and will be of great assistance to us, because, in addition to the amendments which are proposed in the Bill, I am sure other amendments will be introduced by <Col N="143" /> members of the Seanad.  I cannot conceive anything which would be of greater assistance to Senators than the perusal of the statement which has now been made by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I would ask the Seanad to pass the Second Stage of this Bill, because this amending Bill will introduce very considerable improvements in the Principal Act. Senator Johnson has questioned the propriety of introducing amendments so early to an Act which was passed only in the year 1927.  That Act of 1927 is a code of laws governing a new function of the Free State in dealing with patents, copyright and business generally.  After two years of working, of course it has been found that amendments were necessary. I am greatly surprised that the necessary amendments are not much more numerous.  Still I am sure that the officials who have been in charge of this Department of Industry and Commerce and who have been working this Act for two years, are quite satisfied that, as far as they are concerned, the amendments now proposed are sufficient. We will have, of course, other amendments to propose.  Perhaps the House will bear with me while I state that this amending Bill contains two new principles which really I think are very useful.  In the first place, the State takes to itself power to acquire a patent.  That is a function of Government. I do not know of any State, certainly I believe there is no sovereign State, which has not the power to acquire patents and which does not frequently exercise that power.  I was rather amused in listening to the statement that was made in the Dáil and repeated here, that this section is not intended to be of general application.  I can imagine the Minister and the officials trembling in the presence of a horde of new inventors who are going to come up offering to sell them patents. However, I think that section is a desirable section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another section in this Bill introducing a new principle <Col N="144" /> which is advisable and necessary, namely, that persons who apply for patents shall be resident in this country, citizens of this State, and resident in this country.  When I say persons who apply for patents I mean agents through whose hands the application for patents comes. Now the purpose of that is perfectly plain.  It is that any patents affecting this country are to be dealt with by people in this country, and they are not to be flung about like a shuttlecock between patent agents in other countries who have not the same interest in this country which agents resident in Ireland and citizens of Ireland would be disposed to have.  Therefore, I am greatly in favour of that section, and I would like to know from the Minister whether he would adopt an extension of that principle.  I am informed that English agents can render this section, as it stands or amended as it may be, entirely nugatory by the very simple device of preparing all specifications, plans and papers in London, Paris or New York and sending them here to a solicitor who would simply hand in the papers.  The Parliamentary Secretary will correct me, I am sure, if I am wrong, but I am told that there has been a decision to the effect that a solicitor in this country is empowered to hand in papers and make applications for patents.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That in the opinion of the Seanad the existing provision for the relief of unemployment is inadequate and the method of administering home assistance to the wives and families of the unemployed and those in distress calls for investigation without delay.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter to which I wish to draw the attention of the House is causing grave anxiety to people outside who are aware of the appalling conditions that exist in quarters where unemployment is most prevalent. People are asking how are the unemployed who are not entitled to unemployment benefit and who have no other means of livelihood existing. I am aware that there are to-day families of four or five children where the father is strong and <Col N="146" /> healthy and has been unemployed for a period of two years.  In such cases simply because the father is healthy, the poor law system, as it is at present being administered, deprives the wife and children of such a man of even one shilling home assistance.  If anybody thinks that I am exaggerating my case I will produce not one individual case, but hundreds of cases.  I could at the moment give hundreds of such cases to the House but that is not desirable.  If any person thinks I am exaggerating I will ask such person to-morrow morning, or any morning next week, to visit between 7 and 8 o'clock in the morning the convents in our city, notably the Gardiner Street Convent and the Harold's Cross Convent.  There women with large families, and who in some cases that were brought to my notice were expecting additions to their families, may be seen waiting in a queue to receive a free loaf and a can of tea from Sister Pauline. Sister Pauline is a good lady whom I have never met.  If Senators are not satisfied with what they will see at Gardiner Street Convent I will ask them to go to Harold's Cross.</P>
    <P>Can it be said that people who will wait in a queue for a free loaf to bring home to their children are undeserving? Has any Relieving Officer the right to say to these people: &ldquo;We have no means at our disposal to give you relief outside the workhouse?&rdquo;  Is it right or just in this Christian country that any public official should tell a poor person: &ldquo;Yourself and your husband and family can go into the workhouse and we will assist you there?&rdquo;  I am told that unfortunately the conditions inside the workhouse are not what they might be in this country.  Poor persons are appalled at the idea of going there and sooner than do so they will adopt any methods.</P>
    <P>I have known one case where an ex-member of the National Army, who spent five to six years in the <Col N="147" /> service, who is suffering from tuberculosis and who has four children to rear, was under notice to quit.  He buttoned up the collar of his coat and, in the hope that nobody would know him, he went to the outskirts of the City and tried to collect from door to door a sufficient amount to pay the landlord a little of the rent and so prevent an eviction.  It is many years ago since I heard the workhouse system condemned. We have ways and means of providing our own system now. I will say unhesitatingly that the conditions and the methods of dealing with the poor to-day in Dublin are worse than at any time heretofore. And what is it all about?  It is all about a wild clamour to reduce the rates.  Unfortunately I do not think that those who make that clamour know exactly what the result of the clamour is.  Reduce the rates!  When there is no other rate to be reduced, with a stroke of the pen the sum of 8d. in the £ is taken off the poor rate in the City of Dublin.  I wonder do those who make that reduction in the poor rate to please people who are probably struggling in business but who at least have three meals a day, know what the taking of the 8d. in the £ really means?  Do they know that it means semi-starvation for hundreds in the slums of Dublin?  The words are not mine.  I have a greater authority.  Some six weeks ago there was an outbreak of fever in Dublin, fortunately very mild. The Chief Medical Officer of Health in the City, Dr. Russell, issued a warning through the newspapers for the closing of the schools and, in an interview, he said that what was likely to encourage the spread of 'flu in the City of Dublin was the condition of the poor and their state of semi-starvation.  The words &ldquo;semi-starvation&rdquo; were used by Dr. Russell.  Shortly afterwards I read in the newspapers a report issued by those who are dealing with poor law relief.  Unfortunately I am not at the moment able to give the details of that report or of various cases because I have not just now <Col N="148" /> the originals or copies of statements that I sent to various Departments in the hope that something would be done to alleviate distress.  At the moment I am without actual details of cases.</P>
    <P>As regards the poor law system as it is to-day, I would ask Senators to visualise a map of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland.  Let them imagine a little dot upon what is known as the city of Dublin&mdash;not the outskirts, but the city proper between the old bridges.  That is the only spot on the map where home assistance is not administered as it should be, and where there are thousands of unemployed.  We are living in a Christian country, and yet we have those desperate conditions in our midst.  Are the comfortable classes going to stand over what is happening within a stone's throw of the principal thoroughfares of the city?  This morning I had the case of a young man 22 or 23 years of age. I questioned him with a view to getting relief for him in some way.  He told me he was married and had two children.  I asked him where he was living, and he said: &ldquo;Mr. Byrne, my wife is gone back to her mother and she brought one child, and I am going back to my mother and I am bringing the other child.  I would not apply to you for relief of any kind, or any assistance if it was not for the fact that my wife's father, who was helping to contribute to the support of the children, is now unemployed.&rdquo; I will give particulars of that case to any Senator who may like to investigate it.  That young wife, with her child, will go back to one room in a tenement and the young husband will go back with the second child to another room in another tenement.</P>
    <P>I do not want to arouse only sympathy or pity by putting these cases before you.  I would ask something more.  I would ask this House by resolution to demand that an investigation should take place.  I do not want that investigation to be held by those in charge of the administration of relief at present.  I <Col N="149" /> would ask that two or three members of this House, or two or three members of the Dáil, devote half an hour a day to the investigation of these cases and see for themselves whether there is any justification for my statement here.  I would be satisfied if that were done.  A good day's work would be done by doing that&mdash; good work for the country as well as for the unfortunate poor.  I cannot understand why Section 13 in full has not been put into operation in the City of Dublin.  Is the House aware that work that should be provided and food that should be given as a right to these people is now being given through a different channel, and that the thing has now got so bad that the St. Vincent de Paul Society and the Roomkeepers' Society reported that in the last month they had paid 29,000 visits to poor people?  Twenty-nine thousand people have been thrown on charitable institutions who, in my view, should be maintained by the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The St. Vincent de Paul Society has run out of funds, and I am aware that some Department&mdash;Poor Law Commissioners or the Local Government Department&mdash;and the St. Vincent de Paul Society, are working hand in hand, and that the St. Vincent de Paul Society have found themselves in such a position that they had to approach the authorities for funds to help them in their good work.  If these people are deserving of help from the Government, and if some public fund is helping a charitable institution to look after the poor, why not do it boldly?  There are men and women who are proud enough not to apply to a charitable institution for relief but who, if they thought they could get a 10/- or 12/6 ticket as a right from the State, would, under all the circumstances, but not of their own choice, accept that assistance if they got it.</P>
    <P>In another place I have been accused of exaggerating the conditions in Dublin and, in order to get away from that accusation, I would ask <Col N="150" /> two or three members of this House to kindly form a Committee and investigate the matter for themselves. There is no responsible Minister here. I am satisfied that the Minister and those in charge could give some apparently reasonable excuse for the delay.  To get back to a point to which I intended to refer in justification of my case, I should mention that the Inspector of Dispensaries made a report a month ago&mdash;as a result, I am satisfied, of pressure brought by members of the Dáil and Seanad who take an interest in the matter&mdash;to the effect that in four dispensary districts of one portion of Dublin exceptional circumstances existed which warranted an increase of £40 a week in one dispensary, £80 in another and between the four it amounted to £220 a week.  When I saw that I said: &ldquo;Thank God, an effort is going to be made to deal with the problem.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To my horror, however, I read ten days afterwards another report from the same authority and they proceeded to make provision in the coming year's estimate just the same as for the year gone out, but they did not mention one word about the officer's report ten days previously in which he said that exceptional circumstances existed warranting an extra expenditure of £200 a week. As I say, no provision has been made in the coming year for that extra expenditure.  If his report is true, and I am satisfied it is, and that exceptional circumstances do exist why do they not make that provision? Do they hope to get that £200 a week through some other channel or do they try to put their responsibility on to the charitable institutions and the public?  At this point I may observe that the country ought to be grateful for its charitable public in Dublin because there are many subscriptions going into those channels of which nobody is aware.  That should not be.  Messrs So-and-so or some kind individual should not be subscribing £10, £20, or £50 if his neighbour next door will subscribe nothing.  I say that his neighbour next door should be compelled to pay <Col N="151" /> to the poor rate and so spread the charge over the whole area.  I hope that the House will pass the motion. I regret that the Minister is not here to explain the position.  I am aware that the President, the Minister for Local Government and their officials have had frequent discussions on the matter and I am satisfied that their hands would be strengthened if the House passes this resolution.</P>

      <P>I join Senator Byrne in his expression of regret that there is no responsible Minister here to listen to the discussion on a subject of vital importance to the City of Dublin.  The Minister stated yesterday in the Dáil that in 1924 a sum of £127,000 had been spent on outdoor relief or home assistance, and that since then a considerable reduction has taken place year after year, so that in 1929 the sum estimated for is only £88,000.  That means that a saving, or rather what appears to be a saving, of £40,000 a year has been made by the Commissioners on this item of outdoor relief. That happens to be a large part of the £200 a week which the officer recommended should have been spent.  We have often accused the Ministry of reckless extravagance, but their attitude towards the poor of Dublin can be characterised by nothing else than reckless economy. No, we do not want to know the conditions of the poor of Dublin.  We know that they are starving, that they are naked.  We do not want to listen to them.  We do not want to hear about it.  It is hidden in the slums.  Ministers and politicians would be delighted that it should remain hidden for ever.  Why do I say that this saving on outdoor relief is reckless?  For this reason. The poor, perhaps, do not in every case actually die of starvation, but the poor children growing up, emaciated and weak, instead of being a charge for one year become a charge for the rest of their lives on the rates of the City of Dublin. <Col N="152" /> Senator Byrne is quite right in saying that the system of prison workhouses is not suitable for this country.  It was never an Irish institution.  It was an echo of an English system which at one time regarded poverty as something in the nature of a crime.  These workhouses were just as bad as jails, and they are so to-day.  They should never have been introduced into Ireland.  Now that we have some control in this country they should not be continued, and the system of home assistance should be encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that some relieving officers had been prosecuted and convicted of giving relief tickets in cases where relief was not necessary. Of course that was misconduct, but I see that last week relieving officers have been prosecuted for refusing to send on applications for outdoor relief.  They have been prosecuted and convicted by that very able lawyer, and just man, Mr. Collins, one of the magistrates of the city.  Now, that is misconduct.  The men who improperly gave tickets for relief were dismissed.  Will the men who improperly refused tickets for relief be dismissed?  No.  This is a small economy.  It is purchased by a tremendous lot of human suffering in the city of Dublin, and the Minister should be here in order to understand the full significance of it.  Let it be dinned into his ears.  I am sure he knows about it.  Many people know about it, but they do not like to hear about it. Perhaps that is the reason they are not here.  £40,000 is a very, very small item in the annual expenditure of this country.  We have got 53,000 people living on salaries derived from this little State.  The total amount of the salaries is 10½ million.  That is equal to the entire value of the cattle trade in Ireland.  That is the position, and notwithstanding that, in my judgment, this country is financially sound.  In my judgment, if the leaders of parties and members of the Executive Council would only face this question of unemployment and the condition of the poor, they <Col N="153" /> would find that there are resources in the country sufficient to start it on a career of prosperity.  We are in a splendid financial condition in one respect, because we are the only creditor country in Europe except, perhaps, the Scandinavian countries and Holland.</P>

What I do say is that the passing of a pious resolution of this kind, and allowing it to rest at that, is no relief to the poor.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is only fitting that Senators on these benches should have something to say in regard to this motion.  For a number of years, we have been trying by resolution and otherwise to impress upon the Government the urgent necessity of taking steps to deal with the deplorable situation that exists in this country, and more particularly in the City of Dublin, with regard to the evils arising out of unemployment. Senator Byrne has told us that he personally had dealt with a number of applicants who applied to him for some assistance. Senator Byrne is not alone in that respect.  I and every member of the Oireachtas, every person who could possibly come to the assistance of <Col N="154" /> any poor person, have been canvassed day and night for years.  At least I can say so, speaking for myself. For years I have been canvassed by poor men and women who were in a deplorable condition, to see if anything could be done to assist them.  With great regret on almost every occasion I have had to say to these people, particularly the unemployed: &ldquo;I am sorry, but I cannot do anything in the way of providing employment for you.&rdquo; We all know from our experience and from our efforts to secure employment, that it is impossible in present circumstances to provide employment for the number of people unemployed.  I am afraid a resolution of this nature does not meet the situation.  We have been continuously endeavouring, by persuasion and by demand, to show that the first duty of the State is to look after the welfare of its citizens.  We have asked that some effort should be made to provide some employment of a useful nature to the State for the people who are unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, personally, am not a believer in giving relief as we know it in this country to-day.  It is a most degrading system.  The system of poor law relief was foisted on this country for the purpose of pauperising the people.  It was foisted on the people by an alien government with the deliberate object of pauperising the people.  I am afraid the whole poor law system will have to be revolutionised before we can deal with the situation as it should be dealt with in this country.  Bad and all as the present system is, and God knows it is bad enough, we had an instance last week which showed that even under the deplorable system at present existing the relieving officers had to be brought before the District Magistrate to compel them to put into operation, at least, the miserable regulations that are provided under the present system.  The magistrate had no option in the cases before him but to convict.  The people who were defending them ran away from it, because they were afraid to face the facts.  I was amazed when I read in the morning paper that the Minister <Col N="155" /> for Local Government had again made a statement, repeatedly made with regard to the unemployment figures in this city.</P>
    <P>We have endeavoured on many occasions to bring home as forcibly as we could the position facing the Government, because we realise the danger of the position more than the Government does.  The hungry man with a wife and children dependent on him cannot be expected to observe the laws that deny to him the right that God gave him to provide for his family.  You are taxing these people too much by asking them to submit so long to this starvation.  I have said before, and I repeat it, that people in authority and people of affluence and wealth imagine that the poor and the unemployed have not the same love for their own flesh and blood and their little children as the wealthy people, that they have not the same desire to provide food and nourishment for them.  Under our present system it is denied to them.  An unemployed man in Dublin, with a wife and family, is denied the assistance that God ordained he should have.  We are living in a Christian country.  Still there is nothing for these people but to beg from door to door or go to some charitable institution.  The charitable institutions in Dublin are not able to meet the demands made upon them, and have not been for a number of years.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a deliberate statement, on figures supplied to him, no doubt, that in February of this year the total number of unemployed in Dublin was 6,922, and that from 6th April, 1926, there had been a reduction from 7,392.  That is juggling with figures in a most disgraceful way.  It is juggling with figures in order to deny the right of livelihood to human beings.  Everyone knows that the labour exchange returns are no criterion as to the number of unemployed in the city.  We have repeatedly pointed out that the only people who register in the labour exchanges are those in receipt of unemployed benefit and that the ordinary <Col N="156" /> unemployed man, when his benefit is run out, does not go to the trouble of registering further, for it is useless to do so.  If a job is offered in the labour exchange to any man or woman, it is offered to a person who is drawing benefit, so as to get that person off the pay sheet.  Therefore, the unfortunate man whose benefit may have ceased for years does not register, as it is not worth his while.  It is labour in vain for him to register every week as being unemployed, as there is no hope of getting employment.  I have no hesitation in saying, from the knowledge I have of labour conditions in Dublin, and I think I have as much knowledge as any member of the Oireachtas, that the figures given by the Minister as to the number of unemployed could be increased by 200 per cent., and even then you would not reach the total number of unemployed in Dublin.  I think it is disgraceful for the sake of policy, or to try and score a point, to put forward such figures when we are dealing with such a terrible problem.  The Poor Law Commission held a great number of sittings, and people who were well versed in poor law administration made a report some years ago, but no effort has been made to give effect to the recommendations. The proper way to tackle this question is to introduce a measure that will deal with the whole question of relief.  I said before that I am not in favour of this system of relief, but if you do not provide work for these people you cannot let them starve&mdash; it is the only alternative if you do not provide them with employment.</P>
    <P>The present appalling system is an outrage on civilisation.  Holy Writ says: &ldquo;Those whom God had joined together, let no man put asunder.&rdquo; If an old man and woman in Dublin are destitute and they go to that wonderful institution, the union, and do happen to be admitted, the old man is sent to one prison block and his poor old wife to another.  That is our Christianity, our civilisation, in this Catholic city of Dublin.  Then we read of those wonderful people who are reducing the rates at the expense of the unfortunate poor. <Col N="157" /> Our newspapers are pouring out columns every day in praise of the people who are reducing the rates at the expense of the stomachs of the little children of the unemployed poor.  I feel so savage about this question that I hardly like to talk about it.  I know unfortunate unemployed people in this country who are so proud that they would rather die in their little rooms than apply even to a charitable association for relief.  When I think of the appalling conditions under which they live, it is extraordinary to me that they have remained quiet so long.  This resolution will no doubt be passed, but probably no attention will be paid to it.  I say quite frankly that the sooner the people in authority recognise the present position and take steps to deal with it the better it will be for all concerned, because it is taxing humanity too much to expect these people to continue under the present conditions, and the sooner that some practical steps are taken to deal with this awful situation the better it will be for all concerned.</P>

      <P>There is little to add to the statements made as to the appalling distress in Dublin. Everybody who lives in Dublin must know it.  There is little use in the invitation given to people to come and see the distress.  Anybody who has a doorway of any kind knows what the distress in Dublin is.  The distress is there and people are dying of hunger.  Many would have died, if it were not for the charitable societies.  Everybody realises that who takes any interest in the matter.  One remark of Senator Byrne's really is the cause of my intervention.  He said that relieving officers say to the starving people that the only thing they can do for them is to admit them to the workhouse.  Institutional treatment is the most expensive form of relief and the most uneconomic method of dealing with it, whether the institution be an industrial school, a workhouse, or any other institution of the kind. <Col N="158" /> The money expended per capita is much greater than would be required to keep these people in their homes.  I hope that that attitude of the relieving officers will be stopped at once by public opinion, if by no other means.  It is a disgraceful thing to say to people, just because the poor law system is the same in Dublin as it was before the Treaty. There was no amalgamation scheme in Dublin, and the union went on as it was before, because it was too big an institution to touch.  The Poor Law Commission dealt with the Dublin side of the relief question, but nothing has been done, and I think that until the Poor Law Commission's report is tackled it will be very difficult to deal with the appalling distress that prevails in this old City of Dublin, where the rooms and kitchens of the old Georgian mansions are filled with starving people.  Everybody who is interested in the poor knows that. I, unfortunately, know perhaps more than many people, for a great number of the poor and afflicted come to me believing that I am one of the Union Commissioners, as a lady of the same name is one of the Commissioners.</P>

      <P>Many years ago, when I was young, shortly after the famine, the towns in Ireland were filled with half starving people who had just been saved from famine. We passed through many bad years since that, through the days of the Land League troubles, and others, that possibly were as bad.  I do not think that we have ever passed through years as bad as the few last years in this country.  During those years exactly the same statements were made here as were made in the past in Westminster.  Ministers were never able to believe that the people were starving because they, themselves, were so far away from the scene.  Now that Ministers are actually here they make exactly the same statements as were made by Ministers in Westminster twenty, thirty or forty years ago.  I read in the papers the other day&mdash;I do not <Col N="159" /> know whether it was correct or not&mdash; that a Minister was asked about the state of affairs existing and why it was not provided against, and his answer was to ask in return where is the money to come from?  The money ought to come from somewhere.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to say that this matter was only brought to the surface by a charitable lady, Miss Harrison, who went to the expense and annoyance of taking an action against the authorities themselves.  She fought that action out to success and for that she deserves a great deal of thanks from the people of this country.</P>

I am in entire sympathy with him and I think we should approach this matter as sympathetically and as constructively as possible.  I am endeavouring, in my humble way, to find employment for the people living in the back lanes of this city near where I live.  I know some of their poverty and their difficulties and it makes one's heart ache to realise the position in which many of these people are placed through no fault of their own.  I should like that we should approach this question in the spirit in which it was approached by Senator Farren in his statement rather than in the spirit in which it was approached by Senator Comyn.  I do not think that we should fashion whips to flog any political party for our own purposes. We ought to approach it sympathetically and constructively rather than in any other spirit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Byrne asked us to investigate these matters.  Let us have an investigation from top to bottom and have something done and not merely pass a resolution upon the subject and leave it there.  This thing will lead nowhere.  Either we are in earnest about this matter or not.  Senator Byrne wants an investigation and I certainly favour investigation, but let there be no inferential official indictment at the <Col N="160" /> beginning.  Let us rather accept this as a question to be analysed and investigated. I would suggest that Deputy Byrne's motion should read: &ldquo;That in the opinion of the Seanad the method of administering home assistance in the City of Dublin to the wives and families of the unemployed and those in distress calls for investigation.&rdquo;  If Senator Byrne accepts that it will receive my support. I do not think there is any occasion to indict anybody.  I wish this matter was no longer debated until we had an opportunity of hearing the Minister.  I should like that Senator Byrne would accept my suggestion rather than insisting upon the resolution as it now stands being passed by the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I think there is a point in this matter in explanation of the absence of anybody who can state the case for the authorities, whoever they may be, responsible for the method of administration in the City of Dublin.  As we know, there have been Commissioners appointed to take the place of a public representative body, and, with too much nearly to unanimity, representatives, I think, both in the Seanad and in the Dáil, and certainly public opinion as expressed by editorials in the newspapers, have commended that system.  I do not want to subject myself to the charge that I am trying to make political capital out of this, but it is a matter that comes pretty near to the root of this question of administration. There is no responsible body; that is to say, the Commissioners are not responsible to any public in regard to the method of administration. They are not subject to any criticism by people who can command information.</P>

    <P>I enquired through a member of the Dáil, officially and formally, for certain information regarding the statistics of relief applications to the Dublin Union, and the Minister, following a consistent policy, referred the Deputy who put the question, on my behalf, to the Union Commissioners.  Now no member of the Dáil has a right to call for information <Col N="161" /> and returns from the Commissioners.  Therefore there is no justification for any member writing to the Commissioners demanding an explanation.  The Minister, therefore, does not hold himself responsible for the action of the Commissioners of the Dublin Union, any more than he holds himself responsible for the action of the Commissioners in any local administration, and that is the explanation why the Minister is not here.  He cannot answer for the method of administration.  What then is our position?  We can criticise and express views which possibly may be read, by people concerned, in the official reports when they get them in a week's time.  But the very fact that the Minister is not here, and that the Minister is not responsible, even if he were here, and presumably cannot answer with authority even if he desired to do so, suggests to me, if the Seanad is interested, as quite apparently it is interested seriously in this question, whether there is not some way by which the Seanad could not conduct this investigation.</P>
    <P>We may not have executive power to call for the production of information. I am not so sure what the powers of a Committee duly appointed by the Seanad may be, but it seems to me to be a case here in the absence of governmental responsibility, in the absence of a Minister who will justify the administration of the Commissioners appointed by him, that it is a responsibility that seems to be thrown upon the Seanad to do something to find an answer to its own criticisms.  I suggest that no decision should be taken upon this motion to-day and that some consideration should be given to the question whether the Seanad itself could not appoint a committee of its own members to make this investigation.  On the question of the Commissioners and their position a good deal of criticism has been levelled against them as to their method of administering relief.</P>
    <P>There is a certain legal problem involved. <Col N="162" /> We read in the newspapers, I think yesterday, figures showing a very considerable increase in the amount of outdoor relief given this year as compared with a year ago. That was intended to be an answer to some of the criticisms.  Senator Farren referred to certain governmental returns regarding the number of unemployed, and on the unemployment side Ministers tell us that there has been a decrease in the number of registered unemployed between the months of last year and the equivalent months of this year.  So that we have two sets of figures that quite clearly call for some explanation, a considerable increase in the amount of money given in outdoor relief by the Union Commissioners in answer to criticism and, in respect of the figures for unemployment a considerable decline in the number of unemployed.  Obviously there is some contradiction there, unless one can assume that there has been a great increase in the amount of charitable funds distributed, or alternatively, a great increase in the amount of suffering and distress.  The latter is probably the true explanation.  It is unquestionably true to anybody who observes that the figures of registered unemployed are not even an index to the state of unemployment in the city or in the country.  They are an index to the period of the unemployment experienced by the applicants, and not much more than that.</P>
    <P>However, I think no one would deny, who is in the slightest degree acquainted with the conditions, that there are far more than 7,000 unemployed persons, men and women, in Dublin and district.  This is the serious part of what I have to say. Confessedly the public policy at the moment and for the last year, too, has been based upon these figures of unemployment.  The public policy in regard to relief, in regard to the extension of unemployment benefit, and in regard to the provision of public work to relieve unemployment, is based upon the figures supplied by departmental statistics of the unemployment register.  If these are not reliable as a basis for building <Col N="163" /> a policy, surely some other method must be found on which to decide the course a Government should take.</P>
    <P>I do not want to touch upon the difficult and delicate question of the methods of administration of outdoor relief and the present legal obligation upon the Guardians or Commissioners to fill the workhouses before they allow able-bodied persons outdoor relief.  That has been the law for a number of years.  The problem has been before the Government all these years.  Many temporary Acts have been passed, and surely it is possible, even now, pending the bringing of the Dublin and district poor relief and home assistance code into harmony with all the rest of the country, that these provisions prohibiting the giving of outdoor relief to able-bodied persons should be cancelled and that the relieving officers should be given the power, without any question of a breach of law, to give assistance, and not merely that they should be given power, but that the obligation should be placed upon them to give assistance to the poor provided there is no employment available.  I have no clearly-defined views as to the method that should be ultimately adopted, but for the present I would suggest that no decision be taken upon this motion, that its consideration be deferred, and that in the meantime we should try to devise a form in which the Seanad itself would set up a committee to investigate this particular problem and report <Col N="164" /> to the Seanad.  That may be the means of securing that something shall be done.</P>
