      <P>I move:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  The Title of the Bill sets out:</P>
      <P>Whereas the Buncrana Harbour Order, 1929, set out in the Schedule to this Act, has been duly made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the General Pier and Harbour Act, 1861, and the General Pier and Harbour Act, 1861, Amendment Act, as adapted by the Adaptation of Enactments Act, 1922 (No. 2 of 1922):</P>
      <P>And whereas under the provisions of the said Acts the said Order is of no validity or force whatever unless and until confirmed by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The Order that you are asked to confirm is an Order for the appointing and incorporating of Commissioners for the Harbour of Buncrana, in the County of Donegal, and vesting the pier and harbour in them, and for the construction of works and the improvement, maintenance and regulation of the harbour.</P>

      <P>No, but I should like to know why we are summoned particularly about one harbour when there are other harbours which do not seem to be getting the attention that they deserve.</P>

      <P>A discussion on the Second Reading is really out of order unless the Senator desires to oppose the Bill, but, under the circumstances, <Col N="1546" /> as the Minister is here, I should be glad if he would answer the Senator's question.</P>

      <P>The reason is that this is one of the most important fishing harbours that we have and it is in an extremely bad condition at the moment.  Money that might be saved to the country is being lost by reason of the fact that boats have to go elsewhere.  There is a further reason why we think that this harbour should have exceptional treatment.  There is an old commitment&mdash;that a fixed sum of money should be given to this harbour from the Development Fund.  That commitment was entered into before the war came on, and that fact, with the changed conditions, had to be taken into consideration.  A special case was made by the people concerned for the Buncrana Harbour, and departmentally we are very definitely of the opinion that there is considerable urgency about the matter.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Standing Orders having been suspended, the Bill was put through its remaining stages, without discussion, and passed.</P>

      <P>Before the Seanad adjourns, I should like to take this opportunity to give another warning with regard to a further section of the Shannon transmission line which is about to be put into operation. Previously, I gave a warning against any interference with the transmission lines, and pointed out that enamel plates were attached to the posts warning people to that effect.  On another occasion, when Loop 4, as we call it&mdash;the loop which runs approximately through the south-eastern portion of the country&mdash;was being made live, I took the opportunity in the Dáil of giving what I then described as a deliberate and solemn warning that power was to be transmitted over that area.  I then said: &ldquo;I wish it to be <Col N="1547" /> known to everybody that, while there is absolutely no danger from the transmission system if left alone, any interference with the lines that are live means almost certain death.&rdquo;  The new line about to be electrified is Loop 1, and its course will be: Ardnacrusha-Tipperary - Clonmel - Waterford - Dungarvan - Youghal - Cork - Mallow - Killarney - Tralee - Listowel - Ardnacrusha.  That line is about to be electrified, and I again wish to issue in the most solemn way a warning that interference with this line at this moment and from this on <Col N="1548" /> means almost certain death.  I should like to get the benefit of publicity for that statement.</P>

      <P>Before adjourning, I should like to point out that the Dáil does not meet until the 23rd October, and it appears unlikely that we shall have any necessity for meeting until that date at earliest. Probably the actual date will be somewhat later.  I now adjourn the House <i>sine die.</i></P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 3.12 p.m.</P>
