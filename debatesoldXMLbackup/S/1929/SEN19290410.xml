      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose this Bill, and in doing so I want to go into some details and to analyse the increased powers which the Bank of Ireland are seeking.  I feel that on this question of banking it is inopportune to introduce any new legislation at the moment, or to extend the powers of any existing banking institution.  Many of us feel that the whole banking position is one that is giving grave cause for anxiety from the social and the economic points of view.  We feel, in short, that the existing system, as it is operating in Ireland at present, is in no way meeting the economic needs of this country, is not attuned to the needs of the Government of the country, or of the industrialists, or of the agriculturalists. Comparatively recently we had a Banking Commission which outlined various proposals, some of which were carried through, but we find that the banking system, as operating to-day, is, in the main, the same as it was before the Banking Commission sat.  I think it is not unfair to say that in the main the Banking Commission was more <Col N="2" /> a bankers' Commission than a Commission on banking, and that if this country is to progress, if the wealth of the country in the form of credit and money, which is largely concentrated in the hands of the group of bankers who are operating here, is to be fully utilised, very drastic changes indeed will be necessary to make credit more readily available, to control the resources of the country at present held by the bankers, or at least, to have a supervisory guidance in what they are doing, or in what they are going to do with these resources in the shape of credits, lodgments, etc., in their hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all fully appreciate the delicacy of the banking machine; we all realise that it is a delicate instrument, where anything in the nature of drastic changes and anything in the nature of a revolutionary attitude on finance might cause temporary disabilities in the economic order of things.  But we also appreciate, and perhaps even more fully, the undeveloped nature of this country, the paradoxical position in which we find ourselves, with tremendous resources held by the bankers, and the comparative difficulty, if not the great difficulty, of securing the necessary credits to carry out the drastic economic and social reforms that are necessary for the progress of the country.  I feel that in viewing the economic aspect <Col N="3" /> of things in Ireland we have got to keep two points of view in mind.  I yield to nobody in my desire to see industry on a properly organised basis, with efficiency and with proper administration; but I also claim that there is another aspect to-day, an aspect which is affecting the present Government and that will affect all future Governments, and it is the fundamental duty of the Government to see that that aspect is properly dealt with.  I speak of the position as regards human life, happiness, and such control exercised over the resources and the material wealth of the country as will enable the people to exist and to develop according to the natural resources at their disposal. Our natural resources are not infinite, but they are very considerable, and a tremendous amount of work lies at hand to be done with them.  I claim that a great deal of that work is held up owing to the difficulty of finance&mdash;housing, business generally, the development of industry, even the work of government itself.  We are faced with the extreme position that we have resources available, used by the banking machinery to establish credit in foreign countries&mdash;in England, in America, and anywhere else where facilities exist for investing capital, while at the same time the Minister for Finance, and any Minister for Finance who will follow him, is faced with the prospect of having to pay very dearly for any money which is required for national development.</P>
    <P>Now, I submit that that is a very important factor in the life of the community.  It is at the root of most of our social and economic difficulties and grievances, and if we view banking institutions and other enterprises mainly of an industrial nature purely from the profit-making point of view, I claim that we are not going to progress in life, in civilisation or in commercial activities.  I do not propose at present to go into all the economic arguments that I might use as a result of experience in highly industrialised countries; I want to keep as far as possible to the purely <Col N="4" /> banking situation and to deal with that.  I do not propose to enunciate any dogmatic theory as regards what we ought to do with our banks, but I do argue, and I hope that I will have the majority of the House with me, that the present system, whereby we export anything from £150,000,000 to £170,000,000 of our available resources, while the country is starved for national development and for credit, is far from satisfactory. Money, like any other commodity, ought to be, to some degree at least, subject to market conditions, and it is absurd for us to have to pay the exorbitant rate of interest at present being charged by the Irish banks, whilst there is so much money in reserve in the hands of the bankers. I hold that the supply of money that is in the hands of the bankers properly belongs to the credit of the community, and as such ought to be made reasonably available for the people who are trying to live in this country.</P>
    <P>It can be argued, and no doubt it will be, that a banker's function is to take every possible care of the money and resources placed in his charge by his customers.  That is so. We all know that banks have to maintain large reserves of fluid capital to meet any calls that may be made on them.  But I think if we examine carefully the balance sheets of the various banking institutions in Ireland we will see that they are very far away indeed from the possibility of any risks, that the proportion of the exported capital to what is readily available in Ireland is very large, that it is, in fact, out of all proportion to what they need to export, and that it is out of all proportion to what we can afford to export.</P>
    <P>Another aspect that will probably be urged is that bankers must find a field of investment with security and with profits.  That is perfectly reasonable.  But I want it explained to me, if anybody can do so, why we have to float portion of our Irish loans in London or in New York at, say, 5 per cent. on an issue at 97, whilst we have these resources available, <Col N="5" /> and whilst keeping in mind, mark you, at the same time the very substantial profits and reserves which these banks have accumulated. In other words, in my opinion, bankers have got to face whether they are part of the Irish nation, of Irish machinery and of Irish life, and if they are going to attune themselves to the necessities of this country, or are going to be simply vultures in their attitude, out to make money at any cost, irrespective of the Government's needs or of the economic needs of the industrial or agricultural communities.</P>
    <P>I would direct your attention to one or two figures which epitomise the position as regards the banks.  I find on analysing their last balance sheets that the total paid-up capital of the ten banks&mdash;remember, I am dealing at present with all the banks in Ireland&mdash;amounts to £8,762,000. The reserves that they have accumulated and their carry-forward, as disclosed in the same balance sheets, amount to £10,042,000.  The net profits for the period of twelve months, taking their last two balance sheets, amount to £1,861,000.  The dividends paid last year for the twelve months amount to £1,109,148. In other words, the total net profits, after allowing for the carry-forward and reserves&mdash;their open reserves at all events, and, I presume, quite a considerable amount of hidden reserves&mdash;on the year's working amounted to 21 per cent.; the dividends paid averaged slightly over 13 per cent., and I presume the other 8 per cent. approximately went as an addition to their reserves.  This certainly seems to be the one industry in Ireland that requires no protection whatever, and it would also seem to be the one industry that has maintained its export trade, two positions which would be very desirable in every industry but banking, and which are very undesirable indeed in banking, in my opinion.</P>
    <P>To come to the Bill itself, I do not know if there is any immediate worry or anxiety on the part of the directors of the Bank of Ireland to get the additional powers that they are seeking in this Bill.  It can be <Col N="6" /> argued that the powers that are sought would be available to them if they were a limited liability company, but they are not.  They have their own charters, dating back to 1782.  These charters are very difficult indeed to analyse, and I think we would require almost expert legal advice to guide us on them. But there are certain obvious things which stand out, and these I propose to deal with as briefly as possible. In Section 2, paragraph (a), power is sought to reduce or to increase the number of directors.  That is a perfectly reasonable proposition, not only for the Bank of Ireland, but for any ordinary trading company. It might be desirable at any time to increase your board, and it might be desirable to get a particular man to join your board.  But there is one thing that I think ought to be laid down, not only as far as the Bank of Ireland or any other bank is concerned, but as far as every company here is concerned, and that is that we ought not to have any alien sitting on any board of control here.  I submit that that is dangerous from the national point of view, and in view of our weak economic position. I hesitate very much to refer to something that was done very recently as regards the Board of the Bank of Ireland.  I do not know why it was done, but certainly I take as an insult to all decent national opinion in this country the action of the Bank of Ireland recently in appointing as one of their new directors a gentleman who is well known to our people in the North of Ireland, Sir George S. Clark.  I do not hesitate to name him when I have referred to him at all.  His record in his anti-Irishism, in his opposition to everything decent, in his antagonism to all things that would make for the national good, to go into these matters only, without going into the worst phases of his actions in Belfast, was enough to make one man &mdash;myself&mdash;feel outraged when this man was foisted on the people of Ireland as one of the directors of the Bank of Ireland.  Possibly there was a certain reason for this step.</P>
    <P>Considerable litigation has been <Col N="7" /> going on with regard to Messrs. Workman and Clark and the North-umberland Shipping Company.  I do not mention this with any particular bias, but I do feel concerned about it, and I do say that, in my opinion, it is wrong and is a dangerous principle to allow any alien or any individual who is not a citizen of the Saorstát to sit on a board here.  That may be a wrong view-point, but it is mine.  I feel that if industry is going to be built up on decent lines we must have people of the right way of thinking, people who are genuinely Irish in their outlook.  I hold it is dangerous to bring in an alien for such important positions, and particularly for the board of such an important bank.  Section 3, sub-section (2), deals with additional capital stock.  Here again I feel that if it is practicable&mdash;I am not going to urge this very vehemently, because I can see various aspects and difficulties&mdash;to have a majority percentage of the shares of Saorstát companies and of Irish banks held by citizens of the Saorstát, that should be done, and I hope to see sooner or later&mdash;it was one of my reasons for opposition to this Bill&mdash; certain legislation introduced which will protect its industries and not merely make them branch-agency houses for every big combine, both in England and in America.  If possible, the majority of the shares ought to be held by citizens of An Saorstát.  If that is not possible I want to hear why it is not.  In the flotation of companies, whether in the case of a credit corporation or anything else, the Irish people ought to have the option and ought to be forced, if possible, to put their money into them.</P>
    <P>Take Section 5, paragraph (c)&mdash;I am now coming to the important things that, to my mind, are a grave potential danger in this Bill&mdash;it enables the Bank to acquire the whole or any part of the banking business within or outside An Saorstát. That is asking for very considerable powers indeed, and whilst it may mean nothing, it will give them power to do anything.  We <Col N="8" /> cannot afford to risk giving these powers, to leave the country open to various mergers, amalgamations, or anything else which would be prejudicial to the business and the agricultural communities, and which might be very prejudicial even to the Government itself.  That may not be the intention, but the Bill contains inherently in it power to form an amalgamation or a ring of bankers within the country, or to have a fusion of three or four banks, which would make it impossible for people to negotiate business at all, and, as I say, might make it impossible for the Government to negotiate financial measures.  That is a power that I hold we should not give, and I strongly appeal to the House not to give it.  Paragraph (f) of the same section seems to suggest that arrangements could be made of a similar nature on a selling basis; in other words, that on certain terms and conditions the Bank of Ireland, the largest bank in the country, could be merged either with one of the large London rings of banks or with one of the American rings.  No doubt, such a thing is not contemplated, but queer things come to pass, and let us remember that at present the whole tendency of the banking machinery of the world is to consolidate and to form itself into such a consolidated force that it would become the dictator of financial policy everywhere. That has happened; do not forget that it has happened in various so-called free countries in America that are at present owned by American bankers, who dictate not only what is to be done with the money but who dictate to the United States Government what military and naval action they shall take in those countries.  Such a situation is in existence to-day, and that is a position we cannot contemplate with equanimity.  We must not give anybody the power to sell a banking institution.</P>
    <P>Again, it may be argued that if the Bank of Ireland were a limited liability company, as some of the other banks are, it would have this power.  Allowing that that is so, that is a power that we must at the <Col N="9" /> first opportunity take from them, and we must not be in the paradoxical position of having passed a Bill like this, or having admitted that a Bill like this was desirable, or could be tolerated in the case of the Bank of Ireland, and then, eighteen months hence, come along with legislation upsetting what we had done.  I hold that the danger of foreign capital is inherent in that clause, and I hope that the House will have sense enough to see the grave risk that is involved in it.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (p) deals with bullion. Bullion, of course, and the freedom to operate in bullion, is essential to the banks, but it is a privilege or a power that should be carefully watched.  At the moment I do not know how we stand as regards bullion and reserves of bullion.  If, as I presume, our reserves, including bullion, are in the hands of English bankers in the Bank of England or elsewhere, I submit that the matter requires very grave consideration. After all, a crisis might develop in England, and the only security we have is to have reserves of bullion under our own control.  That may be the case, but I do not think it is.  I think that any powers that are granted to bankers in Ireland in regard to the control of bullion ought to be exercised under the direct guidance of the Minister for Finance of the time, and that the country ought to concentrate upon having control of its own reserves in that form.  This to some extent has been covered by the Currency Commission.  I suggest that the position is due for review, that it requires review, and that a very definite safeguarding attitude should be taken up by all people, irrespective of Party, on this issue. We have various other anomalies in Free State banking which do not directly apply on this Bank of Ireland Bill, but which it may not be any harm to mention.  We have banks operating here with headquarters in Northern Ireland and in London.  I think that is an anomalous position and that it should be looked into.</P>
    <P>We know, for instance, that the Ulster Bank has more branches in the <Col N="10" /> Twenty-six Counties than it has in the Six Counties.  We know that most industrial developments in Belfast were financed by resources accumulated in the agricultural districts throughout the country, which means of course that a very considerable amount of their strength was derived from what was known in the North in my time as &ldquo;the South and West.&rdquo; I do not know that we want to adopt a very harsh attitude on that.  We have various issues to face in the North eventually, and I hope soon, and we do not want to make trade, banking, or any other line that forms a link between the North-East and this part of the world, any more difficult than at present, but I suggest, in view of the attitude that has been taken up in the North-East, that we ought seriously to consider what we are going to do about the control of the operations of these banks throughout the country, and also what we are going to do about the note issue which has already been divided between some of these banks.  Speaking of note issue, we have to remember that the Bank of Ireland and all the other banks derive very considerable profit from the handling of the note issue.  I do not know if that is the only way to do it or not, but it seems to me that in our present rather struggling condition we are handing away a considerable amount of the profits on the note issue that could be acquired by the State.  That may be wrong. I do not think it is, and I would like to hear arguments against it.  These are some views, not only of myself personally, but, I feel, of the Party I represent.  Apart from Party, I hope that will be the attitude of all sane, intelligent people who are interested in safeguarding our very vital industry of banking.  It is a matter that is going to affect everything in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I hold that money ought to be cheaper in Ireland, and that it can be made cheaper.  I hold that it is an absurdity for the Government of this country to have to go begging and seeking loans outside the country, irrespective of whatever Ministry is in power, while we have these <Col N="11" /> enormous reserves at the disposal of our banks.  The bankers may say: &ldquo;We have subscribed liberally to the National Loan; we are willing to give all facilities possible to the Government, and to everyone else that wants them within certain limits.&rdquo; Now, I submit that they are not doing that, and have not done it, because we must remember that the banking institutions, as much as any other institution or any individuals in the country, must be subject to the laws of the State, and their security as a whole is bound up with the security of the State.  If the State is insecure then the banker is insecure. If the State is secure then the banker can have no better security than the whole State to guarantee his loans.  For these reasons I move that the Bill as it stands be rejected, and I hope the majority of those present will see eye to eye with me and reject the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. Bagwell Mr. Bagwell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that a continuance of this debate is likely to serve no really useful purpose.  This Bill is a Private Bill and it is certified that the Standing Orders have been complied with or it would not be before us.  The proper and the most convenient procedure for dealing with a Private Bill, especially a Private Bill of this character, is that it should be referred, as is the proper and regular practice, to a Select Committee, where these things can be threshed out, and the merits and demerits of the Bill thoroughly investigated. It would be explained there by counsel.  It cannot be explained by counsel here.  Here it can only be explained by people who have special knowledge of a highly technical question, and some of them are interested parties.  Members of this House are interested parties, and if they are forced into the position of having to explain the Bill I do not think that would be a right position for them to be placed in. That is shown by the fact that they are not competent to sit on this Select Committee, showing that as a result of experience it is much better the thing should be done in another <Col N="12" /> way, that is, by a committee composed of disinterested people, and that the purport of the Bill should be explained to them by counsel.  If we debate it here we shall get ourselves into a very technical discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the motion. I am prepared to move that the Bill should be referred to a Select Committee. I am not sure whether I am the right person to do that or not, but it is the usual practice.  It is a technical Bill and, not being a person with technical banking experience, I am not going to attempt to refer to what is in it, any more than to say that all that is sought is to give the same powers and the same facilities for the conduct of business to the Bank of Ireland that are now possessed by other Irish banks. That is all that is sought, and no more.  I think that what the Bank asks for is only perfectly reasonable and in the interests not only of the Bank of Ireland, but of the public, because if the Bank of Ireland are not given the same facilities in the conduct of their business that the other banks have, then they cannot serve their customers as well as they would be able to do if the Bill were passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One question which Senator Connolly raised I feel I should say something about.  The Senator referred to Sir George Clark's appointment as a director.  I have nothing to do with the Bank of Ireland, or with any other bank.  Sir George Clark was a director of a company in the service of which I was for a number of years, and he was my chairman for some of those years.  The real point is whether he is a useful director, and I suggest the shareholders of the Bank are entitled to decide, and are the most competent people to decide that.  I am quite certain that they did not appoint Sir George Clark because he had in time past held certain political views, but because they thought he would be useful to them in their business.  Sir <Col N="13" /> George Clark has not been, to my knowledge, what anyone would call an active politician for a long time.</P>

      <P>He is primarily a good man of business.  He is entitled to his political opinions, but I am quite certain he is enough man of business not to allow his political views to interfere in any way with the discharge of his duties as a director. He will only do what he considers best for the concern of which he is a director.  I think, as I said, if we continue this debate we shall get involved in highly technical arguments which we really are not competent to deal with.  I think it would be much better that there should be a full examination of the Bill, and that that should be done in Committee, as is the case with other Private Bills.  I am prepared to move that the Bill should be referred to a Select Committee.</P>

      <P>I cannot take that motion.  The Bill has first to pass the Second Reading.  It may be defeated on that stage.  If it passes the Second Stage such a motion will be in order, but not at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be a mistake to reject the Second Reading of the Bill.  I am not advocating its final passage, but every point that Senator Connolly has made has been purely a Committee point.  He dealt, in so far as his speech referred to the Bill, with specific points, each of which are definitely matters for consideration by a Committee.  I think it would be unwise to prevent this stage of this Bill being passed because there are defects in the banking system generally, even grave defects.  I take it that this Bill is intended as a serious measure, that those responsible for it have gone to considerable expense in its preparation, and if the objections of the Senator are confined to the matters to which he made specific allusion, I think we should a least have an investigation as to whether or not those objections can be overcome in Committee <Col N="14" /> before we decide to reject it. I urge, therefore, that the Senator who moved its rejection should not press that, but should allow the Bill to go through its Second Reading so that we might then investigate how far his objections to the banking system generally find a basis for continued objection to this Bill.  It may be that upon consideration on the Committee Stage we may find that this Bill will in no way, if passed, stabilise these existing defects, but that the passing of the Bill may be of some convenience to those concerned. I think we ought at least subject it to the analysis of the Committee Stage before making up our minds either finally to pass it or to reject it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WalterNugentBart" hpid="Sir Walter Nugent Sir Walter Nugent">
      <NameTxt>Sir Walter Nugent</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened very attentively to Senator Connolly's speech.  He gave us a long review of banking in Ireland generally. It seems to me that he had very little to say to the Bill before the House.  We thought the Bill was an extremely simple Bill, so simple that it was hardly worth introducing. All we ask the Seanad to do is to amend the old charter of the Bank of Ireland, and to bring it up-to-date, so as to put the Bank of Ireland in the same position as all the other banks.  Does anyone really object to that?  Certainly Senator Connolly did not say that he did. He attacked the banking system generally, and made a speech that would require very careful answering, but he did not suggest that the Bank of Ireland should not be placed on the same footing as the other banks.  He carefully avoided that.  He did refer to one or two matters that were peculiar to the Bank of Ireland.  He referred to the question of the co-option of a director. When Senator Connolly made his first speech in this House I was charmed with the way he opened, and with the references he made to what his attitude was, and what the attitude of the Seanad should be. He said: &ldquo;Let us forget everything that anyone has done in the past; let the past be wiped out, and let us deal only with the present.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in somewhat of a dilemma with regard to the Second Reading of the Bill.  It is put forward as a Private Bill and no doubt technically it is a Private Bill, but it has very public implications, <Col N="16" /> and it seems to me that one ought to treat a Bill with so many public results dependent upon it more as a Public Bill than a Private Bill at this stage, and that there ought to be from the promoters, or from some spokesman, an explanation of the purport and intentions of the Bill, such as is given on the Second Reading of a Public Bill. Senator Sir Walter Nugent and also Senator Bagwell stated that the purpose of the Bill is to put the Bank of Ireland in identically the same position as all the other private banks.  That is a defence of the Bill and no doubt that will be the result of the Bill.  But there arises in my mind a considerable number of questions as to what is the present position of the Bank of Ireland under its charter, and under various enactments passed in respect of that Bank, to the Government, to the Bank of England, and to the other banks in this country.  To the man in the street who is not technically familiar with the operation of the banking system, it would seem that the Bank of Ireland is in a somewhat privileged position as regards the Government, and in relation to the other banks.  If that is so, then it seem to me that the Bank wants to retain a privileged position, while, at the same time, having the same freedom as the private banks, and I would like, before committing myself to the principle of the Bill, to have some general assurances in that respect, if in no other.  The dilemma I find myself in is something like this: For the House to approve of the principle of the Bill, or for any individual member of the House to approve of the principle, with the feeling that it is essentially bad, but that more information is required, and that that information can be obtained in committee, might be deceiving the promoters, and the promoters of a Private Bill ought not, perhaps, to be put to the expense of following out Private Bill procedure in committee, if there is any fear that after all that expense is gone to the House is in fact against the principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To have formal approval of the <Col N="17" /> principle is a mere formality, though the feeling of the House is probably against the principle, is placing the promoters of the Bill in a false position. If the promoters of the Bill with their eyes open, knowing that there is a considerable amount of feeling against giving the Bank of Ireland special privileges, still desire to proceed with the Committee Stage entailing all the expenses it will involve, it might be desirable that a Second Reading should be given. But I am not convinced that that is the right course.  I think in a matter of this kind we ought to declare our feelings regarding the principle, and to me the principle of this Bill is that the powers of the Bank of Ireland should be considerably enlarged, making them free to enter into any agreement with any of the big banking combines, either in England or in America, to sell themselves out if they wish to any of these combines, or buy up all the small banks in the country if they wish, and generally as a matter of private interest only, to do what they wish with the banking system.</P>
    <P>It is too late in the day to talk of these banks as merely private institutions. They are not.  They are privately owned and run for private ends but they are doing public work, and to my mind we have arrived at a stage when a privately owned institution should, at least, show that it is doing a public work in the public interest, and not doing a public work in a private interest.  I think that it is quite true to say that the directors of this bank, and the recently elected Northern director, are in it simply as a matter of business.  Sir George Clark was mentioned and it was stated in his defence, and in defence of the directors, that he was a man who did not allow any political views to interfere with whatever he thought good for the business he was connected with. That is exactly what I object to. Here is a director appointed as representing Northern interests to the Bank of Ireland.  The Bank of Ireland has undoubtedly some special relations with the State here, and that director has many business associations <Col N="18" /> which are not friendly to the Irish Free State.  It was stated that the interest of Sir George Clark and the other directors is in serving the institution with which they are connected, and that he is not going to allow any political influences to interfere with his business interests.</P>
    <P>Now, that is, to my mind, the principle involved in this Bill, and in the discussions around the Bill.  It is because the directors are interested only in the institution as a profit-making business and are not primarily interested in the public well-being, that they represent a bank which is a national bank in fact but run for private interest.  I can confirm what Senator Connolly stated about the political prejudices of the gentleman named.  I am not going to enlarge upon that now, but I know quite a lot, and I know, too, that the business interests that he is serving will be always paramount, and always were paramount, over the public interests of the community in which he is living, or the Irish Free State interests, which might occasionally run counter to the business interests with which he is primarily connected, and I think it has been confessed that that outlook is not merely the outlook of the Northern director recently appointed, but the outlook of directors generally, and that they make a boast of it.  In some recent observations regarding the banking systems in other countries&mdash;perhaps it has been claimed in regard to the banks here&mdash;it has been stated that while they are nominally private institutions they are, in fact, quasi-public institutions doing public work, and have always regard to the State interests and the general public well-being.  That might be so. When the public well-being runs counter to their interests, as it sometime does, then we were assured here to-day that it is always the business interests that prevail, and it is because of that that it seems to me we ought to be slow to encourage the promoters of the Bill to think that there is approval of the principle of this Bill, the principle being to enlarge the powers of the Bank of Ireland <Col N="19" /> without inquiry into the way in which they have used the privileges which they have had under previous enactments.  What those privileges are I am not aware.</P>
    <P>I do not pretend to understand what the special relations of the Bank of Ireland are with the Government, and how far those special relations affect other banks and the general credit of the country.  But, on the face of it, in view of the curious and otherwise unexplainable special relations that there have been since the Free State was established, between the Bank and the Government, I presume there must be some special privileges attached to the Bank of Ireland by charter and by Act of Parliament. <Col N="20" /> Now, if there is going to be a Committee Stage of this Bill, I think it ought to be understood that the Bank will be expected to give a full account of its stewardship before it can reasonably ask for an extension of its powers.  I think it would depend, as far as I am personally concerned, upon what may be stated on behalf of this Bill whether I would vote for it going to a Committee or that it should be rejected.  But if it goes to a Committee, I think the promoters ought to clearly understand that there is no breach of faith if those who may vote for the Second Reading will ultimately vote against the passing of the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that any partially manufactured woven tissue which but for this sub-section would be-chargeable with the duty imposed by this section is imported for further manufacture <Col N="23" /> and subsequent exportation, they may, subject to compliance with such conditions as they may think fit to impose, permit such woven tissue to be imported without payment of the duty imposed by this section.</P>

      <P>I move Recommendation No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 1, sub-section (4).  Before the sub-section to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Wherever the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that any woven tissues, which but for this sub-section would be chargeable with the duty imposed by this section, were originally manufactured in Saorstát Eireann but have undergone a process of shrinkage abroad, they may, subject to compliance with such conditions as they may think fit to impose, permit such woven tissues to be imported on payment of duty only on the actual cost of the process of shrinking.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Recommendation is moved by me at the request of the Woollen Manufacturers' Association.  The object of a protected duty is, of course, to help those manufacturers, but it is quite clear that unless they are enabled to have goods which may be shrunk in London reimported here there is great danger that they may lose a serious portion of their export trade.  I understand that very important representations have been made to the Minister in connection with this, and therefore I do not propose to argue the case further until I have heard what he has to say.</P>

      <P>The points dealt with in the two proposed recommendations on the Order Paper in the name of Senator Douglas have been the subject of discussion between representatives of the woollen manufacturers, of the wholesale clothing trade, and the furniture industry and the Department of Industry and Commerce, and as a result the Tariff Commission have been requested to prepare a Supplementary <Col N="24" /> Report dealing with these three points.  As the members of the Tariff Commission are fully familiar with this whole matter, I think they will be able to hear such evidence as they require to hear, and to give early consideration to it.  If they recommend that these concessions be given, either in the form suggested here or in some other form, it would be possible to embody them in the main Finance Bill.  In fact, if there was urgency about the matter we could make them the subject of a resolution in the Dáil which would come into effect at once.  I would suggest, therefore, to Senator Douglas that these matters should be left over until they have been reported on by the Tariff Commission, which, I can undertake, will happen very quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the first recommendation is concerned, I am agreeable to that course being adopted.  The second recommendation is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 2 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>2.&mdash;(1)  Where a person or company engaged in the manufacture in Saorstát Eireann of furniture or of bodies for motors or omnibuses shows to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that woven tissues made wholly or partly of wool or worsted are imported by them for the purposes of manufacture of furniture or of bodies for motors or omnibuses and that such tissues are not manufactured in Saorstát Eireann, the Revenue Commissioners may, subject to compliance with such conditions as they think fit to prescribe from time to time for the security of the revenue, allow the importation by such person or company without payment of the duty imposed by Section 1 of this Act.</P>
      <P>(2)&mdash;Woven tissues imported under this section without payment of duty shall be used in Saorstát Eireann by the importer thereof in the manufacture or repair of furniture or bodies for motors or omnibuses and for no other purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="25" /> With regard to this, I would like briefly to point out that the matter is really both a serious and an urgent one for the furniture manufacturers. They at present employ a very considerable number of people.  They are protected by a duty on household furniture, and as far as what is known as &ldquo;stuff over,&rdquo; which is used for the making of arm-chairs and other upholstery work, is concerned, they are very seriously handicapped, because the woollen materials required are not made in Ireland.  They are imported in small quantities, and there will be no benefit to anyone, except perhaps the Exchequer, by maintaining the woollen duty on this class of material. There would be very serious danger, in fact there would be very real hardship imposed on the furniture trade, if this matter is not dealt with, either as I propose to deal with it here by allowing the manufacturers to get the material in free in the same way that the manufacturers of motor tractors are dealt with later in this Bill, or by the provision of some technical definition definitely excluding furniture coverings. I understand that the matter is now to go before the Tariff Commissioners, and that if the Minister gets a recommendation from them that he will deal with it either by Resolution or in the main Finance Bill.  In these circumstances, I am prepared to withdraw the recommendation. I suggest to the Minister that the matter should be dealt with by Resolution and not by an Act which would have to pass through both Houses of the Oireachtas. This latter procedure might cause too much delay and, in fact, injury.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to emphasise the fact that the materials used for furniture coverings, motor cars and coach-building upholstery are not manufactured in the Saorstát or indeed in any part of Ireland, nor is there any potential factory for their manufacture here.  If relief is not given in regard to these coverings, then what will happen is this: that the present protective tariff of <Col N="26" /> 33 one-third per cent. will be reduced to between 17 and 18 per cent. In view of the mass production methods across the water it would kill the advantage of the tariff altogether. I agree with Senator Douglas that it would mean that the &ldquo;stuff over&rdquo; trade&mdash;the upholstering trade&mdash;which is one of the most potential sources of employment in the furniture industry at present, would be almost wiped out as regards manufacturing here in competition with the mass-producing factories on the other side.  The matter is one of great urgency.  I feel satisfied, when the Minister realises that, that as speedy action as possible will be taken.</P>
      <P>Recommendations, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Sections 1 and 2 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
      <P>(1) Where a person engaged in the manufacture in Saorstát Eireann of motor tractors shows to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that a substantial proportion of the motor tractors manufactured by him in Saorstát Eireann is exported, the Revenue Commissioners may, subject to the provisions of this section and to compliance with such conditions as they think fit to prescribe from time to time for the security of the revenue, allow the importation by such person without payment of the duty imposed by Section 11 of the Finance Act, 1928 (No. 11 of 1928), of motor tractor parts and assemblies of such parts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following recommendation:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 3, sub-section (1) After the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; in line 26 to insert the word &ldquo;is&rdquo; and to delete all from the word &ldquo;shows&rdquo; in line 27 to the word &ldquo;exported&rdquo; in line 30.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Section 3 of the Bill there are points that really confine this concession to one firm in the Saorstát, and that seems to make it impossible for any other firm hereafter to come <Col N="27" /> in and get the benefit of this section. If there has been some special arrangement made by the Government here to induce the firm of Messrs.  Henry Ford and Son of Cork to come along here, in which case, of course, it will be necessary to put this guarding clause in for their trade, I suppose we ought not to say anything about it; but if there is no such arrangement I do not see why the section would not read better in the form suggested by my recommendation. I would direct the attention of Senators to the section, which reads: &ldquo;Where a person engaged in the manufacture in Saorstát Eireann of motor tractors shows to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that a substantial proportion of the motor tractors manufactured by him in Saorstát Eireann is exported,&rdquo; and so on.  The words that I have quoted from the section can only apply to someone who has at present a factory here.  Supposing that General Motors Company, or someone else, proposed to come in here and to establish a factory, I believe the section as worded would bar them out.  I think it would be much better that the section should be amended on the lines indicated in my recommendation, and that the whole thing should be left in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners.  I think that even as regards Messrs.  Ford that the words in the section at present are not necessary.  Further, I do not think that it is seemly that such words as &ldquo;a substantial proportion&rdquo; should be put into any Act of the Oireachtas.  What I suggest is that the matter should be left to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>If we are going to leave it to the Revenue Commissioners why not leave the whole matter to them? What do we mean by a &ldquo;substantial proportion&rdquo;?  Is it one-half, one-third, or two-thirds?  I think this sort of indefinite method of expression should not occur in any Act of Parliament.  If the lines, as I suggest, were taken out that portion of the section would then read: &ldquo;Where a person is engaged in the <Col N="28" /> manufacture in Saorstát Eireann of motor tractors the Revenue Commissioners may, subject to the provisions of this Act,&rdquo; etc.  Any person who wishes can then come along and the Commissioners can deal with the matter as they think fit according to the Act.  Unless the Minister has some strong reasons for arrangements made which the words I propose would upset, then I think my proposal would be worthy of attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the construction put upon this section by Senator Jameson is not quite accurate, and that the amendment which he proposes would give to the Revenue Commissioners a discretion which has never been given to Revenue Commissioners in any country.  My submission is that the words &ldquo;a substantial proportion of the motor tractors&rdquo; are words which in the ultimate resort will be construed not by the Revenue Commissioners but by the courts of justice. I see nothing in the section which will prevent any motor manufacturers who may hereafter establish factories in this country availing themselves of the provisions of this section as it stands, because the section, whenever it comes for construction, will be construed as speaking from the date in which it comes before the court for construction. Therefore, I think on this question it would be inadvisable to alter the words of that section. They seem to me to have been very carefully drafted with a view to guarding the interests not merely of the manufacturers who are established at the present time, but any manufacturers who may hereafter consider it advisable to establish themselves in this country.  I think it is right that people, a substantial portion of whose output is exported, should be encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear a great deal about the necessity for an export trade, particularly an export trade in manufactured goods.  It seems to me that the section has been very carefully drafted, and I think that the words to which Senator Jameson takes exception could not be improved upon. <Col N="29" /> Is he to substitute for them a certain definite percentage?  If he is not it is, I think, advisable to leave to the proper authority the question of determination as to what is a substantial proportion, and that proper authority will not be the Revenue Commissioners but in the ultimate resort the courts of justice.  That is my view of the construction of this section.  I think the words in the section are just as good as the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; which you frequently find in sections of Acts of Parliament, and the words &ldquo;substantial proportion&rdquo; are in the same nature as the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; in analogous cases that appear in similar sections of Acts of Parliament.  For that reason, I think the section as a question of drafting is very well done and that an alteration in the section would not be an improvement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It is almost surprising to find Senator Comyn arguing in favour of a monopoly.  My objection to this section is that while it does make provision for Ford's, of which I strongly approve, I am of opinion it is not necessary to do it in such a way that another firm which started in the manufacture of tractors, and which could not prove that they were exporting a substantial proportion, could not get the advantage of this, and, therefore, would be at a disadvantage in comparison with the larger firm.  I cannot see that we ought to provide that there should be a substantial proportion exported, because the firm will be allowed to use parts imported for home trade as well.  That is clear in the section. It seems to me the simplest and the most straightforward way is to allow a firm manufacturing tractors to bring in parts free of duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the words objected to express the intention of the section.  I think we should leave it with the intention perfectly clear. The position is that motor tractors are subject to duty, and motor tractor parts on entry are subject to duty, but, on the other hand, with regard to parts which have been imported and used in the assembling of <Col N="30" /> tractors, a draw-back can be paid in respect of them if exported.  The position so far as Ford's is concerned is that the parts which they import and afterwards export in assembled tractors do not pay duty. Ford's are compelled to keep special books to give special returns, and to undergo expense, in order to avoid paying the Saorstát duty on parts which do not go into consumption in the Saorstát.  In view of the fact that this firm are giving a substantial measure of employment here, and giving that employment by making something here which is exported, we propose to give them this concession which will save them trouble and expense.  The reason for giving them the concession is that they are mainly an exporting firm.  In order to give the concession we might have said &ldquo;mainly&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; if we had liked.</P>
      <P>The fact that we give Ford's this concession is no reason why any other firm which may start manufacturing here should not get it, because there will be no bona fide firm starting the manufacture of tractors here unless they are going to export the main part of them.  If we were dealing with any other firm here we would be dealing with some non-bona fide firm which would manufacture some tractors in order to get advantage of the free importation of parts.  I do not think we should put the Revenue Commissioners to the trouble and expense, and perhaps litigation, that would arise in connection with some such firm, and I do not think we should disguise that our intention in this matter is simply to give a special concession to a manufacturing firm which are giving a great deal of employment by the manufacture of goods which are mainly or almost entirely for export.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Bill do come up for consideration in six months' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the House to read this motion in its literal sense and not to regard it as being any attempt to secure a rejection of the Bill in toto.  The form in which the motion is put down is that prescribed by the Standing Orders.  In proposing the motion I am actuated by two reasons; one is that if this Bill passes now it will be inoperative, and will remain so until a further Bill is passed setting up the machinery under which it is to be operated. The Bill, as Senators will observe, provides that the old system of election is to be substituted by an election at which the candidate shall be nominated in all respects as shall be prescribed by law.  The final sentence of the section reads&mdash;&ldquo;the place and conduct of such election shall be regulated by law.&rdquo;  There is no enactment at present prescribing or regulating such things, and there is no enactment in sight.  The result will be that if we pass this Bill now we shall be in the position in which we shall not be able to fill any casual vacancy that may arise in the Seanad until what I might call this further implementing Bill is passed.  How long that situation will remain it is impossible to say. I have no doubt it will depend on other demands on Government time and on the time of the Houses.  It does seem to me, and I hope the House will agree with me, that we should not be left in that undesirable position for an indefinite period, and that the proper course for the House to follow would be to suspend this Bill until such time as the other Bill is before us, and if it thinks fit pass both together.  I confess I have another reason for the motion.  I am sanguine enough to hope that possibly the interval provided by the postponement of the Bill may be availed of to secure a further consideration of the whole <Col N="33" /> question of election to the Seanad. Personally, I have a strong dislike for the present system, and so I think have other Senators, unless their opinions have changed considerably since last year when the Bill for altering the system of triennial elections was before us.</P>
    <P>At that time the House had really very little chance of discussing the measure in a deliberate way, and we had practicaly no opportunity of putting forward any alternative proposal to the present system, that is, with any chance of having the alternative fully considered and accepted. In the event of an alternative proposal passing the Seanad at that time it would then have to go back to the Dáil, and there would have been no chance of any change from the former system being made.  The Bill came to us close up to the Summer Adjournment, and if the necessary preparations were to be made for the autumn election it was essential the Bill should be passed before the House adjourned.  In these circumstances it was a question of the Seanad swallowing the Bill as it was or adhering to the old system of election, which had given so much dissatisfaction in 1925.  Placed in that dilemma, the Seanad did swallow the Bill, although I doubt very much whether the majority of the Seanad were really in favour of it.  I am encouraged in making this suggestion by some remarks that dropped from the President on the occasion of the introduction of these Bills. Some of us had suggested other methods of election.  I know that for myself I favoured the system of the electoral college.  Senator Jameson, if I remember rightly, favoured the system of a nominating college with subsequent election by the two Houses.  Senator O'Hanlon was in favour of the old system of election, with smaller constituencies.  So, too, I think, was Senator O'Farrell and some of his colleagues in the Labour Party.  That showed, at any rate, there was a substantial section of the House which did not favour this new system.  In reply to some of the speeches in these discussions, the <Col N="34" /> President went a long way towards admitting that he did not regard this new system as an ideal one.  He said, if I remember rightly, that it was to enable us to get over the election of last September and give us the opportunity of exploring the whole matter further before the election that is to come in 1931.  I do not mean to suggest that there was a definite pledge by the President, but there was the implication that a later proposal to that effect would have consideration from him.  I hope that he and this House, and the other House, will think that the interval provided by the postponement of this Bill will give such an opportunity.</P>
    <P>This seems to be the time when further exploration of the subject should take place.  If it is not done now what I fear will happen is that the whole question will be deferred and when we are coming close to the next triennial election we will be in the same position as we were last summer.  If any decision is taken to try to draft an alternative system it will only be done at a late period when proper consideration cannot be given to it.  Now that we have plenty of time is the time to face the problem.  I make the assertion that the system of election as applied last December did not give general satisfaction, and I believe before that system becomes stereotyped we ought to examine it in the light of the experience of last December.  We are not likely to get further information to enlighten us on the subject between now and two years hence, when the other election will be due.</P>
    <P>One of the arguments put forward in favour of the new system introduced last year was that it would lessen the influence of party organisations in the elections.  That did reconcile a number of Senators to the proposals, but I do not think that anyone can claim that that expectation has been fulfilled.  On the contrary, I think it right to say that the party system operated in that election with more rigour than anyone ever conceived to be likely, <Col N="35" /> or indeed, possible.  Of course none of us is so unsophisticated as to imagine that you can do away with the party system in politics.  It is essential to democratic government that there should be party polities, but this House is not intended to be a democratic House, and it is undesirable, in my judgment, that the party system should be allowed to operate as fully here as it would in the case of the Dáil.  There should be some modification which would secure to a greater degree the independence of this House, and prevent it becoming what there is a danger of its becoming, a mere duplicate of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>It might be foreign to go into any details of the last election, but any of us who know anything about it know that not only were members of parties directed to vote for candidates, which, of course, was quite right, but steps were taken of a really surprising kind, at least in one instance that I heard of, to ensure that the directions given were obeyed.  I cannot speak from personal knowledge of the case referred to, but I have it from a very good source.  It was that in the case of one Party some, at least, of the members never voted at all, that the voting was all done by an official.  Of course if that be true, and if it developed, there would be no need to have an election at all.  All that would be necessary would be to get the Party Whips to decide who were to be members of this House.  I think that would be a very deplorable position.  I do not think it would add to the prestige of the House.  As I say, before the position becomes mixed, I hope the House and the Government will consider the advisability of again examining the whole problem.  Whatever may be the view of the House on the larger aspect of the election my original point holds, and that is that this Bill, if it is passed, would leave the House in the position of being unable to fill a casual vacany until another Bill comes along, and for that reason I hope that my motion will be passed.</P>

      <P>I have the greatest pleasure in seconding the motion.  I did not know that the Senator was bringing it forward until I read it in the Order Paper this morning, but I realised at once that he raised a very important issue. With the argument the Senator used &mdash;and a perfectly sound argument it was&mdash;of legislative convenience and of the necessity for an amending Bill being introduced to enable this Bill to be carried out, I do not propose to deal or to delay the Seanad, but I think it is a perfectly sound proposition, and is one reason why, if there were no other reasons, we should carry Senator Hooper's suggestion. I am one of those who object altogether to the system on which this Seanad is elected.  I took occasion when the first proposal was made to change our system of election, to object to it, and I can salve my conscience to the extent that I voted against the Bill.  I do not wish to influence Senators who have other methods of achieving the wishes of the Seanad.  Whatever ideas they have on this point they are certainly worthy of consideration, and I do not by any means bar them out. I think we should consider every conceivable proposition.  The old system unquestionably had many drawbacks, because the electors, as a whole, took no interest in the election to the Seanad.  I regard the Seanad as essential to the security and proper government of this country, because, irrevocably, I am a two-chamber man.  I am quite prepared to admit that there is room for difference on this question, but I am irrevocably a two-chamber man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the danger or difficulty of party systems in this Seanad.  I have been most of my life a party man.  I have always belonged to one party.  That is a detail.  But I am a convinced party man, because, after all, you must have parties in a constitutionally governed democratic country, whatever they call themselves. I am in favour of the widest extension of democratic principles in the composition of this Seanad.  Senator <Col N="37" /> Hooper, by a slip, I think, stated that we were not a democratic House. We may not be a democratic House, but there is no reason why we should not be a democratic House, and in fact we ought to be a democratic House.  We should go further than that.  We should profess our determination faithfully to represent the people of this country.  Therefore, I would like to give the people a direct influence in the election of this Seanad, and my solution of the whole difficulty is direct election of the Seanad by the people.  I recognise the difficulty, the practical impossibility of electing members of this Seanad by one constituency, that is to say, having a Free State electorate for thirty, forty or fifty seats.  The result of that we have seen, and one of the main results is that the majority of the people did not take any interest in the election of their Senators, which is bad for the people and bad also for the Seanad.  What we should do, I venture respectfully to suggest, is to consider amongst other things the question of electing Senators direct by each county.  I think if you had two Senators for each county elected on universal suffrage, you would have a representative Seanad.  You would have a Seanad that had the respect of the people behind it; you would unquestionably have a democratic Seanad, and one representative of the people.  My suggestion is based on the analogy of the United States, and of Canada where they have two Senators or something like that for each State.  We are a small country but we have Twenty-six Counties and we might very well and usefully elect two Senators from each of the Twenty-six Counties, and we might give constituencies like Dublin and Cork such representation as a committee on investigation would suggest.  I think we are making a very great mistake in not electing the Seanad by the votes of the people. I suggest two Senators from each county but, so long as the principle of direct election of the Seanad by the people is carried out, I do not care what particular details are employed to reach that end.  On the other hand, if any Senator has any <Col N="38" /> other ideas about the election of the Seanad, so long as the Seanad is elected and not nominated, I think we might be able to discuss and debate the matter in all its bearings and probably bring it to a satisfactory conclusion.  Senator Hooper has given us an opportunity of raising this question in an informal way, and I strongly support his idea of keeping this question open, by relegating it for six months, or until such time as we can have a full inquiry into this matter, and have some practical proposition put before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speech from a nominated Senator is exceedingly interesting, but I respectfully suggest that it does not deal with the Bill which is before us and which is only dealing with the method of finding a person to fill a casual vacancy.  Senator Hooper suggested that this Bill should be postponed for six months and he gave two reasons.  The first reason he gave was that as the Bill stands it would have to be followed by another Bill, because the Bill states that the method and place of election shall be fixed by law.  I would point out that if that is a serious objection, it could easily be met in Committee by saying that the method, time and place shall be set out in the Standing Orders of each House, which quite possibly would be a better way, and would get over the difficulty as far as this House is concerned.  But, apart from that, I would point out also, that I take it the reason the following Bill has not been introduced is because if it were introduced it would be ultra-constitutional at present until the Constitution has been amended by this Bill, that we would simply get ourselves into a circle, and that until this Bill is passed, providing that a further law will be necessary, there is no certainty that that law will be necessary. I suggest that the argument put forward by Senator Hooper is really a mistaken one, and even if his argument be good, it is good only until the Bill has gone through Committee and until we see whether another Bill will be necessary or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="39" /> The Senator also suggests that we should not deal with the matter of the method of election to a casual vacancy until we had further time to consider it.  That is a totally different and much larger question, the method of election to this House.  If Senator Hooper has any proposal which will enable this House to be more independent and free from Party, I hope he will put it into the form of a resolution, and give us two or three days to consider it.  I am in entire agreement with him that this matter should not be regarded as closed, and that if any Senator has any proposal he should put it down and that this House, not the Government, should seriously debate it.  I think that could and ought to be done, apart from whether this Bill passes into law or not.  I think the issue in this Bill is whether, having regard to the present method now embodied in the Constitution, by which this House is elected by the two Houses voting together, and that being the law, it is better that the filling of casual vacancies should be done by the Seanad alone or by the two Houses.  I believe that this system of election by the two Houses is the proper one, and, therefore, I am in favour of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is one point which is more strictly a Committee point, and which probably I will bring up in Committee which deserves some consideration. This Bill simply alters the Constitution to provide that instead of the Seanad co-opting members, vacancies shall be filled by the two Houses.  It leaves the term of office of a person so co-opted as at present, with the result that when there is, shall we call it a general election for the Seanad, or a three years election, there are more than twenty vacancies to be filled, and you have the very unsatisfactory position, that the persons at the end of the list only serve a short time.  I think that has proved unsatisfactory. Probably that would be all right if you had a simple direct vote, but where you have voting according to proportional representation, <Col N="40" /> it is largely a matter of accident.  I think it would be more satisfactory, particularly in view of the provision made in the Bill, by which the two Houses are going to fill vacancies, if the person elected was to remain in office for the balance of the term of the person whose place he filled.  It might be one, two or six years, but it would mean that we would always have twenty persons to be elected, and only twenty, at a triennial election, and the term of office of each of the twenty would be the same.  It is not a very important point, but I think it would be an improvement, and if I can draft an amendment to that effect for the Committee Stage, I will do so.  I hope, however, that this Bill will not be postponed for six months, which I think would be a mistake.  I hope it will not be done on the ground that we cannot debate future methods of election unless we postpone this Bill.</P>

I think at this stage it would be appropriate for me to raise a matter.  This is the Constitution (Amendment No. 14) Bill.  I am curious to know what will be the position of some historian in the future when he sees Amendment No. 14 Bill to the Free State Constitution immediately following No. 11 Bill and, nearly twelve months after, Amendment No. 13 Bill.  The sequence of these Bills is rather puzzling.  Amendment No. 10 Bill was passed before Amendment No. 6, and immediately following Amendment No. 6 was Amendment No. 13. Following No. 13 was No. 8, following No. 8 was No. 9, and following No. 9 was No. 7.  Then we had No. 11, which has had, I believe, a Second Reading, and now we are asked to deal with No. 14.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the effect of this amendment is to delete from the Constitution a sentence which has been a source of considerable irritation and difficulty in the interpretation of its exact meaning. It was intended to mean that if a Bill was introduced in this House and was rejected by the Dáil, this House could not, in the same session <Col N="42" /> of the Dáil, reintroduce it.  When that was drafted some of us who were to some extent responsible were innocent enough to believe that a session would be a year.  Nobody has ever discovered what is the end of a session, and a session certainly is much longer than a year.  Consequently nobody knows whether that meant that this House could ever reintroduce a Bill which the Dáil had rejected.  Therefore, when the matter came up at the last Joint Committee it became perfectly clear that the sentence served no purpose whatever except as a source of irritation, with a possible limitation on this House, and I am quite certain that the House will have no objection to its deletion.</P>

      <P>So far as the Seanad is concerned, there is nothing in this Bill to get very excited about. It merely seeks to legalise, in a cramped and nervous form, with many apologies from the Minister who introduced it, what is accepted as the normal constitutional practice in practically all modern Parliaments. By this measure the President of the Executive Council may, if the Dáil definitely approves of his action, include in his Cabinet one member of the Seanad.  As introduced, the Bill gave him that permissive power in the case of all members of the Executive Council, with three exceptions.  It was one of the recommendations of the Joint Committee, and this is the only case in which any of their recommendations have been departed from.  Some of them were passed in face of very determined opposition, and one of them, the most important of all, was a recommendation which was carried by a majority of only one, the effect of it being to alter the whole method of election to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In introducing this measure in the Dáil, the President described the recommendation as a peculiar one, and indicated right away his opinion that, although he was introducing <Col N="44" /> the Bill as recommended by the Committee, nevertheless he would be inclined to amend it in Committee, which he afterwards did.  I look upon the proposal not as a privilege conferred upon the Seanad so much as a constitutional concession to the Dáil.  No President in the future will include in his Cabinet a member of the Seanad unless he believes that by so doing he will improve his Cabinet, and even then he must have the definite approval of the other House. There is nothing very novel or very revolutionary in this.  In practically all modern Parliaments, particularly in countries where the Parliamentary tradition is very much more developed than it is here, and where the democratic tradition is at least as good, Governments draw on their second Chambers for Ministers of State with very little reservation. But in actual practice, as the President was careful to remind the Dáil, the power which the Bill confers is likely to be only a very theoretical power for quite a long time to come.</P>

      <P>The President said: &ldquo;I do not think it is at all likely within the next twenty years, even if this Bill were passed into law, that any more than one&mdash;possibly not even one&mdash;member of the Seanad would be either nominated or accepted by the Dáil as a member of the Executive.&rdquo;  That is quite natural; every Deputy carries in his little attaché case a Minister's baton, and if his craft instinct is sufficiently well developed he will resent competition from outside.  He would be a President of more than normal courage who would dare to come to this House for a Minister, however brilliant, while he had a dozen urgent candidates at his elbow, all ready and willing to sacrifice themselves on the Ministerial altar. Therefore the Seanad need take only a very mild interest in this amendment to the Constitution.  It merely takes a short and a halting step towards bringing the constitutional theory of our Parliament into line with what is the constitutional <Col N="45" /> practice in practically all modern Parliaments.  Ultra-democrats need have no fear as to the result, because the protectionist policy of the Dáil will ensure that members of this House are not likely to be unduly troubled with offers of Ministerial portfolios.</P>
      <P>I was sorry, however, that an innocuous measure of this kind should have given rise, in the course of discussions elsewhere, to an absolute orgy of nonsense and of foolish abuse of the members of this House by people who should know better. I regret that for the sake of the good name of our country and the dignity of our Parliamentary institutions. The Seanad itself will, of course, lose no sleep over displays of that kind, but those who value the prestige of the Oireachtas will certainly pray that no distinguished foreigner will be curious enough to read some of those debates.  If he does he will certainly form a deplorably low estimate of the sense of proportion, the statesmanship, and the courtesy of some of our prominent politicians. In a measure of this kind there are principles only involved, and legislators who wish to be taken seriously &mdash;some of whom are, I believe, members of a Shadow Cabinet&mdash;should not disclose their own shortcomings by indulging in foolish and futile abuse of the members of the other Chamber of the Oireachtas.  One example of that type of discussion was shown by a very prominent Deputy, who said: &ldquo;Is there a single member of the Seanad whose inclusion in the Executive Council would justify the cost of printing this Bill? I cannot think of one.  Of course, I am now excluding from consideration the six just men to whom I already had occasion to make reference, like the cities in Bible history.&rdquo; I find, for the first time, that a lady elected to the Seanad becomes a man after she is elected.  That statement is, I think, most unkind to Senator Moore, who, I understand, came within the magic circle, but who was not included in this magic six.</P>

      <P>But the most serious charge of all, in my opinion &mdash;and I am sure the Deputy realised it was a serious charge when he made it&mdash;was when he said: &ldquo;There is not a single one of the remaining fifty-four capable, in my opinion, of acting as a member of the Dáil, much less as a member of the Executive Council.&rdquo;  He must have known that it was a serious charge to say that no member of this House was capable of being a member of the Dáil or he would not have made it. Statements of that kind by people who desire to be taken seriously, who pose as potential Ministers, show a decidedly low standard of what is expected from responsible Parliamentarians.  Even in the case of a Parliamentarian with both eyes on the gallery there is a sufficient opportunity to speak strongly and to speak effectively without indulging in the type of statement which tends to bring our Parliamentary institutions into contempt.</P>
      <P>A few of the speeches made against the Bill were, in actual fact, the strongest possible arguments in support of it, and showed the desirability, in certain circumstances, of extending considerably the scope of the Bill, if certain loquacious people are ever translated from shadows into real live Ministers of State.  I understand that in Germany the Graf-Zeppelin is supposed to have the biggest gas-bag in the world, but after reading some of the speeches made against this Bill, as a Scotchman would say, &ldquo;I hae ma doots.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>As, no doubt, the Seanad is aware, some time ago a representative Committee was set up to inquire into the desirability of having a Censorship Board established to deal with immoral books and publications.  After very careful consideration that Committee brought in a Report which was duly considered, and the Bill now before you has been founded upon that Report. This Bill was one which for its Second Reading received unanimous support of the Dáil, and it was the same on the subsequent stages. Certain amendments were introduced in the Dáil, but they were amendments which dealt with machinery, not with principle; in principle the Bill stands; that is to say, the nature of the publications to which the Bill refers remains unaltered. The principal alterations which were made in the Dáil were alterations in machinery.  As the Bill originally stood it was designed that a certain class of associations called recognised associations should be brought into existence and that those associations would, if they considered that there was a prima facie case for report, report books or periodicals to the Censorship Board on the ground that they were immoral. It was hoped that associations would come into existence, associations of public-spirited workers, associations which would work for what I might call the spiritual benefit of the population, very much as big charitable associations like the St. Vincent de Paul, and other associations of that nature, work for the material benefit of the poorer classes of the population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the suggestion that there should be recognised associations which would do the preliminary work of investigation was thrown out by the Dáil, which also increased the number for the Board of Censors from five, which was originally suggested, to nine.  My <Col N="48" /> own view was that neither of these alterations made for the improvement of the Bill.  I thought that recognised associations could have done very useful work indeed.  They would have been in a position to see what books were doing harm in the country; they would have seen, at any rate, that there was a prima facie case before they made a report; they would have prevented frivolous reports, and at the same time they would have prevented books or periodicals which are doing harm from passing unnoticed.  Again, I think that in the case of a board of this nature, which requires persons of special qualifications to carry out successfully a Bill of this kind, five members would have been rather better than the larger board which is now to be established.  Possibly a board of three would be better than a board of five, but that would probably mean too much hard work falling upon the members.  My own view was that a board of five would be a board which would be comparatively easy to fill with suitable persons; that it would not be too unwieldy and, on the other hand, would not be too small.</P>
    <P>As the Bill stands now, any person who likes can send in a complaint to the Minister for Justice, who will investigate it, see if there is a prima facie case and, if so, send it to the Board of Censors for consideration. If the Board considers that the book or periodical comes within the provisions of this Bill they will recommend to the Minister for Justice that its circulation should be prohibited, and the Minister will make an order to that effect.  At present the Board of Censors can also themselves, by another amendment inserted in the Dáil, institute and originate proceedings.  I frankly admit that I am not very fond of that provision, because I thought it would be rather better that the Board of Censors should not be in the position both of accusers and judges, that it would have been better if other persons were to be accusers, and that they should be solely in the position of judges.  A board of nine censors, as the Bill <Col N="49" /> now stands, will be set up, and they will consider complaints which are sent to them.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the Seanad to the particular class of book and periodical the circulation of which will be prohibited under the provisions of the Bill.  Books are dealt with under Section 6, subsections (1), (2) and (3), which read as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  Whenever a complaint is duly made under this Act to the Minister to the effect that a book or a particular edition of a book is indecent or obscene or advocates the unnatural prevention of conception or the procurement of abortion or miscarriage or the use of any method, treatment or appliance for the purpose of such prevention or such procurement, the Minister may refer such complaint to the Board.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Board shall consider every complaint referred to them by the Minister under this section and for the purpose of such consideration shall examine the book or the particular edition of a book which is the subject of such complaint and on the completion of such consideration the Board shall make to the Minister their report on such complaint.</P>
    <P>(3)  When considering a complaint referred to them under this section the Board may have regard to all or any of the following matters, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the literary, artistic, scientific or historic merit or importance of the book or the particular edition of a book which is the subject of such complaint,</P>
    <P>(b)  the language in which such book or edition is printed or produced,</P>
    <P>(c)  the nature and extent of the circulation which, in the opinion of the Board, such book or edition is intended to have.</P>
    <P>(d)  the class of reader in Saorstát Eireann which, in the opinion of the Board, may reasonably be expected to read such book or edition, and</P>
    <P>(e)  any other matter relating <Col N="50" /> to such book or edition which appears to the Board to be relevant.</P>
    <P>I would point out that it is only indecent or obscene books, or books which advocate the unnatural prevention of conception, which come under that section, and those are the only books with which the Board of Censors will deal.  An indecent book is one which comes under the definition of indecent, which you will see at the end of Section 2&mdash;&ldquo;the word `indecent' shall be construed as including suggestive of, or inciting to, sexual immorality or unnatural vice or likely in any other similar way to corrupt or deprave.&rdquo; If the Board comes to the conclusion that a book is indecent or obscene it will inform the Minister of that finding, and then the Minister can make an order which will prohibit the importation and prohibit the circulation of that book in this country. There are certain matters which the Board may, but need not of necessity, take into consideration.  I think they should always take them into consideration, but they may not be final considerations when they make up their minds.  Those are the various headings which I read to you a moment ago.</P>
    <P>The object of this Bill is, of course, that books which are likely to do harm to the morality of the country should be kept out of the country.  It must be recognised, of course, that a book may be harmful to one person and not harmful to another. A book which a man of forty, fifty or sixty can read without any harm might be very injurious to a boy of eighteen or nineteen, or to a girl of the same age, and in consequence it is only books which are likely to get amongst persons who would be injured by the reading of them the circulation of which we believe should be prohibited.  Also the book must be in itself a really indecent book, and need not be prohibited because it has got possibly one or two objectionable passages in it.  In the words used in another famous code of legislation, to be condemned it must be really intrinsically, <Col N="51" /> ex professo, immoral, not merely immoral obiter, that is, immoral because there is, possibly, here and there an objectionable expression in it.</P>
    <P>Not only does this Bill deal with books, but it also deals with periodicals, newspapers, magazines, and other productions of that nature.  These are dealt with in Section 7 (1), which says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Whenever a complaint is duly made under this Act to the Minister to the effect that the several issues of a periodical publication recently theretofore published have usually or frequently been indecent or obscene or have advocated the unnatural prevention of conception or the procurement of abortion or miscarriage or the use of any method, treatment or appliance for the purpose of such prevention or such procurement or have devoted an unduly large proportion of space to the publication of sensational matter relating to crime, the Minister may refer such complaint to the Board.</P>
    <P>You will see, therefore, that the same principle is applied there as is applied in the case of books.  A newspaper might possibly, in one particular issue, have something objectionable or immoral.  It is not considered that the circulation of a newspaper should be stopped immediately simply because something may have slipped into the paper once.  It is only if the general tendency of the newspaper, as shown by various editions of it, is to tend to corrupt or deprave, that the circulation of it would be stopped.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil the Bill was, to a great extent, enlarged.  This section is now a little wider than when the Bill was originally introduced.  As originally introduced, the Bill was to deal with nothing except with publications which were immoral, using &ldquo;immoral&rdquo; in the sense sexually immoral. These words were added to the section in the Dáil: &ldquo;or have devoted an unduly large proportion of space to the publication of sensational <Col N="52" /> matter relating to crime.&rdquo;  It was the considered view of the Dáil that you might have a paper within which you could not find any particular passage or any particular paragraph which by itself was objectionable or which by itself should not be published, yet if you get a paper which consists of nothing but reports of murders, blackmail cases and the various types of crime, that is very unhealthy and very bad reading for a considerable proportion of the community: that it tends to encourage crime and leads to crime. It was considered that persons who read papers which deal with practically nothing else but reports of cases such as I have referred to, papers whose main features are details of unpleasant cases relating to crime, might very easily be led into crime themselves.  That is to say, if their minds are perpetually dealing with questions of crime, there is a tendency to deprave their minds and to make these people themselves criminals.  Criminals, we know, are very imitative, and the method of disposing of bodies which one criminal adopts, even though unsuccessfully, we find other criminals adopting.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with the punishments which are inflicted.  The section says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It shall not be lawful for any person, otherwise than under and in accordance with a permit in writing granted to him under this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  to import into Saorstát Eireann for sale or distribution, or</P>
    <P>(b)  to sell, or expose, offer, advertise or keep for sale, or</P>
    <P>(c)  to distribute or offer or keep for distribution,</P>
    <P>any book or any particular edition of a book, or any issue of a periodical publication the sale and distribution of which in Saorstát Eireann is for the time being prohibited by a prohibition order.</P>
    <P>Later on in the same section the penalties are set out.  I do not want to weary the Seanad by reading out the whole of these sections.  Senators <Col N="53" /> may notice that the reason why a permit can be granted is this: that there may be a book which is, for general circulation, a very objectionable book, but it may be a book which may be very necessary for a person who is seriously studying as a student general social questions.</P>
    <P>It may be very necessary he should have access to certain books that are prohibited from general circulation. A person may wish to write a thesis against, let us say, the unnatural prevention of conception.  In order that he might write such a book, it would be necessary for him to study the case as put by the persons in favour of it.  Therefore, that provision has been inserted in order that persons who are really interested in social questions and are studying them as students may have every book of every kind available to them.</P>
    <P>Part 3 deals with the judicial proceedings. That follows very closely upon an Act recently passed in England, and which, I understand, has been found to work very successfully. It prevents the publication in certain classes of cases of any evidence except what is contained in the judge's charge.  Of course, those largely deal with divorce cases.  We have not got any of them in this country, and it is very unlikely that part would be called into use very much here, because it is very unlikely that papers in this country would have details of what occurred in England and which were not published in the English Press.  Section 15 is very useful.  It is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  If any person being the proprietor, editor or publisher of any book or periodical publication or being a master printer engaged in the printing of such book or publication prints or publishes, or causes, procures or permits to be printed or published therein in contravention of any of the provisions of this Part of this Act, any matter, details, or particulars in relation to any judicial proceedings such person shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction <Col N="54" /> thereof to a fine not exceeding five hundred pounds, or at the discretion of the court to imprisonment with or without hard labour for any term not exceeding six months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Where there is an indecent case, say a case of indecent assault, or something of that kind, a newspaper may have given very full details of what took place.  That penalty would then be liable to be inflicted upon the person who has published that unpleasant report.  Part 4, in Section 16, deals most specifically with this particular class of paper, that is, one</P>
    <P>&ldquo;which advocates or which might reasonably be supposed to advocate the unnatural prevention of conception or the procurement of abortion or miscarriage or any method, treatment, or appliance to be used for the purpose of such prevention or such procurement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This section makes it an offence to sell books or periodicals of this particular class, whether they have or have not appeared in the list of censored publications, but if the bookseller can show that he had exercised all reasonable care and could not have known of the contents of the particular book he was selling he would not be liable for prosecution under this section.  That is a brief summary of the provisions of this Bill, which I venture to ask the Seanad to accept.  I think there can be very little doubt that at present a great deal of harm is being done by the circulation of indecent literature and by the circulation of a certain class of newspaper.  That is already a great evil, it is a growing evil, and it is an evil which ought to be checked.  This Bill is designed to check it, and I hope it will have the approval of the Seanad.</P>
