      <P>As a matter of chronological order, would it not be better if we took Senator Blythe's motion which is on the Order Paper? If there is any difficulty about Senator Blythe's amendments to the Bill being in order, would it not be better to take that motion, and deal with it so that the matter of the order of the amendments would be settled?</P>

      <P>There are certain amendments standing in the name of Senator Blythe and there is an amendment by the Government, which is clearly in order.  The amendments of Senator Blythe I must rule out of order on the ground that they are outside the scope of the Bill as read a second time.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 57.  To delete the section and to substitute the following new section therefor:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  The Minister may by order appoint a fit and proper person (in this Act referred to as the auditor) to examine and audit the accounts of the Board and may by such order fix the amount of the payments to <Col N="710" /> be made by the Board by way of salary and expenses (if any) to the auditor.</P>
    <P>(2)  The amount of the payments so fixed as aforesaid shall be paid by the Board to the auditor out of the harbour revenue as part of the expense of the maintenance of the harbour.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Minister may by order remove the auditor from office and shall by the same or any subsequent order, unless the appointment of an auditor appears to him for any special reason to be unnecessary, appoint a fit and proper person to be the auditor in lieu and stead of the auditor so removed.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to ensure that the conditions of auditing are in conformity with what is already in existence in respect of all local harbour authorities.  It is in the terms contemplated for such new harbour regulations and legislation as will likely be brought in as a result of the report of the Harbours Tribunal.  I think it is self-explanatory and the wisdom of it will be obvious to everyone in the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Bill passes, I should like to say a word or two.  I did not oppose the taking of the Final Stage now and I do not propose to <Col N="711" /> vote against the Bill.  Nevertheless, I regard it as regrettable that a Bill dealing with Galway, the only urban area of any size in the country in which a large proportion, and probably half, of the people speak Irish, should pass this House without any recognition in its provisions of the position given to the Irish language in the Constitution.  One of the reasons why I do not object now is because it is a late stage.  I was not in the House when the Second Reading was being dealt with, when I might have been allowed to raise this matter at greater length and perhaps more effectively.  I think it is a pity that the Department of Education, which might be regarded as the Department most concerned with Irish, did not raise the matter in its memorandum, so that when the Bill was in Committee, some suitable amendment, if one could have been devised, might have been inserted.  Personally, I recognise that the proposals in the Bill are of economic value to Galway and, for that reason, I am glad to see the development of the harbour take place.  I think, however, that whatever may be the economic value to the city of Galway, of the works proposed in this Bill, a proper attitude on the part of the people of influence and authority there towards the Irish language would do a great deal more to advance that city.  I once said in the city that if they would only look at the matter correctly and take the right attitude, the people of Galway had, in the Irish language, something like a gold mine for their city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one final point I wish to make.  I have a resolution from the Galway Harbour Board in which it is resolved that the Irish language shall as far as practicable be the language of the Commissioners and that in all future appointments a competent knowledge of the Irish language shall be essential.  I do not doubt the good faith of the Commissioners, but I cannot but regret that something to that effect is not actually in their Bill, and is not going to be in the Act when it becomes an Act.  For a great many <Col N="712" /> years&mdash;I suppose right up to the appointment of the Local Appointments Commissioners&mdash;public boards all over the country had resolutions in their books to the effect that only persons with a competent knowledge of the Irish language would be appointed to certain posts, but, as a matter of fact, in practice, if a man had the right uncle, or the right cousins, it did not matter what sort of Irish he had and I would be afraid that, no matter what are the present intentions of the Commissioners, when they are not bound down by the provisions of the Act the claims of the language will be more or less ignored.  However, this whole matter is one which I hope to pursue further in other ways.</P>

      <P>We have received from the Dáil the following Bills:&mdash; Approved Investments (Amendment) Bill, 1935; Unemployment Assistance (Amendment) Bill, 1935; Diseases of Animals Bill, 1935; and Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) (Amendment) Bill, 1935.  I understand that we shall receive the following other Bills this week:&mdash;Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) (No. 2) Bill, 1935; Fisheries (Tidal Waters) (Amendment) Bill, 1935; and Fisheries Bill, 1935.  I am informed that it is not likely that we shall receive any other Bills from the Dáil before the Summer Recess.  The Bills I have mentioned do not seem to be of a contentious nature, and I think we might be able to put them through all their stages next week, but if any Senator thinks we are likely to have contentious amendments to any of these Bills, we might meet on Tuesday, in order to give an extra day for their discussion.  Senators need scarcely be reminded that the following week is Horse Show Week, and it is desirable to leave it free, if possible, although we have frequently sat during that week in other years.  I would ask the House if they would agree to meet on Tuesday so that we could complete our business next week.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="715" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMacLoughlin" hpid="Mr. MacLoughlin Mr. MacLoughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I was not present when the Minister was introducing this Bill last week.  I have read hurriedly the report of the Minister's speech since I came into the House, and it appears to me that it was singularly enlightening on things that did not matter and curiously uninformative on things that did.  I am not at all agitated as to the reason why the Bank of Ireland is mentioned in this Bill, and if the Minister's officials have nothing else to do but pursue archæological research as to the doings of &ldquo;our ancestors&rdquo;&mdash;to use the Minister's phrase&mdash;then I think the Vote for the Department of Finance could be usefully reduced.  A matter of much greater interest and significance to the people is that the interim dividend of the Bank of Ireland has been reduced.  That, I suppose, is conclusive evidence of the prosperity in which we are at present basking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Finance to subdue his archæological enthusiasm and tell us when we may expect the £2,000,000 reduction in the cost of Government Services.  We were assured by the Fianna Fáil Party that the cost of the public services could be reduced by at least £2,000,000 without impairing their efficiency.  At the time that promise was made the expenditure on Supply Services was £21,617,500.  The original Estimates included in this Bill amount to £29,507,710.  That is, roughly, £8,000,000 more than the actual expenditure in these services in 1931-32.  If it was possible to expect a reduction of £2,000,000 in our expenditure on Supply Services when the cost was £21,000,000, then it should be possible for the Government to effect a reduction of £10,000,000 to-day.  I would like to be told when that reduction of £10,000,000 is to be expected. I hope I shall not be assured by some of our friends on the opposite side that the £10,000,000 a year which Fianna <Col N="716" /> Fáil is costing us over and above the legitimate cost, according to themselves, is due to the economic war. The economic war is over.  We have won the economic war.  The war was won at Bantry on 7th January, 1933. Let me quote my authority.  &ldquo;It must be clear to every interest in the country that the Free State had won the economic war, and the victory, every one of them would admit, had been achieved with the minimum of hardship.&rdquo; That is the declaration of the Minister for Finance.  Having won the war, is it not time to bring down expenditure to the level at which it stood when it was £2,000,000 too high?</P>
    <P>Remember we have retained in this country £4,000,000 formerly paid to Britain.  Much of this money had to be found by the Cosgrave Government when expenditure on Supply was £21,000,000 odd.  Now that we have possession of these moneys, is there any justification for a bill of £29,000,000 for Supply Services?  May I ask the Minister also when he proposes to commence the paring process in connection with the Estimates for the Army and the Gárda Síochána.  Last week I had the pleasure of quoting a very sensible speech by the Minister, in which he urged that expenditure should be &ldquo;pared remorselessly to the bone.&rdquo;  In this Bill I do not see any bones sticking out.</P>
    <P>The Minister instanced particularly the Army and Gárda Estimates as fit subjects for paring.  I find that in 1932-33&mdash;before the parers attained to office&mdash;the Estimate for the Gárda was £1,683,000.  In this Bill the Estimate is £1,879,000.  The Police Service has increased in cost by £200,000 a year since the period of the &ldquo;remorseless paring.&rdquo;  The Estimate for the Army was £1,318,000 in 1932-33.  Now it is £1,503,000.  Another £200,000 has been piled on by the parers.  When, may I ask again, does the Minister propose to commence the paring of these two services instanced by himself as examples of extravagance?</P>
    <P>There is provision in this Bill for £20,000 for Secret Service.  Under the former Government the Estimate was generally £10,000, while only a trifling <Col N="717" /> sum was spent.  I should like to hear some general justification of the increase of £10,000 for Secret Service.</P>
    <P>I was led to believe at one time, like many other innocent persons, that under Fianna Fáil there would be no necessity for spy money.  But Fianna Fáil appears to specialise in spies. How is the £20,000 to be spent?  The economic war is over, so that there is no longer any necessity to dog the steps of Mr. J.H. Thomas.  Is our Republican Government spending the spy money in trailing fellow Republicans? If that is how the money is being spent, I respectfully suggest that the cost is too high.  There is so much unemployment now both in town and country that it should be possible to procure spies at a cheaper rate.  The Fianna Fáil spies are, in my opinion, being rewarded on an imperial scale&mdash; a scale altogether beyond our modest resources.  I hope the Minister will be able to give us a general idea of how this money is being spent.  Spying seems to be one of the most progressive and prosperous of our new industries.</P>
    <P>I should like to know how likewise the repayment of our External Loan stands&mdash;how much of the American Loan was redeemed during the year and how much remains to be redeemed? The Minister might also be able to inform us as to how much of this money was paid direct to the persons concerned and how much was paid to nominees or trustees.  I hope the Minister will in his reply deal with the questions I have raised, even if he has to curtail his disquisition on the vagaries of the old lady in College Green.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I read an article in a provincial newspaper, written by one of the ablest journalists in Ireland, dealing with the methods employed by Ministers and their supporters in answering criticisms of the Opposition. The article was recalled to me at the last meeting of the Seanad.  I do not <Col N="718" /> mean any disrespect to anyone, but the article went on to state:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Granted an unscrupulous disregard for truth, a contempt for the intelligence of the electorate, and an absolute disregard for the interests of the country, a facile controversialist can answer almost any case.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister gave one or two examples in his speech on the Finance Bill.  As the Appropriation Bill and the Finance Bill deal more or less with the same matters, I suppose I will be allowed to deal with them now.  I hope the House will forgive me for going back on the sugar beet question, of which we had a great deal.  The Minister stated last week, when dealing with the sugar beet factory:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It was a white elephant in the circumstances which existed at that time.  That was early in the year 1932, when we were subsidising that factory very heavily.  I think, speaking from memory, that since the establishment of that factory we paid in subsidies alone to the proprietors almost £3,000,000 ...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to that.  I had some difficulty in finding at short notice what the subsidy for beet amounts to each year.  Is it £1,110,000 or thereabouts? The Minister said that the beet factories were no longer white elephants, that they were useful beasts of burden and were earning their own keep. Beasts of burden which cost the taxpayers £1,100,000 per year are costly animals.  They are not useful beasts of burden and certainly are not earning their own keep.  The Minister also mentioned that every penny of the money earned in profits by the Carlow factory went out of the country.  Of course, that is not true.  It is true that the company was started on foreign capital, to a great extent.  The amount was £400,000, and the Irish capital invested was about £10,000.  All the profits did not go out of the country. I should like to remind the Minister that it was extremely difficult to induce any foreign capital to come in to start a completely new industry here.  It was an industry of which the people who supplied the raw material knew <Col N="719" /> nothing at the time.  It required a great inducement to get anybody to come here, especially as at that time the Minister and his associates had been doing everything in their power to discredit this country and to pull down its credit.  Before that, they had done everything in their power to make the nations of the world believe that this was a nation of bankrupts and bank robbers.  People were certainly not anxious to come in without a great inducement, and to put money into industry.  Sir Maurice Lippens, when he came here with the intention of putting money into the industry, stated that his financial advisers were against it.  He came to investigate.  When he went to Mr. Hogan he was by no means inclined to put money into the industry here.  It was only when Mr. Hogan pledged his personal honour, in the integrity of the Irish farmer as being a man of honour, that Sir Maurice Lippens decided to finance the Carlow factory.</P>
    <P>I should also like to remind the Minister of the position with regard to the growers of beet.  It was extremely difficult to get farmers to undertake the growing of beet in the beginning unless a high price was given.  If a high price had not been given, there would not have been sufficient beet sown to keep the factory going.  A great many people wanted to try it on the dog, as they always do, but the adventurous spirits who went in for the growing of beet then deserved great credit.  They got a guaranteed price of 54/- a ton for beet containing 15½ per cent. sugar, which meant £3 per ton on an average.  While that was being paid by the factory, the factory paid no dividend.  In the first year, no dividend was paid by the factory although they were able to give the farmers £3 a ton for their beet. The Minister said that it cost the people £3,000,000 to run the Carlow factory.  That figure might be misunderstood by some people.  That cost was spread over eight years.  Then a great part of the subsidy was refunded in the duty paid.  In the later years, from 20,000 to 25,000 acres of beet were manufactured into sugar but the subsidy <Col N="720" /> was paid on only from 12 to 15 acres.  It is only fair in making comparisons that these years should be considered.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter referred to the cost of growing beet and his figures were disputed by some Senators.  I do not know whether I should be trespassing on the patience of the House too much if I were to give the detailed cost of the growing of beet.  If I am not too boring, I should like to do so in order to clear the air.  People are under the impression that sugar beet is a crop from which a great amount of money can be earned by the growers.  This estimate is based on £1 per week for labour and 7/6 a day for a team of horses, with 5/- per day for a single horse, and produce calculated at 10 tons of beet, factory weight, per acre. Ploughing, 1½ days, man and pair of horses, 16/3; cultivating, making ready for drills, three days, man and pair of horses, £1 12s. 6d.; drilling 1 day, man and pair of horses, 10/10; sowing artificial manure in drills, man, 1 day, 3/4; sowing seed in drills, man and horse, 1 day, 8/4; skimming drills for thinning, man and horse, 1 day, 8/4; horse-hoeing, 1 day, man and horse, 8/4; thinning the plants, cost per acre, £1 15s.; second horse, hoeing, man and horse, 1 day, 8/4; second weeding, 2 men, 2 days, 6/8; pulling acre of beet, 2 men, 4 days, £1 6s. 8d.; carting from field and to railway station, 2¼ miles, with 3 men and 3 horses, 2 full days, £2 2s. 6d.; rail carriage, 6/- per ton on 10 tons, £3; farmyard manure, 15 tons at 2/6 per ton, £1 17s. 6d.; superphosphate, 4 cwts., 13/6; sulphate of ammonia, 1½ cwts., 10/6; 1½ cwt. kainit, 10/6; 1½ cwt. nitrate of soda, when thinned, 12/-; rent and taxes 15/-; beet seed, 13/4; association's fees, 4d. per ton, 3/4; total cost of produce, £19 2s. 9d.  Value of 1 acre of beet, 10 tons clean beet at 37/6 per ton, £18 15s.; value of tops for feeding, I acre, £1 15s.; free pulp from 10 tons of beet to about 1 ton, less cost of carriage and bags, £1 8s. 4d.; residual value of manures for the following crop, £1; total, £22 18s. 4d.  Deduct cost of production, £19 2s. 9d., leaving £3 15s. 7d.  Cost of carting and spreading farmyard manure, 2 men and 2 <Col N="721" /> horses, 1 day, 16/8.  Total net profit, £2 19s. 11d.  The total net profit on an acre of beet is £2 19s. 11d.  That is not a big fortune, considering that it is the most difficult, troublesome and laborious crop that one can put into a farm.  It is exceedingly hard on the men who are working on it and I have no hesitation in saying that, under the old system, an acre of mangolds, grown for the feeding of stock, would be of enormously more value.  That is not a great fortune for the farmer considering that the crop is costing the taxpayer £1,100,000 and the consumer of sugar considerably more than he ever paid before.  I should like to refer to the remarks made by Senator MacEllin with regard to the working of the new factories.  The old company were business men, and in running the factory they treated the farmers fairly and squarely, even though there was a strike.  I think everybody regretted that strike afterwards.  They did not understand what they were doing at the time.  The old company treated the farmers fairly and squarely and not in the scandalous manner in which the farmers of Wexford were recently treated.  Last year, the people of Mallow refused to grow beet to any extent.  Wexford farmers came to the rescue and grew all the beet they could get.  They kept the Mallow factory going.  Their beet was transferred there from Carlow.  They were left under the impression&mdash;certainly no hint was given to the contrary&mdash;that they were going to get the same acreage of beet that they had last year.  Yet, it was only on the 7th April that I was told and that my neighbours were told that we were not going to get last year's acreage.  One poor man, a neighbour of mine, had arranged to grow 25 acres of beet.  He had 30 acres last year. He paid a fairly good price for tillage land for that purpose.  On the 7th April, when he had 25 acres ready&mdash;the middle of April is the proper time for this work&mdash;he got word from the factory that he would be allowed to grow only five acres.  All that land was left on his hands.  He could get no seed at the time and all that he could do was to put in spring wheat.  He sowed spring wheat, as he thought, but <Col N="722" /> it proved to be winter wheat and his 25 acres of wheat were a failure.  That is a terrible case but it is the case of many farmers.  Some of the land has not been sown at all.  The people had no money to buy seed to put into it.</P>
    <P>Senator MacEllin referred to the quality of the sugar.  I do not want to run down the quality of Irish sugar, which has always been very good, but I should like some explanation from him, or somebody in the factory, as to the quality of the sugar sent out for a month or six weeks towards the end of May or the beginning of June. Sugar of very bad quality was sent out to the merchants during that period.  It had the colour of mud. When I asked in the grocer's shop about it, they told me that large numbers had sent the sugar back but that they could not get anything else. Having regard to all the Senator said about the quality of the sugar, I should like some explanation as to why that bad sugar was sent out.  I merely want information.  The occurrence may have been unavoidable.</P>
    <P>The great agricultural system which the Government has destroyed is the only one which will earn its keep and keep the country at the same time.  A Senator mentioned the last day that it would cost as much to thin an acre of mangolds as an acre of beet.  It might, though beet requires more care in thinning.  Even so, an acre of mangolds would not be subsidised at the rate of £40 or £45.  Neither did the great cattle industry, or the other industries we had before, cost the taxpayer one penny.  They were the only industries that stood on their own feet or ever will.  I think it was Senator Fitzgerald who argued that the British consumer was paying part of the tariffs on our products because he argued that the tariffs put on here raised the cost to the consumer.  The case is quite different.  It is ridiculous to argue that the British pay any part of the tariffs.  We are only too well aware that they do not.  We have evidence of that in our prices.  In any event, the Minister for Agriculture always argued contrary to what Senator Fitzgerald argued.  The Minister for Agriculture argues that we cannot control <Col N="723" /> the British market, that we have to take what we get there.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to what President de Valera said as a reason for not paying the land annuities.  When President de Valera said first that he was not going to pay the land annuities to Great Britain his argument was based on confiscation of land here in the past.  Evidently, that argument was too absurd even for him and he dropped it.  One of his arguments now is based on the over-taxation of Ireland during the last century.  The over-taxation of Ireland when we were under British rule was, so far as I can find out&mdash;I am referring to the taxation of the 32 counties and I think I am right&mdash;between £9,000,000 and £10,000,000.  That was before the war. Now, the taxation for 26 counties is £30,000,000.  Whatever other excuse he gets for holding the land annuities, he ought not, in common decency, to mention taxation.  A Senator, speaking last week, said that security was the thing we wanted most in his country. Of all the commodities we have not got, security is certainly one.  We do not know from one day to another where we may be.  We are about as secure as the people in Quetta before the earthquake.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I want to protest against the treatment of the people of Cork by the Government.  I think we should raise our voice about it.  There is no doubt that these people paid their way as long as they could.  I worked in Cork for some years.  I do not want to make invidious comparisons but I think they are the ablest people in Ireland.  They are an exceedingly efficient people.  They did everything well.  They never missed a penny they could make by any means.  They were a people who were able to turn out the finest stock and the finest crops.  I often boast of my own county but I put the Cork people before them in this respect.  Nobody will make me believe that their condition is due to any conspiracy not to pay.  These people always paid their way.  The treatment they are getting from this Government is most disgraceful.  It is <Col N="724" /> worse than anything the people of Ireland experienced in the old landlord days.  It is more demoralising than that and it comes from a native Government.</P>
    <P>I greatly regret the practical disappearance of many small industries connected with farming.  There is, for instance, the poultry industry in which my own county was foremost, and there are many others as well.  It is not altogether from the economic point of view that I regret the diminution that has taken place in connection with those industries, but rather because of their effect on the character of the people and on their industry. If I may be excused for doing so, I would like to say everyone who knew the work of the late Mr. George Russell deeply regrets his death, which took place last week.  To my mind, at any rate, the most prosperous and the happiest time for Irish farmers that we can remember was during the period when he was associated with the late Sir Horace Plunkett.  I am referring now to the years before the war, and as I have said, I think they were the happiest times the Irish farmer ever had.  I deeply regret Mr. Russell's death because of the very valuable and unselfish work he did for the country, and especially for that part of the agricultural industry with which the women-folk are principally concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned something about the volunteer halls that the Government are going to build all over the country.  The grant for them, of course, has been reduced, but still the Minister said that they were going to do as much as they could in the way of building halls.  I believe that these volunteer halls will have a very bad effect in the country.  They will be bones of contention wherever they are put up.  So far as one can hear, these volunteers are now called the Fianna Fáil volunteers, or Mr. de Valera's volunteers, or something of that kind.  I suggest to the Government that they should drop this idea about volunteer halls, because I believe that instead of being useful they will be harmful.</P>
    <P>I do not share Senator MacLoughlin's <Col N="725" /> opinion about the Government's expenditure on archæological research. So far I have been very critical of the Government and of their Ministers and of their work, but I want to congratulate the Minister on the grant, even though it is small, which has been given for archæological research.  I think it is a step in the right direction. I also congratulate the Minister on the grant that is being given for the racial survey.  All these things are very useful, and I wish that the Government had more money to spend on them.  I think that is all that I have to say in a general way on this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of your toleration, Sir, I hope you will allow me to raise a matter that is fairly urgent and fairly important.  I will try to bring it under the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It is in connection with the factory at the North Wall where the manufacture of briquettes, or coal blocks, is carried on. This factory employs a good deal of adult male labour, a thing that should be encouraged in every possible way. When an import duty was put on British coal, representations were made on behalf of this factory, and as a result the factory's imports of British slack were allowed in duty free.  For some reason or other, it has been thought advisable to put on that duty now.  Quite recently, through the Department of Industry and Commerce, this duty has been put on and for this factory it creates this position: this slack must be imported because the briquettes can only be made from slack from the best British coal.  As I have said, the factory gives a good deal of employment to adult male labour, and its products of briquettes are used almost entirely by tenement dwellers in this city.  None of them are used in the residential quarters of the city.  The people engaged in the trade are the very poorest&mdash;the hawkers&mdash;who have a boy or a girl using a donkey and cart to convey the briquettes around to the tenement houses.  The imposition of this duty will mean, either that the factory will have to close down, or that the very poorest in the community will <Col N="726" /> have to pay an increase for the fuel they use during the coming winter.</P>
      <P>This duty has been put on by the Department of Industry and Commerce. I do not know whether the Minister for Finance is aware of it or not, but it will certainly have a very serious effect, and I would appeal to the Minister to look into it.  I may say that this is the only factory of its kind in Ireland.  It is well equipped, it is giving a great deal of employment, and its products are used entirely by the tenement dwellers in the city which means that if the duty is continued these people will have to pay an enhanced price for their fuel.  As well, the unfortunate people engaged in the trade are the very poorest in the community.  This is a matter that, I think, the Minister might look into and remit the duty as he did on a former occasion when representations were made.  On that occasion the slack was allowed in duty free.  I do not believe there is any real justification for this duty, and I hope that the Minister will see his way to comply with the request that I have made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never felt any astonishment that the amount of expenditure should rise.  When the Minister and his colleagues were in opposition, they talked about the great reductions that could and should be made.  I always argued that that was impossible: that the trend of expenditure must be upward because of the increasing complexity of our economic and social life, and because of the factors that were rendering the individual more helpless to steer his own course.  I always urged that increased social expenditure or increased social services, whether educational or any other kind, meant increased administrative expenditure.  Therefore, I felt that any argument in favour of big reductions was always unreasonable and ill-founded.  During times of great stress or stringency it might be possible to effect temporary reductions in State expenditure, but I think that in normal times there must be some increase.  The Government have really gone from one extreme to another.  First, they were urging reductions <Col N="727" /> that were impossible and that would have thrown the country backwards if it had been attempted to realise them, and now they have gone to the side of piling on expenditure to an extent that, I think, must be realised by everyone as positively dangerous.</P>
      <P>I think it was Senator MacLoughlin who quoted the increase, in the combined Central Fund and Supply figures from 1931-32 to the present year, of £8,192,000.  As a matter of fact that figure does not represent anything at all like the total increase. One of the things that, I think, is not very wise in the long run is the policy which the Government has pursued of keeping much expenditure and much of the burden on the people off the Budget.  In this Appropriation Bill, there is one sub-head in the Vote for the Department of Agriculture dealing with the wheat subsidy.  In the main, that is not to be expended.  Nevertheless, the wheat subsidy is going to be paid by the people, and paid by them without passing through the Exchequer.  Now, there is expenditure there as well as a burden on the people.  There is an actual subsidy conveyed through the millers to the farmers.  In previous years we knew what the amount was precisely.  It was voted here and it came up for consideration and examination. There are a great many other items of expenditure and taxation which are kept out of the Budget and out of the Appropriation Bill by the policy of the Government, so that when we talk about an increase of £8,200,000 roughly, we are not covering anything like the increase that has taken place in expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the question of sugar alone. Senator Miss Browne mentioned that the sum of about £1,100,000 was going from the pockets of the consumers to the sugar beet industry as a subsidy.  When the Carlow factory was first erected we had the whole thing in the Appropriation Bill.  We had the total amount of the subsidy.  The total bill that was being paid by the taxpayer was brought before the two Houses.  Afterwards, <Col N="728" /> there was a slight modification of that, but, in the main, before the new developments took place, we had that expenditure in the Budget.  Now, it is removed out of the Budget so that there is that very large expenditure which is not counted as expenditure at all.  It does not come into this increase which we have been talking about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator say what he means by &ldquo;slight modification?&rdquo; If my memory serves me right, the same policy in regard to the price of sugar was pursued by the last Administration: that is to say, laying the burden on the public as a consumer rather than as a taxpayer.  That policy, I think, was adopted after the first year or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There was a farthing, or some small proportion of the amount, dealt with in that way, but the big contribution remained.  The main subsidy remained in the Estimates for expenditure right up to the end, and if the Senator looks back on the records he will find, I think, that that is correct.  Take the question of butter. There is new expenditure.  I do not deny at all that it was necessary expenditure in order to save the dairying industry. But, nevertheless, we have, I suppose, £600,000 per annum raised by a system of taxation without appearing at all in those figures that we are dealing with.  I do not know what the amount for wheat will be this year.  I think it will be in or about £900,000.  That is not brought before us either.  There is the levy on cattle which is to continue even under the new arrangement.  That does not come into this either.  So far as the taxation side of it is concerned, it is not disclosed.  Altogether, I think there is something like £3,300,000 of hidden taxation, and, of course, most of it is hidden expenditure also, so that when we talk about an increase of £8,200,000 in expenditure, we are talking about only a part of the real increase, because the real increase must be over £11,000,000 which, I submit, represents a tremendous alteration in the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we have this policy of very high <Col N="729" /> expenditure.  We have great increases in the Customs duties, not all of which are purely protective.  A lot of them have a mixed motive so that we have a burden on the public far in excess of what goes into the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In the year before the present Government took office something like £8,250,000 was raised by means of Customs duties.  If the estimate of the Minister for the present year is realised there will be £9,760,000 collected in Customs duties: that is, £1,500,000 more is to be taken up from those particular sources.  Everybody knows, however, that there is a great burden on the people beyond the amount raised by any Customs duty.  First, the Customs duty becomes part of the trader's capital&mdash;part of his turnover&mdash; and profits have to be charged on it and the consumer suffers in that way. Then, when the duty is not a revenue duty but partly revenue and partly protective, it means that they have part of the amount of the duty added on to home produced goods which means that the people pay two or three, or five or six million pounds more which does not come into the Exchequer&mdash;which is a particular sort of subsidy towards industry.  Generally, if all these changes that have taken place in the field of expenditure, and in the field of taxation, had taken place over a number of years and during a time when there was normal development, there would not necessarily be any criticism to be delivered; but at a time when, taking the economic structure of the country as a whole, there has been no development but, apparently, a certain retrogression, it is a most serious and alarming thing.</P>
    <P>I know that it is always easy for people to cry &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; and to raise alarms about the financial position of the country.  The Minister for Finance, when in opposition, and others did it. They talked about the desperate position that we were in and about the impossibility of bearing the burden of taxation.  I do not want to imitate the Minister, and I do not want to speak in any alarmist tone about the position of the country, but I do think that the <Col N="730" /> country is going backwards economically. If we have all the figures and look at them as fairly as possible&mdash;the figures of agricultural employment and of industrial employment as indicated by contributions to the unemployment fund&mdash;and if we look at the position of the farmers and estimate it as fairly as we can, the whole does seem to point, without doubt, to the conclusion that the country is suffering so seriously that a continuance along present lines is going to bring some disastrous results. This country had a good deal in the way of reserves and it has been able to bear a strain that, perhaps, would have caused a snap in another country less fortunately situated; but the loss cannot continue in definitely.</P>
    <P>Two or three Senators have referred to the collection of the land annuities. Now, I hope that the Government will examine that question without any of the feeling that was displayed in the speech of one Senator&mdash;I think it was Senator MacEllin.  It is no use saying that these amounts are due by law and that the people who are not paying, or who are indulging in any agitation against paying, are people to be condemned utterly and that there is no reason at all in their attitude.  As I said the other day, I think there is no doubt at all that the position of a great many farmers has become difficult and has even become serious and that, in a great number of cases, all spare means have been exhausted: that there is great difficulty in carrying on and that destitution seems to be facing them and their families. Now, the question of land annuities has a history.  It was, I remember, regarded as a matter for boasting that, in spite of the struggle that the people had to make during the land war and in spite of the opposition that was put up to the exactions of the landlords, when the land was actually bought out, the annuities were paid scrupulously and so punctually.  That habit of ready and prompt payment of annuities continued until about the time of the civil war.  Then a considerable amount of arrears accumulated.  It was never possible to wipe out that mass of arrears.  In fact, it never <Col N="731" /> proved possible to make any satisfactory impression on it.  It was reduced a bit, but then the new question raised by Fianna Fáil with regard to the land annuities, came up and the collection became more difficult again and the total of arrears began to mount up a second time.  I do not want to argue the matter by way of quotations from statements that were made, but farmers did get the impression at that time that, if Fianna Fáil were returned to power, they were going to be allowed to retain the annuities or, at least, that the annuities were not going to be paid over any longer to the bondholders through the British authorities, and that the farmers were going to get all the benefits of that.  Now they find that the annuities policy has robbed them of their profitable market; that it has caused every farmer to suffer very great losses; and, at the same time, it is demonstrable that, one way and another, every farmer&mdash;well, if not every farmer, at any rate, farmers in general&mdash;have had to pay much more than the amount of the annuities.  The stock sold at home has suffered in prices, and the farmers have been injured in that way as well as in the way of having to pay the sums imposed and collected in Great Britain.  When, on top of this, half of the old annuities is collected by the Government, it is not unreasonable for a farmer in difficulties to feel aggrieved and to feel that the attitude of the Government in this whole matter has been somewhat cynical.</P>
    <P>The Government argues that, if they were to cease collecting the annuities for the period of the economic war, it would prove impossible to resume collection and that, therefore, the progress of land purchase would be impeded, that the financing of future land purchase would be made extremely difficult.  If things continue as they are at present, however, it seems to me that the Government is going to be forced, by the movement of opinion in the country and by a growth of resentment and by increasing difficulty in getting in the money, to abandon the collection of annuities altogether. If the Government only stops <Col N="732" /> or suspends the collection of the annuities when they are forced to do it and when they have seen completed the progress of events in the country illustrated by such figures as the two figures I mentioned in discussing the Finance Bill last week, namely, that on the 31st March, 1934, the uncollected arrears of land annuities amounted to something like £316,000 and that on the 31st March, of this year, the uncollected arrears amounted to £880,000&mdash;it means that they will not be able to resume collection.  If, however, they recognise that the economic war creates a special difficulty and special hardships for all agriculturists, and if they say, frankly and candidly, that it is their intention to do what they can to remedy the situation, and that, if they are in office, it is their intention to resume the collection of annuities after a settlement, then they will have some chance of resuming the collection. I think the whole matter is a matter about which heat can be engendered very easily both on the side of the Government and on the side of those opposing the Government, and I think it is the duty of Ministers to look at the matter coolly and calmly and take a decision which will be a long-view decision.  They should not hesitate, if they think the trend of events justifies change, to alter the views they have held up to the present time, and they should not hesitate even to appear to yield to an agitation which, they allege, is baseless.  There is no doubt that there is a tremendous lot of feeling about this matter.  It is not however a question of agitation.  That feeling is not baseless.  Everybody knows that you cannot get anywhere by agitation unless there is a real grievance to work upon.  Accordingly, the Minister, and the Government, should not take the view lightly that there has merely been agitation at work amongst the farmers of County Cork and that these farmers have been persuaded by such agitation to do certain things.  They should not take the view that there is no difficulty or no hardship and that the whole thing is artificial.  County <Col N="733" /> Cork, as far as I can learn, is not the only place where the collection of annuities has been becoming more difficult and where the mass of arrears has been tending to accumulate. Supposing the position is arrived at in two or three years that there are £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 of arrears, it must be obvious to the Minister that that amount will be utterly uncollectible. As I pointed out, a much smaller amount of arrears which had accumulated at the end of the civil war could never be collected in spite of everything the Government could do, and if the kind of thing that has been going on recently is continued, it must be obvious to the Minister that there will have to be another funding of arrears.  If another funding of arrears takes place, it only means that it will encourage the people to hold back their payments until there will be another funding, and so on.</P>
    <P>I think the Government are too much inclined to take the attitude of regarding this as being between men who are in a fight&mdash;that it is a question of an unlawful conspiracy. There is no doubt that anything that is based on conspiracy can be broken down by the Government. Conspiracy only lasts a little while, and the Government can break it down if there is no reason behind the conspiracy. I think it is entirely wrong for the Government to take the view that there is not a real difficulty here. I think it was the Minister for Finance who quoted a case some time ago of great profits being made in agriculture in a certain case, and he gave that as an example, but what was true in that case is not true of other cases.  It is quite true that a man fortunate enough to get into tobacco a few years ago might have made a profit, but the normal farmer must lose; so that I think that the whole matter should be looked into in a new spirit by the Government.  I hope also that we will not have a further development of the policy of meeting the expenses of various ventures by more or less indirect methods, because it is possible for the country to be carried into commitments which it will be extremely difficult to get out <Col N="734" /> of, and carried into them to a distance it would not be carried if the money had to be voted.  Coming to one or two other matters, I should like to ask the Minister if the Government has considered a resolution that was passed by the Seanad some time ago asking that a commission be set up to look into certain matters connected with the use of the Irish language or if they are inclined to set up such a commission or a commission with wider terms of reference?  I think that is a matter that would well bear examination.  A week or two ago the President of the Executive Council, referring to the teaching of English in the Gaeltacht schools, seemed to indicate, according to newspaper reports, that personally, he, at any rate, was in favour of the dropping of the teaching of English in those schools.  I hope it is not the intention of the Government to take such a step.  I believe that to do so would not strengthen the position of the Irish language in those districts and probably would actually lead to an increased family use of English.  The Gaeltacht areas are now so small, they are so much surrounded and encroached upon by English-speaking districts that if young people were to be brought up there without an adequate knowledge of English they would be under terrible disadvantages.  They would be cut off from a great many amenities and activities and there is no doubt that they would grow up feeling a grievance against those who insisted that they should not be instructed in English.  Not only would they feel themselves aggrieved, and perhaps inferior to their neighbours, but their neighbours, who would have both Irish and English, would feel these people were inferior.  I think the result of that would be that parents in the Gaeltacht areas would do their best to speak English to their children to remedy a defect which they saw in the education being given in the schools and the results would be that English would tend to become the family language in homes where parents are now quite willing to leave the instruction that should be given in English to their children to the schools.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="735" /> I do admit that there is probably need for certain changes in the arrangements in regard to instruction in English in the Gaeltacht schools. For example, as far as I know, the children who come into the schools without English, and whom we should wish to continue to be habitual users of the Irish language, are expected to make as good a showing in English before the inspector as children from County Meath or County Dublin, who have had English in their homes and who will in most cases continue to use English as their habitual language.  I think, while sufficient instruction should be given in English to enable Gaeltacht children to do any business they may have to do effectively and without discredit to themselves in English it is not right to seek to have a common standard for English over all the schools in the State.  If we do insist on that standard of English in the Gaeltacht&mdash;I do not know whether it is altogether officially insisted upon, but I am afraid in practice it is the feeling of the teachers that inspectors want that standard&mdash;we are going to do much to put the Irish language out of use in the Irish-speaking areas.</P>
    <P>I also think that the whole question of the requirements in regard to English from people from the Irish-speaking areas in public examinations needs to be considered.  In the very weak state of the Gaeltacht and of the Irish language in the Gaeltacht, I think it has a most unfortunate reaction if a child who is bright and good fails in examinations solely because of some weakness in English. If the Irish language were stronger one might say it was all right, but in the present circumstances I think it is a matter that requires scrutiny and some adjustment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general policy of the Government about Irish, the President of the Executive Council, in the speech which he made in Galway, talked about the want of a systematic plan.  There was some suggestion of concentration on the Gaeltacht.  In my view, the place that it is most necessary and desirable to concentrate on is Galway City.  One of the great weaknesses in <Col N="736" /> the position of the Irish language is that it is a rural language, that it is not used to any extent in the life of any urban community.  There are individual families in towns who use it, but the dominant language of every town is English.  In Wales the position is different.</P>
    <P>I can remember noticing this in various Welsh towns.  I remember being on a bank holiday evening in Carnarvon.  I was going through the streets with a friend and we did not hear anything but Welsh spoken.  We went into shops.  Welsh was spoken in every shop.  Even in a town like Holyhead I remember going into a draper's shop, which was crowded.  When I succeeded in making my way to a counter the man behind the counter spoke to me in Welsh until he found I was a stranger.  The Welsh language has an urban position and, therefore, has a strength which the Irish has not, merely because Irish is only the language of some remote areas of some country districts.  I think if the language is to be saved, it must be dominant in at least one urban area, it must be given that amount of backing, that amount of development, of wider use.  It seems to me that the key position, from the point of view of the salvation of the Irish language, is Galway City.  There is no other town of any size that may so easily be made an Irish-speaking urban area.  One of the biggest Gaeltacht areas in the whole country lies right at its door. Large numbers of the actual citizens of the city itself speak Irish.  Certain steps have been taken towards Gaelicising the City of Galway.  A good deal has been done in the University College and I understand there is a steady and gradual progress there.  The Irish speaking battalion of the Army has been stationed there, and I have no doubt that their presence has had an effect on the use of the language in the City.  I remember walking the streets one evening and I actually saw and heard a soldier &ldquo;picking up&rdquo; a girl &ldquo;through the medium of Irish&rdquo;. The Guards use the language a good deal.  I was in Connemara recently with a Deputy.  At one point we were not sure of the road.  There were two <Col N="737" /> Civic Guards standing on the side of the road.  My friend spoke to them in English.  They answered him in Irish and asked had he no Irish.  I do not think they recognised who we were till I took up the running.  A certain number of things therefore are being done&mdash;I am not trying to enumerate them.  I think the Government ought to consider what further things can be done both by way of compulsion, which carries us a certain distance and which is necessary, but still more by way of inducement. There is a small sum in the Estimate for the Taibhdhearc, the Gaelic theatre in Galway.  I have not actually seen any performances in that theatre for some time but I have read what was to be found in the newspapers in regard to it.  I think the time has come when additional help ought to be given to it.  When it was first established it was given a subsidy of £600. It has done a great deal of work since and has maintained its activities steadily.  It has got a certain repertory of plays.  It has got a certain trained personnel.  It has aroused a certain amount of public interest and has attracted support.  I was not in favour of giving very much money at the beginning because in the beginning of such a venture there is nothing easier than to indulge in big expenditure and incur a good deal of waste.  However, a thing like that reaches a point when without further help no further progress can be made.</P>
    <P>I think we can take it that there is little prospect of any dramatic movement of any value in Irish taking place except in Galway.  The work that may be done in Dublin may have some value, but it is going to be artificial; there are going to be nothing but artificial audiences, people who will go in to listen to a certain amount of Irish, not to see a play that happens to be in Irish.  You have, in the capital, a tremendous amount of competition in every sort of public entertainment.  I think whatever value the language will have as a dramatic language in Dublin is going to be partly for school children and just as a stimulus, but I <Col N="738" /> think there is going to be no real growth; it is going to attain no importance and is going to produce no literary movement.  In Galway the situation is different.  I was in the Taibhdhearc when plays were going on. I saw there old women in shawls enjoying the performance and young children from the Claddagh following the Irish perfectly.  I think there is a possibility of the Taibhdhearc in Galway producing results in Irish comparable to the results that were produced by the Abbey Theatre in English.  The Taibhdhearc in Galway, as far as I can judge, has made great progress in the last year or two.  It will not be able to make much further progress on present lines.  I think it can only go to real success if it is able to establish a small, permanent group of players.  The actors now come and go.  A great many of them are students, who go away after two or three years and other people come into their places.  For various reasons, I think it is necessary that there should be some permanent group who would be paid; they would not require high pay in a city such as Galway.  The Minister ought to make up his mind to increase the subsidy of £600 to, say, four times that amount.  I think that such a subsidy would give very considerable results.  I do not want to find fault with other forms of expenditure on Irish in the country, but probably better results could be got from that than from certain other things.  It is a matter of life and growth and real development.</P>
    <P>I should like to speak about one other matter before I sit down.  It is connected with the same subject.  The Minister for Lands is not here, but I should like to speak about the Gaeltacht colony which has been established in County Meath.  There has been a great deal of interest in that colony.  Columns have been occupied in the newspapers with interviews and accounts of those people.  Probably there is an idea abroad that great results for the Irish language are going to spring from it.  I think unduly high expectations have been formed about the thing and that harm may be done if they are disappointed. I should like to hear what the Minister <Col N="739" /> for Lands has to say about it, but it seems to me that an experiment like that, though very interesting and bound to attract a good deal of public attention, has no chance of success.</P>
    <P>I would like it to succeed; I hope I am wrong in my view, but I do not think it likely that the people who have been transferred to County Meath will be speaking anything but English after a very short number of years.  So far as I can gather, something like 200 persons are to be transferred.  They are going to be a very small group in the midst of an English speaking population. They are going to mix with their neighbours; they are going to meet them at Mass and in the markets, and when they go to hurling or football matches, and at dances and other social functions.  The people around them know nothing but English.  There may be some who know a few words of Irish, but, in the main, the grown-up people around them have nothing but English. These colonists for the most part&mdash;the young people certainly&mdash;have both Irish and English, and what is going to happen is that, while mixing with their English-speaking neighbours, the young people are going to speak nothing but English, and, in my opinion, they are bound very soon to lose the habit of speaking Irish.  That is going to spread to a very large extent to the old people, except some of the very old, and I see no hope that a small colony such as that, planted in an English-speaking area, can remain as a sort of Irish-speaking oasis.</P>
    <P>If much greater progress had been made with the language revival in English-speaking districts, the matter might be different, and it might also be different if it were possible to have a colony ten times the size, so that the the admixture of English in social groups would not be so overpowering. It might just be possible that a colony ten times the size could survive as an Irish-speaking oasis, and later on be drawn on, but with the present size of the colony and even with the special school&mdash;and I think arrangements like that are being made&mdash;it is over-optimistic to look for any success.  I am not objecting to the Gaeltacht <Col N="740" /> people getting land in Meath; I am not saying they should not be transferred or anything like that.  I am only pointing out that in my opinion nothing for the Irish language can be done in that way, and that if they are going to be transferred to Meath, they should be transferred simply as a measure of social amelioration, without any expectation of doing anything for the spread or preservation of the Irish language by doing so.</P>
    <P>If, in connection with migration, the Government wants to spread the Irish language, the way to do it would be different. I think the Government should transfer people from the strongly Irish-speaking districts to Breac-Ghaeltacht districts where the people know Irish but do not speak it.  There are for instance, districts in Kerry, which I know of, which are returned in the census as having 97 per cent. of Irish speakers.  I could mention one parish&mdash; perhaps the one I know best&mdash;in which very few of the people speak it now though nearly all know it. If a number of people from that district could be transferred to Meath and their land left vacant for people from strongly speaking Irish districts, the position of the Irish language would be strengthened, because the habitual Irish speakers would go into a district in which there were people who could talk Irish, even if it were not their habit to use it very much, and what might happen is that the newcomers might stimulate the others to speak Irish instead of being forced, as they are being forced in Meath, to speak English themselves.</P>
    <P>It may be that the cost of that would be too great in proportion to the results that might be achieved and that the Government should not try to do very much with it, but at any rate I do not think the Government ought to proceed with any further experiments like the County Meath experiment, unless they were in a position to proceed with it on a very much larger scale.  Even when it is on a large scale, when you bring people into such a difficult position, you cannot help them very much even by special facilities, because you may easily reach a point at which you are pampering <Col N="741" /> them and any people who are pampered will always turn against you.  If you bring a number of people into Meath who are to speak Irish and if, in order to encourage them to do so, you give them this, that and the other facility, the next thing that may happen is that you may have a deputation from them stating that unless they are given £200 per annum per family, they will not speak a word of Irish. It is a very difficult matter.  The ordinary Gaeltacht family which has a claim to land could perhaps be given land individually much more cheaply, and rather than to continue the Meath experiment it would be better to do that and to save the money for some other purpose.</P>
    <P>As I said, the main area&mdash;there may be other urban areas which should be concentrated on&mdash;in which the most effective work can be done for the Irish language is in a place like Galway City, and I should like that whole matter to be explored by a number of people.  It is a matter in regard to which a commission would be very beneficial.  The difficulties and pitfalls are very numerous, and I have not met anybody who could draw up plans by himself in regard to it.  There may be matters in which an individual could draw up all the plans necessary and go ahead, but in this matter the complications are so great that an individual or even a Department, where there might be two or three people who are very competent, may fall into errors, because all points of view are not adequately represented.</P>
    <P>I think that in regard to the Irish language the Government would benefit very much by setting up a commission to pursue the type of investigations which were indicated in the Seanad resolutions or other investigations. For instance, on the question of migration, if the Government do not want to abandon it, they would be very well advised to set up some sort of a committee, consisting of people with different views and different sorts of knowledge, to go thoroughly into it.  In that way, disappointment would be avoided and a certain amount of unnecessary expenditure <Col N="742" /> of money would also be avoided. I do not know what the attitude of the Government is and I do not want to speak in an unduly uncritical fashion.  I am not trying to find fault for the sake of finding fault, but I do think that, without some sort of examination, such as I have proposed, the most effective lines of advance will not be found.  Under the former Administration, there were several commissions and conferences of different sorts with different personnel. I do not say that in every case the recommendations were followed, but there is no doubt that the exploration which took place was extremely helpful in enabling sound policy to be devised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to follow the bad example of those who have preceded me my making a long speech, because I think that, if I did, we would not be finished this side of September.  I want to refer very briefly to one or two items under their appropriate Votes.  Senator Blythe has spoken at great length on matters spiritual; I want to ask a question or two in regard to one or two matters which are definitely material.  With regard to Vote 41&mdash;the Department of Local Government and Public Health&mdash; I would suggest to the Minister that he should use whatever powers he may possess to require local authorities to exercise greater supervision over the distribution of food for human consumption than they do.  Anybody who sees the manner in which meat for human consumption is handled in the City of Dublin must be amazed that there is not a greater amount of disease than does prevail.  Butchers are allowed to hang carcases and parts of carcases outside shops, and to display meat on the footpaths on rough tables and benches, where it is swept repeatedly by clouds of dust conveying germs and microbes from the streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen lorries conveying carcases from the centre of the city out to the suburbs, the meat being covered by a few dirty-looking sacks and with part of the carcase sticking out and quite exposed to dust, dirt and microbes flying about.  Sometimes the <Col N="743" /> sacks blow off and there is no protection at all.  I think that is a scandalous state of affairs, particularly in a city like this.  I cannot imagine that the Corporation and its officials are doing their duty in allowing such a state of affairs, which constitutes a grave menace to public health, to continue. I am not informed, unfortunately, as to what the powers of the Minister in the matter are, but if he has powers, I suggest he should use them, and, if he has not, he should take the earliest opportunity of obtaining these powers from Parliament.  Another matter which is dealt with in a most obnoxious way is the conveyance of bread.  I see bread-vans loaded not only inside but with the roofs covered with bread, with no covering whatever. These are again exposed to dust and germs flying about and are handled by the Lord knows how many people before they reach the consumer.  I think a little more supervision is exercised in the case of milk, but I think that there also a certain amount of tightening up is required.  Certainly in regard to the distribution of fresh meat and bread, the local authorities in Dublin are not doing their duty and it is, I think, the duty of the Minister to see that the present position is remedied.</P>
    <P>The other matter to which I wish to refer is in regard to Vote 65&mdash;the Department of Defence.  I think the Department should be thoroughly ashamed of itself for the manner in which it treats its civilian workers.  I am referring now to the workers employed in fairly large numbers at the Curragh Camp.  These workers are not allowed an annual holiday of even one week, and, so far as I know, they are not allowed to take it even at their own expense.  That treatment on the part of a Government Department is, in my opinion, a disgrace.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has thought it good policy, and I agree with him, to bring in legislation to require private employers to give at least one week's holiday to their workers, without loss of pay, while the Minister for Defence down at the Curragh denies that right to his own workers. These men are treated in the main <Col N="744" /> very badly.  If they are absent for even one day from work, their pay is stopped, but nobody is paid to do the work which they have to neglect by their illness, so that it either has to be done without extra payment by their colleagues or brought up to date by themselves when they return.  The net result is that for every day a man is absent through sickness, the Department of Defence makes a profit.  The State is supposed to set an example with regard to employment and I think the refusal to grant a holiday is absolutely indefensible.  I trust that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will see that his Bill or, at all events, the principles of his Bill, apply to this State Department.</P>
    <P>I want to say one other word in connection with the Votes for the Department of Justice and the Gárda Síochána.  It is in reference to the preservation of public order.  There is no use talking of the financial position of the country, or the prospects of prosperity, unless there is security here for all our citizens.  During the past few days disgraceful acts of hooliganism have been perpetrated in certain parts of the country, in which a church, public halls and even private residences have been attacked and, in some cases, burned to the ground.  No doubt, the hooligans who were responsible for these cowardly acts would seek to justify them as reprisals for what has been happening in Belfast. In other words, the deeds of criminal rowdies in that city were to be avenged here on law-abiding and inoffensive citizens of this State, by elements who themselves had no respect whatever for the laws of this or any other State. Whatever other national shortcomings we may have, we can, at least, say that up to the present no citizen of the State has suffered because of his religion, in person, in property or in opportunities for advancement.  We must jealously and vigorously guard that proud tradition.  Freedom of conscience is one of the very elements of human liberty, and any nation that denies that right to any section of its people stands self-condemned before the world.</P>
    <P>The law of the jungle may prevail <Col N="745" /> in certain districts in Belfast for the time being, but that is no reason why anybody, or any set of persons in this State, should seek to bring upon this community the humiliation and the shame which attaches to the whole of the citizens of Belfast, because of the incidents of the last few weeks, although, in all probability, nine-tenths of them, irrespective of their religion or politics, deplore and abhor the acts that have taken place. I am glad to see that the Government has acted promptly, and with vigour, although unfortunately not in time to prevent a certain amount of damage being done.  However, it is desirable that the Minister for Justice should make it clear beyond any possibility of misunderstanding, that any attempt at repetition of the acts of the past few days will be dealt with with all the power and vigour of the law.  Hooligans who go out to destroy and to burn public and private property, and to endanger human lives by stone-throwing and other acts of violence, are public enemies of a very dangerous kind and should be dealt with as such.  I think the meetings and the band parades, led by people with axes of their own to grind, for the purpose of fanning the flames of religious bigotry, should not be tolerated.  It is speeches made at meetings by elements of that kind that give the hooligans justification for the cowardly deeds they perpetrate afterwards.  No matter whether it is in Galway, Limerick, Clones or anywhere else, if anyone attempts to arouse here the type of bigotry and blackguardism that has brought disgrace elsewhere, they should be dealt with as public enemies, and without mercy.  If the troops and the police in Belfast acted with the same vigour as the troops and the police acted at Lahore in somewhat similar circumstances, peace would come much earlier to that distracted city.</P>
    <P>However, we are mainly concerned with maintaining clean hands and a clean record in this State and with protecting all our citizens from molestation of any kind.  The manner in <Col N="746" /> which the people, as a whole, have revolted against the few dirty deeds perpetrated, is a clear indication to those, both inside and outside our borders, that freedom of conscience and freedom of worship is not merely a theory in this State, but a fact firmly and immovably entrenched in our Constitution, and what is more important still, in the hearts of the people.  I trust, however, that the State which is charged with the protection of all its citizens will with the minimum delay make it clear that there is going to be no toleration and no sympathy for any persons who would seek to provoke religious bigotry or strife in this State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few observations on the speech of Senator Blythe in reference to the Irish language.  If I understood him rightly, he suggested that clearances should be made in the Breac-Ghaeltacht and that people should be taken from the Fior-Ghaeltacht and put into the Breac-Ghaeltacht.  That is a most dangerous idea for him to harbour in his mind.  Let us take an example. County Clare is Breac-Ghaeltacht and Galway is Fior-Ghaeltacht.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Senator propose to clear the people out of County Clare in order to let the people of Connemara in?  What sort of humbug is that?  The Senator said something that I think was very helpful. He stated that the City of Galway which, of course, is in either Breac-Ghaeltacht or Fior-Ghaeltacht should, if possible, be made a centre of Irish-speaking citizens.  If that can be done, it will be most desirable.  It would be very difficult, because, in the course of some inquiries I made in the last fortnight, I found that not a single member of the Harbour Commissioners of Galway is able to speak Irish.  What is more unfortunate, they have an aversion to speaking Irish.  That is the misfortune of the situation.  I suggest, as the only possible way of restoring the Irish language, that it <Col N="747" /> should be spoken, if possible, by educated men, and that men of genius should write in that language.  It was in that way the English language was popularised and established.  I think that is the only way in which the Irish language can be reasonably popularised and established.  There are great numbers of people growing up with a good literary knowledge of the Irish language who can speak it but who do not.  Again, a number of people who become masters of Irish for the purpose of getting into public appointments, once they get into these positions, speak the English language and not one word of Irish.  I suppose it is not good form.  I wonder if it would be possible to have some one Department Irish-speaking from roof to floor.  That might be possible.  I wonder would it be possible to get members of the Seanad who know Irish to speak it.</P>

In reference to other matters, I think when Christianity is assailed it is a poor thing that people who call themselves Christians, should be attacking one another in the way that has occurred in this country in the last few days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">

      <P>I agree with what Senator Blythe said about the migration of people from the West.  I was a member of several commissions that inquired into that question and whenever migration was proposed I opposed it, because I knew quite well that in a short time no Irish would be spoken in the new colony.  If migrants were taken to the Breac-Ghaeltacht where the people talk a little Irish it might be of some advantage.  Otherwise, I think it means changing a body of good Irish speakers into English speakers. With regard to what Senator Comyn said about having books written in Irish, I am sorry to say that I am not able to write in Irish, but I have written a book that will be published in Irish.  Anyone who can should have their books translated into Irish.  That would be a good way of helping the language.  As to the annuities, which are troubling members of all Parties very much, I was glad to hear Senator Blythe's remarks.  At one time he was not so keen in that respect.  However, what is past is past.  I think something will have to be done because I have seen the whole country on the point of being broken up on such questions.  I do not venture to suggest to the House what should be done.  I know from long residence in this country, and from following every agitation that arose in it, that people who own land have never refused to pay annuities or rents or anything else unless forced by bad times.  I can go back as far as 1878 and 1879, when the Land League began, and I know the difficulties that had to be faced at that time when the people were in a terribly bad way.  They could not pay their rents.  The reasons were twofold, because the crops had failed owing to bad seasons, and the price of cattle had <Col N="749" /> fallen as it is falling now.  The people were at the end of their resources and nothing could be done for them despite the ability, the energy and the oratorical power of men like William O'Brien and Tim Healy.  These leaders had the greatest difficulty in getting the people, even those who could pay, not to pay.  I think the people at present are in a difficulty and that consideration will have to be given to it.  I do not know what that consideration will be until it is thought out.  Perhaps the sooner these things are thought out the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters to which I should like to refer.  Senator Blythe referred to what he called the unseen taxes, which he computed at £3,300,000.  The yield of these taxes is supposed to reach the farmers by way of subsidies on wheat, subsidies on sugar beet, and other things.  In my experience and opinion, and in the opinion of other people, these bounties do not reach the farmers. That is one of the big faults of the whole system of bounties and subsidies. If that system is to be pursued as a national matter in order to save the agricultural situation, I think that the Minister should see that these bounties do reach the farmers.  In the case of sugar beet, it may be said that the farmer receives a certain amount per ton for his beet and that they are all very anxious to go in for that crop. I should say, in that regard, that necessity knows no law.  It is a question of trying to eke out some sort of living and, when tested, it will be found that this is a sort of slave price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with cattle, I think everybody with experience will say that the farmers do not receive the bounties, that they receive about 50 per cent. of the price that their cattle and live stock would fetch if they had anything like a free market.  Persons in public positions, when talking of these things, talk in terms of cattle only. There is other stock to be considered. There are sheep and pigs, and then there are live-stock products of all sorts to be taken into consideration. <Col N="750" /> All these have to carry their own costs and all these do not receive the subsidies intended for them.  I saw where somebody in authority, somebody who, I thought, would be competent to express an opinion, said that there was a vested interest by some people or some class in the economic war.  I do not know whether that is so or not. I do not know whether there is a vested interest in between the farmer and the State.  Whether this vested interest receives some portion of these bounties and subsidies I do not know, but there is something between the farmer and the State which prevents him from receiving what the State intended he should receive.  When I speak about the subsidies and bounties in that way it does not mean that I give them my approval.  I think that we must go to the root of the matter before there will be any cure.  When people talk in a general way about the economic war, they forget that there is another war&mdash;a tariff war&mdash; which is distinct from what is called the &ldquo;economic war.&rdquo;  That tariff war bears heavily on the producer.  It prevents him from receiving a fair price for his live stock and other products. It limits his market.  It does that in addition to limiting his price.  We have had that experience.  Since protection and tariffs were instituted, our markets have been limited.  It is more difficult to sell live stock and agricultural products abroad in quantity than ever it was.</P>
    <P>The time is coming when the Government's policy in this regard will fail and I suggest that the industrial end of that policy must also fail.  If the farmers' market is restricted and his earning power affected, his purchasing power will be reduced and, consequently, he will not be able to buy the products of the industries we are establishing at such great cost to the State.  We are not going to have that self-sufficiency or balance intended by the Government and, therefore, I think the policy must fail.  We have been told that this self-sufficient policy will prevail and that we will find a market for our produce at home.  We have been told by several men&mdash;they were <Col N="751" /> complimented by the Minister for Agriculture on their knowledge and I myself was glad to receive a good deal of information from them&mdash;that it was quite impossible that the surplus products could be consumed or retained at home.  It is intended that the industrial revival will absorb the surplus products of agriculture.  These men compute that it will take at least 50 years, and perhaps 100 years, before the population is sufficiently increased to absorb the surplus products of agriculture.  I want to know what is to happen in the meantime.  I know what is happening.  Farmers are carrying on under great privations.  I do not care who denies that because I know it is a fact.  The small holders, especially, are carrying on under great privation.  They have to sell their stock-in-trade.  Some of them have to sell their cows.  Some of the widows, for whom the Widows' and Orphans' Pension Bill was intended, have had to sell a few cows and, in some cases, all but one cow.  In addition, they have to pay a man to work the farm and they have to pay the annuities and rates.  These matters require consideration by this House and by the Government.  The Government have largely impaired the earning power of the farmer.  They have cut down the farmer's prices and the bounties and subsidies have not reached the farmer, so that I hold the Government is responsible for the present position. As suggested by many speakers, the Government should consider whether the time has not come to remit the annuities&mdash;or the halved annuities as they are called.  If they were multiplied by 10, it would be nearer the actual position.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words about transport, which intimately affects farmers.  If they have not efficient transport, they cannot compete under modern conditions.  The railway companies are beginning to take up the local lorries.  Every public representative knows that in every village there is a locally-owned lorry for hire.  These local lorries are used for carting grain, hay and building materials to and <Col N="752" /> from the farms.  We have been told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the railways must supply an alternative service in any case where they take over a lorry, or lorries, and that they must give fair compensation. I do not think that they could possibly give the service that these local lorries are giving and it is a hardship and restraint on farmers that this should happen.</P>
    <P>A matter came to my notice recently in connection with a deposit receipt. A sum of a little over £100 was lodged on deposit in the bank in two names by poor people, who were frugal and thrifty all their lives.  These poor people are now considering what they will do with the deposit&mdash;whether they will take it out and put it in the old tin pot.  The Minister and the Government have become so eager to collect taxation that they propose to collect death duties on these deposits when they amount to over £100.  In such cases as that, I think there should be a remission and that these deposits should not be subject to death duties.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I wish to refer is connected with education.  I am not much of an expert in education but I have had several conversations with people who were interested in it, and who seem to think it a pity that such things as elementary economics, drill and music are not taught in the primary schools, even in a small way.  They seem to think that these subjects should be taught and, after considering the matter, I agree with them.  The pupils would make better citizens, they would have more ability for competition in life, they would know more of things about them, and they would have a fuller and, probably, a happier life if these subjects were taught them.</P>

      <P>I should like to say a few words about the matter to which Senator O'Farrell referred&mdash;that is, impressing on the Government the need for action in putting down the conduct of those hooligans to which he alluded.  So far as the members of the community to which I belong are concerned, I do not believe any of <Col N="753" /> them have any doubt whatever that our Government is going to do its duty.  We believe absolutely that our Government will take every possible precaution to make an end of these scandals.  We have no doubt of it whatever.</P>

      <P>This debate has been largely concerned with wars.  We heard about the Irish war, the economic war, the tariff war, the great war, which we all remember and have reason to regret, and the several small wars in which we ourselves were concerned. So far as the Irish war is concerned, I am just as much in favour of the spread of the Irish language as anybody in this House or outside it.  Last year, I drew attention to the system in the schools in this city whereby boys are given holidays at the end of June and girls at the end of July.  That is the position, generally speaking.  People like myself, who want to bring their children to the seaside or to the Gaeltacht have to send the boys one month and the girls another month.  At present, I have four boys in the Gaeltacht. The girls got their holidays only the other day.  That is not much encouragement for me to teach them Irish.  I have to do it, of course.  It is forced on me.  I have to send the boys down and keep them in a house in the Gaeltacht and, when they are finished, I have to send down the girls and keep them there again for another month, whereas, if the boys and girls got holidays at the same time, I could take a cottage and go down and learn Irish myself as well as the children. I raised this point last year, but no notice was taken of it.  On the other hand, while such things as we are aware of are happening in this country at present, Irish, to my mind, does not matter very much.  When I think of the things happening in Belfast, Portadown, Clones, Limerick, Kilmallock, Galway, and, I understand, to-day in Sligo&mdash;when one thinks of these things and when one sees in the newspapers that people are collecting a lot of nags&mdash;they call them horses&mdash;to ride into towns, and then go around from factory to factory <Col N="754" /> calling on the Catholics to come out on strike unless the Protestants are dismissed, and when one reads that in Belfast and Portadown the Protestants go around calling on all their fellow-Protestants to come out on strike unless the Catholics are dismissed from their jobs, one has to ask himself&mdash;are we civilised.</P>
      <P>The people who do that sort of thing profess to be Christians, but are they?  They are Christians, and they curse the Pope and they curse King Billy.  They do all that kind of thing, and they will tell you that they are doing it all for the love of God.  They forget that God Almighty Himself said that you cannot love God without loving your neighbour.  It is sadder still that the Government of Northern Ireland did not deal firmly with the situation when it started there.  They should have got out all their forces to teach those people &mdash;I do not care on which side &mdash; a lesson.  As a matter of fact they were not all on the Protestant side.  There is a certain low class in Belfast that cannot be called Christians.  They are savages.  They will cut a man's throat or they will shoot him because he is a Catholic, and, unfortunately, on the other side we have a few who will do that kind of thing.  Some misguided people in the Free State think that it will help our Catholic fellow-men in the North if they go into a factory and tell Catholics not to work there unless the Protestants are dismissed.  I appeal to all our people, whether they are in the North or the South, to forget all that.  God knows we have had enough wars in this country, but if we are going to have a religious war, and if anyone is going to encourage it, I do not know where it is going to end.  I fear it is going to end badly.</P>

      <P>I intend to ask the indulgence of the Seanad in this matter and to permit me to defer making any lengthy reply on this stage of the Bill to the various speeches that have been made. <Col N="755" /> I do not know whether I can really consider Senator MacLoughlin seriously. I do not think he expects to be treated very seriously himself on occasions.  I think that he feels his role here is rather more to amuse than to instruct, and I confess I find him very much more amusing than instructive.  He asked when we intended to commence the paring process, particularly as applied to the Gárda and the Army.  The Senator has a very short memory, indeed.  He will remember that in the year 1933 there was a Bill here which proposed to do a little paring so far as the cost of the Gárda was concerned, and he was one of those who led the Party in the Seanad which defeated our efforts to secure economy then.</P>
      <P>I will convey to the Minister for Industry and Commerce what Senator Foran said in regard to the briquetting factory at the North Wall.  However, I would not like him to think that I accept entirely what he said, because he implied that this factory depends for its continued operation upon its being able to import, duty free, coal slack from the other side of the water.  Well, I happen to know that there is a considerable quantity of Irish coal slack available at Arigna, and I have not any doubt that it would be found just as suitable for making coal briquettes as British coal slack would be.  I do not know whether the cost of transport would make it prohibitive, but in any event the material is there, and I do know that proposals have been under consideration for utilising the slack there for making coal briquettes.  However, as I have said, I will bring before the Minister for Industry and Commerce the general considerations which Senator Foran has asked me to bear in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know which part of Senator Blythe's speech to deal with first. I do not intend to deal with any part of it at length, but there was one point which he did make and that is: that apart altogether from the taxation which forms an integral part <Col N="756" /> of the Budget and which is revealed in the Budget, consumers in this country, by reason of the fact that they have to pay prices above the world level for certain commodities which we produce here, are at a disadvantage as compared with those who can procure their requirements at world prices. Well, after all, it was stated in an article which I think appeared in a leading English newspaper the other day, as a result of investigations which took place into the prices which our people are paying for most of the articles in common use in this country, particularly articles like meat, butter and sugar, that, even in present circumstances, the prices which our people are paying for agricultural products in what is mainly an agricultural community are very much less than consumers have to pay in agricultural countries elsewhere.  It is true, possibly, that we are paying an enhanced price for wheat, butter, beet and cattle for home consumption, but after all that is a result of legislation which the Government has undertaken in order to ensure that the domestic consumer here will pay a fair price to the domestic producer.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether, from the point of view of the producer, there is any great crime or any great fault in that.  So far as the community as a whole is concerned, it does not lose, because it merely represents the transfer of purchasing power from one element in the community to another element within the community.  As I said in connection with the question of the wisdom of, and the economic justification for, developing the sugar beet industry here, the matter would be quite different if our soil and population were being utilised to the fullest: if there were available opportunities for utilising the people already fully employed on the soil in some other occupation which, in general, would be more remunerative to the community. Then there would be an economic loss, but when we have land and people idle I think that the community secures the greatest return by encouraging the production of the commodities for which our soil is suited and which our people are fitted to produce.  If we <Col N="757" /> have to subsidise that section of the population that we are asking to turn to that production at the expense of the general body of the community, it is better, I think, to keep them employed in producing wheat, beet and butter than to have, in the present circumstances of the time, to maintain an increasing portion of our population in idleness out of the resources of the community as a whole.  Therefore, while we may speak of including in the prices of these various commodities the sum of £3,000,000 in subsidies&mdash;some may speak of it as £3,000,000 in indirect taxation&mdash; nevertheless, I submit it does not represent a net loss to the community as a whole.  It merely represents a transfer from that section of the community which is overwhelmingly a consumer of those products, represented by that figure of £3,000,000, to that other section of the community which is overwhelmingly a producer of those products.</P>
    <P>What I have said in regard to those subsidised commodities applies also, in great measure, to a very large proportion of our ordinary budgetary expenditure.  It represents a transfer of expenditure within the community. It is not exhaustive expenditure.  Some economists in dealing with these matters are disposed to divide public expenditure in that way, into either exhaustive expenditure or transfer expenditure, to put all expenditure into one or other of two categories and to refer to it as a transfer of expenditure, as, for instance, a social service or an exhaustive expenditure.  Social services are provided for the community as a whole, and very often largely at the expense of the more fortunate elements in the community. Sometimes social services are provided for that section of the community which is living at or below the subsistence level and which has to be maintained as a matter of Christian duty, and also as a matter of higher politics at the expense of the general community.  But the money that is taken from the community as a whole to provide these social services and that is distributed amongst the less fortunate elements in the community, <Col N="758" /> goes back to the community again, because if a businessman or a producer has to contribute to the cost of those social services, the less fortunate people in turn consume what the businessman has to sell and what the producer produces.  That keeps a certain amount of money in circulation, and, above everything else, it helps to maintain those people in such circumstances as to make them reasonably good citizens, to case the hard lot in which they happen to find themselves by reason of the deficiencies in our social organisation.</P>
    <P>If we did not do that then we would have to take measures which would be much less justifiable and I believe much less efficacious in preserving the general peace and well-being of the community.  Provided that these social services are only used by the people who are entitled to them by reason of their necessity, and provided that the people whose circumstances entitle them to be maintained at the expense of the community do not abuse those services, I feel that, generally, there is no economic loss in providing services as widows' and orphans' pensions, unemployment assistance, at the cost of the community as a whole.  I think that what we do take in that form of taxation finds its way back to the community, and I think that, even though our expenditure has gone up here considerably since this Government came into power, there has been, correspondingly, a considerable increase in our revenue, not merely the revenue we have provided out of <i>ad hoc</i> taxes for the social services, but revenue which comes in the form of motor duties, tobacco duties, confectionery duties, amusements duties, and expenditure on luxury articles.  We have derived a considerably increased revenue from such sources, and I believe it is due to the fact that a redistribution of purchasing power within the community has taken place which has led to a considerable quickening of business activity here in all the urban centres and which, I think, has considerably minimised, in the country districts, the reactions of the economic dispute.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="759" /> I am afraid it would take me too long if I were to deal with the point which the Senator raised in regard to those aspects of the Government's programme in regard to the Gaeltacht which the Senator criticised, and which, I believe, he criticised very helpfully, on the whole.  No action, or no decision, has yet been taken in regard to the Seanad's resolution in regard to Irish, but I may say that, so far as the Civil Service is concerned, a committee was set up some time ago to consider what further steps might be taken to encourage the use of Irish in the Civil Service.  In this connection I may say that I feel that, so far as the teaching of English in the Gaeltacht is concerned, I do not think it would be practicable ever to discontinue it, and I do not think that, even from the point of view of the general mental development of the people, it would be a good thing to do so.  After all, it is good to have the people bilingual and to have the mental discipline of learning a second language.  It leads, if I may say so, to greater clarification of ideas, and when it comes to learning a second language, the one which would be most useful to our people, I think, would be the one in which for a considerable time to come, I am afraid, the ordinary social and commercial intercourse of the people of this country will have to be carried on.  That leads up to the question of the requirements in regard to English in the public service.  I am not certain that it would be beneficial to Gaeltacht speakers to relax very considerably our requirements in that regard.  After all, the people who come from the Gaeltacht have a considerable advantage over the people who do not come from the Gaeltacht in the fact that they have, or should have, a very full and complete knowledge of Irish. That gives them a considerable advantage in competition.  I think, on the other hand, that so far as the Civil Service is concerned, the type of work which is demanded requires that persons entering it must be able to express themselves clearly and grammatically, and particularly without any ambiguity, in English.  After all, if they <Col N="760" /> are not able to do that, I do not think they would fulfil our requirements, and I do not think it would be possible to carry on through their instrumentality the very complicated administrative work which the public service entails.  Therefore, I, personally, would not be disposed to countenance any great relaxation of the standards in regard to English.  I know that in general, where a person has a very good knowledge of Irish, he has a certain advantage, and I think that if we were to relax the standards in regard to English, it could only be done if we were to lower the present qualifying standard for our entrance examinations, and I do not think that that is unduly high from any point of view. The person who has a good knowledge of Irish&mdash;particularly such a knowledge as might be expected from a native Irish speaker&mdash;has a considerable advantage over other competitors, and I do not think there is any real justification for increasing that advantage further.  I think that the Senator's suggestion that we ought to concentrate on Galway City is a very helpful one, and I shall take steps to look into the question of the Gaelic Theatre there.  The Senator, of course, will understand that, possibly more than in his time, the Minister for Education is primarily and functionally concerned with the question of the position of Irish in the University.  However, I am very sympathetic to the suggestions which the Senator has made, and, if it can be put up to me in a proper way&mdash; although I will not promise beforehand to give the four-fold increase the Senator suggests&mdash;I shall do my best to deal with his suggestions as sympathetically as the public finances will permit me.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Farrell mentioned a number of matters which relate entirely to purely departmental affairs, and I shall bring them to the notice of the Ministers concerned.  I think I can say the same in regard to points raised by Senator Staines.  Senator O'Farrell and Senator Staines also mentioned a matter which I feel great difficulty speaking about.  I feel great difficulty in speaking about it for two reasons. <Col N="761" /> First of all, the position here is such that I do not feel that I would be justified in saying anything about territory that is not inside our jurisdiction. On the other hand, I do not wish in any way to extenuate the occurrences that, to our extreme sorrow and regret&mdash;I think for the first time in well over a century&mdash;have disgraced parts of the Twenty-six Counties.  I refer to the occurrences which took place over the week-end. While, as I say, I do not wish to extenuate them in any way, there is this point to be borne in mind: that the reports of these incidents which have appeared abroad have very much exaggerated them and have left us in the position that to say anything officially about them may give people outside an altogether wrong impression of the feeling that prevails among ordinary good citizens here in the Twenty-six Counties.  I can only say that when I read the newspaper on Monday&mdash;I was coming back from Kerry&mdash;and saw what had occurred in Limerick, I felt a shudder of horror. For myself I was depressed and harried by the thought of the thing all day, though I knew how repulsive it must be to the feelings of every good Irishman that a thing like this should disgrace us, particularly in that city where we have had a strong Republican movement, and particularly to-day when we have a Government which bases itself on Tone and which tries, so far as it can, to follow the teachings of Tone: to abolish the memory of such dissensions and to substitute for the denomination of Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter the common name of Irishman.  I think that the spirit displayed on that occasion is altogether foreign and repulsive to our people.  I can only feel that it is being fomented by some outside and baleful influence within the Twenty-six Counties.  I can assure the Senator, and the people as a whole, that, when the people who are responsible for these things are apprehended and brought to justice the full weight of the law will be brought to bear on them, and I have no doubt that, if the ordinary law were not found sufficient, <Col N="762" /> special powers will be used to put down and suppress this terrible thing, which, as I say, has shocked us all and which has made itself manifest here during the past three or four or five days.  I am perfectly certain that these people do not represent any significant element in our population, nor any desirable element in it either, and that the weight of public opinion will have already brought home to these people the stain and the dishonour which they have brought upon our State and upon our people.  I know that there is nobody living here in the Twenty-six Counties who has any reason to fear that we shall not always live as good neighbours and honest Irishmen whatever be our creed, and who does not feel that we are prepared to stand by and succour each other in all our needs and to use all our resources to protect every citizen in his life, his property, and in the freedom of his conscience.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Cathaoirleach will give me indulgence for a few moments to reply.  I made three notes with regard to the points raised by Senator Baxter.  One was concerned with the position in the Six Counties, with which I have already dealt.  The other was to the effect that the present Minister for Finance is following in the footsteps of his predecessors in the cutting of the old age pensions.  I merely wish to point out that we have not cut the old age pensions, but that we propose to see that no person will draw an old age pension who, in our view, is not entitled to draw it under the law.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, I see no prospect of the Government changing its attitude in that regard.  I think that the annuities can be paid and that <Col N="763" /> they ought to be paid.  I think that is proved by the mere fact that, in the poorest counties, they are being paid and that the campaign of non-payment is being concentrated in one or two of the best circumstanced counties in the country&mdash;both of them, I think, getting considerable advantages from our tillage policy.  The mere fact that it is concentrated there, and the fact also that, when sheriffs have called, apart altogether from the seizures that had to be made, they paid not merely the annuities they owed, but also the costs they had incurred, shows that there is no necessity for a change in the Government's attitude.  Apart altogether from that, there has been a considerable improvement in the collection of annuities, in Tipperary, Cork, and other counties, which justifies us in thinking that the refusal to pay annuities there was not a purely spontaneous movement and was not one which arose out of dire necessity.  As regards the question of the warble fly, there, again, legislation must precede supply.  Until the Minister for Agriculture feels that he requires special statutory powers to enable him to deal with the warble fly and new legislation has been adopted by the Oireachtas, I cannot make any provision for it.</P>
      <P>Regarding the question of the Agricultural Corporation, I have had some discussions with the directors of the Corporation during the last couple of months, but I am not in a position to say whether, with the Corporation as at present constituted, with its finances on their present basis, it would be able to do anything to reduce very considerably the rates of interest to future borrowers.</P>

I do not think it is necessary for me to bring special pressure on that body to expedite its work.  Most of the people on that Commission <Col N="764" /> are giving their time at very great sacrifice to themselves and a great deal of inconvenience.  I am perfectly certain that they will complete their investigations in the shortest possible time.  At the same time, the investigation which they have been asked to undertake is, I think, very much more comprehensive than has ever been attempted here, and I prefer that they should take their own time to do it so that whatever conclusion they may come to will at any rate be based upon an adequate investigation.</P>

      <P>That is true in regard to the Finance Bill which is the next business to this.  I do not know what has happened in the Dáil but I think they were hoping to adjourn this evening and if we had disposed of the Finance Bill by 6.30 o'clock or so I think the understanding was that the action of the Seanad in regard to it would be reported to the Dáil.  I think they would deal with whatever had resulted from the discussion here.  I do not know whether that arrangement was made or with whom in regard to the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>Undoubtedly it looks as if what the Minister is asking us to do is to suit the convenience of the Dáil.  The Dáil, I think, want to adjourn to-night or to-morrow, and wish to dispose of all legislation in front of them so that they can go off. If we had not such a strange state of <Col N="766" /> affairs in this country as exists in regard to this House one would hesitate a great deal to agree to a thing of this sort, because we are practically establishing a precedent that this House is to have seven days or so to consider the whole Budgetary position. After talking for three days, there is to be no further time for us to consider the other stages.  I think it is for us to consider the position we are in.  Is it any use for us here to consider anything as regards the future? I think if it was a positive certainty that this House was going to continue, that the Seanad was going to be here to take its part in the management of the country and the legislation of the country, it would be very wrong to allow a precedent to be established but, honestly, looking at the state of affairs as it exists, is it worth our while to interfere with the holidays of the Dáil and of the Government?  The proposition certainly would have to be fought if things were not going to be as we are told they are going to be.  I do not know whether this is the time for us to raise a debate on this question.</P>

      <P>May I say that I should not like that Senator Jameson should go under a misapprehension. There are a great number of motions on the Order Paper to suspend Standing Orders in regard to a number of Bills, but in regard to this particular one I think the Senator ought to read columns 649 and 650 of the Official Reports, because he will see there what really is the genesis of the present <Col N="767" /> motion.  It was, I think, the result of an understanding which was arrived at here on last Wednesday, that if the debate on the Second Stage of the Bill were adjourned, this Bill being, as Senator Blythe pointed out, really a one-stage Bill, all stages would be taken to-day.  That is all I have got to say so far as this particular motion is concerned.  I think there would be a great deal more force in what Senator Jameson has just said if it had relation to motion No. 5, but I do not think it has very much substance in regard to motion No. 3 on the Order Paper.</P>

This particular Bill passed through the other House without a word of comment, criticism or consideration.  Certainly the Minister in his reply to-day has said things and has left things unsaid which I think call for some considered rejoinder, and if we are going to meet again to-morrow I think this Bill should be held over until then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not want to cut across the general discussion but I want to make some small reference to the point which the Minister for Finance raised on the last occasion touching this phrase in the Bill, that &ldquo;the Bank of Ireland may advance.&rdquo; The Minister drew attention to the <Col N="768" /> fact that this had a long history and that he was not satisfied that it was a necessary phrase at all.  If that is so, I think that in future Bills it ought not to appear.  We have had avowals from the Bank of Ireland that they do not want any distinction drawn between them and the ordinary joint stock banks, and if this is not necessary, it should not appear.  The Minister having raised this point, following a question raised on another Bill at an earlier stage, I want to draw his attention, and, through him, that of the President and the Minister for External Affairs, to the fact that a similar phrase still appears in the British Appropriation Acts and Finance Acts covering the Bank of Ireland.  That is to say, by enactment, year by year, the British Parliament is giving powers to a Free State institution to do certain things.  It raises a constitutional point and I think that, in view of the developments of recent years, the intention of the Minister concerned ought to be drawn to the fact.  It is certainly an undesirable practice that the British Parliament should continue to legislate in respect to the powers of a Free State financial organisation.  I simply draw attention to the fact and assume that it will be taken up in due course.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the Minister is going to deal with this aspect of the matter.  He told us he had been trying to find out why this was provided with regard to the borrowing of the whole amount of the £17,000,000 dealt with in the Bill. There is, of course, an absolute necessity for the Government to take borrowing powers in this Bill and the practice of giving leave to borrow from the Government bank the whole amount is an ancient practice about which, like the Minister, I know nothing. I should think, however, that Senator Johnson is probably right when he says this requires consideration, and, probably, the consideration he is thinking about is that a figure <Col N="769" /> should be put down in respect of borrowing which would be much nearer the amount required.  The insertion of this clause in the drafting of the Bill saves the Minister a great deal of trouble, but I doubt very much if it would be possible for the Minister, in drawing up this Bill, to say how much money he wanted, and, unless the Minister could put in figures which he could stand by and debate, I believe there is nothing very wrong with the practice.  If he were to come to the bank and suddenly ask us for £17,000,000, I think he will recognise himself that there would be some talk about the matter.  The word &ldquo;persons&rdquo; is also used, but I cannot see any person coming along to advance these large sums.  The Bank of Ireland is the Government bank. It collects all the taxes and the money of the Government is lying there and the loans, such as are described in this Bill, are made there.  It seems to me that the entire clause is ordinary common sense, and I do not know how we could ask the Minister to alter the practice.  Somebody long ago had a good deal of sense when he drew that up and gave the Minister for Finance an opportunity of doing what is required without a great deal of debate.  I cannot see anything very much wrong with it.</P>

      <P>Schedule B enables me to return just for a moment to a matter I raised on the Second Reading, and raised, I thought, in an uncontroversial way&mdash;the question of the land annuities and the Guarantee Fund.  I am prompted to rise for a moment to-day by reason of a certain misconstruction put on what I said by Senator MacEllin, according to the Official Reports of last week.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Senator Toal's colleague, Senator <Col N="770" /> Milroy, developed an argument as to whether a man has a moral right to pay the annuities or not.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course, I never said anything of the kind.  If the Senator will look back to my speech, he will see that I said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Very clearly and very definitely I have no sympathy whatever with the idea of non-payment of the annuities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I did raise a certain question and I did expect that the Minister would have dealt with it.  The question I raised was rather expanded in its conception by, I think, Senator Blythe and I am certainly disappointed in the reply I got.  The Minister ignored the issue I raised and justified, or attempted to justify, the collection of 50 per cent. of the old annuities by the present Government on the same ground that the torturer would justify the use of the rack&mdash;it was successful in extracting certain sums from the victim.  I raised the question and the Minister very definitely and carefully evaded it.  I would prefer that he should evade it if his mind is not clear on the merits of the point I raised, because I would not like the Government to be committed to a decision without full and careful thought.</P>
    <P>If their basic idea of retaining the annuities has been baffled or unfulfilled and if the persons who were originally responsible for paying these annuities are having the full amount of those annuities extracted from them by some process of British taxes on their produce, is it fair, is it equitable, for the State here to exact another 50 per cent. of those annuities?  There is no question of the morality of non-payment of annuities; it is a question of paying more than once and I do not think anyone is going to attempt seriously to justify it.  I am fully conscious of the difficulty of the situation.  It involves something more than a mere &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no.&rdquo;  It involves other big reactions and implications which Senator Blythe, I think, dealt with and which it is not necessary for me to refer to, but I do hope that we have not heard the last word on this matter from the Government point of view.  I wanted to <Col N="771" /> avail of this opportunity to correct the entirely inaccurate construction which Senator MacEllin put upon some remarks I made last week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words with reference to the remarks which Senator Milroy has made.  I should like to say that there is something more than what he has said about the collection, of the annuities. He says that the farmers are paying them more than once or twice.  I believe they have paid more than once or twice and many more times, but, in addition to that, this Government or the British Government&mdash;whichever of them initiated the economic war&mdash;I do not know which of them claims to have initiated it, but I will not go into it now&mdash;has actually taken away the power of the farmer to make these annuities on his farm.  Whether the farmer has to pay them across the water or here at home, he has been prevented in a great measure from making these annuities, so that, besides the moral aspect, there is an absolutely material and basic right.  I believe that farmers should pay their annuities, rates and so on, but I do not believe they should pay unjust rates or annuities and I believe that the Government are destroying or imparing his power to make these annuities in respect of valuations which, as our Chairman could teach us, were made many years ago.  These annuities were based on the farmer's power to make them and to pay them to those who advanced the money. These valuations were scientifically made, but this Government or the British Government have smashed that up.  Consequently, I think there is more to be considered in this matter than Senator Milroy said.  There is both a moral and a material right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 3, sub-section (8).  To insert before the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(8)  This section shall not apply to tenements and rateable hereditaments valued after the 31st day of December, 1922, and accordingly tax under Schedule A of the Income Tax Act, 1918, shall be assessed and charged on such tenements and rateable hereditaments as if this section had not been enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section to which this is a recommendation is one which adds one-fourth to the valuation of buildings-for the purposes of income tax under Schedule A.  What the recommendation asks the House to do is to say that that sub-section cannot apply to tenements and rateable hereditaments valued after the 31st day of December, 1922.  A tax of five-fourths on the valuation of buildings is very objectionable. I must admit that there is a great deal to be said for the Minister's case.  The valuation of nearly all buildings in town and country are very old.  In most cases they are very likely too low, and owners of properties valued too low in the old valuations are not bearing their fair share of income tax. Admitting all that, the Minister has inserted a proviso that this sub-section is not to apply to the City of Waterford. That city was valued, I understand, in 1923.  I have no doubt that the exclusion of the City of Waterford has been made by the Minister because it was just and equitable.  The valuations in the City of Waterford are comparatively new valuations and, for tax purposes, under Schedule A, are probably perfectly proper and right. If it is right and just for Waterford, it is right and just for the rest of the country.  If the House imposes this extra one-fourth on valuations for <Col N="773" /> income tax purposes it will be doing a thing that it is not justified in doing. Therefore, the recommendation suggests that the section shall not apply to tenements and hereditaments valued after December 31st, 1922, the end of the year before the revaluation of Waterford.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the general proposition put forward by Senator Brown.  I do not think a solid case can be made against his argument. Last week the Minister made some reference to the practice of the valuers, that they valued new property rather on the basis of old property which was adjacent.  I doubt very much if that is the practice.  I think it is not the practice. As it is merely a doubt, I cannot give any evidence in support of my contention. My general objection to this method is that there is no differentiation between new valuations and old valuations that ought to be made. Senator Brown proposes that there should be an exemption made.  I feel that it is very repugnant to adopt this method of saying that five-fourths of the value is reckoned as the value.  I do not think there is a precedent for that.  If there is a precedent it should not be followed. If there is no precedent it should not be begun.  Take the precedent and apply it to a man's income.  His income is £1,000.  For the purposes of income tax the Minister retains the standard rate at 4/6, but deems the income to be £1,200.  That might apply all round.  I do not understand the procedure; how the valuation of some property becomes double what it was, or five-fourths of what it was.  I think the system introduced here is an utterly vicious one and ought not to be supported in this House.  In so far as the recommendation is a departure from it, and applies a logical development of the exemption made in the City of Waterford, I support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not able to accept this recommendation, for the reasons I explained at great length elsewhere. Let me again get back to what we try to do under Schedule A rather imperfectly.  We try to tax a man's income and, for the purpose of arriving <Col N="774" /> at a quick calculation, it is assumed here that the net income derived from property is represented by a valuation made between 1853 or 1865.  That would be struck upon a house or building which either was, or was assumed to be, in existence in those days. What are the real facts?  The valuation does not fully represent the income he derives from the property.  I do not think I could put the argument any better than Senator Johnson put it.  He asked us to consider how unjust it would be, if in the case of a man enjoying a real income of £1,000, we said we were going for income tax purposes to consider that as being £1,200.  What do we do in the case of a man deriving income from the ownership of property?  The man's actual income may be £1,000 but, for the purpose of assessing tax, we in fact regard it as being, as in the case I dealt with at length in the Dáil, something like £300.  We allow the difference between that £300 and the net income of £1,000&mdash;the actual income the man enjoys&mdash;to go scot free.  To remedy that we have adopted the method proposed in this section which, we believe, will not do any injustice to the taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it would be contended that it is not just to tax a man's real income, to assess income tax on a man's real income.  I do not think there can be any injustice in that. We may compute roughly, giving the fullest possible margin for errors on the part of the State, but I feel very confident that we would not have done any great injustice to any person if, instead of making this five-fourths, we had made it three-halves.  But, in order to make certain that no injustice would be done, we took 25 per cent. instead of 50 per cent., which would be, possibly, more equitable.  As well as that, there is the overriding safeguard that if any man is penalised he can go and have the house revalued when the other provisions of the section will apply.  So far as a man is in the enjoyment of a net income from property which is assessed at 25 per cent. more than the valuation of the property no injustice is done to him. <Col N="775" /> As far as the merits of the recommendation before the House go, I am not able to accept it, because it would make the whole administration of the section impracticable.  It would torpedo it entirely, and, instead of getting the additional money which we are seeking in the section, we should probably lose very considerably if before the collection began each inspector had to be furnished with information showing when revaluation took place.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, owing to the application of the principle of relativity, all new buildings are valued in relation to the rent which a building affording similar accommodation would have been worth to be let at in the year during which the original valuation took place. It is quite easy for the Commissioner of Valuation to arrive at that, because there has been a continuous building programme going on in any town, and each antecedent building was valued by reference to a similar building in existence in that time.  The chain goes back fairly continuously to the original valuation, which took place somewhere between 1852 and 1865. They are all brought down to a common level and the relativity factor has been applied in every case, so that even new buildings are considerably undervalued.  The proof of that is to look how new houses are letting and what they are valued at in the City of Dublin.  The usual valuation of a house worth to be let £100 per annum, the landlord paying taxes and repairs, is from £24 to £26.</P>

      <P>Even if the landlord pays rates and the cost of repairs he probably enjoys a remission of rates <Col N="776" /> because it is a new house.  On a house let at £100 the outgoings would not be more than £30 or £35.  If we assume that it is valued at £32, nevertheless the total income derived from the house is at least twice £32.  That is the most extreme case that could be put up.  It will be seen that an obvious injustice is done to the general body of taxpayers owing to the fact that a man who derives a net income of at least £64 or £65 from a house let at £100 per annum is nevertheless only assessed upon £32 of that income, and the difference goes scot free.  That is our justification for the section.</P>

      <P>It is important that owners of houses with low valuation should bear a proper share of taxation and income tax under Schedule A, but my point is that Waterford cannot have been an exceptional case.  Why was Waterford excluded from this section?  It was valued in 1923.  I assume that that valuation is now a fair and just one.  Why should not any house valued in the same year as Waterford was valued, or at any time since, get the same treatment as Waterford?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference. Waterford was revalued in 1925&mdash;not in 1923.  When the Waterford revaluation was going through it was enjoying some reduction on the 1913 rentals and it was brought up to the 1913 basis. That is very largely responsible for <Col N="777" /> the tremendous increase in the valuation of Waterford.  On the question of precedent, there is a precedent, though not under Schedule A, for this step.  At one time incomes under Schedule B were assessed on twice the valuation.</P>

      <P>It is a mistake to imagine that the value of large houses has increased in recent times or has even remained the same.  The contrary is the fact.  Rates have doubled in and around Dublin and the income from houses is much less than it was before.  Then there is the question of the upkeep of these houses, which is very expensive.  In many cases, the owner gets nothing out of the renting of his houses.  A Senator mentioned that he had two houses and that they did not pay him at all as the cost of upkeep was greater than the amount he received.  I think that that is generally true.  The upkeep of these houses is very costly and if a man desires to sell his house, he can get no price for it.  People have changed their mode of living.  They have moved into the country and are living in small houses. If the owner tries to get out by sellins, he cannot find a buyer.  Those are the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to the Minister getting the full rate of income tax on incomes derived from house property or any other kind of property, but I object, particularly, to the support the Minister gives his case by saying that he wants to get at the real income.  Whose real income?  The real income of people assessed under Schedule A.  They are all assumed to have a real income based on five-fourths of the valuation &mdash;an equal, flat rate, applicable to all. That is not getting at the real income. That is merely an assumption that they are all working under the same conditions and making the same rate of income out of their property.  The pretence that the Minister is trying to arrive at the real income of these people, assessed under Schedule A, is quite fallacious.  He tells us that they are all on the same basis&mdash;that they are all robbing the Exchequer and that <Col N="778" /> he is going to make them all pay equally.  I do not know how much inquiry the Minister has made in reward to the instances he gave, but I feel pretty sure that he has been misinformed in regard to a great deal of his information.  I wonder whether it would not have been wiser to have found a way of getting at that part of the income which is derived from the increase in ground rents, whether on the part of the immediate owner or the ultimate owner.  I think he could have found a way of getting at the real profit in these cases and that he could have devised a scheme for taking the cream off that particular source of income.  I am not at all convinced that it is a legitimate method of gathering in income tax to assume that everybody ie on the same basis and that everybody who has property of a particular kind should be assessed on the assumption that they are all going to gain in the same way at the same rate by virtue of their ownership of that property.</P>

      <P>The Minister seems to have dealt with this recommendation on the basis that the houses affected by it are entirely owned by persons who let them.  In other words, he regards it as a tax on profits derived from the letting of houses.  I have in mind, particularly, people who are far from well-to-do, who have had of sheer necessity to make arrangements to purchase their houses during the last ten or 12 years, when it was quite impossible to get a house to rent.  Newly-married couples and people in very humble circumstances managed to scrape together sufficient to put down a deposit with a building society or public utility society whereby they were able to buy their houses on the instalment system.  I know dozens of people who have committed themselves financially up to the neck to pay for these houses over a period of, say, 20 years.  They have had to deny themselves many things in order to get a little house of their own.  They are now paying interest and sinking fund in respect of the moneys owing.  Their rates have increased, and in many cases their <Col N="779" /> family commitments have increased. When they bought these houses the income tax was based on five-sixths of the valuation.  There was a remission of one-sixth in respect of repairs. A year ago, that one-sixth was eliminated and they had to pay on the full valuation.  Hot foot on that comes this other increase of 25 per cent. That is imposing a very unjust and unfair burden upon these people.  The increase in income tax must have increased the weekly or monthly burden on people who bought their houses on the instalment system through the Dublin Corporation and other bodies, and many of these people are in poor circumstances.  The fact that all these houses have been valued since 1922 must of necessity mean that they have been valued according to the present-day basis.  If they were not, Waterford would not have been valued on that basis.  To seek to treat them as if they were valued 70 years ago is entirely unjust and unreasonable, and there is no logic whatever behind it. I sincerely hope the Minister will receive the recommendation in a different spirit from that in which he has dealt with it heretofore, because he seems to have dealt with it as a case in which landlords rented their houses and were only concerned with the net profits they could secure from these houses.</P>

      <P>I think that Senator O'Farrell is under a misapprehension as to the effect this section will have on those who are purchasing their houses on some credit system&mdash;through a building society or from the Corporation or by an advance from a bank on the security of a mortgage.  The most of these people will not be affected by this section at all.  In many cases, when ground rent and mortgage interest have been deducted, they stand quite clear.  An example may illustrate what I mean.  Let us take the case of a man whose income is such that he is liable to income tax at full rate, and is the owner of a house assessed to Schedule A at £30, subject to a ground rent of £5 and <Col N="780" /> mortgage interest, £20.  As he is liable to income tax, he pays Schedule A tax, 4/6 in the £, on £30 and deducts tax at 4/6 from the ground rent, £5, and from the mortgage interest, £20.  He is, therefore, left to bear tax on £5 at 4/6 in the £. The net effect in the case of that man of this increase of one-fourth would be an addition of about 34/6 per annum. I do not say that that would be the precise amount but it would be in or about that sum.  Take the case of a man whose income is such that he is exempt from income tax.  His house is assessed at £30 and it is subject to the same charges for ground rent and mortgage interest&mdash;£5 and £20.  Being exempt from tax on account of family allowances and other things, that man's assessment of £30 will be discharged, leaving him to pay tax on £25, all of which he recovers either from the ground landlord or from the person to whom he pays the mortgage interest, so that he has no tax to pay himself. That is roughly true of people who bought houses through building societies or with the assistance of banks or through the Property Loan Investment Company, Limited, with whom there are special arrangements for collection of tax.  They are liable to the Revenue for tax on the interest received by them and, consequently, the allowance for such interest is given against the Schedule A assessment. So far as the generality of persons referred to by Senator O'Farrell are concerned, this change does not affect them at all.  It probably does not affect any person who has bought a house from the Dublin Corporation or through the medium of a building society or public utility society.  Even in the very worst possible case&mdash;in this connection, I think there is a misprint in the report of last day's discussion which I should like to correct&mdash;the case of a person who owns a house valued at £20, free of all charges, the maximum amount in income tax which the owner, if liable to income tax, would normally be responsible for under this section would be 11/3 per annum. When these figures are kept in mind, I think it will be conceded that the <Col N="781" /> possibility of hardship is exceedingly remote, indeed.</P>

      <P>On the section, this additional 25 per cent. on the valuation of houses is going, I think, to produce a curious effect.  I do not know whether the Minister realises it or not.  There must be a considerable number of people in this country who are very large holders of property which is assessable under Schedule A.  There must be a great many in this city, for instance.  A great many of those people are paying supertax, and this will have the indirect effect of increasing the amount of their super-tax.  It may also have the pleasant effect for the Minister of making people who are not assessable at present to supertax become assessable to it owing to the increase that will be made under this section.  If so, I congratulate the Minister on the effect of the section.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Senator Douglas I move recommendation No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 11, sub-section (3).  To insert before the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="782" /> (3)  Whenever the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce is satisfied that any articles chargeable with duty under this section are essential raw materials of a process of manufacture carried on or intended to be carried on in Saorstát Eireann and are not obtainable or likely to be obtainable in Saorstát Eireann and are required to be imported by a manufacturer for use in Saorstát Eireann in such process, the Revenue Commissioners may by licence authorise such manufacturer, subject to compliance with such conditions as they may think fit to impose, to import without payment of this duty the said articles either, as the Revenue Commissioners shall think proper, without limit as to time or quantity or either of them or within a specified time or in a specified quantity.</P>
    <P>The reason for this amendment was explained by Senator Douglas on the Second Reading of the Bill.  It arises in connection with the Customs duties on imports.  There are a number of industries in the Saorstát which, for some of the processes of their manufactures, are obliged to use substances which are imported and on which there is a Customs duty.  On the Second Reading of the Bill, Senator Douglas illustrated what is happening in a particular industry&mdash; the linen industry&mdash;of which he has personal knowledge.  One of the processes in linen manufacture is the finishing of linen and that requires starch.  There is a duty of £3 a ton on starch that is imported.  Starch is not manufactured here, and the object of the recommendation is that starch which is required for the manufacture of linen and which cannot be obtained here should be allowed in duty free.  I am aware that in the linen trade there is provision for a drawback of the duty paid on an article used in the manufacture of linen that is exported.  I think that was stated by the Minister.  Assuming that that is so, you have to wait for the drawback.  It is of an uncertain amount and you cannot take <Col N="783" /> into consideration the amount of the drawback when you are determining your price in your fight with competitors in the foreign market.  Now, a number of our manufacturers, especially those in the linen industry, have to compete with Northern Ireland and Scotland.  The result is that this Customs duty places an undue burden on that industry.  I think a better way of doing it would be this: that the Minister should abolish the drawback and instead accept this recommendation.  He could require the manufacturer to make a return of his entire sales for the financial year and have an apportionment of the quantities of linen exported and of the quantities sold in this country.  He would then charge on the imported article only in so far as it was used in the manufacture of the linen sold in this country.  In that way he would get the same results as under the section, and I make that suggestion to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Senator Douglas put down this amendment under a misapprehension as to what the real position is, because Section 12 of the Finance Act of 1932 contains an almost similar provision which is of general application.  In fact, the only difference between it and the recommendation is that while the words in the recommendation are &ldquo;raw materials of a process of manufacture&rdquo; the words in the Act are &ldquo;under this or any other Act are essential to the process of any manufacture.&rdquo; There is an existing section in the Act of 1932 which would give us power to do what the Senator suggests here and which would be applied in the case of the raw material of commodities manufactured for export such as linen.  In fact, the probabilities are that we shall proceed rather by way of sanctioning imports under licence than by way of drawback.  That is to say, I think we shall accept the suggestion which has been made by Senator Brown. But, in any event, it is not necessary <Col N="784" /> to have this section of particular application to the Schedule as the general power already exists.  At the same time, I want to say this, that that power will be exercised very sparingly&mdash;only after a great deal of investigation&mdash;and after we shall have been satisfied that the materials are required for the manufacture of articles intended for export.  Otherwise, the revenue producing efficiency of the Schedule would be completely destroyed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Senator Dowdall I move recommendation No. 3:</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 25 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first two thousand tons of coal used in the manufacture of gas and its by-products in any gas undertaking shall be exempt from duty and the duty of five shillings per ton imposed on coal under the Emergency Imposition of Duties (No. 5) Order, 1932, and confirmed by the Imposition of Duties (Confirmation of Orders) Act, 1933 (No. 21 of 1933), shall cease to be charged, <Col N="785" /> levied or paid on such two thousand tons of coal as on and from the date of the passing of this Act.</P>
    <P>Senator Dowdall has asked me to speak to this recommendation, and while he is quite willing to withdraw it, he thinks the Minister might consider the advisability of doing something to assist the smaller gas companies in the position in which they find themselves as a result of the tax of 5/- a ton on coal.  As a matter of fact, one would imagine that the explanation given by the Minister on recommendation No. 2 would cover the case of those smaller gas companies because they do carry out a process of manufacture on a raw product.  The remission of duty is given to certain industries, such as foundries and brick works, and the remission of duty has been passed on to the Great Southern Railways Company.  The larger gas companies will not be affected very seriously by this tax. They will be in a position to balance things up, but I fear, from the information that has been given to me, that as a result of this tax the position of the smaller gas companies may be somewhat jeopardised, due to the fact that they are paying an increased price for coal, and, in addition, this duty of 5/- a ton.  It might be expected that some consideration would be given to them.  The recommendation is that the first 2,000 tons of coal should be admitted free of duty.  It is estimated that that would cost the revenue about £10,000. Senator Dowdall feels that the matter may be left in the hands of the Minister to see if something can be done.  I do not press the recommendation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, I wonder has the Minister considered whether this particular section may not lead to a considerable amount of money being deposited outside the Saorstát.  I know that this idea of transferring money is something that is in the air to some extent.  Rumours get around which, possibly, may not have any foundation whatever, but they affect people's actions, and I have heard that already there has been an appreciable transfer of money out of the Saorstát.  It seems to me that, if it is true that there is that tendency, a proposal such as is contained in this section will tend to increase the disposition of people to act in that way.  The difficulty that people might have in holding their money outside the country would relate much more to current accounts than to deposit accounts.  I presume that on the deposit accounts there would be no frequent lodgments and no great difficulties arising.  I do not know how this would affect banks with branches both here and outside.  It might be that branches here would act as agencies for banks outside, and that the deposits would be outside the Saorstát, and that no practical difficulty would be experienced by the persons making the deposit, because there would be agency machinery here to facilitate them.  If that is so, it would mean that the object the Minister has in view would be fairly easily defeated, and I do not think it is a desirable thing that any encouragement or inducement should exist for people to transfer their deposits outside the country.  In certain cases it may have no practical results of any importance, but, for one thing, it helps to put our statistics wrong; it helps to throw the balance of these <Col N="787" /> figures out of gear.  Then, in other cases, it may have a practical result, and I think that, when there is a certain undercurrent of this kind existing, it is particularly desirable that the tendency should be discouraged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have carefully considered the point raised by Senator Blythe with reference to this section and, on the whole, I am satisfied that it will not produce any general tendency to diminish deposits.  A number of reasons have led me to form that opinion.  The primary one is that I do not think that any person who has money can find any safer place to put it than in an Irish bank.  When we look at the position, political and otherwise, elsewhere, I think we must come to the conclusion that money is just as safe here as it would be lying with one of the Big Six or any place else.  After all, apart from that, I suppose that most of this money has been lying idle for a long time and it is only when the people want to use it that they would have to ask the bank to release it to them. Therefore, as is the custom with people when they are in a position of this sort, they will not disturb the money and the section may not affect them for a very long time.  Apart altogether from that, however, I do not think their money would be as safe elsewhere as it would be here, and I think that many of them will come to that conclusion with the passage of time.  There is also the fact that there is no assurance that what we are doing here will not be done elsewhere by other authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>This Third Schedule is the Schedule in which we see clearly the effect of the policy of the Government in regard to the sugar beet industry.  This Schedule shows clearly, when one knows what the production is in the country, the amount of the subsidy. It also shows, when we take it with certain figures that the Minister quoted the other day, the heavy taxation that is borne by the people for such a small return to the Exchequer. I forget the particular figure the Minister quoted, but he pointed out that the return to the Exchequer was less than the return obtained under the former Administration.  The reason stands out very clearly in this particular Schedule, because such a proportion of the sugar is now home-grown.  Of course, this particular Schedule is simply an item of the Budget, but it is one of the taxes that falls heavily on the poorer section of the community.  Sugar is one of the necessities of life, with tea, which is also taxed in this Budget.  I think it is right to point out to the Minister a thing that he does not need to be told, and a thing that, perhaps, he may refuse to recognise: That the continuance of the present policy of the Government means a continuance of the impositions that we find in this Budget.  The other taxes, that are either taxes on the rich or taxes that are luxury taxes, have very narrow limits as revenue yielders, whereas these taxes have wide limits. There will be no appreciable contraction of the consumption of sugar as a result of the tax now imposed.  It could go up, perhaps, a good deal more <Col N="790" /> before there would be a serious contraction and, as I say, this is part of the whole scheme of the Budget.</P>
      <P>Nothing can be done about it at this stage, but it is certainly something that is to be regretted as a feature of the Budget and it has to be used as an argument to try to bring home to the Government what the mere facts ought to bring home to them, and that is, that the general policy pursued by them is going to lead to a repetition, on a more serious scale, of the increases in taxation on the necessities of life.  I do not suggest that the Seanad could do anything at all about it, but I think it is serious in a whole variety of respects.  It is serious in the subsidy that it gives to an industry which has a value but which, possibly, has not a value equal to the charge that it is throwing on the State.  It is not any use at the present stage to talk about the haste with which the industry was extended before the first experimental factory had been completely worked out and before the economic as well as the technical lessons had been learned from it.  The technical lessons were learned in a year or two, but there was an economic lesson which could only be learned by allowing the factory to be worked right to the end and by allowing it to reach the point where all obligations were cancelled and where there was sufficient knowledge at the disposal of the Government and the farmers and everybody interested in the industry to enable a fresh start to be made on the soundest basis possible.  As it is now, we have this large subsidy which must continue, for we do not know how long, and which must be paid by the poorest families in the State to farmers who are on by no means the worst land in the State.  All this 16/4 per cwt., which everybody contributes, goes mainly to where the lands are relatively good and it is quite possible that, even on those lands, only for the present difficulties and for the fact that other branches of agriculture are not paying, the price would not induce the growing of a sufficient quantity of beet.  This Schedule has many sides and I think that the various sides are regrettable in different ways.</P>

      <P>I propose in my remarks to summarise some of the discussions which took place in the Seanad on the subject of the Budget in general.  In listening to the criticisms of the Senators on the subject of these various Budget Bills, and the answer of the Minister to those criticisms, I think it is not an unfair thing to say that he practically stated that it was absolute necessity that drove him to bring in a Budget of this nature, with this system of taxation in it, and that he was very much like the apothecary who said it was his necessity and not his will consented. I think it is fair to look at, finally, before we settle this, what was really in the Budget.  If we consider what are three of the main essentials, the necessities to prosperity in any country, we will find they are cheap bread, cheap clothing, and cheap fuel. In this country, undoubtedly, we <Col N="792" /> ought to add to them cheap sugar. The Budget admittedly denies to the people of this country every one of these things which in any prosperous country are considered essential. There are many other taxes that Senator Blythe dealt with to-day and that previous speakers have dealt with in addition to the taxes on these essentials.  There are many other hidden taxes and a huge expenditure which really directly drive at the prosperity of the country.  If we are going to consider what is good for our country there is no doubt that we will have to consider some method of getting rid of a system of taxation of this nature, because if we do not get some other system established and if we continue to spend so much money&mdash; and already the sources of taxation are taken up to their limits &mdash;there is no doubt that by this time next year fresh sources of taxation will have to be brought forward by the Government.  We can quite easily see, for instance, that income tax exemptions of to-day may have to be revised.  We may also see the school teachers' salaries lowered.  At the present moment we are watching that very thing taking place in France. France is up against the very same thing as our Government, and they apparently adjourned their House while the Ministers are looking around for further taxes.  They are doing the very thing that I am mentioning here.  Where else is the Government going to get the necessary amount of money to carry on if they do not do something of that sort and if some other means of altering the present situation is not found during the next year.  You know that no sane country could go on borrowing money on very hazy security to meet a balance which is not met out of the amount of money collected by the Government.  If that were to go on, this system of borrowing to pay our expenditure over income, we are on the high road that all spendthrifts who do that thing get to.  We are undoubtedly on the way there.  I do not think that it will be possible for us to go on passing Budgets where we settle the amounts <Col N="793" /> we are short of by borrowing.  Therefore, it does look that inevitably we will be forced to the consideration of further taxation of things which are not yet taxed.</P>
      <P>Take one instance.  The Minister asked me to make suggestions as to what other sources of taxation he could have if he took off the corporation profits tax.  And sundry Senators on the Government Benches said we were very good at criticism but had no suggestion ourselves to offer as to how the difficulties could be met.  If the House will pardon me, I want to make a few suggestions to show how these things could be met.  In considering this part of the matter, the first idea that occurs to one is that our difficulties are, in reality, the consequences of our own actions.  One of the principal causes of these is that certain human beings have attempted, in pursuit of their own theories, to interfere with the production of, and trade in, commodities which are the natural products of the country, and out of which her citizens have long been making their living, and, in doing so, they run great risk of destroying the trade of this country and inflicting great injury on its inhabitants.  That is action which has been taken by our Government in pursuit of their theories as to what is best for this country.</P>
      <P>When the Government refused to pay the land annuities to meet the interest on the land stock counter-guaranteed by the British Government, they raised a quarrel with our best and, for many things, our only customer, which led to the infliction of duties and quotas, which, if bounties and subsidies had not been given, would have put an end to the sale of our cattle and agricultural products, and, in spite of all efforts, has inflicted untold injury and loss.  There, again, that is the direct action of our own citizens.  The course of trade in these was upset.  Large quantities of them became practically unsaleable, and, to remedy this, the Government have fostered wheat production by bounties which are now to be forced on the bread-eaters for payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to this, an infinite number <Col N="794" /> of tariffs have been placed on goods entering this country, raising the price to the inhabitants of practically everything they need to clothe them.  Some of these tariffs have been of a war nature to prevent British goods being sold here; some have been designed to give a protective market in this country for home-manufactured goods, and others merely to raise revenue for the Government.  If any negotiations are ever going to take place with the British and the North of Ireland people, a thorough understanding amongst ourselves must be arrived at as to which of these tariffs are of essential use to this country and must be retained, and what tariffs can be used for bargaining purposes in making a trade agreement.  The tariffs really necessary and worth while paying to secure the establishment of industries giving good employment make one class; the tariffs required to keep other industries going which give little employment at too great cost to the people make another.  The small factories making materials required for roads and such like things at excessive cost to the rates as compared with what they could be purchased for are also injurious to the welfare of the country.  The tariffs put on goods from Britain for war purposes to prohibit their sale in this country, while raising the cost of the goods here, are a source of expense and loss to our own people, and the tariffs put on goods to raise revenue for the Government are a most costly and ill-considered method of raising money.</P>
    <P>While these matters are under consideration here, the introduction of further tariffs which would only complicate the situation, must be suspended, unless by special Acts carried by both Houses.  We could never go on, while a stream of fresh tariffs was going on from day to day, thinking that it was any use setting up a body of men in this country to discuss the whole tariff question and to see what action we are going to take in regard to it.  When a thorough knowledge of our tariff system has been obtained, we will be in a position to <Col N="795" /> discuss, on Ottawa lines, the establishment of a trading agreement with Great Britain, settling how British goods are to be admitted into this country and Free State goods admitted into Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  The gain to both countries of equitable arrangements for carrying on mutual trade is so enormous, and the desire, both of the British and the Irish peoples, for conditions of profitable dealings is so great, that, to secure them, both sides should be willing to make concessions in the settlement of the monetary matters in dispute.  I do not believe that any arrangements should ever be made involving future annual payments to Great Britain by the Free State.  Whatever settlement is arrived at it must be one for a definite amount.  If the Free State is relieved of all hostile duties and a remunerative trade with Britain and Northern Ireland is secured, there should be no difficulty in arranging for the financing of the funds to fulfil the conditions of any agreement arrived at; but there is one essential, so far as the Free State is concerned, in arranging for any such settlement.  It is that it must not be made by one Party.  As in the days before the Treaty, those entrusted by the country with the negotiations must belong to both political Parties, and, for this purpose, Party and personal animosities must be laid aside.  No settlement with one Party could give the stability required.</P>
    <P>I believe that the heads of the Government and the Opposition could secure the appointment of a small commission for the consideration of the question on such lines as I have suggested. A vast amount of information which has not been made known publicly must be placed at their disposal, and they must be given time to consider it and to arrive at their decisions and recommendations.  When their work is finished, a small number of our most trustworthy and intelligent citizens must be selected to confer with an equally highly-qualified committee acting for Great Britain, not debating before any arbitrator, <Col N="796" /> but striving to arrive at an honourable and satisfactory settlement which they can recommend to the peoples whom they represent.  How their decisions are to be ratified is also a matter which will have to be decided at an early stage of the proceedings.  I had a hand in establishing a truce before the Treaty, but I doubt whether any truce could be arranged for while these discussions were going on.  It is not a case of the cessation of physical violence, as it was then, but there is still the more reason, why a beginning should be made by our country as soon as possible to do all the preliminary work required to arrive at decisions as to our own requirements which will be necessary for the guidance of our own commissioners.</P>
    <P>No doubt some proposal for a discussion on some such lines as these would have to be laid before the British Government and they would have to undertake to appoint a commission to act for Great Britain, and some undertakings would have to be given as to the ratification of the findings of the commission by both Governments.  I believe the British Government, fully aware of the great benefits which a settlement of these matters would bring to their citizens, would give every assistance, but, under existing circumstances, they cannot be expected to make the first move, nor do I think we can ask our present Government to make the first move on their own responsibility.  I do think, however, that we can ask them to begin with their own citizens and make the endeavour to get the leaders of the three important Parties in the Free State to join with them in a determined effort to put an end to the present ruinous state of affairs existing between the two countries.</P>
    <P>What I have said and the suggestions I have put forward are my answer to the accusations that we, who deplore the conditions into which this country has been brought, have no course of action to propose that will lift our country out of the morass. If the Government have alternative schemes, let them be brought forward and considered, and definite proof be <Col N="797" /> given that they are determined to make an effort to end the nation's troubles.  If they do nothing and another Budget more disastrous than the present one is brought before this country next year, then we can only conclude that either the will or the ability is wanting to enable the situation to be dealt with, and I hope, for the sake of the country, that that is not so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that what I have to say will minimise in any way the value of the statement which Senator Jameson has made. What it means, and what its value is, I will not pretend to assess until I have read it, but I intend to say a few words on an entirely different line, and I hope it will not be taken that I am trying to divert attention from his speech.  In the course of the earlier stages of the Bill, references were made&mdash;as I thought, of a somewhat belittling character&mdash;to the importance of the Votes for certain social services.  I took the trouble of examining the Estimates and of relating those with the expenditure on the same services in 1931-32. Roughly, I found that in this year's Estimates, for six or seven Votes, more or less of the character of social services, such as pensions, housing, military service pensions, unemployment relief and so on, including the sum available for employment on public works, a sum of somewhat over £3,000,000 is provided for in this Bill over and above what was expended on the same services in 1931-32.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the fact that the legislation, in respect of which a very considerable sum has been voted has altered the character of certain social services, like old age pensions, housing and unemployment assistance, has changed the character of much of the social ameliorative code, and introduced into that code certain services which cannot very well in the future be reduced, I consider that to be a definite achievement of the last three years. It is legislation which is of great value to the masses of the working-class and poorer agriculturists.  I made a note of the fact that in three years since <Col N="798" /> March, 1932, very nearly three times as many houses have been erected as were erected in the previous three years.  I mean houses for the working classes provided by public authorities leaving out those provided by private persons. I make a particular note of the fact that the houses provided by public authorities were for the working classes in town and country, and that nearly three times as many were provided in the last three years as were provided in the previous three years under the last Administration.  I make a note of that fact, because I want Senator MacLoughlin particularly, and others who think with him, to realise that the Labour Party, in giving the general support that they have given to the present Government are very conscious that the alternative is the last Government, or its Party successors, and its Party successors are more reactionary than the last Government itself was.</P>
    <P>The tendency for the last three years of the previous Government was distinctly reactionary.  It reduced expenditure on services which were particularly favourable to the masses of the people.  In respect to expenditure the tendency of the present Government has been favourable to these social services which are valuable to the masses of the people.  I would like to make a note of the criticisms that were made regarding the effect upon employment of the present Government's policy.  Very positive statements are made on both sides.  Supporters of the Government make assertions as to the number of persons that have been employed, as compared with pre-Fianna Fáil days, and the other side as to the small increase that has been experienced in regard to numbers.  I think it would be worth the Government's while to find a way of making a true and impartial examination of the facts in that matter.  It is unreliable to take figures, for instance, of the sale of unemployment insurance stamps alone, because we know there are times when a special effort is made to round up non-complying employers, and during that effort a very much greater sale <Col N="799" /> of employment stamps is experienced. Then there follows a slacking, so that employment stamps as evidence are not very reliable.  The unemployment exchange figures are not reliable by themselves either, because they deal with different classes of unemployed persons.  I am impressed somewhat as to the rate of expenditure by the masses of the people and by agriculturists generally by the evidence of the banks and the Currency Commission.  I am not saying that this has anything at all to say to the question of reserves or as affects policy, or the permanent prosperity of the country.</P>
    <P>But, so far as immediate circumstances are concerned, I am impressed with the fact that, taking the average of the last three months of 1931, and comparing it with the last three months of 1934, that deposits and current accounts in the banks within the Free State declined by two per cent.; that the amount of bills discounted and advances within the Free State also declined by two per cent., but that bank notes and currency notes in circulation rose by 10 per cent., at a time when agricultural prices had fallen by 22 per cent., and the cost of living had fallen by about five per cent.  I mention these facts and prices to indicate that there was a general reduction in prices of a much greater amount than there was a reduction in the bank evidences of current expenditure, and I take it from that evidence, so far as it carries weight, that the immediate circumstances of the people are in fact better to-day than they were in the last three months of 1931.  There are other factors to be taken into account, and it is because one has to weigh other factors against these factors that I would like to hear of an impartial examination of the evidence, so as to prevent this assertion and denial of the effect of Government policy.  I have said so much by way of giving credit to the Government for its policy.</P>
    <P>But there is another side to the case. I am going to refer to the Minister's speech of last week, in which he shed <Col N="800" /> a certain light upon the mind of the Government in regard to its policy, economic and social.  In order to illustrate his point the Minister quoted certain figures of the output in 1931 compared with the output of the same industries in 1933.  Those industries were boots and shoes, clothing and apparel, sugar confectionery and jam. He quoted the total gross output value in 1931 and put against it the gross output of 1933.  I think he asked or expected the House to draw the conclusion that the difference between £2,950,000 in 1931 and £4,045,000 in 1933 was the increased value produced within the Free State.  That is not by any means correct.  He quoted the gross figures&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Merely as an indication of the extension which took place in the industries and, of much more significance, as evidence of the increased numbers of workers employed and the wages paid to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to make it quite clear that the figures of gross output are no indication of the value or the improved value of these industries to the Free State.  They may swell the figures and the money values but, from the point of view of national prosperity, they have no value at all. Having cleared away that, I freely admit that the correction makes no difference whatever to the argument the Minister was putting forward.  He put forward what I thought was a rather curious argument.  He showed that there was a certain loss of revenue from Customs duties by virtue of the increased production here of these particular commodities in that period.  He told us that according to the Interim Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee, which he thought some day would be published, it would take £150 expenditure on public works to provide £1 a week in wages for a man for a year, whereas he said that the value in employment, through the loss of Customs duties, was to give a man £52 for the expenditure of £66.  In effect, I think that was the argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But I am somewhat curious to know <Col N="801" /> whether we are to draw the conclusion that expenditure on public works must always be taken out of revenue.  Only on that assumption has the argument any validity.  In that case we have got to take as an asset in favour of public works expenditure the difference between a perishing commodity, such as boots and clothing, and the permanent asset which public works expenditure creates.  If that is not the case, and if it is assumed that expenditure on public works shall be by money provided by borrowing, then these public works are valuable and the argument is very much on the other side.  If the annual expenditure is to be taken into account, including interest and sinking fund, then I think it will be found that the cost of providing £1 a week wages per man for a year&mdash;if one takes the line of argument that the Minister used&mdash;as against the loss of revenue from the duties, all the advantages would lie in the public works policy.  I ask the Minister to take into account the effect of his argument having these three industries for a basis.  He quoted the boot industry.  Take the years 1931 and 1933.  We have not got details for later years and we cannot say anything about them, though I assume the tendency shown between 1931 and 1933 will be continued, and perhaps intensified for the following couple of years. There was an increase in the production of pairs of boots in these years of 138 per cent., while the increase in the number of wage earners was 126 per cent., and total wages increased by 57 per cent.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should have regard to the tendency that these figures indicate, and that the boot and shoe industries are typical of other highly mechanised industries. As you progress with the production of commodities to satisfy the normal needs of the population, you are not going to increase the number of persons employed concurrently, and in due proportion with the increase in the output, so that you are going to have progressively an increase in production without a progressive increase in the numbers of persons employed.  Let us go a little further from these three industries.  Take the case of the sugar <Col N="802" /> confectionery industry alone.  I find that the increase in wages in 1933, as compared with 1931, was 19 per cent., while the gross value of the output increased 51 per cent.  The possibility of people earning wages in that industry to buy the output of that industry was less in 1933 than it was in 1931.  Supposing I take, for the better illustration of my argument, the whole of the 26 industries for which reports have been received for the purposes of the census of production and compare the figures for 1931 with those of 1933.  I speak of the industries which are engaged in the production of transportable goods and I am leaving out building and contracting and certain other public services.</P>
    <P>Without going into too much detail, I find that, in 1931, the wages paid to the wage earners in those industries were such that they would receive £13 in wages to purchase £100 worth of produce, gross value at wholesale price, whereas, in 1933, the earnings by way of wages in those industries was less than 10 per cent. of the wholesale price.  That is to say, there was a decline of 3 per cent. in purchasing power derived from earnings in 1933 as compared with 1931.  The obvious conclusion one draws from that figure is that the people engaged in the services of other kinds, producing values not of a transportable character and performing services of a professional and clerical kind, had to have a larger share of the national income than the wage earners had or the product could not be bought.  If the comparison of those figures for these two years is a continuing one&mdash;that is to say, if the tendency shown in these two years continues for 1934 and 1935, as I think the ultimate figures will prove to be the case&mdash;then we are facing up to a growing problem of conflict of interest&mdash;conflict of interest between the wage-earning class and a non-wage-earning class.</P>
    <P>That brings me to a point I mentioned before.  The Ministry has now been in office for three years.  I cannot trace an indication of the introduction of any single germ of principle which, by its development or growth, will have the effect of supplanting the present capitalist system.  By a continuance of <Col N="803" /> present policy&mdash;however successful it might be in its immediate purposes&mdash; the effect will inevitably be to reproduce all the evils that have been produced by the capitalist system in this country, in England, in the United States, in Germany, in Belgium and other countries, with all the probable consequences&mdash;the perpetuation of a class which owns nothing but its labour power and sells that labour power to the proprietary class at the highest price it can obtain.  There is not the germ of a principle regarding anything which is going to supplant the present system&mdash;not distributism, not socialism, not co-partnership, no idea at all but the continuation of the present policy, with all the evils that are inherent in it.  What makes me feel so grieved is the state of mind exhibited by a passing sentence or two from the Minister's speech, when he took credit for the fact that one of the things they had been trying to encourage was the establishment of joint stock companies with a view to getting an active money and security market here&mdash;to perpetuate the thing which is most evil, irresponsible ownership; to encourage people to take shares in this, that and the other company and sell and buy these shares without any regard to the purposes of the industry, without any regard to the commitments between employer and worker, without any regard to the quality of the article they are producing, without any regard to anything but the dividend they are going to get out of that industry.  Irresponsible ownership is the key to the state of mind which, I am afraid, is being exhibited.  I make these remarks with regret because I did feel, and I feel still, that there are&mdash;perhaps overshadowed, perhaps overborne by other factors&mdash;desires in the Minister himself and in his colleagues to get away from the evils of the system that they inherited.  But they are not moving in that direction, and what I feel as a grievous thing is that, after all the effort of the last 20 years, as a result of which political changes have taken place, costing a great deal of blood and sorrow, that change is not going to be <Col N="804" /> followed by a social, economic change. Unless that social, economic change takes place, then all these sacrifices and troubles will have been in vain.  I appeal to the Minister to persuade his colleagues to go into this matter seriously, to examine the tendencies, to think of the direction in which they are moving, and to resolve not to re-establish and perpetuate all the evils which they sought to get out of.</P>

      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy of the Reeks</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Johnson gave praise to the Government for what they had done in pushing forward social services during their term of office&mdash;the last three years. The Senator should remember that these services were started and built up, to a great extent, by the Administration which preceded the present Government.  This Government has moved very much more quickly than people expected, and what one is afraid of is that this increasing amount&mdash;the £3,000,000 which has been spoken of&mdash;was obtained by overspending of our resources.  If that be so, sooner or later, we will get a situation such as occurred in France, and a situation such as occurred in France recently must sooner or later lead to a reaction which will be disastrous. not only for the general community, but for the wage earners who have got these social benefits in a shorter time than they might otherwise have come.  As to the urgency of finding some means for bringing this economic dispute to an end, I have always held that the dispute was an unnecessary one.  I have always held that the present Administration could have done all they did in the way of industrial development and social services without this dispute.  They could have done it more advantageously if there had been no dispute.  I do not want to paint the lily.  I am not given to doing that, but Senator Johnson spoke with his mind fixed on the industrialists in the towns, while I am thinking more of the small farmer, the labourer who gets two or three days' work on one farm and two or three days' work on another farm.  I am thinking to a lesser extent of the <Col N="805" /> bigger farmer.  From quiet observation during the last few years, I am convinced that there is very definite deterioration in the assets of almost every type of farmer and, consequently, in the assets of the shopkeepers in the small towns.  I notice that there is a reduction in their stocks.  They are not allowed as much credit as formerly by the wholesalers, and the standard of living amongst the small farmers in clothes and so forth is very much lower than it was. I am not speaking of this matter now as a political question.  But I suggest that the Government should seriously examine the position and see if there is not some way of ending this unfortunate and, as I say, unnecessary dispute. Let them go on with their industrial policy and their social services, but that can be done without what is called the economic war.</P>

      <P>If there was one speech that should not be made on this stage it was the speech of Senator Johnson, because it was a speech full of statistics and percentages and excursions into the realms of economics, which it is very difficult to take up on the spur of the moment and deal with in a satisfactory way.  To anyone who has given any study to the growth of economic and social freedom, no doubt there is an ideal condition which is always in prospect and which never seems to be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In passing, I wondered what exactly Senator Johnson had as his objective when he said that there had been no departure from the capitalist system. Where are we to turn for the alternative?  I believe that theoretical objectives, like political plans, are very difficult to realise with 100 per cent. satisfactory results.  The whole process of social development has been one series of expedients and experiments, one generation trying to make use of all the powers and resources it possessed to elevate and advance humanity.  I see no other way.  I do not believe that a spectacular experiment in economics, such as has taken place in Russia, one of the most inhuman experiments the world has ever <Col N="806" /> witnessed, is one that this State would be well advised to indulge in.  We have seen from what we must consider detached and dispassionate accounts that it has involved a period of agony on the people who are the raw material of that experiment.  To subject people to such agonies as a means of testing a social experiment is a method of social advance that we should try to avoid.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that I want to deal briefly with Senator Jameson's statement, a statement of very deep interest and of great import.  He has made reference to an experiment here which has had the result of inflicting a period of distress, disturbance and uncertainty and, I might almost say, economic agony on the people which many of us think was unnecessary, and almost all wish would be terminated as soon as possible.  I have no desire to say one word that could be construed as an attempt to make party capital out of this matter.  I believe that no matter how the situation may have arisen and how it may have developed, the one thing that we are faced with at the moment is this: that the continuance of the present situation is undesirable.  It is undermining the social and financial stability of the State, and its continuation indefinitely can have nothing but calamitous results. Every serious-minded person in the community desires that this dispute shall be ended without party triumph and without national dishonour&mdash;with an appreciation of the national outlook &mdash;and that it will be followed by some period in which the people of this State will get an opportunity of retrieving the perilous cost involved by the duration of that struggle.</P>

Every <Col N="807" /> vital factor, and every worth while interest in the country at the moment, is clamant for an ending, a termination of this unfortunate dispute.  If those who speak for the State are animated by the mentality expressed by Senator MacEllin's interjection, then I am afraid that the prospects are very gloomy indeed.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy define the mentality and not be putting his own construction on a simple question?</P>

      <P>I believe that the situation as between the two countries is, at the moment, hardening, definitely hardening, and I believe that a further period spent with estranged conditions means greater difficulties towards coming to a settlement.  Surely, the merits of the matter at issue are arguable.  If anyone asked the Senator who has made the recent interjections what are the matters at issue, I doubt if he could definitely state what they are.  I doubt if the average citizen in this State could tell you what is the real trouble between the two countries. Surely, it is not too much to ask as a preliminary to a discussion of the price for peace that somebody of men should ascertain what are the issues upon which it is desired to make peace.  I think that Senator Jameson has done a definite service in bringing this matter forward in terms so detached from Party considerations and so significant in their indication of what may ensue if there is an attempt made to understand, and, understanding, arrive at an honourable agreement.  I think that is all that anyone wants.</P>

    <P>There is no use in striking the note of the demagogue of &ldquo;no surrender&rdquo;: that the nation will not have a surrender.  If we have that spirit on both sides then I fear the outlook is very gloomy indeed. <Col N="808" /> When this economic war was at its inception, I ventured to predict that if it was started one hardly required to be a prophet to foresee who could last out longest.  I think it is undesirable that that ultimate test should be brought about: that it shall only be decided by the utter endurance of our people.  I do not expect the Minister to deal with this to-night. It is too grave a matter to be dealt with on the spur of the moment.  I hope he will give it reconsideration and that he will convey to his colleagues in the Government that we in the Seanad have referred to this matter: that we look at the matter from a deep sense of the national life, and national responsibility.  We are not asking that anything should be done to diminish the national status or the national honour.  We only ask that something will be done, at the same time maintaining the national security and giving the country a chance of national prosperity.</P>

      <P>Senator Jameson has made a very serious and important statement.  He has put forward some very well considered proposals preliminary to a settlement of this dispute with England.  I am sure that I am expressing the feeling of Senators when I say that we do not expect the Minister to reply to that statement to-night.  The matter is so serious that we hope he will give it the serious consideration that it deserves.  We hope that when he has considered the proposals put forward by Senator Jameson, and brought them to the notice of some of his colleagues, that on to-morrow or on some other suitable occasion, he will make a reply to them.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, 25th July.</P>
