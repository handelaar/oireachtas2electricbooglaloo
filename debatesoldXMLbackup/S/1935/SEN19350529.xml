      <P>I did not think, Sir, that it would be necessary to raise this question again.  This question of sitting on a Catholic holiday has arisen on several occasions in this House previously. Apart from that, we have a precedent in the other House.  I hope that Senators will realise that to-morrow is an important Catholic holiday, and I think it is only right that this House should observe such holidays. After all, we are not here very often, and, if we meet to-morrow, it will look as if we only came up for the purpose of sitting on a Catholic holiday. I suggest, Sir, that some definite rule should be made with regard to such matters.  It has been decided definitely by the other House that they shall not sit on Catholic holidays, and I do not think it is right to call Senators in here on a day when Deputies do not have to sit in the other House. I sincerely hope, Sir, that we will have a ruling made on this matter.</P>

I think that the House will agree that the Bills before us to-day could be just as easily dealt with and expedited next week.

      <P>There is only one matter to which I should like to refer before the Bill passes.  An amendment was proposed during the course of this Bill with the object of protecting honest people who might be prosecuted for <Col N="4" /> having a deficiency of fats or other solids in milk.  A typical case has come to my notice recently, to which I should like to draw the attention of the House. It is a case where I consider that a great injustice has been done to the person concerned, and I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give the House particulars as to the duties of the analyst in such cases.  In the case to which I am referring, which occurred quite recently&mdash;it actually occurred while this Bill was going through this House&mdash;a sample of milk was taken I might say that the person concerned is altogether above reproach.  She is a lady of independent means&mdash;a philanthropist&mdash;and she would be the last person in the world to allow anything in the way of tampering with milk to occur.  She spends a great deal of her fortune on supplying milk to the poor, and she has kept a large number of goats&mdash;a most troublesome and expensive matter&mdash;in order that the poor people in cottages would have an opportunity of having the breed of goats improved.  A sample of milk was taken by the food and drugs inspector in this case.  The analysis showed, according to the report, that the sample contained 3.50 per cent. of fats, 7.38 per cent. non-fatty solids, and 89.12 per cent of water.  In the analyst's report it was alleged that at least 13.2 per cent. of its weight of water had been added to the milk.  I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary whether it is the duty of the analyst to state definitely what water has been added to the milk.  Would it not be sufficient to give the percentages of the solids contained in the milk? This lady has been put to a great deal of annoyance and inconvenience as a result of that report.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to see that honest people are protected against such things happening, because I think that it is a dreadful thing for an honest person to have it said in a public court that she had added water to milk. That was what was said by the analyst in this particular case.  Of course, no water had been added &mdash; nothing could be more certain than that&mdash;but there you have a case where a philanthropic lady has had her character injured by <Col N="5" /> such a report.  Of course, the result will be that hundreds of people will believe that she is an impostor, and is going behind the people's back in that way.  That is a definite case of hardship, and I should like to draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to it.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Miss Browne in this matter.  I think it is a monstrous thing that such a charge should be made when it is now definitely admitted that milk can be deficient in its butter fats without any water having been added to it.  I think that the Parliamentary Secretary should look into this matter with the view of preventing analysts from making a report that water has been added where, in fact, water has not been added.  The analysts could give the contents of the milk which they sample without making the definite pronouncement that water had been added.  I think that the Parliamentary Secretary should arrange that such reports would be given in a different form.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying, it was necessary to have a certain maximum beyond which the water content of milk should not go.  That was absolutely essential because there are more ways of arriving at a high water-content in milk than one.  Of course, the well-known way is to go to the pump and put in the water.  That is the well-known way.  Another way of getting milk of a high water-content, for the purpose of sale, is to keep cows that yield large quantities of watery milk, and it is impossible to catch a man who indulges in that kind of <Col N="6" /> thing, unless some such section as this is put in the Bill.  I notice that some Senators are smiling, but I may say that I know something about cows and milk, and even about watering milk&mdash; in a professional way.  It would be impossible to get a conviction unless the analyst put into his certificate the statement that water had been added. I know something about this legislation, as I appeared for a number of years in some of these cases.  I am satisfied it would be impossible to carry the law into effect, or to protect the public unless what I suggest is done.</P>

      <P>The point raised by Senator Miss Browne does not arise under the Bill before the House.  It arises under the Food and Drugs Act.  The addition of water to milk does not come under this Bill at all.  I might say, however, in connection with that point that when the Minister for Agriculture, in consultation with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, prescribes the percentages of fats, the regulation prescribing such percentages will be laid on the Table of the House.  Senators will then have the opportunity of discussing whether the percentage is a safe and proper one or not.  The analysis contemplated under this Bill will be very largely for the purpose of detecting bacteriological contamination, a different matter altogether.  But there will be, as I have said, a further opportunity of discussing the point that Senator Miss Browne has in mind when the regulations <Col N="7" /> setting out the percentages of fat that milk exposed for sale for human consumption should contain are laid before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Seán T. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to make clear and explicit the operation of Section 15 of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, which purported to give certain powers to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to control the appointment, remuneration and duties of local authorities generally by applying the powers already possessed by the Minister in regard to poor law officers. Doubt, however, has arisen in regard to the extent of the powers conferred on the Minister by the section owing to a decision of the Supreme Court, and it has become necessary therefore by this Bill to clarify the provisions of the section and to give effect to the powers originally intended to be conferred on the Minister thereby.</P>
      <P>The intention of the original section was that it should extend to the officers of all local authorities in substitution for existing statutory powers, but the Supreme Court considered that this had not been effected by the section on the ground that if it were the intention of the legislation to take away existing statutory powers they should have been clearly repealed by the section.</P>
      <P>The Bill, therefore, proposes to remove any doubts as to the application of the section to the officers of all local authorities and to make certain that the powers conferred on the Minister by the section are paramount to any existing statutory provisions relating to officers under such local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The administration of the Department has, of course, proceeded on the <Col N="8" /> assumption that the powers given by the section extended to the officers of all local authorities, and it is accordingly desirable that the difficulties which have arisen in consequence of the dicta of the Supreme Court should be removed, as it is essential in the interests of good local administration that control should be exercised by the Department over the appointment of local officers particularly in view of the changes which have taken place in the organisation of local government during the past few years.  The Bill is a temporary one and is not intended to settle the permanent relations between the Minister and local authorities in regard to the appointment and control of local officers which it is hoped to deal with in the next session comprehensively by a permanent measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The necessity for this measure arises out of a judgment given by Judge Davitt in a recent case in the Circuit Court in which damages were awarded against the Electricity Supply Board.  The judge, in his decision, stated that he was not satisfied &ldquo;that Section 51 of the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1927 gave to the Board either expressly or by necessary implication power to erect on a street or road poles, posts or other such supports for the purpose of carrying electric lines for the distribution of electricity.&rdquo;  An appeal is being taken against that <Col N="9" /> decision, but in view of the judge's statement, and the doubt that has been cast upon the position of the Electricity Supply Board, it has been considered desirable to remove that doubt by the introduction of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Act of 1927 was prepared and passed for the purpose of enabling the Electricity Supply Board to carry out whatever functions were necessary for it in order to generate and distribute electricity throughout the Saorstát. The Board has acted throughout the intervening period as if it had full legal power to erect poles and posts on roads and streets.  If the position created by Judge Davitt's decision were allowed to continue, the Board would, of course, be liable to have proceedings taken against it by persons who, for any reason, could allege that damage was done to them by the erection of these poles and posts which had become a &ldquo;nuisance&rdquo; in the legal significance of that phrase and in consequence of that decision.  This Bill proposes to confirm and make retrospective the power of the Board to erect these poles and posts.  It is not proposed to invalidate in any way proceedings instituted against the Board prior to the introduction of this Bill. If the lady whose action against the Board produced the Circuit Court Judge's decision wins her appeal, then the amount of the damages will be paid; and, in another case in which proceedings were instituted prior to the introduction of this measure, if it is proceeded with and damages are awarded, in that case also the damages will be paid.  The purpose of subsection (3) of Section 2 is to ensure that it will not be open to anybody to take proceedings against the Board after the date of the introduction of this measure in consequence of the action of the Board in erecting either poles or posts prior to that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only amendment of the principal Act effected by this Bill is in Section 3.  The purpose of it is to correct a drafting error.  Under the original Act the Board was required to consult with the local authority before erecting poles or posts on any road.  The obvious intention of the <Col N="10" /> section, taking it in relation to other sections of the Act, was to require the Board to consult with the local authority before erecting poles or posts on streets as well as on roads.  The Board have, in fact, always acted as if there was a legal obligation on them to consult the local authority before erecting poles or posts on a street.  The object of this Section in the Bill is to remedy that particular defect in the original Act, and to ensure that there will be consultation with the local authority before erecting poles or posts on a street as well as on a road, but without invalidating anything the Board may have done in consequence of the fact that they did not consult with the local authority before erecting poles or posts on a street.  In practice the Board has always done so, so far as I am aware.</P>
    <P>That is the sole purpose of the Bill. Although it is the function of the courts to say what was the intention of the Oireachtas, I think that we can say, notwithstanding Judge Davitt's decision, that it was intended in 1927 to give the Electricity Supply Board power to erect these poles and posts. The Board have always acted as if they had that power, but now that a question has arisen in connection with the matter, and that some doubt has been cast on its powers to do so, it has been considered desirable that these doubts should be removed so that the position of the Board will be safeguarded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would the Minister think it well to insert in this Bill a section making it obligatory on the Electricity Supply Board to consult with the local authority before erecting poles or posts within any area at all-not merely a road or a street.  There is, I think, an understanding that the local authorities and the Electricity Supply Board should consult together before erecting poles in areas that are likely to be developed, but there is no legal obligation to do that so far as I know.  Perhaps it might be well if there was a legal obligation put on the Electricity Supply Board to consult with the local authority before they erect poles anywhere.</P>

      <P>The Dublin Corporation are very interested in this particular question.  They would like to have this position: that where, in the City of Dublin, the Electricity Supply Board contemplate erecting poles, they should consult with the Corporation.  The Corporation objects to the erection of poles where their erection can be avoided.  The matter was discussed at a recent meeting of the General Purposes Committee of the Dublin Corporation.  I would like to have the position that the Electricity Supply Board should consult with the Corporation in any case where they contemplated the erection of poles within the City of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the present time the Electricity Supply Board are obliged to consult with the local authority before erecting poles or posts upon a road and, one may say, upon a street, because the omission of the word &ldquo;street&rdquo; from the original Act was merely a drafting error, and, as I have already stated, that drafting error is being remedied in this Bill.  I do not think that Senator Mrs. Clarke has rightly expressed the desire of the Dublin Corporation.  They have asked for something more than consultation.  They have asked that the Board should not be allowed to erect poles or posts without their consent, and further, that if the Corporation demand the removal of any pole or post, the Board should be required to remove it within a period of two or three weeks of the making of the demand.  That is something which I do not think it would be desirable to concede.  The Board have always endeavoured to conform to the wishes of local authorities in connection with the erection of these poles and posts. Of course there are some local authorities that object to the erection of poles and posts altogether, and for various reasons.  One is that they desire to see the transmission lines laid underground.  That is something that can be done only when there is a very considerable volume of business in a particular area.  If the amount of <Col N="12" /> business offering in any area is small, or that an area is only in the early stages of development, it would be entirely uneconomic to lay the transmission lines underground; but in the great majority of cases around Dublin where the transmission lines are being carried upon poles at the present time, they will, we hope, in due course be placed underground as the sale of current increases.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator Johnson, there is a legal obligation on the Board to consult with the local authorities where poles are erected upon roads, streets, or public ways of that kind.  In fact, the Board have always endeavoured to conform to the wishes of the local authorities in cases where the development of new areas is concerned, and they will continue to act in that way. It is true that at the beginning when there was a considerable drive to get these transmission lines erected, they did not take very much time in some cases to have the whole question of future development examined with the local authority.  That stage, however, is now passed, and in the erection of new poles or posts there is not the same urgency or desire for speed.  Consequently, full consideration can be given to this question of development, and to the erection of transmission lines in a manner which will not merely conform to the development plans of local councils but that will perhaps facilitate them as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to effect a number of miscellaneous amendments in the Road Transport Act of 1933.  Some of them are not of very great importance but one or two of them deserve special mention.  The purpose of Section 2 is to deal with a peculiar type of case <Col N="13" /> which arose here and there throughout the country.  A person who carries his own merchandise in his own vehicle is not required to have a merchandise licence.  In certain cases, however, businesses were controlled by companies. One company owned and controlled by the same people carried on another type of business as another company.  The working arrangement in the past provided for the goods of one company being carried in the vehicles of another.  That practice became illegal under the terms of the Road Transport Act, unless the company with the vehicles received a merchandise licence and, consequently, became public carriers, accepting all the obligations of public carriers.  The most typical case of that kind was where certain people in a town owned a garage or motor equipment establishment and a general merchandise business and where, for private reasons, they had transformed themselves into limited liability companies, having a separate company for each business. One can easily see how it became the practice to use the vehicles of the motor company to carry the goods of the other company and how convenient that arrangement was.  With the enactment of the Road Transport Act, it became impossible to continue that arrangement.  To meet this difficulty it is proposed to provide that, where a mechanically propelled vehicle owned by a company is used for the carriage of merchandise the property of any company which is in the same ownership or under the same management, such merchandise shall be deemed for the purposes of the principal Act not to be carried for reward.  The difficulty would only have arisen where individuals had transformed themselves into limited liability companies.  It would not have arisen in the case of persons acting as individuals.  There is no reason, from the transport point of view, why those concerned should not be facilitated by this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 provides one of the main amendments which the Bill is designed to effect.  Under the original Act, an existing carrier was entitled to get a licence authorising him to conduct a road transport business with vehicles <Col N="14" /> of the same total unladen weight as those which he possessed for the purposes of that business during the qualifying period.  The great majority of businesses were carried on with one vehicle only.  Out of 1,200 or 1,300 licences issued, over 1,000 were issued in respect of road transport services carried on with the aid of one vehicle only.  A large number of those transport operators had a very popular type of vehicle called the Ford one-ton truck and, consequently, they got licences for the one-ton standard weight.  That truck is not now available and the general tendency is to use motor vehicles of greater carrying capacity.  When the original Bill was introduced in the Dáil, a Deputy suggested that it would make for administrative convenience to provide a minimum unladen weight of two tons and to allow operators to vary their equipment under that weight.  We foolishly rejected that suggestion at the time.  We found out by experience that, if we had adopted it, it would have made a great difference in the administration of the Act.  It would have made administration much more simple than it has been. We are proposing to effect that change now and the purpose of this section is to provide that any person who is licensed for an unladen weight of two tons or less will be deemed to be authorised to operate vehicles up to two tons unladen weight.  That will prove a considerable convenience to a number of people who had licences for unladen weights of less than two tons and who have been unable to replace their old vehicles with new vehicles of the same unladen weight, and were, consequently, debarred from continuing in the transport business.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Section 4 is to effect a purely drafting change in the original Act.  Sections 5 and 6 are designed to deal with another problem&mdash;to provide a method by which we can enforce the provisions of the Road Transport and Road Traffic Acts throughout the Saorstát on persons operating merchandise or passenger services across the Border, that is to say, persons with headquarters in the Six Counties.  The only method by <Col N="15" /> which we could effectively deal with breaches of the Acts by these operators would be to stop the vehicles at the Border, arrest the operators of them and interrupt the service.  This would cause considerable inconvenience not merely to the persons actually detained but also to the passengers in the bus or the owners of the merchandise being carried upon the vehicle.  Consequently, it was considered advisable to adopt another method.  Under this method, we propose to issue licences to the persons conducting these services for importation of these vehicles into the Saorstát and to take power to withdraw these licences if, for any reason, it appears to be desirable to do so.  By that device, we can secure that those persons will conform to our laws.  The device is intended to be used only for that purpose.  It will not cause any inconvenience to persons using these services, or to the persons operating these services except they take action which is in conflict with the statutory requirements of the State.  The device is a simple one.  It will prove much more convenient to operate than the only method open to us at the present time and it will enable breaches of the Road Transport Act committed by those people to be dealt with in a satisfactory manner.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question of carrying merchandise for reward, I should like to know whether a point I have in mind arises under this Bill or not.  A rather unique position arises in connection with the carrying of beet.  As I understand, beet, once it is grown, ceases to be the property of the growers and becomes the property of the sugar company. The carriage of that type of merchandise must be undertaken by public carriers and if any mishap occurs in connection with the carriage&mdash;for example, if a strike occurs&mdash;the farmers would not be at liberty to carry the beet to the factories, with resultant harm to the operation of the processes of sugar manufacture.  The Minister will understand what I mean by that.  As the law stands, the <Col N="16" /> growers would, I understand, be powerless to exert themselves to forward their beet to the factories.  I am not sure that I am accurate in my presentation of the point but, if matters are as I have been led to believe, there is ground for some relaxation of the provisions&mdash;for withdrawing beet from the category of merchandise or introducing a provision whereby, in such a contingency as I have mentioned, the growers of beet would be able to devise some means of conveying their produce to the sugar factories.  I am not sure whether that can be done under this Bill but it is a point that deserves consideration when dealing with the question of road transport.</P>

I suppose that is almost inevitable but I should like the Minister to tell us whether it is intended that there should be discrimination as between firm and firm on the other side of the Border or whether they will all be granted licences, provided they comply with the same conditions as are imposed on Saorstát firms, with the additional conditions proposed.</P>

      <P>I think I have grasped the point to which Senator Milroy drew attention.  It has been contended that, inasmuch as the beet, when grown, becomes the property of the sugar company, the farmer could not deliver the beet he grew himself to the factory without having a merchandise licence, as he would be carrying in his own vehicle a commodity that was not his own property.  That position is met by another section of the Bill which permits a shopkeeper to deliver to the residence of a customer goods purchased by that customer in his shop. <Col N="17" /> No merchandise licence is required for conveying goods in those circumstances and the position of a farmer in the circumstances mentioned would be similar.  Beet becomes the property of the company when it is grown&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the contract between the company and the grower, the beet is the property of the company from the moment it is grown, whether it is paid for or not.  I am satisfied that no legal difficulty whatever would arise and that there would be no prohibition or restriction upon farmers delivering beet to the factories of the company in their own vehicles. Another point arises in that connection. The contention has been made by interested parties that the railway company last year was insufficiently equipped to deal with the whole of the beet crop.  There is no doubt that that contention is correct.  The railway company last year could not possibly have dealt with the whole of the beet situation.  In fact a serious situation might have developed in certain areas if certain individuals had not, in defiance of the law, carried beet for reward without licences.  We have to prosecute these people, but, in doing so, we recognise that the transport arrangements for the conveyance of beet to the factory might have broken down if they had not done so.</P>
      <P>The railway companies are equipping themselves with a large number of new vehicles.  It is contended that these vehicles are not altogether suitable for this traffic.  They are very large vehicles, mostly tractors with trailer equipment, and cannot conveniently be got into farms or into boreens which might lead to the farms.  Consequently the railway company had to make arrangements with farmers to have the beet brought to particular points on main roads or placed in fields.  That arrangement was not convenient to the farmer, whereas the other public carriers, with small lorries, could go anywhere and collect the beet at the point most convenient to the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that we have not yet transferred to the railway company <Col N="18" /> any licences confined to beet held by licensees, and we have under consideration the advisability of excluding them from any transfer of licences that may take place; in other words, to allow private carriers to deal with the carriage of beet until the railway company has additional equipment to deal with the road transport business and more experience of the operation of that business.  Under the Act the power of compulsory acquisition or transfer of licences operates up to July of this year, and then for two years ceases to operate, commencing again on the same date two years afterwards. If we do not make transfers of licences before the date in July at which these transfers must be made, they cannot be transferred for two years afterwards.  We have under consideration with the railway company the advisability of excluding beet from any licences transferred to them before July 1st.  If we decide to do that the position will be, that anyone who is a holder of a merchandise licence will be entitled to carry beet for reward for three years without interference.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty in that regard that it is no harm to mention.  Most of the persons engaged in the business of the carriage of beet for reward were located about Carlow.  The carriage of beet for reward did not operate to any great extent in any of the other areas where factories are now established. There may be a difficulty in these areas in giving new licences to people to carry beet for reward in view of the terms of the Act, if we decide to do so. That matter is being examined.  I can assure Senators that we are alive to the beet position and, in fact, have had representations from all the interested parties; that is, the people engaged in the carriage of beet, and the sugar company which is naturally concerned to ensure that supplies will not be impeded in any way.</P>
    <P>There is another argument, and I do not know what validity there is in it, that the price of beet has been fixed for a three years' contract, and that when it was being fixed notice was taken of the existing scale of charges for transport.  The railway company <Col N="19" /> are charging more because they are paying standard wages to employees, whereas most of the independent operators paid very low wages indeed, where they paid any wages.  A very large number of the vehicles were operated by the owners, who very rarely got more than 15/- or 20/- weekly in profits out of the business. The railway company have to pay a standard rate of wages to workers, and consequently cannot carry as cheaply as some of the small operators, so that it is contended conditions should not be changed during the operation of the present price agreement period in respect of the price of beet.  It is not a very strong argument, but it was advanced.  The whole question has been considered and a decision will have to be made in the near future, because the date July 1, before which the transfer must be made, is approaching.  The policy will have to be decided before that.</P>

      <P>The position is that the railway company can apply for the transfer of any licences, and the Minister can agree, if he is satisfied that it is in the public interest, that it should be done.  Heretofore we have more or less transferred licences on application. The consideration of the public interest arises in respect of beet, and the question is whether it is sufficiently great to justify us in refusing transfers. On the question of beet, it does not necessitate special legislation.  So far as Sections 5 and 6 are concerned, it is intended to discriminate.  We could have under the original Act confined the business of carrying passengers to companies established in the Saorstát or persons resident here.  We did not do that.  We decided deliberately to allow Six-County operators to continue to serve here, and we gave them licences. We have only one means of enforcing <Col N="20" /> the conditions of these licences.  If an omnibus company from Derry carried passengers for reward or over roads not licensed for the carrying of passengers, at present the only way we can actually enforce the regulations is by stopping the omnibus on the border, detaining the vehicle or the driver and interrupting the service.  We have no hesitation in doing that in the case of actual owners, because they have broken the law, but they may be carrying passengers who may be stranded on the frontier posts.  In order to get an easier method of enforcement this device has been adopted, which will enable us temporarily to suspend a service, if necessary, or permanently withdraw that service when there has been persistent and continuous violation of the legal requirements here.  The great majority of the cross-border operators are doing their best to comply with the requirements of our laws, but there are one or two who have to be taught the necessity for doing so, and this device enables us to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was necessitated by the lapse of the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Act, 1932, which operated for three years and terminated on 31st March last.  The object of the 1932 Act was to provide a higher price for butter on the home market than the world price.  The great object of this Bill is to effect the same purpose.  We found defects in the administration of the 1932 Act and it is proposed by this Bill to remove these defects.  For instance, in the 1932 Act creamery butter, factory butter and butter handled by non-manufacturing exporters, and others was leviable, whether sold in the home market or exported, and the result was that certain creameries which were not in very good financial circumstances <Col N="21" /> were unable to finance that arrangement, because under that Act they had to pay a levy on production.  They had to wait for some time, perhaps, before exporting and some time longer before the bounties were paid.  In that way they required large capital to carry on business and were forced to sell butter on the home market in order to get ready cash.  The result of that in turn was that there was more competition than was good on the home market, and prices were below what could have been got, without there being any great advantage to producers or consumers because what happened was that merchants were getting butter at one, two or three shillings per cwt. less than the indicated price and the benefit was not passed on. We propose to remedy that.  It is provided in this Bill that levies will be collected only on butter sold at home when it is actually sent for sale.  It is also provided that there will be a minimum price fixed for butter sold on the home market so that there will no longer be cutting of prices between creameries and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the 1932 Act there was a levy on non-creamery butter in certain cases.  For instance, you could collect it from registered butter factories, and non-manufacturing exporters and from those distributors on whom notice was served.  That was rather an unfair system, because in some towns we might have a better system of finding out who was dealing in butter than in other places, with the result that in one place notice might be served on every trader while in another town no notice might be served on anyone and they got off free.  The arrangement under this Bill is that everybody is bound to pay a levy, whether notice is served upon them or not.  There is an exemption clause for small producers delivering butter direct to consumers. Part I provides for the continuance of portions of the 1932 Act until this Bill becomes an Act.  It only deals with those who are liable to pay a levy under the 1932 Act, and does not refer to those who may be brought in under this Bill, and who were not in under the other Act.  Part <Col N="22" /> II provides for the registration of producers and distributors.  Every producer of non-creamery butter who sells to a consumer or anyone else must pay the levy unless he is selling to a registered person.  Part III deals with levies. Perhaps it is as well to be as precise as possible about this.  Provision is made for the collection of levies on butter and other milk products manufactured and sold in the Saorstát after March 31.</P>
    <P>The levy on creamery butter will be at the rate of 39/- per cwt. and will be collected from the manufacturers on their home sales on or after the 1st April, 1935. The levy on non-creamery butter will be at the same rate and will be collected as follows:&mdash;From all persons who were liable for levy under the 1932 Act, on their home sales, on or after 1st April, 1935, until a date to be appointed, and from all persons registered under Part II of this Bill, on their home sales on or after the appointed date.  There is a distinction made there as regards non-creamery butter between those who were liable under the 1932 Act and those who were not liable.  They all become liable on the appointed day, but from the 1st April until the appointed day those who were not liable under the 1932 Act are not liable to pay any levy for the interim period. Regulations can be made increasing or removing the levy on butter, and different rates may be prescribed for different classes of butter.  There will be no levy on milk products until the Bill is passed, after which levies can be imposed at such rates as may from time to time be prescribed.  Milk products will thus be exempt until this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>Special provision is made in Section 20 in respect of the Kerry cattle area in view of the very special circumstances obtaining in that area and the low price paid for butter produced therein during the warm weather.</P>
    <P>Part IV gives power to prohibit the import of butter except under licence. It also gives power to prescribe the rate of levy on any butter that may be imported.  Hitherto the position was <Col N="23" /> that we had power to prohibit and also power to remove prohibition or to import under licence, but in either case if butter was imported it had to pay a levy.  Now a levy is being prescribed here instead of the tariff.  The tariff, of course, will be removed.</P>
    <P>Part V is similar to Part IV except that it deals with milk products other than butter.</P>
    <P>Part VI gives power to restrict the export of butter and milk products. That has been found necessary.  For the last three years it has been the practice to restrict the export of butter late in the season in order to keep enough butter here to meet our requirements for the winter.  Also during last winter and the winter before it was necessary to provide a certain amount for export to certain markets where we had entered into agreements to supply butter during the winter months.</P>
    <P>Part VII deals with the power to pay bounties, and Part VIII deals with the power to fix maximum and minimum prices.  I do not think that it will be necessary to fix a maximum price, but the minimum price of creamery butter must be fixed, as already explained. The price which has been in operation, more or less, for some months past has been 141/- per cwt. for wholesale lots and 145/- for retail lots.  Creamery butter has been selling retail for 1/5 per lb.  If this Bill becomes law that position is likely to remain; that is, the price of butter wholesale will remain the same and the price to the retailer will probably remain at 1/5 per lb.</P>
    <P>Part IX deals with the financial provisions. A fund is to be created and into that fund all levies and registration fees must be paid; they cannot be devoted to any other purpose.  And out of that fund we take bounties, salaries and expenses of inspectors, and any grants that may be given for approved marketing schemes, but we cannot take money for any other purpose. It is also provided that advances may be made by the Exchequer into that fund, from time to time, but such advances must be repaid <Col N="24" /> on the 31st May following the end of the financial year in which they are made.  That system has been carried on for the last three years, because during certain months in the summer there is a deficit in the fund which has amounted to about £100,000. That deficit is made up in the autumn months when levies are paid, but bounties are not paid to the same extent.  It is necessary, of course, to keep the fund replenished during the summer months.  This year it may amount to £150,000.</P>
    <P>Part X is the usual part in all those Bills with regard to the keeping of records, etc.  Under the Bill it is proposed to fix the home price f.o.r. at 139/- per cwt. and the creameries to pay therefrom a levy at the rate of 39/- per cwt.  This levy will be calculated on 270,000 cwts. of butter, allowing for a reduction in the rate of levy on winter production. A bounty will be paid at the rate of 25/- per cwt. on exports of 480,000 cwts.  The position will then be a home price of 139/-, with a levy of 39/-, leaving 100/- to the creameries on home sales and for exports.  Taking the present price of butter on the British market, at 80/- or 81/- a cwt. and about 4/- a cwt. expenses, that would give the creamery a net 76/-.  The subsidy which is paid out of the Export Bounties Fund at the present time is equal to the tariff which is paid, so the creamery gets 76/- plus 25/- bounty, the result being 100/- approximately.  So whether the creamery sells butter on the home market or exports it under this arrangement it will get the same price, that is 100/- per cwt.</P>
    <P>Go on further into this question of prices of creamery butter and farmer's butter which appears to be the question which is agitating the minds of most people with regard to this particular Bill.  We are sometimes accused of trying to bolster up the creameries at the expense of the farmer's butter.  I should like to explain as well as I can the position of both creamery and farmer's butter under this Bill.  To get a clear picture of the effect of this Bill let us first of all assume that it is not passed and <Col N="25" /> see what the position will be.  I have already stated that creamery butter is to-day worth, say, 80/- on the British market and on that a tariff of 22/- will be payable.  Against that tariff we pay out of the Export Bounty Fund 22/-, so we may leave the tariff out and take it that the creamery sending butter to the British market for 80/- per cwt. allowing for 4/- expenses, is getting 76/-.  If this Bill were not in operation the creamery would receive 76/- per cwt. for butter exported and they would, of course, sell for the same price at home.  That would enable the retail shops here to sell butter at 10½d. a lb.  If that were the case we may take it that farmer's butter would follow the price of creamery butter as it always does.  Taking it on the average for a few years and over all the country, it lags behind creamery butter in the retail price to the extent of 1½d. or 2d. a lb.  We may assume, therefore, that farmer's butter would be selling at 9d. a lb. if creamery butter was selling at 10½d. a lb. to the consumer. But after this Bill becomes operative creamery butter will continue to sell at 1/5 per lb. and it is to be assumed that farmer's butter will sell at 1/3 or 1/4, if it is getting its true value.  For the benefit that the creamery is getting&mdash;6½d. or 7d. a lb.&mdash; the creamery has to pay 4½d. a lb. levy and for that benefit that the farmer's butter is getting&mdash;also 6½d. or 7d. a lb. &mdash;it is proposed under this Bill that they also shall pay a 4½d. a lb. levy. In justice, nobody can deny that that is what should be done.</P>
    <P>If one wanted to make a case for the creameries I think a good case could be made that they are being treated unjustly even on that arrangement because suppliers who bring their milk to the creamery and buy back their butter from the creamery are buying back butter which has paid a levy.  A levy is payable on that butter which they consume themselves.  The supplier to the creamery is paying a 4¼d. levy on butter he consumes in his own house while the farmer who makes farmers' butter is not paying that and will not be asked to pay it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="26" /> Another thing that we have to keep in mind is this: that farmers who make farmers' butter to a great extent have a very good market during the winter.  Probably, they supply their butter direct to consumers or perhaps to grocers or traders in the town and they get a fairly good price during the winter.  In the summer time there is a surplus of farmers' butter on the market, for our own consumers do not absorb it all.  The result is that a lot of farmers' butter during the summer goes to the blenders for export and the price of that surplus is always inclined to regulate the market and to bring down the suppliers' price to that level or near that level during the summer months.  The best way perhaps to illustrate any point is to give an instance of what occurred.  When the 1932 Act was brought in first it was found impossible to collect the levy from anybody beyond the creameries, the factories and the non-manufacturing exporters who were a well-defined class, and were also on the registers that we had in the Department. Farmers' butter was not levied to any great extent.  The butter brought by farmers to the grocer for sale to home consumers was exempt from levy.  The result was, as I have already mentioned, that a great deal of the surplus which the farmers had in the summer was sold to blenders at a very poor price, 6d. or 6½d. per lb. perhaps.  It was felt in my Department that things could be improved if a levy could be collected on farmers' butter or the bounty increased on that butter which is exported by the factors.  At any rate, an effort was made to do that. On the 1st July of last year notices were served on 4,400 shopkeepers throughout the country to pay the levy.  Now I take the Trade Journal for the price of butter during those months and I find that in June the price of farmers' butter is given as 78/11 per cwt.; in July, 80/9; in August, 87/3, and in September, 86/11. Now, it will be seen from that that the effect of collecting the levy from grocers throughout the country was to increase the price of farmers' butter by anything from 7/- to 10/- per cwt. <Col N="27" /> Any Senator will see, if he considers the matter, that there was no doubt that that would be the result, because by collecting that levy from the grocers we were enabled to give back more bounty on the export of factory butter.  Senators may think I am, perhaps, taking an unfair price.  I may be told that the price perhaps went up for other reasons.  That is not so.  The price of butter on the British market, to which our factory butter was going was the same from June to December inclusive.  There was no change.  The change was in the internal price of farmers' butter supplying the factories which got the benefit of it.</P>
    <P>I take this question in another way. Let us start at the other end and find out what is likely to occur if this Bill was dropped, or, alternatively, if it comes into operation.  I think I have made the case that in justice and equity the farmer making his own butter ought to pay a levy on that butter the same as farmers supplying the creameries.  I might perhaps make a stronger case if I could show that it is in the interest of the farmer who makes farmers' butter, as well as being just, to pay a levy.  Let us take factory butter at the present time.  The price of factory butter may be taken to be 9s. or 10s. behind creamery butter. It is, on an average, 9s. or 10s. behind creamery butter, so that if creamery butter is to be got to-day at 80s. in Great Britain, we may take factory butter as being worth 70s. per cwt. Blended factory butter will require at least 10s. per cwt. for expenses &mdash; that leaves it 60s. per cwt.  That is to say they give 60s. for the butter they buy from the farmer.  If any Senator will calculate that he will find it comes to 6½d. per lb.; perhaps not that.  If bought through an agent, it would probably only be 6¼d.  But if it is sold to the blender after this Bill comes into operation, where if we had no bounty on farmers' butter as distinct from creamery it would be worth 6½d to the producer, with this system under this Bill it is provided that a bounty will be paid on all the butter bought by <Col N="28" /> the blender for export of 25s. per cwt., which may be taken to represent another 2½d. per lb.  So that if the factory before this Bill paid 6d. for butter to the producer, when this Bill comes into force they will pay 8½d.  If the market remains as it is&mdash;it is improving a bit for the last couple of weeks, but it is hard to say whether it will remain as it is&mdash;but if it does that butter will be worth 8½d. to the producer.</P>
    <P>We have a very big class of farmers who supply their butter to blenders and factories.  We have, in fact, amongst them what I should take to be the poorest farmers&mdash;the small farmers I mean in the County Kerry and the County Clare.  A great deal of this butter is made up by quantities bought from these small farmers living on the worst land that is to be found in this country.  They are very small people living on very small holdings and very poor land.</P>

      <P>I shall leave that to Senator Dowdall to answer.  I say that if we can improve the lot of these people by getting them 2½d. per lb. more for their butter we would be justified in bringing in this Bill, if for no other reason.  Let me go further.  Leave Kerry and Clare aside for the moment, and let us come to farmers in the country making butter for their customers and who have a surplus in the summer which must go to the factories.  At this time last year, that butter was selling at 6d. per lb. to the blenders.  Owing to the existence of this Bill it is 8d. per lb. and if the Bill goes through it will be better.  Take the farmer last year who went with his butter to the fresh butter market and got 6d. per lb. during the summer.  He may be asked by his customer to sell him more butter and, if so, he may get 2d. or 3d. per lb. over the open market price, which was down to 6d, and his price then went up to 8d.  He would not be able to sell his surplus butter at more than 6d. unless he put it into <Col N="29" /> 2-lb rolls and agreed to sell at 8d. per lb.  What is he doing this year?  He says to himself, I would get 8d. or 8½d. if I go into the fresh butter market.  I will not give it to the customer unless I get 10d.  In addition to that I have to pay 4d. levy so that I will have to get 1/2½ or 1/3 per lb.  So that the farmer in that position by selling part of his butter in the fresh butter market and part to the consumer is not worse off but is much better off under this Bill.  The consumer is going to pay more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, let us take the grocer.  Some grocers take the farmers' output all the year round.  In the winter they can sell it easily to customers in their houses.  When it comes to the summer they find it hard to get rid of it, and last year they said we will sell it to the blender for 6d.  This year, they said our surplus can go to the blender for 8d.  Therefore, I shall charge the customer 10d. plus 4½d. levy. At any rate the farmer is not going to be worse off, so far as I can see.  In every other commodity, leaving butter aside for the moment, we deal with, we always find if there is a surplus, and if we can improve the surplus market price it has an effect upon the cost of the commodity right through.  You cannot improve matters unless you go right down to the very bottom of the surplus market and improve things there.  That is what we are doing in this Bill.  We are taking the low surplus butter that the factories were taking for export.  It was worth 6d. last year and 8d. now, and we are raising that, and I have no doubt that that will have an influence on farmers' butter all around. Creamery butter remains the same as in the past three years.  It is possible the consumer will have to pay more under this Bill.  In fact, it is the proposal that the consumer must pay this levy.  We are not doing any injustice. A good many consumers take creamery butter at 1/5.  Many of them take it because they cannot get farmers' butter.  I know many people who would take farmers' butter if they could get it all the year round.  Now, these people have to pay 1/5 for their creamery butter.  Is it not only just if there are <Col N="30" /> people who would take farmers' butter when it is available that they should pay 1/3 or 1/4 per lb. for this farmers' butter?  I do not see that there is any injustice to the consumer who is affected under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Farmers in some towns get 8d. or 9d. per lb. for their butter.  Some people say that we are going to take 4d. off these people.  That is not true at all; it could not be true.  There are farmers now getting 8d. or 9d. for their butter who are asked to pay 4d. levy and who will say they will not. They may say they will sell their surplus butter like everybody else.  A farmer may say I shall sell it in a lump and get 8½d. and then the consumer who wants to get farmers' butter will come back and say that butter is worth 1/3 or 1/4 to me.  We are putting consumers more or less upon the same level.  A particular class will have to pay more for farmers' butter because we want a certain levy collected from those farmers in order to pay a bounty on this factory butter, and thus raise the price of butter all around.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot of talk about the small farmer.  Every public man, whether in the Seanad or in the Dáil, is always anxious to guard the interest of the small farmer.  Let us examine the case of the small farmer.  A big number of these small farmers are suppliers to creameries.  They are going to get the same advantages as the big men.  Probably not altogether so much but we cannot help that.  It would be very difficult to improve the lot of the small man without improving the lot of the big man and unfortunately we cannot do that either.  As I have mentioned, you have a very big lot of small farmers in Kerry and in Clare who supply a great amount of this butter which goes to the factories in the summer and we will improve the position for them by 2d. per lb.  We provide for other small farmers who supply customers direct.  If they supply less than 10 lbs. they are free of the levy.</P>
    <P>One other class of small farmer: There are a number of districts in this country where the number of farmers <Col N="31" /> were in a position seven or eight years ago that the local markets could not absorb their butter.  They came together and started a creamery.  The creamery was going on well until two years ago.  That is until the Act of 1932 was brought in which was supposed to be for the benefit of the creameries, but, in fact, it ruined certain creameries.  As there was no levy on farmers' butter an undue advantage was given to home producers to compete against the creamery in the local market.  There were some small farmers who had a stake in the creameries while the co-operative spirit lived, but they soon left and the whole thing was burst.  I would like to see this question approached in a helpful way.  It is a very difficult problem trying to raise the price of butter in the internal market while the external price remains.  In the normal way the export market would be surplus market and would regulate prices just as we try to create that position here.  Our surplus market for farm butter is the factory.  As we are not satisfied, however, with world prices at the present time, and as we are making an attempt to get better prices for our producers here than the world market would give us, I should like the question to be approached in a helpful way with a view to seeing how far we can get in that direction.  I think we all admit that it is a very difficult problem.  Perhaps we may admit also that it is a difficult question to understand.  Some people, evidently, find a great difficulty in understanding the system at all.  For instance, one question that troubled Deputies in the Dáil was connected with the question of how it would be determined whether the butter a factory was buying was intended for export or for sale at home.  What troubled them was that there would be a levy on the butter sold at home and a bounty on the butter sold for export, and they were troubled to know how the differentiation would be made.  Well, in the first place, to answer that question, which may, perhaps, trouble Senators as well as Deputies, the levy is only payable on butter sold at home and not on butter exported, whereas the bounty <Col N="32" /> is payable on butter exported, but not on butter sold at home.  The thing that has to be remembered is that the levy is paid by the last person who buys.  For instance, a grocer might buy butter from a farmer, but he need not pay the levy if he passes that butter on to another grocer, and that other grocer does not need to pay the levy if he passes it on to a factory, and so on.  The last person who sells the butter at home is the person who is liable for the levy.  For example: suppose a grocer buys butter at the market price, he will either sell to a person to whom he can pass on the liability for levy or to a consumer and in the latter case the price he will charge will include the levy.  Similarly, if a butter factory had butter on hands, and was considering whether to sell that butter at home or to export it, the factory owner would know that, including the bounty, he would get, say, 90/- a cwt. if he exported the butter; but if some manufacturer in the Free State, who required factory butter for his own purposes, asked that firm for a ton of butter, what price would they quote? I take it that they would say to themselves: &ldquo;If we exported this butter, we might get about 90/- without levy a cwt., so we will sell it for 131/- a cwt. and pay levy, and if they do not take it at that price, it does not matter, because we will have the foreign market.&rdquo;  I hold that prices will naturally settle down in that way.</P>
    <P>I should also like to speak about marketing.  It is provided in this Bill that special provision can be made by way of collecting, perhaps, a lesser levy, or giving a lesser bounty on butter sold under an approved market-scheme. I think that it is hardly necessary to go back over the history of the last few years in order to realise what has happened with regard to marketing.  Marketing has been in a very chaotic condition.  I think everyone will admit that the home market has become demoralised.  What has happened is that, very often, a creamery had a customer from whom it was getting 1/- or 2/- more than from another customer.  If another creamery heard of that, they would say to the customer: &ldquo;We will give it to you for <Col N="33" /> 1/- or so less.  As a result of such competition, prices have been cut until we are selling butter at, at least, 2/-, 3/- or 4/- less than we need sell it at if marketing were organised in a proper way.  For instance, you will have the case of a creamery which can sell at 80/-, agreeing to take 78/-, because they are hard up for cash at the moment.  As a result of that kind of thing, buyers tend to lose confidence in creameries.  They realise that if they are quoted a certain price, it is not a firm price: that it may be reduced, or, alternatively, that if they take the butter at that price, their next door neighbour may get it the very same afternoon for a few shillings less.</P>
    <P>I think that everybody will admit that our butter is superior to other butters on the British market and that it is worth more.  Nevertheless, we are not getting what we should get for it. A few months ago, I called together representatives of the creameries and exporters and suppliers of butter, and this matter was discussed.  As a result of that meeting, a provisional committee was appointed to examine this question of marketing, and I think that this Committee will be able to do some good work.  As a matter of fact, I think that there is now a desire amongst all the creameries in the country to have this matter taken up definitely and to have the whole thing organised on a proper basis.  If we go back six or seven years, it will be found that there was then a very strong feeling, amongst certain sections, against any sort of organised marketing.  I think, however, that that has disappeared very largely, and I think that nobody would object now to some system of organised marketing. I may say that I have great hopes that something will come out of this Committee and, even if nothing does come out of it, there is power, under this Bill, to give special facilities to all the creameries, that are prepared to organise, to market in an approved way.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to make <Col N="34" /> one appeal to the House, and that is that the Bill is urgent.  I make this appeal because I presume that when this stage is passed, we will be discussing the Bill in Committee.  It is true that there are what might be called retrospective conditions, technically; but really it is only continuing the 1932 Act until this Act is passed. That means that we cannot collect levies from the people who are liable to pay levies, nor can we pay bounties to the people to whom bounties are due, until this Act is passed.  If there is a delay in the passing of this Bill, it is going to be hard on these people to have to remain out of their money too long and, possibly, it is also going to be hard on us to collect the levies. I am sure that everybody realises that no business man, or creamery, likes to part with a very big cheque, even though it is due.  They do not object to paying small amounts.  From that point of view, the Bill is rather urgent and I should like to urge that point on the House.  These are the only points that occur to me at this stage of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, when introducing the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Bill, 1932, stated that its principal object, I think, was to preserve the cattle trade of this country. I agreed with that contention, and, for that reason, I supported the Bill.  I still agree that the dairying industry is the most important branch of agriculture. I believe that it is the foundation of the cattle trade and that it is most important and, in fact, essential, for the production of pigs and bacon and other agricultural products.  However, Sir, since 1932 there has been a big change.  We had, at that time, a market for all the cattle we could produce.  That market has now gone and the markets which are left are hardly worth catering for&mdash;at least in the production of live stock&mdash;and the question is whether this Bill is worth having in view of the present circumstances of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My principal objection to the Bill&mdash; and it is the only point I intend to deal with&mdash;is the tax on farmers' <Col N="35" /> butter.  I consider&mdash;and I think that the majority of farmers in the country consider&mdash;that 39/- per cwt. on butter is a monstrous and iniquitous tax, and that it should be opposed so far as it lies in the power of the Seanad to oppose it.  For that reason, I think that, if the Minister does not agree to wipe out that clause, the Seanad should reject the Bill.  That tax is going to deprive many industrious farmers in the country of their means of livelihood. No matter how plausible a picture the Minister may paint, if that tax is to be imposed, I believe that it will drive the industrious farmers of the country to desperation.  It seems to me that nothing can happen in this Bill except the reduction of the 4¼d. on the home produced butter.  Take, for example, the market price for butter at the moment.  The price yesterday was from 144/- to 147/ for creamery butter, while factory butter was practically unsaleable, and farmers' butter was making from 109/- to 112/-.  For years factory butter has been selling at from 1/5 to 1/6 a lb. retail price, whereas the retail price for farmers' butter was from 8d. to 10d. and sometimes 1/-.  Unless the price of creamery butter is going to be raised above 1/6 per lb. then, so far as I can see, the retail price of farmers' butter is not going to be worth more than 8d., 10d. or 1/- when this Bill becomes an Act, for the reason that there is a tax of 4d. per lb on it.  There is a tax at present on creamery butter, and the price of it is 1/6 per lb.  The creameries can always keep up their price because they have a monopoly of the market the home produced butter has not and never will have.  If farmers' butter is still selling at 1/5 a lb., then I calculate that home produced butter will be selling at 10d. and 1/- per lb., and out of that a tax of 4¼d. a lb. will have to be paid, so that the home producer will be getting only 6d. or 8d. for his butter. Does the Minister think it fair or equitable that butter making 8d. or 10d. per lb. should pay a levy of 39/- per cwt.?  I think it is hardly fair that a person producing butter, who has to sell it at 8d. per lb., should have to pay as <Col N="36" /> big a levy on his butter as those whose butter is making 1/6 per lb. retail.</P>
    <P>The Minister is taking power in this Bill to exempt what is known as the Kerry cattle area.  I think the Minister is right in doing so, but I would point out to him that there are several other districts in the country which are just as much entitled to be exempt from the provisions of the Bill as the Kerry cattle area.  You have, for instance, parts of Connemara, Mayo and Clare, as well as parts of the country outside the creamery areas, which are entitled to the same consideration as the Kerry cattle area.  If these people are going to be compelled to pay a tax of 4¼d a lb. on the butter they produce, the result in my opinion will be that they will be put out of production.  When that provision comes to be operated it will, I believe, have the effect of doing away, to a great extent, with winter dairying, because if farmers cannot sell their butter at a remunerative price in the summer they are not going to continue to produce in the winter.</P>
    <P>Why should the creameries have all the consideration?  The Minister, of course, will say that they have not, and that they are badly treated.  I do not mind how well the Minister treats the creameries, but the rest of the farming community in numbers at least represent three-quarters of the butter producers of the country.  In numbers they outnumber, so to speak, the creamery suppliers, but I agree that from the point of view of production the latter predominate.  The people who are being penalised under this Bill are to my mind the better type of farmer.  The farmer who supplies the creamery starts operations in the month of April when his cows calve.  He produces milk for the creamery at very little expense for seven or eight months in the year, and then closes down.  The non-creamery farmer is producing butter during the 12 months of the year, and if he cannot get his present price for it then he is going to go out of production.  That is going to mean a serious loss to the country.  I think that man is entitled to as much consideration as the farmer <Col N="37" /> who sends his milk to the creamery. Therefore, I think that the Minister should eliminate from the Bill the provision which taxes the non-creamery farmer.  If he does that, I think I can assure him on behalf of the Seanad that his Bill will have a quick passage through this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Counihan that one of the most objectionable provisions in this Bill is that which taxes the farmers who make butter in their own homes.  The Minister for Agriculture, more than any other Minister, has had to resort to all kinds of expedients in order that he might get himself out of the morass in which he finds himself owing, principally, to the absence of a market for the farmers' produce.  This Bill is the result of what is known as the economic war just as all the other legislation introduced by the Minister is.  If the Minister wishes to help the creameries out of the difficult position they are in, one is prompted to ask why he has resorted to this method of doing so?  Why has he not relieved them out of the Central Fund instead of making one section of the unfortunate farmers pay for, and come to the help of, another section?  Despite the figures and the laboured efforts of the Minister to show that the farmers are not going to lose over all this, it is merely so much theory: so much wind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was very difficult to follow the Minister.  I agree with him that this Bill is an exceedingly complicated one. The Bill seems to me to favour the idea that is now a prominent feature of Government policy&mdash;in fact it is becoming a definite thing with them&mdash; to get money by indirect taxation so that the people may not realise the extent to which they are being fleeced. That, in my opinion, is the idea behind this tax on farmers' butter.  If the money required to help the creameries were voted out of the Central Fund it would be debated in the Dáil at great length and shouted from the housetops throughout the country.  The same thing applies in connection with the bounty on wheat, but I am not going to go into that in this Bill.  The <Col N="38" /> position, at any rate, is that people are going to have to pay more for their flour because the bounty to the wheat growers is to come no longer out of the Central Fund.  Does the Minister really think that the people are asleep or dreaming: that they are mere worms and will not turn sometime? The cost of living is going to become enormous as a result of the policy that is being pursued by the Government.</P>
    <P>In plain language, what this Bill means is this: that the home butter-makers in the country are going to be called upon to pay the sum of £300,000 to the creameries.  I have every sympathy with the people in the creamery districts.  I know, of course, that in a good many of what are called creamery counties the land is very rich, and that the people have not to work as hard as the people living in other parts of the country.  The people in the creamery districts were getting a good price for their creamery butter over a long time-period while farmers in other parts of the country were getting poor prices.  During that period, as Senator Counihan has pointed out, the people in the creamery districts were not taxed to help the farmers in other parts of the country.  They were not taxed to help the farmers in the Minister's own county, for instance.</P>
    <P>I may say that a good deal of the legislation which the Minister has introduced would seem to be directed more against the farmers of his own county than any other.  I think it is correct to say that we have a larger number of home butter-makers in the County Wexford than in any other county in Ireland.  Take the case of a farmer who keeps ten cows.  I have made a rough estimate of the loss that such a farmer will sustain through the operation of this Bill.  I may say that a number of my neighbours keep about that number of cows.  We have not any large herds in the County Wexford, but if we take the average man in that county who keeps about ten cows, I calculate that his loss on the butter he produces will be about <Col N="39" /> £2 a week.  That money is going to come out of his pocket, and no amount of juggling is going to get over that fact.  It would take a far cleverer man than the Minister to make me believe that the farmer who keeps these ten cows is not going to pay that £2 a week out of his own pocket.</P>
    <P>This whole Bill is ridiculous. Farmers were getting a fairly good price for their butter during the winter. In fact, in the case of many of them it was almost their last resort.  Calves are now worth practically nothing. That being so, the number of cows in the country will be reduced.  One man who used to keep ten cows told me that he was going to do away with five of them immediately.  He was a man who was making from £90 to £100 a week in the summer out of his butter. Consider the loss that the operation of this Bill is going to inflict on him, and not only on him but on others, because he will not be able to employ as many now as formerly.  You will have one or two men losing their employment with him.  All this is simply a method of camouflaging the policy of the Government in the matter of indirect taxation.</P>
    <P>We do not know the number of inspectors that will be required to administer this Bill when it becomes an Act.  The Minister will not tell us.  He would have to tell in the Dáil if the money had to be voted directly there. He would have to account for every penny voted.  The Minister talked a lot about justice and equity.  If he comes down to Wexford and talks to any body of farmers there about justice and equity he will get his answer.  I do not propose to say much more on the Bill.  I think it is the worst Bill that the Minister for Agriculture has so far produced, and that is saying a good deal.  It is the most complicated and absurd measure that could possibly be thought of.  The Government should have gone the straight and honest way in doing what is aimed at in the Bill instead of trying <Col N="40" /> to camouflage the people by this method of indirect taxation.</P>
    <P>The poor people of the country will be fleeced by having to pay increased prices for butter.  It is all very well to talk about keeping up the price of butter, but who is keeping it up? Every man, woman and child in the country.  They will have to pay their share in keeping up the price.  One would think from the Minister's speech that this Bill was going to confer a great benefit on the country and to cost the people nothing.  Of course, that is not the position at all.  Quite the contrary is the position.  In conclusion, I desire to say that I oppose this Bill very strongly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. Bagwell Mr. Bagwell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill on which I have not as much special knowledge as some other members of the House, but on the other hand I have not any special interest in it either.  I want to say that I have not been in conference with anybody who has either special knowledge of, or a special interest in, this Bill.  I am sure the House will understand me when I say that the difficulty which confronts some of us in speaking on Bills of this character is in trying to find out what they are about, and in trying to make good the deficiencies in our own knowledge of them.  As regards this particular class of Bill, if one consults a person who knows all about it, that person will naturally give you the case for or against it from a certain point of view.  He will simply give you the point of view of one particular interest.  Every man in this country of high protection who is interested in some particular thing will be quite content, of course, if his own special commodity is highly protected and will not really mind what happens to other people.  Viewing this Bill in that way, Senators will realise how difficult it is for an individual member of the House to form himself, so to speak, into a sort of commission to go around seeking for information with a view to getting an all-round knowledge of the subject.  The Minister is in the position that he ought to have an allround <Col N="41" /> knowledge of everything contained in this Bill.  But then, on the other hand, he is an interested person. He is more interested in it than I am. The necessity for it is due, largely, to the policy of the Government of which he is a member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, obviously, is a most important one.  I have read it very carefully, and if I make any mistakes in the observations that I have to make on it these, I suggest, will do no harm. They will give the Minister an opportunity of correcting them when replying, and in that way may be the means of securing valuable information for the House.  The Minister has admitted that the Bill is a complicated one. Several of its provisions deal with figures.  Some of them, I suggest, are imaginary figures&mdash;mere conjecture. The case for the Bill, I submit, is largely built up on conjecture.  The portion of it to which I desire specially to refer is that which deals with the farmer-producer selling butter in the home market and with the Irish consumer of butter buying from such farmer-producers.  In that regard, I find the Bill very unacceptable. I do not know whether the Minister knows what the value of the farmer-producer of butter is in our national economics. I do not suppose that he could have accurate knowledge of that.  The Bill will, of course, eventually reveal that information.  I think that the value of the farmer-producer of butter must be very material.  It seems to me that that branch of the industry is largely threatened by this Bill.  Ostensibly, the Bill is not designed to menace any section of the trade but rather to help the industry, but we are all acquainted with the practice of &ldquo;robbing Peter to pay Paul.&rdquo;  Under this Bill, money will be taken out of one Irishman's pocket and put into another Irishman's pocket and, so far as I can see, Ireland as a whole will not be any better off.  A bounty will be paid to exporters but the levy on the farmer-producer will go towards paying it. Whether he is going to get that levy back or whether he is going to get any <Col N="42" /> advantage out of the scheme appears to me to be extremely problematical. The farmer-producer will lose the liberty he enjoys of making as much butter as he can and selling it where he can unrestrictedly.  Many people like that butter.  At the price at which it is sold, there is a demand for it. Some of it is good and some of it is not so good but it suits some people.</P>
    <P>The levy is not going to be the only expense on the farmer-producer as a result of this Bill.  He will have to be registered and he will have to pay for registration.  Then, there will be the inspection of his premises.  What that will involve, apart from the administrative expense which will fall on the country as a whole, I do not know, but I am sure it will involve an appreciable sum.  Neither do I know what the effect on the farmer of this inspection will be, because that will depend on the standard required.  As to that, people differ very widely.  If the standard required be at all comparable with that which is demanded &mdash;and probably rightly demanded&mdash;in butter factories and creameries, the farmer-producer will be put out of business.  An aspect of this question has always puzzled me.  I have been in the habit of going to one of the greatest dairying countries in Europe &mdash;that is, the Alps country, which covers a portion of France, Switzerland and Italy.  That is a dairy country and not a beef country.  I see there cheese, butter, and cream produced on the cow farms out on the mountains, where things are very primitive and where, I am perfectly certain, the premises would not pass any inspector.  The result, however, is most excellent butter and cheese which everybody, including myself, likes. No harm appears to be done to anybody and the inhabitants are a very healthy population.  Inspection under this Bill might be a very burdensome thing.</P>
    <P>Then, there is the rendering of returns and accounts.  A farmer doing a big business and sending out a lot of stuff could afford a certain amount <Col N="43" /> by way of overhead charges.  He could probably afford to employ an educated person to render accounts properly. The small man cannot, however, do that, for a variety of reasons.  He himself, may not have sufficient education to keep these accounts.  He may find the driving of a pen for half an hour harder work than any amount of physical labour.  Yet, he may be a very intelligent man and a good farmer.  This paper business might be a source of great trouble to a man who could produce very good butter.  Then the farmer cannot sell any substantial portion of his butter to a middleman. He has got to sell direct to the consumer if he is to come under the exemption.  That is going to handicap the farmer in a large number of cases. Many farmers cannot sell their butter off their farms very satisfactorily because their farms are inaccessible and people will not go to them. Neither can they afford to deliver the butter direct to the consumers.  At present, they dispose of their supplies very conveniently to those who distribute the butter for them.  Now, people will not go to their farms for butter and they cannot afford the cost of lorries or other means of bringing the butter supplies direct to the consumer. Whether the farmer will recover from the consumer the amount of the levy which he has to pay appears to me to be a matter of conjecture. Whether he does or not, somebody is going to lose 4d. per lb.  Either the farmer or the consumer is going to lose the 4d. and no fresh money is brought into the country as a result of the operations of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Looking at the Bill, as a whole, I ask myself whether it is introduced for the purpose of driving farmer producers of the type I have been speaking about out of business.  I think it is legitimate to ask whether that is the object of the Bill because it seems extremely likely to have that effect in a great many cases.  If that be the object, what good purpose is served? The creameries will benefit?  Perhaps to a certain extent, but at what cost <Col N="44" /> to the farmers, and at what cost to the nation as a whole?  Mass production is good in many ways.  It is good for the consumer, because he gets an article more cheaply.  But that argument does not apply in this case.  To have the maximum amount of labour on farms is a desirable thing.  It tends to a more equal distribution of the population.  It is generally agreed that the drift to the towns is bad and that concentration of population is likewise bad.  If you put these farmer-producers out of business, they will not be able to employ as many people as they employed before.  Some of the people they employ will either have to go on the dole or find work elsewhere. If everything is to be put into the hands of the creameries, there will not be so many people working on the farms.  These people may lose their habits of industry, and it is a good thing to have a class of farming which leads to the formation of habits of industry.  That is desirable in the national interest.  The Minister will, of course, say that I am wrong in my submissions, but I should like him to show how I am wrong.</P>
    <P>This Bill seems to be opposed to the policy of putting more people on the land.  The form of farming affected is one of the best forms of farming and it is very effective in keeping people on the land.  How the Bill could be amended, I do not know, because the whole principle of the Bill is bad.  It is one more instance of unlimited powers taken by a Minister to control a very big business.  That is always an extremely complicated task and it is very doubtful whether any one man, or set of men, can do it satisfactorily.  So much power is given under the Bill to the Minister to change, alter and withhold that there will be no finality and no security and I do not see how people can continue in the dairying business under the circumstances.  This Bill arises out of the economic war.  I arrived at that conclusion entirely apart from any previous speaker.  It seems to me to be a question of juggling to get away from the main fact.  The main fact is that all this <Col N="45" /> represents money taken out of one Irishman's pocket and put into another Irishman's pocket.  The nation as a whole is no better off and we have all this suffering as a consequence of this tariff war, which arose out of a quarrel with our neighbour.  We are reaping the results of that.  We are going round and round in this way, pretending that this and that Bill is going to make everything right, instead of dealing with the main cause.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in his very long and careful speech, wound up by saying that he would like to see this question approached in a helpful way. Whatever criticism I have to offer, I shall offer in what I think is a helpful way.  The Bill contains provisions that are highly contentious.  However careful we be in discussing this question, it is inevitable that we should react to the peculiar circumstances and difficulties of our own counties and the areas which we know best.  My own opinion is that this Bill, contentious and all as it is, is essential.  I am not going to adopt the line that all that the Minister says is wrong or that all that the Minister says is right.  If we are to be helpful, I think the only way we can indicate that is by recognising that there is some merit in the case of the other fellow.  What has been said with regard to Part II of the Bill, in so far as it imposes extra taxation upon some section of the people, is true.  What the Minister suggests the results may be is as yet, to a certain extent, problematical. The Bill may have the results the Minister indicates.  Until these results are obvious, the people in the non-creamery counties will feel very sore indeed.  I admit that I am rather surprised at the Minister's action, considering the political complications. I believe that no more unpopular sections could be put into any Bill than those contained in Part II of this measure.  I am not going to dwell any further on this point because other speakers have already addressed themselves to that part of the measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not prepared to accept what <Col N="46" /> Senator Bagwell says&mdash;that the introduction of this measure is solely due to the economic war.  However, I think the Minister himself will not deny that the effects and consequences of the economic war have put upon him the responsibility of finding more money both by way of levy and increased cost to the consumer in order to give the farmer-producer 3½d. or 4d. a gallon for his milk than would have been necessary if there was no economic war.  The fact that we have an economic war and that the farmer has to pay the penalty is very unfortunate. It is a fact which had to be taken into account in the framing of the Bill, but it is not the sole cause or reason for the Bill.  The price of butter in England is, as the Minister says, from 82/- to 84/- per cwt.  That could not be regarded as a paying price to any farmer in this country. If farmers were not to have any greater price, I do not believe that they could, under present circumstances, keep in production.  My regret is that the Bill does not go far enough and provide that the price of butter to the creameries and producers would be higher than it is.  If there is a weakness at all in the Bill, it is in that respect.  It is the conviction of the dairying farmers that milk at 3½d. or 4d. a gallon at the creamery is not high enough to encourage dairying.</P>
    <P>When discussing this matter we are entitled to look at the position of dairying as a whole, and to look to the future, to see what the aim is with regard to our dairying policy.  Obviously, our exports to the British market are of vital importance in dairying as well as in every other agricultural commodity that farmers produce.  The total production was about £1,150,000 last year while the total imports to Britain were valued at £33,000,000.  That is an aspect of dairying to which Senators and the Minister in particular, should address themselves.  The time would be well spent if more consideration was given to that side of our dairying problem. In my view we should make an effort to increase our exports to foreign markets, and to get a better hold than <Col N="47" /> we have, in order to bring back more money for products that we are so competent to produce and for which we are so favourably circumstanced.  Undoubtedly there are difficulties.  I admit that the low world price of butter gives no encouragement for production.  It may be truly said that the low world price is so discouraging that there is great danger, but for the passage of this measure, and the taxation it imposes, that many of our people would go out of dairying.  The State cannot afford such an unfortunate development and whatever steps are necessary to prevent it must be taken in the interests of the nation.  In addition to the provision made by this measure to secure money to raise the price of butter to a figure beyond the present one, which I believe the Minister will admit does not cover the cost of production, I feel that the Central Fund should have been called upon.  It has not been done, and I do not know that any voice has been raised in protest. The truth is that 4d. per gallon will not cover the cost of production of milk.  At the same time they are expected to maintain a decent standard of living, and to carry responsibilities financial, moral and social under conditions which apparently they are prepared to accept as being good enough for dairy farmers.  These things should be known so that those engaged in other occupations could appreciate the difficulties of dairy farmers, and what little compensation they get for their labour.</P>
    <P>I may be asked what is to be done to mend the situation?  The Minister indicated that powers are being taken in Section 49 to regulate the marketing of butter.  If we are to increase our exports to Great Britain and to increase production in the dairying industry we must at least try to cover the cost of production.  As far as possible, all waste should be eliminated and, if needs be, the State must come in with aid to keep the industry alive. It is struggling along to-day under difficulties and is accepting the poverty-stricken conditions that are <Col N="48" /> common practically to every branch of agriculture.  That is the position with one or two exceptions which can only be undertaken by a small percentage of our people.  I believe the Minister should have gone much further than this Bill by establishing a marketing organisation.  No progress can be made in the marketing of butter, certainly outside the country, in the conditions that exist.  The Minister was cognisant of them even before he came into office.  I think it is true to say that when in opposition the Minister was strongly sympathetic to the idea of a combined marketing organisation.  He realised then as well as he does to-day that with the attitude of many creamery managers, and the difficulties that confront them, it was not possible to compete in Great Britain against the more highly organised and better disciplined people from Denmark, New Zealand and Australia.  There were days here when the marketing organisation formed by the pioneers in the co-operative movement succeeded during the period of three years of its existence in raising the price of butter on the foreign market.  Instead of the price of Irish butter being 1/- under Australian, it went to 1/- above the New Zealand price during the last year of that organisation's existence.</P>
    <P>The position in the British market is that the Danes hold premier place as far as price is concerned.  They do that because of their peculiar position. They have become masters of production and of marketing.  They are in the market every day of the year. They make contracts that they are able to keep.  They are not in the market for a few months and then out of it as many of our Irish creameries and farmers are.  The first essential is to establish and to hold a place in the British market, so that we will be able to make dairying pay in winter as well as in summer&mdash;when it is paying at all.  If that is done, and if we are to reach the stage when we can demand 100/- per cwt. for butter as well as the Danes, we can only do it by having a good market all the year round.  We <Col N="49" /> cannot do it unless a position is created for dairy farmers that will enable them during the winter to produce milk at a price that at least covers the cost of production.  The Department of Agriculture has for years neglected that aspect of dairying. The question is, do we want to do it?  Until we develop winter dairying we cannot establish ourselves in the British market as the Danes have done.  We have also got to learn how to market our butter as it should be marketed.</P>
    <P>Apparently, there is a difference of opinion between people who manage the creameries.  I got a communication from the Irish Creamery Managers' Association, which indicates very clearly that there has been undercutting by a number of creamery managers, particularly in the home market.  The circular does not deal with the external problem at all but it states: &ldquo;We think we do not overestimate when we say that, on an average, and throughout the year, at least 3/6 is lost on each cwt. of bulk butter sold in the Free State.&rdquo;  If 3/6 is lost on each cwt. of butter sold in the Free State, seeing that we sold about 270,000 cwts., that would represent a loss of £47,000 on home sales. According to Mr. Semple's calculation, the exports come to £84,000, or a total loss of £131,000 due to faulty methods of marketing butter.  The Minister is looking for helpful suggestions. I believe he is as convinced as I am that there is not going to be established in this country a dairying industry on a sound basis unless there is combined marketing to prevent undercutting on the part of creamery managers, at home and abroad.  Some of these men may not be good business men while others, because suppliers want cash, have to sell.  Because of that and the reasons stated by the Minister, when some of them discover that others have found good customers across the Channel they are jealous and they take away what the other fellow has won by trying to secure these good customers for themselves, thereby reducing the price that Irish farmers can get for their produce. <Col N="50" /> The secretary of the Irish Creamery Managers' Association places the figure of the loss at £131,000 on productivity in the marketing of Irish butter.  In the present circumstances of the country, when money is badly wanted, the Minister realises that loss caused by faulty methods should not be permitted.</P>
    <P>The Minister is more optimistic than I am when he says that he thinks he sees a change of spirit on the part of people who have come together to discuss new methods of marketing. They speak with different voices.  I saw from a report a week ago that the chairman of a meeting, a creamery manager, who attends most of the meetings at which the Minister speaks, indicated that in his view very little more could be done for marketing than was being done.  That is the spirit that broke the previous marketing organisation and it is going to affect any new marketing organisation. Apart from national effort, there is the loss from the point of view of the reputation of Irish butter abroad. The Minister knows that four or five years ago people in England knew they could be supplied by this marketing organisation but who have not bought a pound of Irish butter since that organisation went out of existence. They will not deal with us because of the methods that some of our people employ.  What concerns me most is our prestige and reputation in England amongst businessmen, that while a good article is available it cannot be supplied on the sound business lines that have made the marketing of the dairying products of other countries so successful.</P>
    <P>I urge, as strongly as I can, that the Minister ought to take steps at once.  I am convinced that a number of thoughtful people in the dairying industry will back him very strongly if he is prepared to take action to put dairy products on a sound basis, on which they do not stand to-day.  I am convinced, too, that winter dairying needs encouragement, which it has never got here, and that winter dairying <Col N="51" /> is absolutely an essential part of our dairying industry.</P>
    <P>In Section 39 the Minister makes an attempt to prevent underselling on the part of the creameries in the home market.  Sub-section (1) reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It shall not be lawful for any person to sell any creamery butter for delivery to the purchaser thereof in Saorstát Eireann at a price which is less than the price which is, on the date of the delivery of such butter to the purchaser, the minimum price under this section in respect of such butter.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister will not be able to make that section operative and, unless he is convinced that he can do so, I would urge him strongly to delete the section entirely from the measure.  It has been suggested that there would not be any difficulty in enforcing this, but I am convinced that it will be very difficult, if not impossible.  The Minister is aware of what happened in the case of the Fresh Meat Act and of how difficult it was to get 25/- or 22/- per cwt. for meat.  He knows just as well as anyone the competition there will be here eternally for the good home trade, the competition there will be to supply the man who can pay cash on the nail, or if he is given credit for 14 days, will honour his cheque at that time. Creameries will be anxious to get this trade and to hold it.  I suggest to the Minister that, no matter what he puts in the Act, if he has not control of butter through a selling agency there will be undercutting.  Perhaps other methods will be used to get hold of those customers and to keep them and to knock the other fellow out.  Frankly, I am convinced that this is an effort at combined selling that will fail, that it will leave a number of honest men disgusted, men who would not be prepared to adopt the methods that would be necessary to secure trade because of this section.  Perhaps it will be an encouragement or an incitement to dishonest tactics on the part of quite a <Col N="52" /> number of people here who will be forced, because of the passage of this legislation and particularly the insertion of this clause, to adopt means which they would not be tempted to employ if this section were not in the Bill.  It was inevitable that, with the introduction of Part II, you would have the conflict of opinion that is evident throughout the country between those who are in the creamery districts and those in the non-creamery districts. No section of our people is prepared lightheartedly or gladly to bear the new taxation which is being put upon them and which they have been able to evade in the past.  Undoubtedly, there are very strong feelings in many of our counties and in particular districts in some counties over the insertion of this section.  What I feel about it particularly is the difficulty the Minister will experience in trying to administer this part of the Bill at all. I think we will have all sorts of evasions.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to hear from the Minister how he proposes to administer this part of the Bill.  Is it to be done through the Gárda Síochána or through the new dairying inspectors?  By what means does he propose to have those registers compiled and to see that all the people whose names ought to be in them are there and that the fees are collected? If the Minister has looked into all that, including the cost of it, and is satisfied that it is possible, then he knows where he stands.  The powers which he takes are fairly strong, but it ought to be known that already under the Dairy Produce Act producers who have been sending milk to the creameries have been subjected to all sorts of regulations.  A farmer may not only be sent home with his milk if it is not clean, but he may be brought into court and prosecuted. His premises may be subjected to all sorts of inspections.  The additional powers which the Minister seeks here are not new.  I believe that under this part of the Bill you will have all sorts of evasions, and I think there is nothing more harmful than passing legislation that may be evaded.  I <Col N="53" /> would be anxious to hear what the Minister's viewpoint is; whether he has the power and the capacity to make this part of the Bill fully operative or not.  It is something that the Minister ought to consider, because, undoubtedly, if people find loopholes or ways of evading their responsibilities or of adopting methods by which the law can be side-stepped, it will produce contempt for all law. The Minister has gone far in increasing the amount of butter which these producers can sell without paying a tax at all.  I do not know what his calculation is as to the total amount he expects to receive on the amount of butter that will be marketed under this part of the Bill.  These are considerations which ought to weigh with the Minister, whether or not, as regards this contentious part of the Bill, the game is worth the candle.</P>

      <P>I have not been able to give a close study to this Bill and its operations, but, so far as I was able to read the discussions in the Dáil with a view to trying to elucidate the problems that the Bill tries to meet, I frankly confess that I was more bewildered than ever by the discussions I read, and I had to give them up.  It so happened that I was in possession of a copy of a certain report of the new Zealand Parliament, where they were discussing a butter Bill.  I could not but think of the debates on that subject when Senator Bagwell was speaking.  I have been accustomed for the last few years to hearing heartrending cries as to the state of the Irish farmer and more particularly the dairy farmer, and from Senator Counihan about his cattle, but nothing that we have heard here compares in poignancy to the complaints of the dairy farmers of new Zealand as to the condition they are in in regard to the price of their butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the 1932 Act was being passed, it was explained that such a Bill was necessary in order to keep in existence the dairying industry, that if something of the kind was not done, the farmers would go out of milk production, and <Col N="54" /> it would be difficult, if not impossible, to revive the dairying industry when it was desired to do so.  The plea was made at that time that consumers of creamery butter would be willing to pay up to 1/5 per lb.  The Minister indicated that that would be about the price that would be the maximum for a consumer of creamery butter.  It was recognised that it meant a rise of 2d. or 3d. per lb. for the average user of creamery butter but that that price was only about the level of the prices that had prevailed for such class of butter a couple of years previously. For my part, I realise that it was not an unfair proposition to ask the town consumers of creamery butter to pay that price for the purpose that was sought to be achieved.  There was one other consideration, that those people who were not in a position to pay 1/5 per lb. for creamery butter had the option of buying farmers' butter at a lower price.  In fact, if they desired creamery butter against the farmers' butter it was up to them to pay an extra price for a special fancy of their own.  This Bill appears to me to affect the relative position of those who were in the habit of using farmers' butter and those who were in the habit of using creamery butter, and I would like, before the motion is put, that the Minister should explain the position of consumers as they will be affected by this Bill if it is passed in its present form.  I am quite able to understand, for instance, the contention of those who were speaking for the farmers who were producing butter for direct sale, as voiced by Senator Miss Browne, that the farmer who is producing is going to bear the burden.  I am not able to reconcile that with the contention, that seems to me to be more like the fact, that the consumers of farmers' butter are going to pay the price.  It was the Minister who said that the position of the creamery in regard to creamery butter would not be affected. Consequently, whatever change is taking place is between the consumer of farmers' butter, the producer of farmers' butter and the State.  The Minister told us that the State is not affected inasmuch as the whole of the sum collected by way of levy is being <Col N="55" /> put into a fund and will be used for nothing else but for bounties and so on. If that is the position, then it is a matter for reconciling the cost of the farmer producing butter for direct sale and the consumer of that butter.  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I made a shot at an estimate to the effect that 25 per cent. of the butter produced in this country is sold as farmers' butter direct to the consumers. I think it is probably true to say that in the larger towns more creamery butter is sold, and that so far as the working classes in the larger towns are concerned they are able to pay the better price of 1/5 for creamery butter.  But in the smaller towns and rural areas, where most of the farmers' butter is consumed, the ability of the working people to pay is lower than those in the larger towns. I have asked myself what is to be the effect on the consumer with lower wages in regard to his butter consumption. If, as I think the Minister indicated, the average price of farmers' butter in the retail market might be 1/3 to 1/4 per lb., I want to know what was the average price in the last year of that particular kind of butter?  Was it 10d. taking the whole year round or was it 9d.?  If either of these figures is a fair shot at the average it means a rise in the price of butter to the consumer of 5d. or 6d. or 7d. in the lb.  If that is to be the effect of these clauses upon that large portion of the working class population of the country which is now in the habit of using farmers' butter, and that sometimes less well-paid section of the population, I think the Minister ought to pause.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for him as the Minister for Agriculture to think in terms of the producer, but in any collective action with the rest of his colleagues which he is taking, he ought to have some regard to the position that this Bill will create in respect to the consumer.  I do not think that consumers, taken as a whole, or any section of them, ought to be entirely unaffected by a Bill for conserving the dairying industry in this country.  But <Col N="56" /> if I am right in suggesting that the meaning of this Bill is that it will raise the price of this butter, to the lower-paid portion of the population, by 5d. or 6d. in the lb., I think we are asking them to bear too great a share of the burden.  I may be quite wrong in these estimates.  The Minister may show that I am entirely astray in my rough calculation, but I hope he will be able so to show.  If he cannot, then I think any proposal to amend that portion of this Bill ought to be supported.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as a whole, must be supported on Second Reading if it is desired that the dairying industry as a whole is to be maintained.  We are exactly in the position we were in in relation to the Bill of 1932.  That Bill was deemed to be necessary in order to enable the farmer producers of creamery butter to get such a price for their milk that would save them from absolute ruin, immediate and irrecoverable.  Therefore, the Bill must be supported on Second Reading so far as it goes.  But I ask the Minister to make much clearer than he has done what is to be the effect of clauses relating to farmers' butter upon that portion of the poorly paid section of the population which might have to pay 5d. or 6d. per lb. more for their butter than they have been paying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasToal" hpid="Mr. Toal Mr. Toal">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Toal</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish this Bill to pass without my protest against the section that applies to farmers' butter. One speaker said that this was the worst Bill introduced by the Minister. I do not agree, but I say it is one of the most unpopular Bills that was ever introduced in the eyes of a very large section of the Irish people&mdash;the small farmers.  The industry of farmer butter-making is as old as the hills.  It is an industry that the Minister and the Government should think well over before trying to destroy.  It is an industry amongst our poor people.  It was a source of education and a means of supporting families for generations.  It was a means of introducing the family into the social life of the country.  To my mind, this Bill is going to kill this <Col N="57" /> industry and, I may say, I do not see how the Minister is going to enforce it.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, at the present time we have in this country many evasions of Acts that have been passed.  In the part of the country that I know best we have a regular industry which is very demoralising to the manhood of our country and to our boys, and that is smuggling and trying to evade the law.  I am afraid this Bill, if it becomes an Act, will have a very demoralising effect upon the women and young girls in the country.  I am convinced a whole army would not be sufficient to enforce this Act if it passes.  Take my own district!  How is it to be enforced there?  Why, you would want an inspector under every bed if you are to succeed in getting the returns that are needed.  I think it is very hard that poor people should be liable to be taxed if they have one cow.  They are exempt up to 10 lbs. of butter, but one good much cow would produce 10 lbs. of butter.  Therefore, they must register and pay the tax.  The making of farmers' butter and that industry generally have a great bearing upon the social life of the country and upon the life of young girls, and are very good for their education. Many and many a happy family have been kept together through this small industry.  If you kill that industry you will do a great injury in the country.  I hope the Minister is going to make the best effort he can to improve the dairying industry generally, but I am afraid he is going the wrong way about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that there is a terrible feeling in the country about this matter.  This industry has been carried on for generations.  It was not only a means of support but it contributed to preserving the health of families.  I have long experience of creameries.  I find that where the milk is taken away to the creameries nothing is left in the home for the nourishment of the family and the children.  I am also convinced that the facts that Senator Johnson has brought forward will have a very serious effect if not remedied.  This will lessen the consumption of butter <Col N="58" /> in the country.  Many people sooner than pay a price of 1/5 a lb. will cease to use butter altogether.  We know what that means.  They will try to buy the cheap meat.  If they can get meat for 3d. or 4d. a lb. they will not pay 1/3 and 1/4 a lb. for butter. All this will have a terrible effect upon poor people who now can go to their neighbour and get a lb. of butter at a reasonable price.  I hope the Minister will reconsider this portion of the Bill.  The continuance of this farmers' butter-making industry will have a very good effect both socially as well as from the health point of view upon the people.  If the Minister persists, I am convinced the returns will be very disappointing.  I do not see how they are going to be calculated.  Our people have become demoralised enough without putting a temptation of this kind in their way and I earnestly hope the Minister will reconsider this portion of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said, and said very properly, in introducing this Bill, that it was an urgent and complicated measure and very difficult even for those engaged in the industry to understand.  I can say as a fact that some people in the trade find it difficult to understand it.  The measure which has just expired was framed long before what was known as the economic war.  It was framed because butter prices had fallen so low that this country, in common with New Zealand and Australia, set out to devise a means by which they could secure for the producer such a price on the home market as would enable him to continue in dairying.  It is admitted by everybody that as far as creameries are concerned this worked satisfactorily.  The object was to secure a price approximate to 100/- per cwt. net from creamery to creamery.  Senator Miss Browne talked of defeating this Bill.  I tell the Senator that if this Bill be defeated there will be such an outcry that the Dáil will have to be called back, and I will guarantee that not one member of the Fine Gael Party will vote against it a second time.  We got a good indication <Col N="59" /> of that when Deputy Bennett voted with the Government on this measure and against his Party.  In the former Bill the levy and bounty system applied only to creamery butter.  This measure and against his Party.  In the former Bill the levy and bounty system butter produced in the farmer's own dairy.  Everybody knows, and knows better than the Minister and his advisers, with whom I do not always agree, that in the administration of that part of the Act there will be difficulty and there will be evasion, but I feel, as time goes on, the evasion will be less and less.  The Minister is giving a concession to certain small dairy producers and I think it is well he should do so at present at all events.  The measure will have, and I may say has had, the effect already of securing&mdash;and I wish Senator Toal would understand this&mdash;a better price for the farmer's butter than he would secure were it not that this measure has certain retrospective clauses.  These prices, as a result of these retrospective clauses, are being paid already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Counihan spoke about selling butter at 8d. a lb.  I may tell the Senator, for his information, that I sold butter last week, here in Dublin, in ton lots, at £120 a ton.  That, of course, includes delivery.  It is as well, however, to bear in mind that the levy is pooled and goes back to the producer.  There will, of course, be some expense in administration, and I regret that the Department is not bearing that part of the expense.  I think that the Department should pay that part of the expense, but the part of the money raised by means of the levy goes back to the producer.  Senator Baxter knows that 100 per cent. of the levy went back to the creameries, and I hold that practically all of the levy here will go back to the producer in the home dairies.  When Senators here spoke of a tax of 4¼d. being an unthinkable and unbelievable tax, it seemed to be amazing that other Senators did not characterise that as being ridiculous.  I appeal to members of the Seanad to do <Col N="60" /> the wise thing now, for once, and let this measure go through.  I realise, of course, that this measure, in the same way as similar measures, may reveal difficulties later on which one cannot anticipate.  On the whole, however, I think that this is a fairly well thought-out measure.  After all, it must be remembered that the Department has had considerable experience of dealing with such matters, and I ask the House to give the Minister the opportunity, for which he has asked, of administering the Bill.  If it needs amendment or revision next season, that can easily be done.</P>

      <P>Is our Government going to pay to the exporter of Free State butter the full amount which he has to pay as an import duty on his butter when it goes into Great Britain, or is it to be met out of the produce of these levies with which this Bill is connected?  If the Minister says that none of the levies under this Bill is to be applied in the payment of the British taxation on butter sent to Great Britain, then I, for one, have certainly a completely wrong view of the Act; because, as I read Section 9, it says that all fees payable under this section shall be collected and taken in such manner as the Minister for Finance shall from time to time direct. Are the bounties which are payable to the British Government not included in this Act?  If they are not included, I feel that one has completely misread this Bill.  Furthermore, if they are not required for the purpose of paying to the exporter the bounty which he has to pay in order to have his butter allowed into Britain, I cannot understand for what purpose we want this £800,000.  According to the Minister, <Col N="62" /> as I understand, he wants to raise a sum of about £800,000 by way of levy. He says that some £500,000 or so will be got from the creameries and that he will get out of the ordinary farmers' butter what will probably make the sum up to something like £800,000. Apparently, the Minister himself admits that he does not really know what he will get out of farmers' butter, but he hopes that he will be able to get that amount.  If this money were going to be spent on any scheme for really assisting our butter producers, one would think that there would be quite a good deal to say for it.  But I have read through the Bill, and I have read the debates in the Dáil, and I cannot find any proof whatever that any real benefit is going to come out of this Bill to anybody connected with the trade.  In spite of all the remarks that have been made in this House and in the Dáil I cannot see how anybody connected with the trade is going to be a penny the better as a result of this Bill.  It seems to me to be ridiculous that a further sum is going to be raised by levy than has been raised already out of the people engaged in the industry.  There is now going to be a levy of 4d. a lb. on farmers' butter.  I feel, as other Senators have said, that if the farmer has to pay that 4d. a lb. on his butter, the industry will largely disappear. Even if we are to assume that the consumer will take up part of the burden and that the farmer does not have to pay the whole of the 4d., it will then have the effect that the price to the public will rise.  I am referring here to the Irish consumer.  Notwithstanding what may have been said by Senators, I feel that; in that case, it would be inevitable that the poorer people would have to pay a higher price for their butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After reading the Bill carefully, I cannot find any necessity for raising this amount of money out of the industry itself.  I can find nothing in the Bill to show that it is absolutely necessary that this money should be raised.  If we knew where this taxation was going, if we had a clear statement from the Minister showing that this <Col N="63" /> money was going to help the industry, it would be a different matter; but there is not a line in the Bill to show that, nor has the Minister himself told us.  It is quite easy to see, from the speeches made here to-day, that there are very great risks of a grave injury being done to one part of the butter industry in this country.  If this Bill means the raising of the price of butter in this country, as it seems to me to be quite likely to do unless the butter-producing farmers are going to be very seriously injured, the public will have to bear some of the cost and, if so, we will have some of the reactions which Senator Johnson fears.  I cannot make out why the Minister is doing this.  It seems to me to be a most terribly complicated measure.  Senator Bagwell spoke on the question of providing better marketing facilities.  I am sure that we would all be unanimous on that, but this is a totally different thing.  The real gist of this whole Bill, it seems to me, is the raising of £300,000 or £400,000 a year out of a certain set of people who have not been taxed hitherto; but what the necessity there is for that, or where the money is going to, I do not know.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to tell us to whom this money is going, and to explain why he is taking it from one set of people in order to hand it to another section.  I have had many difficult problems to face in my life, as all of us have had. I remember having to face the problem in school many years ago of the integral calculus, and of sitting there trying to find out what it meant.  I remember that I was in an absolute fog about it, but I must confess that I am in just as big a fog over the meaning of this Bill as I was over the meaning of the integral calculus.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us what the money is wanted for and who is getting the benefit of it.</P>

      <P>I should like to call the Minister's attention to Section 20, which has to do with special provisions for the Kerry cattle area.  I come from that part of the <Col N="64" /> country and, naturally, I am interested in that section.  Although this section may be calculated to benefit that area. I think that, in actual fact, it is not really a just section at all.  If you take Kerry itself, the cattle area there is only a smallish portion of the county, and there are other parts adjacent to that area on both sides where circumstances are quite similar.  Personally, I should suggest to the Minister that, unpopular as it is in my own area, the whole section should be re-drafted so as to permit of the levy being adjusted or restricted, if the Minister wishes to do so, according to the individual circumstances prevailing in any district. I suggest that the Minister could define districts in exactly the same way as in the case of the Gaeltacht.  I believe, however, that, as the section stands, the Minister will not be able to meet the case he wants to meet, and that it will only lead to injustice.  I think that any other points I wished to mention have been dealt with by other speakers already.</P>

      <P>Most of the discussion on this Bill centred round the levy on farmers' butter, and perhaps if I can make that matter somewhat clear I will have dealt with most of the arguments that have been raised on this Bill.  I want to make it clear to Senator Jameson and others that a subsidy out of Government funds, which is covered by an Estimate put before the Dáil under &ldquo;export bounties,&rdquo; is paid on butter.  It covers the tariffs.  As a matter of fact, up to a little while ago, we were giving 5/- more than the tariff on butter going into Great Britain. Now the price of butter has gone up, and the position to-day is that the subsidy given out of Government funds is exactly equal to the tariff, and we are legislating here as if there was no economic war.  You can put the Government subsidy against the tariff.  We are getting a price for butter from Great Britain as if we were paying no tariff.  Of course, <Col N="65" /> I cannot answer Senator Jameson's question as to whether the Government will continue to pay the amount of the tariff or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it included in the Finance Bill that is to come before us later?  I take it that it is one of the things which we will have an opportunity of debating on the Finance Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I cannot really say whether the Exchequer will continue to make up the full amount of the tariff. That will depend, to a great extent, on what the world price for butter is.  If butter goes up on the British market to 120/- or 140/- per cwt., or some figure like that, it is possible that the Exchequer might drop out and say &ldquo;that is quite sufficient.&rdquo;  However, it is not very probable that the price will be raised to that figure.  Senator Jameson appeared to find it difficult to understand how this Bill could benefit the industry, seeing, as he said, that we are taking the money from one person and giving it to another person in the industry.  Perhaps it would be well if I were to give the House an example of how this operates.  Suppose our exports were equal to our imports&mdash;an example of this kind will, I think, make it easier for Senators to understand the position&mdash;and, suppose, this Bill were not operating, if a person had 2 cwt. of butter to sell he would sell 1 cwt. of it in England for 80/- and the other cwt. at home for 80/-.  He would sell at home at the export price, and would therefore be getting £8 for his 2 cwt. of butter.  Suppose that we were to give a bounty of 20/- under the scheme proposed in this Bill, it would mean that he would be getting 80/- for the cwt. of butter he exported, and 20/- by way of bounty.  That would give him 100/- for his cwt. of butter, and, naturally, he will not sell the second cwt. at home unless he gets 100/- for it.  Failing to get that he will export it for 100/-.  In that way, he gets £10 for his 2 cwt. of butter; he will pay £1 levy on it, and he receives the net sum of £9 instead of the £8 that he got under the first example I gave.  I hope I have made that clear to the Senators.</P>

      <Col N="66" /> This Bill, as I have said, is not the result of the economic war.  I know, of course, that if I were to bring in a Bill here to rename the Clydesdale horse&mdash;to call it by some other name &mdash;there are certain Senators who would say that a measure like that had been introduced as a result of the economic war.  In fact, I do not think that I have ever brought a Bill to the Seanad that was not described by some Senators as being a result of the economic war, and I suppose I shall never bring a Bill here that will not be so described by some Senators. That is how all these measures appear to Senator Counihan, Senator Miss Browne and a few other Senators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What about them?  That was not a result of the economic war. There is another thing that I want to make clear.  This is not a Bill to help the creameries as against farmers' butter.  After all, if we are collecting the same levy on butter, whether it is creamery or farmers' butter, and if we are giving the same bounty on all that butter, how can it be said that this Bill is brought in to help the creameries at the expense of the farmers?  What we are doing under the Bill is this: we are collecting the same levy from the creameries and from the farmers and we are giving the same bounty, so that both are in the same relative position.  They are in the same position as if this Bill were not introduced at all.  I said here earlier to-day that the price of New Zealand butter is so much.  Let us say that it is 81/-, and that Irish Free State butter is 80/-.  Putting the subsidy against the tariff, and with the bounty that we will be paying here, the creamery will get 100/- net.  On the average, the creamery pays 20/- per cwt. for the cost of manufacture, so that after meeting all expenses the creamery is left with 80/- to pay to its suppliers.  A factory making butter in this country at the present time will, after it has paid the tariff and having received the subsidy and the bounty out of this fund, get 93/-.  It will get <Col N="67" /> back about 91/- or 90/-.  Its expenses will amount to about 10/-, so that it also will be left with about 80/- per cwt. to pay out to producers.  In both cases you get the same average amount.</P>
      <P>Senator Bagwell said that this Bill was a plan to encourage people to come together and put up creameries.  I do not see that it offers any inducement to farmers at the present time to organise a creamery in their districts. If they churn their own milk and bring in their butter once a week to the local market they are entitled to get under this Bill 80/- per cwt. for it.  If they bring it to the creamery they will also get 80/- per cwt., but if they take their milk to the creamery they will be put to the expense of delivering it there once a day.  If any Senator doubts what I say on that, I am prepared to give him the names of three or four places with which I have been in communication in the last two or three weeks.  In my letters to people in those districts I have advised them not to organise creameries.  I have told them that in my honest opinion it would be better for them to go in for the production of farmers' butter under this Bill.  I think that gives the House a good idea of what the Bill aims at.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator seems to think that the Government should control everything.  Apparently he wants Government control all over. We want to allow the ordinary economic forces to work as much as possible.  Senator Counihan may be one of those people who would like to see the methods of Soviet Russia in operation here, with Government control over everything.  My desire is to go as little as possible in that direction. I was asked why we were proposing to take the levies from the farmers and not from the Exchequer. <Col N="68" /> If any Senator has a suggestion to make to the Minister for Finance when he comes here with his Finance Bill that we should get the money from the Exchequer instead of having this levy, pointing out to him some other source from which he can raise the money, I can assure that Senator that he will have my strong support.  I would be very glad to hear some Senator put a concrete suggestion on that before the Minister for Finance: that he should raise the money in some other way. Will some Senator be courageous enough to suggest to the Minister that he should put an extra tax on tea, sugar, bread, corporation profits tax or some other of the unpopular taxes that have been put on lately?  If some Senator has the courage to do that, I for one will support him.</P>
      <P>We have been told by Senator Miss Browne that the farmers will pay £300,000 in levies under this Bill.  If they do, we will be able to pay a bounty of £6 per cwt. to the farmers. If Senator Miss Browne's figures are correct, then, under this Bill, farmer's butter will be worth 1/9 per lb., but the point is I do not believe her figures are correct.  Senator Miss Browne quoted some other figures.  She said that a farmer with ten cows will be paying £2 a week in levies.  Well, that man must have wonderfully good cows.  Each of them must be giving four gallons of milk per day, or more, in addition to what they give to meet the requirements of the man's own family in milk and butter, and allowing also for great efficiency in the churning. It is considered, I think, that 1 lb. of butter from 2½ gallons of milk represents very efficient churning in the home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is not going to cost a lot for inspection.  In addition to the inspectors already employed throughout the country eight additional inspectors will be required for areas not covered at the present time.  Their employment will cost between £3,000 and £4,000 a year.  I think it is only right that the cost of this inspection should come out of the butter fund, especially as the registration fees are <Col N="69" /> going into it.  In the case of most Bills of this kind, the registration fees go into the Exchequer, but in this particular case the registration fees are going into the butter fund, and the inspectors are to be paid out of it.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill that really ought to have been drawn up by the butter industry itself, if it were properly organised, and not by the Government. That is what is done in other countries. Bills of this kind should be drawn up by the butter industry itself, and if that were done, naturally the industry would provide the cost of administering it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in the districts they are in.  But these eight additional inspectors will be for the purpose of looking after districts in which creamery inspectors are not placed. They will not, of course, inspect for quality.  It is not their job to inspect the quality of the butter, but rather to look after other matters : to see that the returns are properly kept, and so on.  I do not quite understand the force of the argument that Senator Bagwell advanced against the Bill. He said it was a means of taking money out of one Irishman's pocket and putting it into another Irishman's pocket.  I fear that is the result of a great deal of our legislation.  Senator Bagwell, I believe, understands something about railways.  Suppose a railway company wanted to increase fares, would it be a wrong argument to use that they were simply taking money out of an Irishman's pocket and putting it into the pockets of an Irish Railway Company?  The object of most of our legislation is to try and do justice as between one Irishman and another, and why we should try to take money out of the pocket of anybody, except an Irishman, I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator Baxter that we should make a great drive at the present time to increase our exports because there is no doubt, <Col N="70" /> taking the country as a whole, that we are exporting at a loss.  It is quite evident that we could not export at 80/- per cwt. and give the producer a fair return.  The result is that we have to bring in a Bill like this to give him some help on every cwt. of butter that he sends out.  The home consumer has to pay a certain amount extra on the butter that he consumes at home in order to help.  I do not think that it is a type of export that we ought to encourage.  At the same time, I do not want to be taken as saying that we ought to discourage it, and one reason is that the number of cows in the country has been increasing rather rapidly in the last couple of years.</P>
    <P>I agree with everything that Senator Baxter said about marketing.  The Senator's speech on that was really helpful.  There are, of course, certain difficulties in connection with it.  To be quite frank, what I feel about it is this: that if I were to come down too strongly on the side of central marketing it might do harm because, as Senator Baxter has said, there is a certain amount of feeling against it still.  I think that feeling against central marketing is disappearing and that it is much more likely to disappear altogether if those who are its advocates have not a Minister to deal with who is going too far in that direction. I feel that the Minister ought to try to take a middle line until we get things going, and whether I believe strongly in it or not, I think it would be wrong to take a very strong line on that question at the moment.  I am very much inclined to leave the matter to this Provisional Committee which has been formed.  I think that the Provisional Committee is doing well on the whole.  The members have met with a good reception at the meetings which they have held and I think it is quite likely that we shall, in time, evolve a system of some sort of ordered or central marketing.

    <Col N="71" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is as to the minimum price.  Senator Baxter holds that the minimum price will be very difficult to operate.  I do not think it will because, after all, when we are dealing with creameries, we are dealing with very different people from private individuals such as were referred to under another Act.  These creameries are co-operative.  There will be, at least, a desire to co-operate in a scheme like this and the great majority of them will, I think, co-operate to get this minimum price enforced.  Again, they have to keep their accounts and do their business in a very open way. If they were to evade a responsibility like this, they could not eventually conceal the fact.  They would be found out.  I doubt that any large number of creameries would try to conceal such a thing.  The big majority would, I think, fall in with this proposal.</P>
      <P>We have given very big encouragement to winter dairying during the last three years because, under the last Act, the levy was not collected from 1st December to 31st March.  Last winter, that meant that butter was worth 39/- a cwt. more than for the other months.  That is as big a difference as any Senator could expect in the way of encouragement for winter dairying.  I do not know whether we can continue that very substantial difference.  It all depends on how our bounty fund goes.  If that is solvent on 1st December, we shall certainly exempt the producers completely from the levy during these four months.  If it is necessary to make up any deficit in the fund on the 1st December, it may be necessary to continue the levy at some small rate&mdash;say 25 per cent. or 15 per cent. of what it was during the remainder of the year.  Last year, we were in the happy position of having no deficit, so that we could take off the levy entirely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was told by several Senators that the provisions in this Bill for the collection of a levy on farmers' butter were most unpopular.  I think they are.  I got quite a number of communications from private individuals <Col N="72" /> and public institutions protesting against this levy on farmers' butter. So far as I could see, these protests were practically all based on a misunderstanding of the measure.  I am afraid it is rather hopeless to try to convince anybody that this measure is going to work out as anticipated.  All I could do in the Dáil was to advise Deputies to wait and see how it would work.  I think that Senator Dowdall is quite right on that point.  The only thing which will prove whether the Senators who spoke against this measure are right or whether my Department and I are right is the manner in which the Act works when it is four or six weeks in operation. Senator Johnson has, I think, placed the burden of this levy better than anybody else.  I think that it is going to come mostly, but not entirely, from the consumers.  Senator Johnson asked me if I could give him the effects on the relevant positions of creamery and farmers' butter.  What the Senator says is, I think, true&mdash;that farmers' butter is consumed more in the smaller towns than in the cities. It would, I think, be also true to say that, in the creamery counties, farmers' butter is not so much consumed as it is in the other counties. In any event, so far as this levy is concerned, in the four months from 1st December to 31st March, it will not make any difference, because there will probably be no levy during that time.  Farmers' butter was, on the average, about 1/2 or 1/3 per lb. during those four months of last winter.  I suppose it is likely to be the same price next winter and there will not be any difference whatsoever so far as those four months are concerned. Take the position in the other eight months.  It has been claimed by certain Senators that farmers are getting 8d. or 9d. per lb. for their butter now.  There is no doubt that, in those cases, the consumer will pay the full levy.  No farmer is going to pay the levy and sell his butter at less than 1/- or so to any consumer, because it would pay him better to make it into a lump and sell it on the fresh butter market.  No consumer, <Col N="73" /> when this Bill is passed, will get butter at less than 1/1.  Those who are buying butter at 8d. or 9d. per lb. now will probably have to pay 1/1 in future. Where 1/1 or 1/2 is being paid at the present time, the levy will, in all probability, be divided between the farmer and the consumer.  How it will work out in the total, I find it difficult to say.  It will not be a big amount when spread over the whole.  The amount we expect to collect on farmers' butter under this Bill is £150,000.</P>

      <P>That will only be in the case where the consumer is, at the present time, by a great stroke of luck, getting his butter at 8d. or 9d., while everybody else is paying from 1/2 to 1/5.  We are expecting to collect about £150,000 altogether on farmers' butter. Last year, we collected about half that amount, so that this Bill is not going to take a great deal off the farmers' butter.  The amount will be considerably less than £100,000&mdash;probably not more than £50,000 or £60,000.  That is the difference which this Bill will make.  I might have told Senator Johnson, when replying to his point, that a great deal of farmers' butter was levied last year.  Whether the consumer or the producer paid that levy, there is going to be no change this year, so that the consumer will pay the same for butter in that case. The change which this Bill is making in the Act of 1932 refers only to a very small amount.  The amount collected in levy on non-creamery butter last year was £58,000.  We expect to collect about £150,000 this year.  The difference, therefore, would be about £90,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it very difficult to reply to Senator Toal.  He said that farmers' butter was going to be absolutely wiped out.  Then he said that the people who are buying farmers' butter were, on account of having to pay the levy, going to be destroyed.  If the farmers have to pay the levy, then the <Col N="74" /> consumer will not have to pay it.  If the consumer has to pay it, the farmer is all right.  The Senator wound up by saying that the Government would never collect the levy, so that it would make no difference.  If he had said that at first, it would not have been necessary to say any more.  It is possible that the Seanad may be inclined to allow the Second Reading of this Bill through, with a division or without a division, with the intention of raising the question of the levy on farmers' butter later.  It is absolutely impossible to work this scheme any further unless all butter is levied.  If such an amendment were carried, it would be really a question of dropping the Bill entirely.  I am stating that as a plain fact and not as a threat.</P>

      <P Just="Center">PART II.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Regulation of the Business of the Production of Pigs.</P>
      <P>5.  &mdash;Whenever it appears to the Minister that the number of pigs immediately available or which may otherwise become available in any future period of six months in Saorstát Eireann will be so much in excess of the requirements of the pig and bacon trade as to render the unlimited production of pigs undesirable, the Minister may&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) prohibit the use of registered boars for the service of sows except under licence, and</P>
      <P>(b) make regulations for the issue of such licences, the distribution and allocation of such licences in proportion to the pigs normally raised in any one district, the variation of the number of licences as between districts and all other cognate matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his concluding remarks on the Second Stage of this Bill the Minister interpreted my understanding of the measure somewhat wrongly and said that I evidently thought that the curers were to get everything they wanted. That is not correct.  I said that the curers would get a definite income, but I realise fully that definite income may on occasion mean little more than the cost of production.  It is because I want to ensure a minimum of the cost of production to the producer, to the <Col N="76" /> original essential unit of the pig industry, and because I want to eliminate, as far as possible, wasteful effort on the part of those least in touch with the market, that I have put down the amendment.  As the House will realise the amendment is in the form of a token in order to allow further discussion at this stage.  I hope the Minister will accept it in principle, and submit a more complete one on the Report Stage, even though hitherto he has contemplated avoiding this issue.  My contention on the Second Reading was that if you are going to regiment an industry then you must do it completely.</P>
    <P>To use a military parallel, it is fatal to go into battle with your officers and sergeants in good order and your men doing what they like in the ranks behind.  The ultimate result would be that the whole show would suffer severely, and unnecessarily, and even under the most favourable circumstances the good results hoped for would not be got.  I thought that the Minister's attitude on the Second Reading was seriously sympathetic, and that he knew that the measure was faulty while lacking this provision, and that sooner or later he would have to introduce a measure to cope with the problem we are discussing.  I gathered also that he thought there were difficulties, and that special legislation would have to be introduced to deal with the situation which I wish to anticipate.  I suggest that all the necessary machinery is available and that the matter is very much simpler to deal with than has appeared to the minds of the Minister and his officials. It may not be necessary to bring the machinery into action and it is for that reason I have given to my token a permissive character.  We have all experienced the continued uncertainties of the pig market.  They were stressed by the Minister and other speakers on the Second Reading, and if this measure is not to be a disappointment, particularly to the small producers, I am convinced that the powers to deal with an emergency should be available.  I expect that the <Col N="77" /> Minister knows as well as anybody the difficulty in finding room in a legislative programme for an amending Bill, and I urge him, for that reason, to make the best use of his present opportunity.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I am right in suggesting it, but it may be that the Minister put this matter on one side because of the difficulties which would arise if all sows were to be registered.  Of course, that would be very cumbersome and expensive, and would mean inspection, delay, and a largely increased staff.  In my alternative proposal you have all the necessary machinery, not only to hand but ready to operate.  You have registered boats located at definite distances apart and apportioned in relation to the number of pigs usually bred in any one district.  The owners of these boars have got lists of the people who keep sows and usually breed pigs.  You have the personnel of the Department scattered over the country who could be utilised in the course of their ordinary duties for superintending, checking and advising.  With this machinery it only remains to issue so many licences to each boar and make regulations for their equitable distribution. The scheme contemplates the minimum of disturbance.  A friend of mine, a big pig producer, asked me what was going to happen to him. He produces 250 pigs every year. He remarked: &ldquo;I suppose I will get no licence.&rdquo;  The intention is to leave him alone.  There is no doubt that there would be cases of evasion, but if owners of registered pigs were made aware that unauthorised service would mean the transfer of the boar elsewhere, or that no new application would be entertained for another one, I think adequate care would be taken to prevent unauthorised service.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that as litters varied in size it would be hard to arrive at anything like a correct figure of requirement to fill the quota at a given time.  I do not think there is much in that.  The Department has a very good idea of the <Col N="78" /> average number of pigs that will come to maturity from a given number of sows.  I am urging this matter strongly on the Minister and on the House because, as this is a permissive section, I feel that the opportunity which this Bill presents should be taken full advantage of, and that we should not put a measure which is defective in such an important aspect on the Statute Book.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe with Senator The McGillycuddy that eventually something on the lines suggested by him to restrict the production of pigs will have to be adopted, but that time has not come yet.  When it does come there must be greater consideration as to how production is to be restricted.  If the Minister is thinking of accepting the amendment I want him to consider what is going to happen to the feeder of pigs who does not produce.  You are going to restrict the production of stores and if that is done you are leaving it in the hands of producers to raise prices considerably above the cost which would make it remunerative to feed pigs.  At present, a good many small farmers and agricultural labourers are going to keep pigs whether they pay or not.  They reckon the pig as having a sort of saving value.  A big farmer who produces and feeds pigs for profit would be able to do without them if the price of stores went too high, but the small farmers and labourers will keep a pig no matter what the price of stores.  The Senator realises that more consideration must be given to the restriction of production. For that reason the amendment should not be accepted at present. There is no reason why pigs should be produced to any great extent at present prices, and I do not think that situation will arise for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind Senator The McGillycuddy and other Senators that we are seeking to solve the bacon problem in another way in this Bill, and it is not by limiting production. I feel that if it came to the <Col N="79" /> limitation of production of pigs it will be a rather big thing to do and will probably require very elaborate machinery.  If Senators read the report of the Pig Industries Tribunal they will have seen that when the Dutch set out to do that they had a very big organisation, a central organisation, district committees and parish committees.  In order to get any sort of justice between farmer and farmer you would require to have machinery of that kind.  I must say that this is a very ingenuously-drafted amendment and is very concise. It contains a great deal because it would give power to reduce the number of sows.  It is put in a terse way.  On the other hand, perhaps there should be safeguards so that certain things are taken into consideration, and that a person over three years in production should be considered more than a person who is only trying to get into production. There are also other difficulties.  I think the Senator saw the difficulties in his amendment.  If parties disputed about what was to be done the only way we could act would be to threaten to remove the licence from the owner of the boar.  I think under existing legislation we have not got that power.  Once a licence is given, unless the boar is found on examination to be below standard under the Live-stock Breeding Act, that licence cannot be removed.  There would be difficulties of that kind.  A person may go on disobeying our order and we have no way of dealing with him because there is no penalty of any kind provided for. A very big consideration was also raised by Senator Counihan, that it might not be the best way to deal with it, because the people who are fattening pigs&mdash;the big man or the small man, as the case may be&mdash;must get for those pigs a certain price; otherwise, it would not pay them.  If the producers of small pigs felt there was a great scarcity they would put up the price, especially if they knew that a competitor could come into the market.  So I think it may not be the best way to deal with it.  I think, on <Col N="80" /> the whole, I could agree to accept this amendment, but I think it would be dishonest to do so, because I do not think it would be workable.  Perhaps it is the best way that could be suggested at the moment, but I do not think it could be worked.  If it comes to the stage where we have to regulate production, I am afraid it will mean another Bill and certainly a more elaborate Bill to cover a case of this kind.  Probably there would have to be a number of clauses containing safeguards for the producers.  I am sure Senators would like the producers safeguarded against the Minister; that the Minister would not have an absolute discretion.  I would like to ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment, because I do not think it could ever be worked.  We shall have to bring in a special Bill if the occasion arises.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask Senator The McGillycuddy a few questions with reference to this amendment. The Senator is perfectly aware that in County Kerry, where he comes from, the small farmer tries to have young pigs about the time when feeding is plentiful.  He knows just as well as I do that young pigs are fed on small potatoes and that sort of thing in the harvest time, when feeding is plentiful.  I wish to ask the Senator this question: If this amendment was accepted by the Minister, and if he endeavoured to put the regulation into force, how could he prevent a man from getting a sow served in Kilgarvan or Kenmare?  The thing is altogether illogical.</P>

    <Speaker pid="McGillycuddyReeks" hpid="The McGillycuddy of the Reeks The McGillycuddy of the Reeks">
      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy of the Reeks</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister probably would have to arrange that so many licences would be issued at a certain time of the year; a time that would fit in when the small potatoes were available.  That would cover the matter raised by Senator Healy.  Senator Counihan, I think, said that the thing had not been deeply considered.  As a matter of fact, it has been considered by half a dozen different counties, and it has been considered <Col N="81" /> at very great length in the Dáil.  The Minister has said definitely on several occasions that it is only the difficulties and repercussions and want of legislation in certain particulars which have prevented him taking the powers that are suggested.  He mentioned the case of the small farmer and the labourer who would like to have their pig.  It is really the product of that type of man that I wanted to bring in under this amendment; the man who gets, say, 24/- a week, or works broken time.  As regards penalties, the Minister said there was no power to impose a penalty on the owner of a registered boar.  In many Bills that were before the House, I have seen penalties broadcast in every section.  I feel quite sure that that difficulty could have been got over and would have been got over quickly if the Minister really thought it was advisable to accept this amendment. As I said in my opening remarks, I put down this amendment as a token. I know it is not perfect and that it could not possibly be perfect, but I put it down to draw attention to the importance of a thing which I am convinced should be in this Bill. I very much regret that the Minister cannot manage to take a freshly-drafted amendment, and I have to ask the leave of the House to withdraw the amendment.</P>

I think the Minister ought to look into that point.  I think it ought at least to be seven days.  Anything may happen in the post.  A man would have committed an offence by not having sent in his return within three days.  I do not think it would raise any complications <Col N="82" /> for the Department if the time were extended.</P>
      <P>Line 15 would also require an amendment and sub-section (4) would need a further amendment, because there you have the words &ldquo;as soon as may be after the seventh day after the expira tion of every accounting period.&rdquo;  I think the Minister should look into that, as it may turn out to be unfair to the minor curer.</P>

      <P>Section 19, sub-section (2).  To delete in line 54 the words &ldquo;Minister may cancel&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;Court may, on the application of the Minister and in addition to any other penalty that may be imposed, order the cancellation of.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the section as it stands, the Minister takes power to cancel the licence. The object of my amendment is to take that power from the Minister.  In the first instance, the person from whom he proposes to remove the licence will have to be convicted in court.  The amendment suggests that when the prosecution takes place, the Minister may apply to the court to have the licence cancelled altogether.  There are cases where minor or technical offences could be committed.  In such cases the Minister could revoke the licences.  In the case of publicans, fines are sometimes imposed but the licences are not endorsed.  I think the Minister would be wise to allow the judge to decide whether a licence should be revoked or not.  The judge would be able to give a more impartial decision.  I think the people concerned would have more confidence if it were left to the judge to say whether the licence should be revoked or not.  Of course, I do not want to cast any reflection on the Minister or on his inspectors.  This Bill possibly will be in force for all time.  I hope we shall not have the present Minister in power for long unless he changes his present policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Counihan is really over-anxious on this point. Many Bills have gone through where power was taken to cancel licences without going to court at all.  Practically every Act that went through <Col N="84" /> has that provision&mdash;the Dairy Produce Act, for instance, the Eggs Act, the Fresh Meat Act, the Cereals Act and the recent Cattle Act.  In every one of these Acts there is a section setting out the grounds on which the Minister may cancel the licence of the premises that are being dealt with under those different Acts where the Minister was of opinion that the Act was contravened by commission or omission. The Minister need not go to court to cancel a licence if an Act is contravened.  Here at least we have to go to court.  In this Bill the same power is not claimed.  The Minister cannot do this unless the judge first convicts.  If the Senator were to look up those cases, I think he would find very little cause to complain. It is extremely difficult, as a matter of fact, to get any person's licence cancelled under any of those Acts. First of all the inspectors, usually on their own initiative, overlook the first few offences.  When they report a person to the Department, it is rather serious; then, of course, a first report by an inspector is not taken as seriously as subsequent reports.  He has to report several times before the Department takes action.  By the time the matter reaches the Minister several representations have been made.  Of course, the Minister has to hold an inquiry and it is extremely difficult to get a cancellation through. At any rate, nobody could contend that a cancellation could take place without thorough examination.  In this Bill, we are not going as far as we did in other Bills.  We have to bring the person to court and get a conviction before a cancellation takes place. Now, it was felt by the Department of Agriculture before I went there&mdash; because when Deputy Hogan was Minister for Agriculture he had the same clauses in Bills&mdash;that whenever there is a contravention the Department is in a better position to know whether there should be a cancellation than even a judge.  They are in a better position to know whether there is a tendency in the district to contravene the Act in that particular way.  You have to remove a person sometimes <Col N="85" /> from the register to show that drastic action is really going to be taken. Sometimes these people are again restored, but sometimes not.  I think, and the Seanad agreed with me on the occasion of a former Bill, that the Department&mdash;for it is the Department in these cases more than the Minister that acts&mdash;is in a better position to judge whether cancellation should take place.  The judge's function is to inflict a fine.  I think it may be taken that this power is never used lightly or without the greatest possible consideration, and I think the Senator should withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Minister I did not put down this amendment as in any way a matter of obstruction, or with a view to causing any reflection upon the Minister or his inspectors.  In this particular case he will have to bring the culprit into court.  He may have to ask to have the licence revoked.  If he does not want to have the licence revoked he may press for a fine.  There are poor butchers in this country, and minor curers, who feel that influence could be brought to bear upon an inspector to have them watched.  It is easy to find an excuse for bringing a person into court.  I do not agree with that, but to create greater confidence I think the Minister would be well advised to accept this amendment or at least to accept the spirit of it and bring up one on his own account on Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a certain matter of principle involved in this, on which I would like to express my view.  The proposition is that the justice should have power to cancel a licence, that is, on the application of the Minister.  If a judge is satisfied that the offence is committed on the case made by the prosecution and he inflicts a penalty that is the utmost you should ask the judge to do on the evidence up to that moment.  This is a case as to whether it is desirable that a licence should be cancelled and all the other factors have to be taken into account&mdash;the effect of the cancellation <Col N="86" /> upon a man and his living and all the rest.  It seems to me that it is undesirable that that should be the procedure in this or in the general run of such cases.  If there is going to be an appeal to the justice it should be a separate case made after the conviction has been secured and not an automatic operation, or even appeal in the case made for the prosecution.  It is for the Minister to come to the magistrate and to press for a certain penalty&mdash;it may be half or for the lot&mdash;but it is in the option of the justice.  Now he is asked to ask for a penalty of a particular amount.  It is like the Continental system where the prosecutor demands the death penalty or 20 years' imprisonment and where that is part of the prosecution.  Before we proceed to adopt such a method I think we ought to consider it very carefully.  It seems to me the proposition in the amendment goes a good deal farther than the Senator thinks.</P>

      <P>I cannot agree with Senator Lynch's eulogy of Senator Johnson's condemnation of the amendment. After all, the act of a district court when the magistrate has endorsed a publichouse licence for breach of the licensing laws is on all fours with what Senator Counihan asks in this amendment.  I think it is a very good way out of the difficulty that presents itself, as explained by Senator Counihan, namely, that to the people affected, even without the Minister's personal knowledge, a wrong might be done.  I think it would instil confidence into the people concerned if the Minister would accept the amendment and allow it to pass.</P>

      <P>The section as it stands provides that the Minister when granting a new licence should consult the Bacon Board. I think it would be more to the point that he should consult the Pigs Board. After all, the Bacon Board would not be very much in favour of setting up another factory which might be in opposition.  The Minister, I think, should change from consulting the Bacon Board to consulting the Pigs Board.</P>
