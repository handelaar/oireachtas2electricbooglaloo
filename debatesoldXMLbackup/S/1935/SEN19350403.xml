      <P>This amendment is introduced for the purpose of meeting a point that was raised by Senator Milroy on the Committee Stage as to whether a commercial attaché and people of that class were covered by <Col N="1566" /> the text of the Bill as it stood.  My opinion was that it was already covered, but to make assurance doubly sure we are prepared to agree to the insertion of this amendment. It means that when a person in such a position is declared by the Minister for External Affairs to be an official representative in Saorstát Eireann of the Government of a particular country, then the immunities that are indicated in the preceding paragraphs of the section with regard to diplomatic representatives will be granted to such person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 5.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(8)  Whenever an order made under an aliens order is made in respect of aliens of a particular class or in respect of particular aliens, such order shall be published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> as soon as may be after it is made.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I dealt with this on the Committee Stage.  The proposal is to amend the section to provide that, whenever an order is made by the Minister under an aliens order in respect of aliens of a particular class or in respect of particular aliens, such order shall be published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  If one is to take the Aliens Order of 1925 as typical of the kind of order that would be made, one finds a section such as this: &ldquo;The Minister may by order impose on any alien or class of aliens such restrictions (either in addition to or in substitution for other restrictions imposed by this order) as to residence, reporting to the police, etc.&rdquo;  That means to say, that the Minister is going to have considerable power to deal with classes of individuals or with individuals.  My amendment seeks to do the least possible that should be required of a Minister; that is to say, that if he is going to make an order under an aliens order to apply to a particular class of aliens the public should be made aware of it.  It should not be a secret matter between the Minister and a class of aliens or an alien.  We should know exactly what the Minister is going to do with the powers that are given to him.  I find that Article 13 of the Aliens Order of 1925 provides:</P>
      <P>The Minister may direct that any person or class of persons shall be exempt either unconditionally or subject to such conditions as the Minister may impose from all or any of the provisions of this Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There, again, we have a sample of the kind of power that is being given to <Col N="1569" /> the Minister: to make orders which are not to be laid before the Oireachtas and which, as I have said&mdash; unless we provide for publicity&mdash;may be a secret matter between the Minister and an alien or classes of aliens. It is undesirable, I think, that the Minister should have such powers. What I am seeking is that official notification should be given of the making of such an order, so that the public can be made aware of what is happening, in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last day I indicated the objections, from our point of view, to publication in the case of a particular person: that if you did mention a reason for the order, then the worst possible construction would be put upon it.  I said then that if there were a number of reasons for which a person may be deported that it was possible&mdash;if there was publicity &mdash;it would be said, for instance, that he was deported for moral reasons or something of that sort: that at any rate the worst possible reason was likely to be attributed to him.  The question is, could you give in each case the reasons?  I feel that you could not. I feel there would be classes of cases in which the full reasons could not be stated.  I promised on the last day that I would have this sympathetically considered and examined in the Departments concerned.  That has been done, and there is very strong objection to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be prepared to go this far: to accept the amendment with the deletion of the words &ldquo;or in respect of particular aliens.&rdquo;  I know that that does not completely meet the Senator's point of view.  Perhaps he will say that it is with regard to particular persons, and not classes, that he wants publicity.  I am afraid that we could not agree to that.  If we were to agree to it it would lead to considerable difficulty from the administrative point of view.  It might also do unnecessary harm perhaps to individuals.  We could not agree to have the orders with relation to particular persons published, but if the House would <Col N="1570" /> permit it and the Senator is satisfied, I am prepared to accept the amendment with the deletion of the words &ldquo;or in respect of particular aliens.&rdquo; We are meeting the Senator on his point with regard to class but not with regard to individuals.  I grant there are reasons why orders of this sort should not be kept secret and should be published.  I indicated some of these on the last day.  I referred to publicity by way of Parliamentary Question or of returns.  It was suggested, and probably rightly, that if there is to be publicity there will be less harm by having the publicity in a publication such as the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> than by way of Parliamentary Question or Parliamentary Return.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words on the general character of this legislation.  It is desirable to make a protest or to utter a warning, so that the House or, at least, the Ministry <Col N="1571" /> will realise the tendency of legislation of this kind.  The plan of the Constitution is that the Legislature makes laws, and an Executive has to administer those laws.  This is one of numerous Bills of the kind that have been passed at different times. Hitherto power has been given to the Minister in fact to legislate, because when a Bill hands to a Minister powers to issue orders, and to prescribe punishments for the breach of those orders, I consider that is legislation.  I recognise quite well that sometimes, and for several classes of laws, this procedure is inevitable, but it should be minimised and restricted as much as possible.  The original Aliens Act, of which this is pretty well a copy was passed under war conditions in 1914, and made it possible for a Minister to make orders which had the effect of statutes.  After the war that particular piece of legislation was carried on, but had to be re-enacted year by year.  The position of this Bill is that it is a permanent piece of legislation, which has not to be re-enacted year by year. Nevertheless, it gives very great powers to the Minister, subject, of course, to the Aliens Orders, which the Minister may issue under the Act, being laid upon the Table of the House.  That procedure enables the House at some time within 21 sitting days after the order has been made to have it annulled, but, in practice, we know it means that the Minister is as effective as the Legislature with this particular group of questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the order itself, as I pointed out in the last amendment, may contain powers which are in effect legislative powers to make orders which are not required to be laid upon the Table, so that on the assumption that the aliens order that is to be laid upon the Table will contain some such provision as this, &ldquo;the Minister may by order impose on any alien or class of alien such restrictions either in addition to or in substitution of&rdquo; other restrictions imposed by the order.  Certain aliens orders will be made by the Minister and laid upon the Table, but such an order, if the <Col N="1572" /> Minister follows precedent, will give him powers either in substitution of or in addition to the orders laid upon the Table.  That strikes me as containing possibilities of very great abuse, and it removes from the control of the Legislature powers which it should retain in its hands.  The objections I have made to this Bill are almost wholly of that character, that it gives to the Minister for the time being powers which ought, on all normal occasions, apart from emergency and war, be retained strictly by the Legislature.  This piece of legislation is in keeping with that body of statutes which is coming into vogue, which one might say transfers or devolves upon the Minister powers which the Legislature itself should retain.  I am in agreement that certain procedure of administrative legislation&mdash;if I may use the term&mdash;might be desirable in certain circumstances, but, I think, if the Legislature is going to move in that direction it should do it deliberately.  It should not give a little in this Bill, a little in another Bill, and a little more in a third Bill, so that we shall gradually be renouncing our responsibilities under the Constitution as the legislative authority. This Bill goes a long way in that direction, and it is on these grounds I have felt it necessary at least to utter a warning if not a protest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated a certain amount of sympathy with the point of view expressed by Senator Johnson.  However, I think he altogether exaggerated the tendency in this Bill, although it is a type of, measure in which inevitably a large amount of power must be given to the Executive.  I do not know whether it will be possible to evolve some form of machinery which will enable a certain amount of work to be gradually transferred from the Executive and to be performed more directly by the Parliament, or by some other machinery besides the Executive set up by the Parliament.  I do not see how it can be done.  I can assure the Senator that in this Bill every effort was made to leave to Parliament the powers it possessed.  Perhaps I misunderstood the Senator, but I thought he suggested that the Minister could impose punishment. <Col N="1573" /> I do not think that power is in the Bill.  It creates offences by law, and any punishment for such offences has to be inflicted by a court.  Here we are simply making certain things offences by legislation, and these offences have to be tried by a court. It is true that the Executive has to defend the general interests.  For example, having got permission from the Legislature to deport, the order under which special deportation orders come to be made has to be sanctioned in the long run by the Legislature, if not directly, indirectly; in the sense that members of the two Houses will have an opportunity of seeing the order, and if they think there is anything inimical in it to the public interest they can call attention to it, If the Legislature decides that such order should not have been made, it can be annulled.  I do not think we could have made this Bill effective in any other way.</P>
      <P>Parliament is given every opportunity to see all orders that are made, and, if it is not pleased with them, to annul them.  The only case in which there is anything like what I might call private action by the Executive is in the case of a deportation order, and I explained why we think there should not be publicity in a particular case. In such cases we have to depend upon the Executive having a proper view of its responsibilities, and upon Parliament taking care to hold&mdash;as it has the power of doing&mdash;the Executive accountable for all its actions.  The more powers given to an Executive like this the more necessary it is for Parliament to be watchful, and to see that the Executive which it appoints and controls works in the public interest.  Even though I have the same general feeling as Senator Johnson, I have no hesitation in recommending the Bill for final passage.</P>

      <P>Before this Bill is finally adopted by the Seanad, I should like to make one or two observations. In my judgment the Seanad has done very well in the active and helpful manner in which it has dealt with this Bill, and I am satisfied that that must give great satisfaction to the President; and particularly so when we find a Senator who is recognised as an authority on constitutional law, Senator Samuel Brown, stating that this is an absolutely necessary Bill, and is therefore a welcome Bill.  It is more or less in reference to that statement that I want to make my observations. The statement comes from Senator Brown who has shamed, if they have any shame left, some of those people who made the treacherous statements which appeared in flaming headlines in the English Press that this Bill was <Col N="1575" /> conceived by the President out of hatred to the English people.  This is another of those mean and brazen attempts which are very often made by people to drive a wedge between the friendship which does exist and which will exist, between the masses of the two countries.  Now, Sir, I am a long time before the mast-head of public life in this country.  Quite recently I was looking over some old papers, and I came across a card of membership of the Land League, bearing the date, December 19th, 1880, close on 55 years ago.  During that time I have seen many movements come and go; I have seen many leaders pass away, but I trust I will be allowed to express the sincere hope, and a hope which I, at any rate, am satisfied is shared by millions of our scattered race, that the man who sits before us, President Eamon de Valera, may be spared to go on, and to reach for our country that goal, which every man and woman in this country with any spark of patriotism should stand behind him in his endeavour to attain, that goal for which so many of our people suffered and died in their efforts to attain, in the words of that noble young patriot, &ldquo;that Ireland should take her place among the nations of the earth.&rdquo;  I am a fairly old man, and I may not live to see the realisation of these hopes, but I am satisfied that President de Valera and those associated with him are on the right road, and as the son of a Fenian&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I deny that on the part of a large section of our people.  I would like to see that friendship established, but England must earn our friendship.  So far she has not made any attempt to earn it, and where she has not bullied us, she has tricked us. Until she has learned to cease her bullying and trickery and to be generous to this country, and restore the rights she took from us, there will be no friendship between us and England&mdash;anyhow, between a large section of our country and England.  I did not intend to intervene in the debate, but I feel I would not be acting justly to a large section of our people if I allowed the remarks to which I have referred to pass without comment.

      <P>On behalf of women in general, I thank the present Government for the nationality it has given to its married women.  Formerly a woman became of the same nationality as the foreigner she married.  That was very unpleasant and in the wartimes it came home to a great many of us.  Many suggestions were offered and one was that the woman, wherever the marriage took place, should have the nationality of that place.  If she married a Frenchman here, she would remain Irish and if she married a Frenchman in France, she became French.  Women were not satisfied with that and finally the President saw that the only thing to do was to make <Col N="1577" /> sure under this Act that women would not lose their nationality on account of marriage.  Women have been pleading for this for years and years.  I know there are many who say that something further should be obtained in the way of descent through the mother, but what we have worked for for a very long time we have got, and most Irish women are satisfied with the progress that has been gained under this Bill.</P>

      <P>I want to make a few remarks on the speech of Senator Mrs. Clarke.  She may speak for a limited number of very extreme people but, for the reasonable people of this country, Senator O'Neill expressed the view that they wished to live on terms of friendship with their neighbours in Britain.  There is no reason, in my opinion, why they should not do that. Whatever may have been the history of the country in the past, there is no use in dragging it up time and time again in order to hinder further the progress of this country.  We know the terrible effects of this on the country. We know about the economic war which is ruining the country and dragging it in the mud while there is talk of progress, and talk about nationality.  Why do it?  It is a totally false and wrong interpretation of Irish history.  It may be the history that it taught in the schools, going back on the confiscations of the past as an excuse for raiding money which was due to certain people who lent it here. I maintain that was what was done.</P>

      <P>Senator Foran is one of those Senators who like to interrupt when they hear unpleasant things.  He is making a habit of it. <Col N="1578" /> We want to live in friendship with the British people and it is right and proper that that should be said here and that we should not allow any other impression to go from this country.  A very large and very important&mdash;the largest and most important&mdash;section of the Irish people wish to live on terms of friendship with the British people.  Senator O'Neill, when he was giving out this piece which he gave, forgot to say that the ablest legal opinion in this country and in Great Britain hold the opinion that in spite of this Nationality Bill, the people of this State still remain British citizens and that we have in it a great deal of eyewash.  That is not my opinion, as I do not profess to know anything about law, but it is the opinion of the ablest lawyers in this country and in Great Britain.  My object in speaking now is that some voice, no matter how insignificant, may be raised to contradict this trumpeting, as I might call it, of the extreme element in this country.  I believe that the other and very much larger section of our people is too inarticulate and that is my reason for speaking now.</P>

I thoroughly agree. Senator Mrs. Clarke wants it recorded that they do not wish to live in friendship.  I can assure her that she is speaking for a very small minority in this country, for a group that has been led astray by false and wrong propaganda.  I know the masses of this country and I know a considerable number of the masses of the English people, and I can say that they both have a greater love for one another than for any other country in the world.  I repeat it&mdash;than in any other country in the world, and I can assure Mrs. Clarke that she is wrong when she says that they do not wish to live in peace with one another.  We want love and not enmity, and I think it is very bad policy and propaganda to put forward in a responsible body, <Col N="1579" /> and I can say that she is not speaking on behalf of any responsible section of the community of this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a matter of considerable importance, and looking at it from an Irish point of view, Senator Mrs. Clarke gave expression to the sentiments of the great majority of the Irish people.  As Senator O'Neill stated, there would be no question of any hostility between the masses of the Irish people and the British nation, or the British people and the British Government, were it not for the fact that for centuries they are trying to dominate affairs in this country and to interfere with the rights of the Irish people.  That is what is the cause of the spirit of hostility between the masses of the Irish people and the masses of the British people, and it would be as well to ask the lion to lie down with the lamb as to ask the Irish people to have a spirit of brotherhood and a spirit of friendship with the English people as long as this uncalled-for interference with the rights of the Irish people is taking place, and there is no use separating the masses from the classes in England.  The classes in England are carrying out the wishes and the policy of the masses because in carrying out their policy the British <Col N="1580" /> Government is expressing the will of the English people and not the will of any section of the masses.  I think it just as well that this should be made clear; it does not matter what sections or parties people may represent in this country.  You will have that hostility so long as you have continued interference by England with the rights of the Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the last speaker's observations call for some slight rejoinder.  He spoke in the present tense, mind you, about the continuous interference with the rights of the Irish people by the British.  I would recall to the memory of the last speaker, to this House and this State, the fact that a Treaty of Peace between this country and England was entered into in 1921.  I know that that Treaty raised very deep and acute controversy, and I think that events that have occurred since then justify me in saying that the developments that have ensued fully justified and vindicated those who stood over that Treaty and overwhelmingly destroyed anything that was in the minds of those opponents who alleged that the Treaty was a trap by which the fundamental rights of this ancient country would be subjugated.  The reason I refer to it is this: whatever may have been the interference with the rights of the people of this country by England prior to that Treaty, whatever may have been the assaults up to then upon the liberty of the Irish people, on December 6th, 1921, that interference and those assaults ceased, and I challenge contradiction on that point.  Ever since that date the rights secured under that Treaty have been broadened and enlarged until to-day the man who led the assault against that Treaty stands as the man who is administering it and who recognises it, and who acknowledges repeatedly that what was secured went much farther than he anticipated at that time.  I am not raising this for the purpose of recalling these memories which have been recalled by previous speakers.  I recall it as leading up to what I have to say upon the Bill before the House, and that is that this Bill is one which, in <Col N="1581" /> its main premises, is, as Senator Browne stated, unnecessary, and there is no one who, in criticising that Bill, has questioned the necessity or the desirability of the Bill defining the form and status of nationality of this State.  What I would take exception to, and so far as criticism and questioning are concerned, I still hold to, is that the spirit of certain phrases in that Bill are an irritant to goodwill between this country and Great Britain.  They run counter to the spirit of goodwill and the development of harmonious, amicable and equitable relations between the people of this State and the other member States of the Commonwealth. I think it was a mistake that this irritant was introduced.  It was unnecessary in the Bill.  It cannot do any good, and quite possibly it will do a great deal of mischief.  I have not, however, approached this Bill in any partisan spirit, or with any desire to secure in the least degree a Party victory in debate, even though I could not secure it in division.  I hope that this Bill will not have any harmful result, and I wish the Government good luck with it when it becomes an Act.</P>

      <P>I do not know how much longer irrelevancies in this debate are going to continue, but the person who started it has a good deal to account for.  Except for Senator Mrs. Wyse Power and the greater part of Senator Milroy's speech, nobody touched upon the Bill at all, but they started a debate upon irrelevant questions for the purposes of singing a hymn of hate about the people of this country and the desirability for love and peace with the people of another country.  I think it is disgraceful that this mean advantage should have been taken in this House for anyone to sing a hymn of hate, and I would say that when the people here at home learn to love and respect each other in the way that ordinary citizens of a civilised State should, then we can discuss the question of love with the people of other nations.</P>

      <P>Senator Milroy has done what he blames others for doing. He said nothing about the Bill that was relevant.  I am going to offend in <Col N="1582" /> the same way but I want to say this much: I do not think it is quite right to try and make capital out of such things as hate and enmity where, in my opinion, those things do not exist. As one Senator, I wish to say that as between the ordinary common English people and myself there is no such thing as enmity, and I do not think that Senator Mrs. Clarke's speech has been taken up quite correctly.  There is no personal enmity, but if enmity is to be expressed where a domineering attitude is adopted most certainly enmity can be expressed through something, and the expression of that enmity is, I think, being expressed through the person and the person is not directly concerned.  Senator Milroy has gone into the realms of the past, but I do not wish to follow him, I will try to give an example of what I mean.  Senator Milroy stated that following the Treaty of 1921 we were quite free.  Were we? The country is partitioned and the country is occupied.  In those portions of the country where I meet a British soldier there is no personal enmity between that British soldier and myself.  But there certainly is an enmity expressed through him directly at the Government and at the channels through which the Government acts on behalf of the people.  I think that that is a very fair interpretation of what Senator Mrs. Clarke said.  I do not think that capital should be made out of the statements that have emanated from this side of the House.</P>

      <P>I regret that Senator Milroy has left the Chamber, because I think that, in justice to himself, he should have an opportunity of listening to the views expressed by himself when still a member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party a few years after the Treaty had been put in force.  At the time the National Group was formed, Senator Milroy found it incumbent on him, as a matter of conscience, to resign from the then Government Party.  He told the people of Cavan that he would give them the reasons for his resignation.  A significant statement, in view of what the Senator said here to-day, was published in <i>The <Col N="1583" /> Nation</i> of the 4th December, 1923, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Treaty position is steadily drifting towards insanity, confusion and possible shipwreck.  We, of the National Group, have made effort after effort to secure the calling of a National Conference to consider, discuss and formulate a policy to repair the injury effected and avert the danger that menaces.  Our efforts have not materialised into anything tangible.  There has been no effective response from either the Government or the organisation supporting the Government.  The latter, or certain members of it, are conscious of the facts of the situation but appear powerless to move.  The members of the Government seem to be so engrossed in contemplating their own rectitude and infallibility that they cannot observe the indications that point the dangers ahead.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should like to accept the Senator's assurance that he was not seeking any Party advantage or that he was not indulging in what might be termed ordinary Party propaganda in the attack he made upon the President. His reference, I think, might justly be described as an attack.  He said that the position of those who accepted the Treaty had been more than justified. I forget his exact words, but he referred to the majority Party here, and in a rather heated way to the President, as having led the forces that threatened the machine set up under the Treaty.  It may not be inopportune in this connection to refer to certain representations made by Senator Milroy and five or six other very conscientious members of the Dáil who retired from Cumann na nGaedheal in order to form the National Group. According to <i>The Nation</i> of the 4th December, 1923, they had submitted recommendations to their own Party Ard-Chomhairle prior to leaving.  They protested that the really relevant document had been suppressed by that body and another substituted in which the following passage occurred, which, they said, could not be reconciled with the contents of the other document:&mdash;</P>

    <P>&ldquo;The present Government has a <Col N="1584" /> record of achievement second to none.

      <P>Here is Senator Milroy's comment on that document:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;These matters, to my mind, are not suited to the tactics of Party manoeuvring.  They are too serious for that.  They affect to the very core the well-being and stability of the nation, which is above the interests of any Party or any set of politicians.  When we speak of policies of any Party or the Government in the Saorstát, there are certain standards by which these policies may be judged.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is Senator Milroy's own condemnation of the tactics which forced him to leave the Party to which he gave his first allegiance.  And yet he adopts somewhat similar tactics to-day. He goes on to ask: &ldquo;If there is to be <Col N="1585" /> a break with the traditions of administration created by the British régime? If there is to be a serious effort to make the objective of each service in the Saorstát an Irish-Ireland one?  If the working of the Saorstát is to be under the control and direction of those who ran these services in hostility to Ireland during the British régime or if the Saorstát Government is going to make any really serious effort to produce an economic policy which will solve unemployment?&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am prepared to agree with Senator Miss Browne to this extent that there must have been one school, at least, in this country in which it was really trash that was taught instead of Irish history.  So much hostile criticism has been made of the statement by Senator Mrs. Clarke here to-day that I may be permitted to quote Senator Milroy's statement in <i>The Nation</i> of the 4th <Col N="1586" /> December, 1923, as regards external influences:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I know there are powerful influences at work to prevent that being done and to keep this country the bond slave of British economic interests.  There is considerable evidence that these influences are successfully exerting pressure on Government policy.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>But to-day Senator Milroy would have us believe that ever since December 6th, 1921, there has been no such thing as external interference with the State. I do not think that their so-called hate has, to any extent, been on any side. It is certainly not on ours.  I do not think that any section of our people hate any other people.  We do hate injustice and we do hate undue interference with our rights.  That is a very different thing from hating the masses of the people of Britain.</P>

      <P>I suppose it was inevitable that a Bill dealing with Irish nationality should give rise to a very wide and broad discussion on Fifth Stage.  I must confess, however, that I was not prepared for the line which the discussion took.  Senator Milroy has used the occasion to reiterate his views about the Treaty.  I do not know that I can let the occasion pass, as the matter has been raised, without reiterating my views.  Senator Milroy said that it was a Treaty of peace between the two countries.  I wish it were so.  There would not be numbered in the ranks of those who opposed it a single person if it was felt it was going to be so or that it could be so by its very nature.  The difference of opinion arose from different interpretations of what it meant and what it would lead to.  I opposed the Treaty because I believed, in the first place, that, to take it, would not be consistent with the position which we had chosen on declaring our independence. I did not believe it was going to be a Treaty of peace because it purported to deny rights which belonged to the Irish people indefeasibly&mdash;rights which some of the people, so long as this remains a nation, would be prepared to fight and die to assert.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1587" /> A treaty of peace between our people and the people in the neighbouring island could easily have been concluded.  All that was asked of the people on the other side of the Irish Sea was that they should cease to interfere here.  When Mrs. Clarke spoke of the feeling which, undoubtedly, exists&mdash;there is no use in our blinding ourselves to it&mdash;she referred to a feeling of natural irritation at and natural dislike of an attempt by a neighbouring people to deny this people what they are certain are their God given rights&mdash;that is, to govern themselves in their own way.  There is a very simple test as to whether we are free or not.  Let the people of this island freely decide the question.  Let there be a plebiscite taken of the people of this island as to whether they are satisfied with the present relations or whether for example they want to have their freedom expressed, in the form of independence, as a republic.  That is a test which, naturally, would be applied by ourselves if we were the only people concerned and could apply it.  The British Government have been asked to acknowledge that right and to accept that test.  For many years we have been asking that.  I asked it years before 1921.  To this day, the challenge has never been accepted.  If the Irish people were, in a plebiscite, without any attempt at foreign pressure, to decide on some form of relationship or even to decide that they were satisfied with the present relationship, then it could be asserted&mdash;I think truly&mdash;that the Irish people were in their present position as a free people. There is no use in our blinding ourselves to the facts.  Nor is there any use in the people of the other island blinding themselves to the facts.  The fact is patent, that the majority of the people of this country do not want, in the first place, their country divided or partitioned and, in the second place, they want the liberty to decide what their own form of government shall be &mdash;whether it shall be a monarchy or a republic.  They want to have an equal voice also in deciding what shall be the relationship, if any, between this <Col N="1588" /> country and the country across the water.  These are the rights which a free people would possess.  If we have not the power of exercising these rights up to the present, surely it must be because there is some pressure from outside or some power which denies us these rights.</P>
    <P>Let there be no nonsense about this question.  I am quite willing to admit that we have certain powers in this part of Ireland.  I do not want to detract in any way from the powers we have but this State has not the form that, I believe, the majority of our people would have had it take if there had not been interference or pressure from outside.  The patent fact is&mdash;history shows it; go back and examine the records&mdash;that the Treaty of 1921 was accepted under duress&mdash;under the threat of war and for no other reason. That is the truth.  It is said that I led the forces opposed to the Treaty.  I did.  I opposed it for the reasons I have broadly indicated.  I have admitted, and I admit now, that I anticipated even worse things from the Treaty than the things that happened and, goodness knows, civil war was a bad enough thing to anticipate and see realised.  I did not anticipate that the movement based on the Treaty would have gone in the direction it has taken as fully as it did.  I am quite willing to admit that there is an immense difference between the powers that are possessed since, for example, 1926, and the powers that existed before that.  There is a great difference between the position in which the Governor-General was, for example, as the direct agent of the British Colonial Office and the present position. I am willing to grant all that. I am willing to grant that there is a big difference between the present position and the position as it existed, at least so far as the British acceptance of the position was concerned. There has been, as you know, a difference of opinion as to whether certain rights did exist before the Statute of Westminster was passed or not.  It has been held here that these rights, as far as the Saorstát is concerned, were possessed and in existence; <Col N="1589" /> but at any rate the Statute of Westminster was a recognition by Britain of the fact that there was to be no limitation of the legislative powers of the Parliament here.  It is because that is so patent that I object to such criticism as we had from Senator Miss Browne, who does not know what she is talking about, and even from Senator Sam Brown, who should know what he was talking about and who, I am sorry to say, was guilty of lamentable lapses in the statements which he made here on the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that this Bill cannot do, and does not do, the things it purports to do.  I have asked for an explanation from those who say that to tell us why.  What in the limitation of our powers is there which prevents us from doing the things that we say we are doing in this Bill?  We are repealing, for instance, the Act by which, according to existing Irish law &mdash;the law in force&mdash;it would be held that Irish citizens were British subjects. How was it that this law, if it is in force, came to be the law here? I take it that it came through Article 73 of the Constitution, but Article 73 of the Constitution, I think, makes it explicit that these laws are laws here only until they are amended or until they are repealed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>We are by this Act repealing them.  We have the right to do it.  There is no doubt whatever about that.  No Act of the Imperial Parliament, as it was called, is able to bind us if we wish to loose ourselves from it.  We have full competency to do it, and we are asserting our right to do that by this particular section in which we are repealing the British laws in so far as they may be deemed or held ever to have been in force here.  Let nobody have any doubt about it. British subject is no longer, as far as our citizens are concerned, a term applicable to them under Irish law.  It may be said that they may be so regarded by the law of another country. It is possible that another country, Japan, for instance, may claim that all who were born here were her citizens. If the Japanese were foolish enough to <Col N="1590" /> put such an Act on their Statute Book or to retain such an Act on their Statute Book, we could not very well go over and compel them to take it off. but, as I said before, it would be a piece of impertinence to continue doing that and to continue retaining it in that particular way, and I hope as far as our people are concerned, that that piece of impertinence, as it would be, will stop.</P>
    <P>Senator Brown, apparently did not deny our competency to deal with a very wide range of matters, but he seemed to think that somehow there were one or two directions in which our competency was restricted.  He seemed to indicate that the Preamble to the Statute of Westminster somehow or other interfered with the general application of the Act.  It did not do anything of the kind.  If Senators look up and read carefully the reports on which that Act was based they will realise that the discussions recorded in them took place precisely because it was recognised that there was to be no limit of competency, and that because there was to be no limit of competency it was desirable that there should be uniformity in certain particular matters: that as long as the States continued in a monarchical form, for example, that the law relating to the royal style and titles and the law of succession should be the same in all.  It is a recognition then of competency&mdash;this recitation in the Preamble and this report of the proceedings of the conferences on which the Bill was based.</P>
    <P>I do not agree at all that Senator Brown, who spoke on the legal aspects of this question, was right in his opinions or had any genuine foundation for them.  At times he seemed to be thinking of British constitutional history as it was 200 or 300 years ago.  He spoke of allegiance as if it was some special personal relation between the person of the monarch and what would be called his subject.  That has gone, even out of English constitutional theory, for some hundreds of years, I think.  It is realised that in the British constitutional theory, in so far as there is any allegiance at all, it is to the King in some political capacity and not <Col N="1591" /> as a person: that the individual personal relationship of the type of protector and protected, has gone away altogether.  Again, the Senator seemed to suggest that you could have only allegiance to a person not to a country. That is not true either.  You will find, if you read books on international law, constantly the phrase &ldquo;allegiance to one's country&rdquo; and &ldquo;allegiance to a country,&rdquo; so that Senator Brown, I think, if he examines carefully the statements which he has made, will find that in fact they are based on altogether shaky foundations.</P>
    <P>The position then is this: that we are satisfied that this Bill is completely effective, that it establishes a code of nationality law affecting our citizens in every part of the world.  It is not a local Citizenship Bill.  In 1922 the Constitution seemed, and purported, apparently, to establish such a citizenship, but that has gone.  It was never, in practice, applied.  That has gone legally, and in fact, and when this Bill becomes law you will have a code of nationality law applying to our citizens in whatever part of the world they may be.  Remember, as I pointed out before, the Hague Convention laid it down that it is for each State to determine under its own law who are its nationals and that the question as to whether a person possesses the nationality of a particular State depends on the law of that State.</P>
    <P>On an earlier stage I indicated the need that there was for this Bill.  That has been generally recognised.  I am glad to find that the representatives of the women of our country are satisfied that this Bill puts them in a position of equality.  It is said that it has a defect in not allowing for descent through the mother as well as through the father.  There is there only an apparent inequality.  It is an inequality in phrase rather than in fact, because by the provisions that have been added to the Bill in the Dáil, following the discussions that took place on that matter, an Irishwoman who becomes a widow, or an Irishwoman who wants <Col N="1592" /> her children to be regarded as Irish citizens, can easily have her wish satisfied.  Provision is made by which that can be done.</P>
    <P>I am more than pleased at the privilege of being the person who has sponsored this Bill.  I am pleased with it in every way.  I believe that it lays the foundation, the only foundation, on which we can have real friendship with a neighbouring people.  The rights which they accord to us we are prepared to consider and accord equal rights to them.  It is a position of equality, the only position which will make for permanent good relations. The word &ldquo;hate&rdquo; was referred to.  I do not know any more unfortunate type of speech than that which was delivered by Senator O'Farrell.  There were a number of things he said that could be misrepresented and misunderstood. The speech appeared to me to be one which was most objectionable in every way.  Senator O Maille said it was a case of <i>beirt ag troid agus iad ar aon sgéal</i>&mdash;that is to say, two people in the one point and one overstressing it. That was the difference between the point of view that was expressed, I think, by Senator O'Neill and Senator Mrs. Clarke.  Senator O'Neill spoke of the desire of our people to be on friendly relations with Britain.  We want to be on friendly relations with Britain just as we want to be on friendly relations with France, Germany and America, and with other peoples, but we would prefer to be on friendly relations with Britain because they happen to be nearer to us, and because there are certain relations which bring us into contact with them more directly and immediately than with other countries. That is true.  Senator O'Neill laid stress upon that, but it was a statement that might be misunderstood as if it represented the complete satisfaction of our rights: as if we had had already complete satisfaction of our rights, and if at this moment there was nothing to hinder friendly relations between the two countries.</P>
    <P>Because it was open to that misunderstanding, Senator Mrs. Clarke, <Col N="1593" /> wisely in my opinion, laid stress on the fact that though we desire these friendly relations, there are things at the present time which militate against these desires becoming effective.  If our country is partitioned against our will, as it is partitioned, without any regard to any fundamental principle, that partition line was not drawn because within it there was a homogeneous minority whose rights had to be protected.  If that was so the area would be very much smaller than it is, probably not one-third of the Six Counties would be the area where it could be suggested that there was anything like a homogeneous population that desired to be cut off from the rest of the country. Even if there was, there would still be the big question, whether a section of a population, in a case like ours, has a right to cut itself off under such circumstances. Partition was imposed by Britain against the will of the majority of the Irish people; it was imposed upon us on no just principle.  That is one of the things that has prevented good relations between these two countries. Senator Fitzgerald spoke of another.  Certain of our ports are held by British care and maintenance parties.  It is not with our desire they are there.  We have time after time told the people of Great Britain that we are prepared to pledge ourselves, and to use all our strength, to see that this country as a free country would be no menace to her safety.  Time after time we told them that we were prepared to defend these coasts in such a way that no foreign enemy would be allowed to use this country as a base of attack against Britain.  Britain is not prepared, apparently, to take an assurance of that sort.  She wants the assurance of having forces in possession. We say that she has no fundamental right to these ports and that as long as she holds any portion of our country against the will of our people, no matter on what plea she holds it, so long will there be something standing between and preventing the good relations and the friendship that we desire, and that every right-minded Irish person desires between the two peoples.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1594" /> Why can they not do that?  Why not let us have our own country?  We ask nothing else.  If we have our own country without any interference, then it will be very easy indeed for the two peoples to come together, and to make arrangements which will satisfy the mutual interests of both.  Although it merely represents two aspects of the same thing, it was no harm to have these statements from Senator O'Neill and Senator Mrs. Clarke.  The one thing I think we should not have was a statement such as that made by Senator O'Farrell, because that exaggerates and throws a blame on people which is not genuinely there.  Whenever a foreign power holds a country there will always be differences of opinion as to the amount of resistance that should be put up to outside interference.  It is only natural that when people are starving, and when they are offered half a loaf, that there would be differences of opinion as to whether the half loaf should be taken or whether they should hold out and starve to death rather than take the half loaf.  The differences between our people in the last ten years have not been differences of their making.  No Irishman pretends they have been.  There have been differences caused through the fact that there was pressure from outside brought upon a weaker people.  It is natural that those who want to get rid of that pressure should differ in their opinions as to the extent to which it should be resisted, and the manner and the method by which it could be resisted.  The sad part about it is that all our people did not realise&mdash;the one way it should be realised&mdash;that these differences were almost inevitable and could be exploited by those who did not wish well to this country; that they could exploit us unless there was some method of mutual accommodation arrived at.</P>
    <P>I was very sorry to have heard the speech of Senator O'Farrell attributing to our people things that could not justly be attributed to them.  Our people do not hate.  They neither hate each other nor hate other people, as Senator O'Farrell seemed to suggest. This country has had a sad history.  It <Col N="1595" /> has been fighting with weaker forces against stronger forces for many an age.  The fight has not yet been completed. It will only be completed when every inch of the soil of this country is under the control of a Government freely elected by the majority of the Irish people.</P>
