      <P>Section 2, sub-section (3).  To insert before the sub-section two new sub-sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="94" /> (3) The Board shall not, nor shall any authorised undertaker, lay any such lines above ground along or across any street or road or erect any posts, poles or other erections in any street or road situate within any county borough or urban district except with the consent of the local authority or body having the control of the streets within such county borough or urban district.</P>
    <P>(4) Where any difference arises between the Board or an authorised undertaker and a local authority or body having the control of any street or road in consequence of the refusal of such local authority or body to consent to the laying of any such lines or to the erection of any such post, pole, or other erection, such difference may be settled on the application of the Board or authorised undertaker, made after due notice to the local authority or body having control of the street or road, by a district justice of the District Court in whose district such street or road is situate, who shall have power to overrule such refusal or to confirm it absolutely or subject to such terms and conditions as he shall think proper.</P>
    <P>This amendment appears on the Order Paper in the name of Senator Mrs. Clarke and in my name.  I was sorry that I had not an opportunity of getting into contact with Senator O'Neill, because he is a member of the Dublin Municipal Council, which discussed this question and approved of our moving this amendment.  I should like his name to be also appended to the amendment but I was not in a position to get into contact with him.  In this amendment we merely seek to ensure that the same power will be retained by local authorities as they possess under the Posts and Telegraph Acts.  Dublin has, unquestionably, paid its price for this electricity undertaking.  I do not know what the attitude of Dublin ratepayers who are members of the Seanad was when the Bill in connection with the electricity undertaking was passing through this House but, unquestionably, the Dublin electricity <Col N="95" /> supply undertaking was confiscated. No compensation whatever was paid.  At that time, the people had no representatives on the Municipal Council.  The City Commissioners were then in control and, I think, no protest was raised.  I am not aware that members of this House raised any protest, either.  Senators are aware that unsightly poles have been erected in different parts of the city.  This question was raised in the Dáil by Deputy Tom Kelly, who is also a member of the Dublin Municipal Council.  I happened to be a member of a sub-committee which interviewed members of the Electricity Supply Board in connection with this whole matter.  They consented to the cessation of the erection of these unsightly, tarred poles which are disfiguring the city.  They are not going to put up any more of these.  They have promised to put up, instead, some class of iron poles.  Furthermore, where there are terraces, they will run the wires from those poles along the eaves of the houses.  They agreed that after five years, the whole question should be reviewed.  When the electricity scheme for Dublin was established by the Dublin Corporation, it was an underground service.  Whilst we are not exactly asking that that system should again obtain, we are seeking in this amendment to impose some check on the disfigurement of the city&mdash;that the Electricity Supply Board should not get, so to speak, unbridled control of the city.  The Telegraph Acts provide that the Department, before tearing up the streets, should have the consent of the local authority.  In this amendment, we are asking that that should continue and that, if any dispute arises, it be referred to the district justice for his opinion.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister for Industry and Commerce will accept the amendment or not.  He, like us, has a duty to discharge to Dublin citizens.  He is the senior public representative of South Dublin City.  He is not, perhaps, senior in years and he is not, perhaps, senior in the public service but he is senior <Col N="96" /> in public esteem because of the fact that, at the last Dáil Election, he got the highest number of votes of any candidate in South Dublin City.  I do not know whether or not the Minister will be disposed to agree to this amendment.  I hope he will.  We, representing Dublin citizens, see the reasonableness of it.  We are asking for no more authority than was given by the British Government in the Telegraph Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>This is probably a move in the right direction because it is not desirable that the Electricity Supply Board should have authority to do what they like in the way of putting up posts and wires in a county borough or in an urban district.  However, I am not sure that the Senator's amendment is the amendment that is required.  Sub-section (3) does what the Senator wants, but it strikes me that sub-section (4) will not carry out his intentions.  The Senator is making the district justice an arbitrator in a dispute between a local body and the Electricity Supply Board.  The district justice is to have the right of confirming the refusal of the local body to allow the posts and wires to be put up or he can say that they ought to be put up.  The Senator is purporting to give jurisdiction to the judge of a court which has no jurisdiction in matters of this kind.  I am not at all sure that the Senator succeeds in giving that jurisdiction.  I suggest to the Senator that it would be far better to get some other arbitrator than the district justice.  This is really a matter affecting local government and not industry or commerce.  I suggest that any dispute between the local body and the Electricity Supply Board should be referred to an inspector of the Local Government Department, to be nominated by the Minister for Local Government.  Jurisdiction will then be given, but I doubt very much if jurisdiction will be given under this amendment. I do not think that the district justice would be bound to do what this sub-section asks him to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenClarke" hpid="Mrs. Clarke Mrs. Clarke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Clarke</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Healy and I put down this amendment at the request of Dublin Corporation.  The <Col N="97" /> Council feel that it is not right that the Electricity Supply Board should have absolute freedom as regards the erection of poles in the city.  The Corporation is going to great trouble to create nice suburbs and they think that these suburbs are being disfigured, in many cases, by the erection of poles where they ought not to be erected. Poles have been put up in some cases in the front gardens of these nice, suburban houses, The Corporation would not act unreasonably in this matter. If the Board could find no other place for the erection of a pole than what would seem to the Corporation to be an unsuitable place, the Corporation would not object but they do think that the Board have been absolutely indifferent to appearances in connection with the erection of these poles.  The question of expense is, to a large extent, the determining factor with the Electricity Supply Board.  To save the cost of wiring, they erect poles in places which are unsuitable from the point of view of the locality.  Their aim is to keep as close to the main as possible.  I know a case where, when the owner of a landscape garden wanted an electricity supply, the only place the Board would consent to put the pole was in the centre of a beautiful lawn.  When the owner objected to have the pole put there, the Board agreed to put it in a courtyard about 100 yards away.  I think the Board should not have these powers; that they should be a little more reasonable, and have some little thought for the appearance of the city and the homes of the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the spirit of the amendment.  There is no doubt that the activities of the Electricity Supply Board in recent years have certainly not added to the beauty of the City of Dublin.  Before the boundaries were extended the Corporation supply was an underground system but, in some of the urban districts that have been taken into the city, there were overhead systems.  It can, at least, be said that in the overhead systems in Rathmines and Pembroke the poles were less unsightly than the ones that have been erected in recent years. <Col N="98" /> They consisted of heavy metal piping and were generally painted with aluminium, which took away some of the unsightliness.  Since the Electricity Supply Act was passed the Board have gone into parts of the old city where there were no overhead wires and erected most unsightly poles.  It is certainly very discreditable on the part of the Electricity Supply Board to have no consideration other than erecting these poles as cheaply as possible, and leaving the city with these ugly eyesores along the streets.  In reply to what Senator Healy said about the position of Senators who live in Dublin, I may say that I supported this scheme as I was prepared to see Dublin making a contribution to a great national enterprise that was to do such untold good for the country as a whole.  That is beside the question now.  The suggestion made by Senator Brown would be better than the proposal in the second part of the amendment.</P>
      <P>If we are going to have litigation, I am afraid you will not get very far. By the time the lawyers are done haggling the poles will have been erected.  The suggestion of Senator Brown that the decision should be referred to the Minister for Local Government or to an engineer or inspector in this Department might be accepted by the Minister, or some other amendment which would carry into effect what is desired.  Most people contend that there are serious complaints against the manner in which the Electricity Supply Board erect these poles and disfigure the city.</P>

      <P>As to the question of referring the matter to the district justice, I suggested to the city law agent that it would be preferable if it were submitted to an arbitrator appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Local Government.  I am not by any means enamoured with legal proceedings, but the city law agent believes that what is proposed is the quickest method of dealing with the question. That is why I suggested the system that obtains under the Telegraph Acts. I am sorry the Minister was not here <Col N="99" /> when I was moving the amendment. He is perfectly well aware of the price that Dublin paid for the electricity undertaking.  I am justified in saying that were it not for the Pigeon House during the drought last summer the Shannon Scheme would have cut a very sorry figure.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the matter very carefully.</P>

      <P>I am in sympathy with the Senator who moved the amendment, but there is another objection to it.  Where there is a difference the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; should be &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;  If you are going to have arbitration, and if you want to prevent expense and the delay of going to law, it should be compulsory arbitration.  I suggest that if the Senator wants this amendment to work he should alter the wording before the Report Stage and change the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; into &ldquo;shall.&rdquo; The Senator also referred to the arbitrator who will be appointed.  In my opinion the district justice would not be bound to do this under the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain measure of sympathy with the amendment, but a very small measure of sympathy, because the Electricity Supply Board has practically completed its networks.  This matter is more involved than appears to the ordinary observer.  To limit the powers of a very important body like the Electricity Supply Board, in carrying out a scheme and trying to establish its financial success as early as possible, is a responsibility that we should be slow to take.  I have not heard many complaints of the manner in which the general public is dissatisfied with the Electricity Supply Board with respect to the erection of poles.  It must be understood that there were supply authorities in existence <Col N="100" /> before the Board came into operation.  If the majority, if not all provincial undertakings had erected what has been described as ugly poles &mdash;although one would have wished for other kinds&mdash;I suppose the finances of local electricity undertakings could not allow any increased expenditure in that way, and, in the normal passage of time, the eyes of the citizens became accustomed to these poles just as they have become accustomed to the ordinary telegraph poles.  If this amendment is passed, I can visualise a considerable amount of delay in developing areas that have not yet been developed by the Electricity Supply Board.  I take it that the Dublin Corporation are necessarily concerned about this question.  I suppose this question hinges upon beautifying the city and on town planning. I prefer to be guided by the Minister, who realises the responsibility attached to the whole undertaking of the Electricity Supply Board, to say what can be done to complete the assurance which was given by him that the engineers, who are citizens of this State, are not going to act in the manner outlined by the proposer of the amendment. They have no desire to see the beauties of the city in any way disfigured or tampered with.  I am not going to support the amendment.  I believe the Minister will find it difficult to bring in a suitable amendment to deal with that aspect of the situation. If any better form of amendment is brought forward on the Report Stage I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I must ask the Seanad not to accept this amendment. I am satisfied that if it were accepted and embodied in the Bill it would seriously retard the development of the Electricity Supply Board's business.  Furthermore, the amendment is contrary to the trend of electricity legislation in all countries. It is true that in Great Britain electricity suppliers were required to get the consent of the local authorities before erecting poles on roads or streets, until the year 1919.  In that <Col N="101" /> year amending legislation was passed and electricity suppliers in that country were placed in the same position as the Electricity Supply Board is here now; that is, they are required to consult with the local authorities before breaking up roads or streets for the erection of poles. The Board are most emphatic in asserting that at all times they exercise the powers conferred upon them by the Act of 1927, for the erection of poles, with due regard to the amenities of the districts concerned and reasonable objections raised by local authorities or by property owners affected.  The danger which would arise if this amendment were passed was fully expressed by Senator Farren.  It is undoubtedly correct that the Dublin Corporation and local authorities generally would prefer to have electricity supply lines laid underground, and that the absence of poles would probably improve the appearance of many parts of the city and provincial towns.  But it is well to recognise that if the Dublin Corporation had power to require and to insist on the Electricity Supply Board laying underground lines and extending them to the outlying suburbs a very large number of these areas could not be supplied with electricity at all.  The additional cost necessitated by the provision of underground lines would have rendered various development schemes entirely uneconomic, and they would have to be abandoned, so that the advantages of an electricity supply would be denied to many people living in such areas.  As the use of electricity develops, and as the load in any particular district becomes heavier, it is the intention of the Board to substitute existing overhead lines by new underground lines, but that can only be undertaken where it is clear that the business arising in the district concerned is sufficient to justify the additional expenditure.  The example given by Senator Mrs. Clarke hardly arises in this direction.  The manner in which the Board would erect the poles on the property of a person who is installing a national electricity supply is not affected by this amendment, <Col N="102" /> which relates only to the erection of poles on roads or streets. And the local authority in that case, as in practically every case, has been able to get its wishes given effect to by the Electricity Supply Board in that connection.  So far as the second sub-section of this amendment is concerned I think the district justice would be the most unsuitable person to arbitrate between the local authority and the Electricity Supply Board.  But, apart altogether from that, I urge the rejection of the amendment because to my mind it is unnecessary, and would, if adopted, retard the development of the Electricity Supply Board's business, and would be contrary to the general trend of legislation in these matters.  The Seanad need not have any fear that the Board is going to exercise its powers unfairly in these matters.  They are pledged to have prior consultation with the local authority.  They always have that prior consultation and are always anxious to comply with the wishes of the local authority.  No case has been brought to my notice where they failed to comply with the wishes of the local authorities without good reason, such as the case where the local authority wanted the mains to be put underground which would involve an expenditure in the district altogether out of proportion to the revenue that would accrue.  The existing system has worked well and I think there is no necessity to change it.  I ask, therefore, that the amendment should not be inserted in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 2, sub-section (1).  To insert after paragraph (b) the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>or</P>
      <P>(c) a mechanically propelled vehicle or a vehicle drawn by a mechanically propelled vehicle is used for the carriage of beet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to provide that where a farmer possesses such a mechanically-propelled vehicle and uses it for the carriage of beet for himself or his neighbour that he shall be permitted to use it without having <Col N="104" /> to take out a licence as a carrier within the terms of the Bill.  This is rather a serious matter because the growers of beet are tied down to a fixed price for the next three years.  The profits of the farmer would be upset if by any means the cost of delivery of his beet to the factory were to be increased. The railway companies have not quoted a price nor are they in a position to quote a price for the deliveries of beet from the farms to the factory whereas the farmer is tied down to a fixed price for three years.  It is a matter of considerable concern to them that the cost of the carriage of their beet to the factory and that the cost of carriage from the factory to the farm should be at as low price as possible, and such as hitherto had been in operation. There has been no increase in the case of the Carlow factory.  Last year the service rendered by carrier farmers had been such an outstanding success that the manager of the factory said that it was a service that he did not believe it possible to be superseded by any organisation.  He gave it great commendation and said that it was most serviceable in connection with the carriage of beet.  I hope the Minister will not upset the existing system of the carriage of beet between the farmers and the factory.  Beet is a very perishable article.  It has been carried to the factories where necessary as late as 10 or 11 o'clock on Saturday nights, in order to keep the factories going, and has enabled them to carry on in a manner not otherwise to be expected.  Furthermore, if the carriage of beet was entrusted to regular carrying companies they might not be available at all times and in that way great loss will result to the factory.  I hope, therefore, the Minister will agree with the terms of my amendment, and that the conditions prevailing will be allowed to continue for the next three years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amend ment which entails a very serious consideration for the beet growers.  I am interested in the growers in the district in which I live.  There are very small growers there, living at considerable distance from the railway <Col N="105" /> station, who depend on the present system for beet carriage.  The same applies to growers nearer the factory where the beet comes by road. Many of these are poor people who have only one horse that would not be able to carry more than half a ton at the time.  If these people only got short notice it would be absolutely impossible for them to get to the factory with their beet except with the help of a neighbour's lorry.  The custom existing up to the present is that a farmer with a lorry would help small people who have only one horse, and transport their beet to the factory.  It will disorganise the whole business of the haulage of beet if these people are not exempt from the provisions of the Bill.  I hope the Minister will agree to exempt the carrying of beet altogether and to leave it out of the present Bill. That would ensure that everyone would get a chance of getting their beet to the factory.  If the railway company gets the whole monopoly it will mean the disorganisation of the transport of beet to an enormous extent.  I ask the Minister not to dislocate the system that exists and to accept the amendment moved by Senator Wilson.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>A peculiar position arises in regard to this amendment. Senators must be aware that a similar amendment moved on the Report Stage in the other House was ruled out of order.  An interesting position will arise if this amendment is accepted and it goes back to the other House.  This House, however, is master of its own procedure and whatever ruling the Chair gives will, of course, stand.  I only draw attention to what may give rise to an interesting situation.  I do not think there is any justification for this amendment except that one may argue for the exception of peat as well as beet or meal stuffs or any other of the numerous agricultural products.  I think it was Senator Miss Browne who said on a previous occasion that the rates quoted by the railway company&mdash;the average rate of 6/- per ton&mdash;was cheaper than could possibly <Col N="106" /> be quoted by any other carrying company, and that there was no reason, in these circumstances, why there should be any anxiety in regard to the cost of transport.  It also transpired that the lower rates by the local carriers were only possible because of the sweated conditions prevailing in their branch of the carrying trade.  One of the objects of the Road Transport Act of 1933 was to bring order into the transport industry, to prevent a particular section coming crash, and to limit the appalling conditions that existed from the viewpoint of organisation. We are asked now that a State-subsidised industry should receive more support on the basis of sweated labour.  Personally.  I very strongly oppose any such principle.  From the point of view that beet has a fixed price and a guaranteed expenditure for three years for the farmers it is in many respects a sheltered and favoured industry.  The same arguments as those put forward for the exemption of beet could be used in regard to pigs, calves and sheep, and no doubt if this amendment is accepted we will have similar arguments advanced in favour of those sections of agricultural industry. The Minister has already explained in both Houses that it lies with him as to whether or not he should issue transport licences to those carrying beet at present, whether the railway companies or any other company. He has already indicated that he can use his discretion in that respect and I do not think that any more is needed.  If he does not transfer before the 1st July there cannot be any transfers for two years.  I think those concerned should leave the matter in the hands of the Minister who has the beet industry as much at heart as anyone owning a lorry and expecting to make a profit out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no recollection of making the statement that 6/- a ton in the part of the country in which I live is of such extraordinary benefit to the beet growers.  It was pointed out by Mr. Hogan, when this <Col N="107" /> industry started, that they were to get a cheap rate for the beet growers. That was something, of course, because if the ordinary rate had been charged the promotion of the beet industry would be impossible.  The campaign lasted, I think, for four months.  The main difficulty is that the growers have to get their beet to the factory at very short notice. Now, imagine the position of the poor farmer.  If there is any sweated labour in the beet-growing industry, it is the poor farmer who grows the beet who is sweated.  He is sweated far more than anyone engaged in the whole industry.  So is the poor farm labourer sweated.  The worker in the factory is guaranteed high wages but what does the poor farm labourer get?  Whatever the poor farmer can afford to give him and that is very little.</P>
      <P>I can say that the flat rate of 47/- per ton for beet is not going to make anyone rich.  Were it not that the price is guaranteed and that the farmer is assured of a market, the beet-growing industry would collapse to-morrow.  The guaranteed market is the only attraction about it.  The price which is fixed means that he is going to get something for his crop while, in the case of other commodities which the farmer produces, he does not know whether he can sell them or not.  The only reason that the farmers are supporting beet-growing is that they have this guaranteed market.  I know from figures I can produce that not one penny is made on the beet-growing industry.  The only thing which the farmer is getting out of it is the pulp which is returned to him and he does not get that free by any means, as the Minister is in the habit of saying.  He pays for the carriage of it and he pays for the bags in which it is conveyed.  He pays 30/- a ton or perhaps more for it according to the area in which he lives. This amendment, in my view, is absolutely necessary, because if some arrangement of this kind is not come to the beet-growing industry will be seriously affected.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Farrell has dealt with the amendment from the general rather than from the particular point of view.  He must know that last year the railway company were altogether insufficiently equipped to carry beet.  The Minister has said so.  Had it not been for these haulers, the factory in Carlow would have been at a very great disadvantage.  The amendment simply means that a farmer who has a vehicle shall be allowed to carry his own beet and the beet of his neighbour without being obliged to get a licence.  It does not go any further than that.  The farmers do not want any monopoly.  If the railway company can undersell or undercut them let them do it.  The farmers do not claim any monopoly for the carriage of beet, nor are they asking for any special privileges.  If the railway company desire to cater for this traffic they should certainly be allowed to do so, and if they can run as efficient a service as was run by the beet hauliers last year they will get traffic.  We say that the price of beet being so small, the carriage of the beet is a large factor in the matter as is also the carriage of the pulp, and in order to ensure that the industry will be carried on, the beet haulers should be allowed to continue to carry beet during the term of the contract as they have been doing up to now.</P>

      <P>May I ask Senator Wilson a question?  Is he speaking on behalf of the farmers or on behalf of the Beet Hauliers' Association?  He can answer that because he has the brief in his hands.

      <P>There was a point raised by Senator O'Farrell which, on the face of it, is very appealing, but I do not think that he touched on all phases of the question.  Senator Wilson has pointed out that when the present price of beet was arranged, certain factors entered into the settlement of that price.  One of these factors was the cost of transport and haulage.  A <Col N="109" /> certain figure was assumed to be the price that the producers of beet would pay for the carriage of the beet to the factory.  If the figure then estimated was a miscalculation, and if a higher figure is charged by the contractors or the people who secure a monopoly under this Bill, then the whole calculation for the production of beet at an economic price is upset.  I do not think that anyone here would desire that this industry should be carried on under conditions that could not be described as economic.  The point is that if the haulage contractors secure a monopoly and charge a price that drives the producer down to sweated labour conditions, the whole industry will be threatened.  Is there any means by which these conditions can be altered?  The price has been fixed for three years.  The people who produce the beet should certainly not have forced upon them sweated labour conditions any more than the people who may be employed to transport the beet.  I would suggest, if there is to be a monopoly created, that there should be a possibility of revision of the contract price, if the price charged by the monopolists upsets the original calculations.  As far as I can judge by what the Minister said last week, he is by no means committed to giving a monopoly to the railway company. He said then:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The position is that we have not yet transferred to the railway company any licences confined to beet held by licensees, and we have under consideration the advisability of excluding them from any transfer of licences that may take place.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister may, however, before this Bill passes decide on the transference of such licences.  I think all that is wanted is that the producers of beet shall be secured an economic price for their produce and that they shall be able to carry on under decent conditions; that they shall not be driven by an unexpected increase in the transport charges into conditions that may make it impossible for them to produce beet at the price agreed to under the present contract.</P>

      <P>There is a matter that the House should take into consideration in connection with this amendment. The carriage of beet differs greatly from the carriage of any other commodity in that it must be carried quickly and continuously.  It will not do to have a stoppage in that carriage. What I am rather afraid of, and I think the House should consider it, is that if a monopoly is given, as has been suggested, to the railway company a strike may occur and then where are you?  This is just the one industry that could not stand a strike because of the necessity for the rapid transport of the stuff to the factory.</P>

That is better, it seems to me, than handing the transport over to the railway company to do as they like.</P>

      <P>If he has a lorry. The people who are now being spoken of are what is known as the Beet Haulers' Association&mdash;a company of common carriers, people who do nothing but carry goods for reward. These people seek to be free lances, to be free from any connection with the railway company or any other company, and, in general, to escape the conditions with which a railway company would have to comply to carry <Col N="111" /> beet.  It is not at all the poor farmer who wants to send his own beet to the factory, whose case is at stake. Senator Brown talks about the danger of a railway strike during the beet season or during what is known as the beet campaign.  The Carlow beet factory has been in operation for many years and no railway strike has yet disorganised it.  What is the reason for assuming that strikes are going to be so attractive during the beet campaign in future?  Are we to assume that the employees of the Beet Hauliers' Association will never by any possibility strike?  Is the possibility of a strike confined to the employees of the railway company or are the employees of this association so ground down and such slaves that nobody will ever expect them to strike?  We are told that this is an organisation of carriers who will confine their activities to three months of the year only. Surely, these people, in order to carry on, must carry other goods for the remaining nine months.  That being the case, how are they going to get the exemption asked for under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is complained that the railway company were unable to deal adequately with the traffic last year.  Is that to be wondered at?  For several years their lines were deserted and they were brought to the verge of bankruptcy by uneconomic competition, but they did make a big effort during the past twelve months.  They built thousands of new wagons and hundreds of new lorries in the past twelve months.  The men in the workshops worked night and day in order to provide a sufficient service for this traffic. That service is now to be sabotaged by leaving it in the hands of the Beet Hauliers' Association to provide an opposition service.  Why is it assumed that they can carry beet cheaper than the railway company, a greater organisation, with thousands of lorries and with a century of experience behind them in the matter of transport and other facilities that the Beet Hauliers' Association have not got?  Simply and solely, because it is assumed that the <Col N="112" /> beet haulers will only observe sweated conditions of employment, work longer hours and generally trample on everything that every decent citizen stands for in the way of treatment of employees.  That is the type of organisation that the movers of the amendment are standing for and these are the conditions of service that are sought to be made permanent by embodying them in a Bill which is to be a permanent enactment.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not favour the acceptance of the amendment seeing particularly that he has it in his power to deal with the matter and to leave these people in being for two years more, which, in my opinion, is two years too long.  In any case, the question regarding the contract entered into is a principle that operates in regard to all contracts&mdash; building contracts and contracts of that kind.  The question of transport enters into all of them and surely the protection afforded by the Railway Tribunal and by action that the Minister can take by legislation is a sufficient protection for the beet growers as well as for every other section of the community who require transport facilities and that means every section.  I hope the House will not accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>If I am wrong in that then, of course, a good deal of my argument goes by the board.  I had thought that this association was composed exclusively of growers.  I understood that some of the growers of beet who had lorries were willing to carry their neighbour's beet to the factory for a price, and that the price was arranged by contract for the next two or three years.  I did not understand that there was any question of sweated labour.  My comparison of that kind of an association with the <Col N="113" /> railway company was entirely in favour of the association on the question of strikes to which I referred.</P>

      <P>The speech that we heard from Senator O'Farrell was, of course, one that we might have expected from a railwayman who has been an advocate of the great monopoly which we are under at present in this country.  We have got to consider whether a monopoly, carried out to the full extent, is a good thing for the country.  The Bill before us represents the idea of the Government as to what should be done for giving us proper transport here, but when we come to consider the question of the carrying of beet to the new factories, then, I suggest that we are up against a totally different matter altogether. Senator O'Farrell's speech may be summed up in this way.  It was the speech of one advocating the interests of one monopoly as against another monopoly.  The railway companies may need that sort of support, and I suppose they do.  I think, however, that after hearing the speeches of Senator Wilson and Senator Miss Browne it must occur to most of us that the carrying of beet is quite a different thing to the carrying of the goods which a railway company usually carries.  The House, I suggest, should hesitate before it passes a Bill which changes in any way the method that has been in operation for a number of years for getting beet to the sugar factories, a method which, I may say, was of great help to the first factory started in Carlow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Farrell seems to think that, if this amendment were rejected, no trouble would arise because, as he has said, the railway company is well equipped to deal with the carrying of the beet.  I believe that the facts are rather different, and that the Railway Company were not able to do the thing properly.  I believe there would have been a great deal of trouble but for the fact that the services of non-railway owned conveyances were available for the carriage of the beet to the factories.  The citizens of Dublin had some experience lately of what can <Col N="114" /> occur where you have a monopoly of transport services when labour troubles arise.  I think the Seanad should be very slow to hand over an industry to the control of a monopoly, and should take steps to see that adequate protection is afforded in the beet industry.</P>
    <P>I do not know what is in the Minister's mind about this.  On the last occasion that he spoke here he seemed to be somewhat doubtful.  I suggest, whether the amendment is carried or not, that another year, at least, ought to run before monopolistic conditions are laid down for the carrying of the beet to the new factories. That would enable the Government to see what the Railway Company can do, what individual carriers and groups of farmers themselves can do in this matter of getting the beet to the factories.  I have been a critic of the sugar-beet industry, but on this matter I think it would be wiser for the country to allow another year to run before imposing monopolistic conditions on the carrying of beet.  That, in my opinion, would be the wise thing to do, and that I hope is the course the House will take.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that there is a good deal of misapprehension with regard to the whole situation. One would imagine, listening to Senator Jameson's speech, that this Bill dealt with the matters that he referred to.  That is not so at all. Evidently he would like to have the conditions that he referred to incorporated in the Bill but that, I submit, cannot be done.  The point is that Senator Wilson's amendment is an attempt to upset the existing situation which has statutory effect under the Road Transport Act.  Senator Wilson has taken advantage of the introduction of this Bill to seek to have incorporated in it the principle that Senator Jameson spoke about.  Senator Jameson talked about monopolies. The sugar-beet industry is a monopoly and, as well as I recollect, I never heard any protest from Senator Jameson about that.  Under the Road Transport Act certain conditions were laid down with regard to the operations <Col N="115" /> of carriers.  That Act has now been in operation for nearly two years, and the Minister's experience of it has been that certain of its provisions are calculated to inflict hardship on people who would be deemed to be carriers under the terms of the Act because they carry goods for their own firm or for the same firm under two different companies.</P>
      <P>The Minister explained on the Second Reading of this Bill that it was to deal with such a set of circumstances, and in order to be just to those people, that he introduced this amending legislation.  But what is happening now?  The hauliers' association are attempting, by the insertion of this amendment, to get outside the terms and the provisions of the Road Transport Act of 1933.  Why should they be put in a privileged position?  I venture to say that the Minister could not dream of accepting the amendment. If it were accepted, why should not the carriers of every other class of commodity be treated likewise?  The Minister, I submit, cannot make a case for special exemption for the beet hauliers' association.  If he were to open the door to that, then to be just he would have to do the same in the case of other carriers.  It is quite clear that this amendment represents an attempt to get these beet hauliers outside the terms and provisions of the Road Transport Act.  It is the amendment that is seeking to alter the present position.  The Bill does not propose to do it as Senator Jameson seems to think.</P>
      <P>This Bill is simply an attempt by the Minister to remove certain anomalies that the administration of the Road Transport Act has revealed.  I venture to say that this amendment is hardly in order for the reason that it seeks to vitiate the provisions of the Road Transport Act.  If, by this amendment, the beet hauliers' association were able to get rid of their responsibilities under the Road Transport Act and succeeded in being put in a privileged position as compared to other carriers, then it would be just as well to scrap the Road Transport Act altogether.</P>

      <P>The question as to whether the amendment is in order has been mentioned by Senator O'Farrell and Senator Farren.  I may say that I gave that matter special consideration. It was represented to me that certain beet growers had lorries and that they were accustomed to use those lorries for the purpose of drawing their own and their neighbours' beet to the factories as has been suggested by Senator Brown.  That being so, I considered that the amendment was in order on the Bill.  I was guided, too, by the fact that the Minister, on the Second Reading of the Bill, said that his Department was considering the whole matter of beet growing. Senators must bear in mind that this is a revising Chamber.  This is an amending Bill, and the amendment that has been moved seems to me to be a reasonable one because, as has been suggested, the beet growers have been accustomed to haul for one another through an association, and surely that is a proper matter for the House to consider on a Bill such as this.  I am sure that the debate will have done a great deal of good, and for the reasons I have stated I rule that the amendment is in order.</P>

      <P>From what Senator Farren said one would think that the Beet Hauliers' Association was mentioned in the amendment.  As a matter of fact, there is no reference to a beet hauliers' association, or to any particular group of carriers, in the amendment. It seems to me that the amendment is entirely on a par with the two paragraphs that are actually in the section as it stands.  One does not need to discuss the advantages or disadvantages of monopolies on a matter such as this is.  In this country, circumstanced as it is, there must be monopolies in many directions if there is to be reasonable efficiency.  If we accept that point of view, it is not necessary for us to go so far as to say that monopolies must be complete and unbroken in every respect.  It is quite competent for the legislature to decide whether, generally speaking, transport shall be the monopoly of one or two organisations and yet to leave certain <Col N="117" /> aspects of transport outside the scope of that monopoly.</P>
      <P>I take the purpose of this amendment simply to be this: That we are asked to say on behalf of the legislature that the carriage of beet shall not come within the scope of the monopoly.  I think it was Senator O'Farrell who said that if these hauliers were going to carry on and maintain their vehicles they would have to carry other goods than beet.  I think that if anybody is going to be regularly in the business as a common carrier, then he cannot subsist on one monopoly.  Therefore, I do not think that this amendment can be regarded at all as being in the interests of any common carrier, or any group of carriers, because it is quite obvious that the amendment will not enable him to carry anything but beet. The amendment does not propose to preserve a business to some group of common carriers for, say, two-thirds of the year.  This particular amendment will not have that effect.  Therefore, it will not affect any person who is ordinarily in the business of a common carrier.  It will enable certain people who are not in the carrying business at all to come in and carry this particular commodity during the short period that has already been referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beet is in quite a different position to a number of other commodities that have been mentioned.  It seems to me that a definite case has been put forward for keeping beet outside the scope of the monopoly.  In the case of peat, for instance, no great harm would be done if the carrying of it was held up for a month or two months and the same would apply to a number of other commodities.  It is true, of course, that a certain amount of inconvenience would be caused, but that is about all. In the case of beet everyone knows that once the sugar beet factories start they must be kept working continuously. If, for any reason, a stoppage occurs then serious losses will be incurred by the factory, its employees and the producers.  It seems to me that there is a case to be met here in regard to beet.  It is not sufficient to say that if the Minister accepts this <Col N="118" /> amendment he must accept every other claim put forward.  It has been suggested that if such claims were put forward they would cause embarrassment to the Minister if he had already accepted this amendment.  I do not think that is so.  It is perfectly true that if a strike occurred the Minister, I presume, could put military lorries at the disposal of the farmers to carry the beet to the factories, but I do not think that would be a desirable thing at all. I think it is far more desirable that this should be kept within the ordinary procedure under the law, and that people who have lorries and who are not ordinarily in the business at all as carriers should come in and undertake to carry the beet to the factories.  I think, as a matter of fact, only in exceptional instances will the Railway Company fail to get the greater part of the business.  There may be places where the roads or entrances to farms are such that other people employing smaller vehicles will be able to render the best service, but not to such an extent as to injure the Railway Company. It is well, however, that where there are other carriers who can serve the farmers better that they should be allowed to work.  So far as the main part of the work is concerned, I think it will be the Railway Company that will do it but we have here something in the nature of a safety valve, something that will prevent the necessity for a public authority stepping in in case of a dispute.  We know that public authorities must step in in certain cases.  I think it is better to have a certain amount of elasticity in our machinery to enable a crisis of any sort to be overcome in the ordinary way by the people engaged in the business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I live where beet for the Carlow factory is mainly grown. The season is only for two or three months' duration, and when notice is sent to the farmer from the factory that they are ready to take his crop, his whole anxiety is to conform to the regulations and get the crop to the factory as quickly as possible.  I think any attempt to bring the business of the farmers into unusual channels will <Col N="119" /> be a great inconvenience in many districts. The work should be done as it has been done hitherto.  There is no such thing as a haulage company being interfered with.  The work has been done mostly by local farmers who have lorries, which they use for a great many other purposes, including the carrying of cattle.  I suggest that, for at least a year, it should be left as it is.  We who grow beet have a great deal to contend with&mdash;dealing with it in bad weather is a great hardship&mdash; and people who talk of sweated labour should remember that it is the farmers who grow beet who are sweated in trying to conform to the rules laid down by the factory.  This work ought not to be taken out of the hands of people who have been most obliging to one another.  I know farmers with tractors who are most anxious to oblige their neighbours and who give them a hand to tide them over a difficult time.  A great deal of attention has to be paid to the crop.  It is not a very encouraging crop to grow.  From our district to Carlow there is a charge of 7/- per ton for delivery; when that is deducted from the 37/- per ton allowed for the beet it does not leave a fortune for the farmer.  The chief inducement to them to grow it is that they are sure of the money that it will realise. There is no great security in the growing of wheat.  As far as I am concerned, I would sooner see green crops and that we should go back to stall feeding.  I am entirely in favour of the amendment, which I think is most reasonable.</P>

      <P>There is one thing that I might explain.  Perhaps it is not understood in connection with the delivery of beet, that when the farmer gets notice he has to make delivery of his beet within two days.  If he neglects to do that the factory may not take it.  He must have it ready to load; otherwise he cannot make delivery of it in time.  If it is not loaded in time the factory will not guarantee to take it, and the loading agent will not be obliged to provide for the carriage of the beet for perhaps another month.  If the beet is left <Col N="120" /> on his hands it will deteriorate; it will lose much of its sugar content.  Quick delivery is one of the great difficulties that the farmer has to contend with.</P>

      <P>A number of speeches have been made upon this amendment, and I must confess that I am not clearer now than I was at the beginning as to what it is intended to achieve.  The purpose of the amendment is to put carriage of beet for reward outside the scope of the Road Transport Act.  It has nothing to do with the farmer carrying his own beet in his own lorry to the factory.  There is nothing in the Road Transport Act to prevent his doing that or to prevent his neighbour carrying it for him, provided he does not do it for reward. If he does act as a public carrier, then he has to be subject to the provisions of the Road Transport Act and to the regulations governing the carrying of merchandise for reward on the public highways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point which, apparently Senators have entirely ignored.  The Road Transport Act was passed in 1933.  Senator Wilson made reference to the assistance given to the Carlow factory last year by members of the Beet Hauliers' Association, but every person who was engaged in the business of carrying beet for reward before the passage of the Act was entitled to, and did, receive a licence to carry beet, and on the authority of these licences they have, in fact, been carrying beet for reward to the Carlow factory in the last season.  The question that arises on this amendment is not whether it is desirable to have the whole business of carrying beet for reward confined to the Railway Company, or whether we should have a number of independent carriers as well.  That can be determined under the Act without any amendment.  The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the decision is going to be one way and to have, not merely the members of the Beet Hauliers' Association, but everyone who wishes to engage in the business of carrying beet for reward free to do so.  I say, with all respect to Senators, that no case has been made <Col N="121" /> for the exclusion of beet from the scope of the Road Transport Act that could not be made equally forcibly for the exclusion of other commodities.  If this amendment is accepted it is a certainty that we will have similar representations made by other interests for the exclusion of milk, garden produce, peat, or some other agricultural product from the scope of the Road Transport Act.</P>
    <P>In relation to a number of those things we have already had representations based precisely on the same grounds as the case for the exclusion of beet, or upon the necessity for speedy delivery in view of the perishable nature of the product.  The undesirability of allowing a monopoly position to be created which may result in higher transport charges is an old bogey as is also the possibility of a strike, as if strikes are something that are associated with monopolies and with nothing else.  The only reason why there might be more safety against strikes in the existence of a number of carriers rather than in the existence of one carrier is that the Trades Union organisation might not be efficient enough to organise the employees of all carriers.  If that situation should exist we have no reason to believe that it will exist indefinitely.  We have every reason to believe the contrary.</P>
    <P>There is another argument which I think should have considerable weight with this House.  This question of whether beet should or should not come within the scope of the Road Transport Act was discussed at length when the Act was being enacted and after prolonged deliberation the Seanad agreed that beet should be included.  On the strength of that legislation the Great Southern Railway Company has committed itself to a heavy expenditure on equipping itself to deal with this transport; it has expended £96,000 already upon the construction of special railway wagons to deal with beet, and £32,000 in the provision of special road vehicles to deal with the beet traffic.  Not alone that but it incurred heavy expenditure in the acquisition of vehicles licensed to carry goods.  Licences have been <Col N="122" /> transferred to them from people who had been engaged in transport work in the beet growing and adjoining areas.  The adoption of this amendment to exclude beet from the scope of the Road Transport Act would mean that all the equipment with which the Railway Company has provided itself and all the licences that have been transferred to them would be if not completely useless in excess of its requirements, if the beet traffic were lost.  It is true, however, that there is a problem to be considered in that connection, that is if the Railway Company are not fully equipped to deal with the whole of the business.  It was not fully equipped last season and I am not sure that it will be fully equipped to deal with the much heavier traffic next season.  Because of that we have given consideration to the question of whether or not the licences for which the Railway Company have applied should be transferred to it with beet included or excluded.  That is the only problem that arises in connection with beet for us to decide and we must decide within a month whether in any transfer of licences that may take place to the Company beet will be excluded, not merely for this year, but for two years to come.</P>
    <P>Certain Senators suggested the desirability of giving this system a year's trial.  It has had a year's trial. The Act has been in operation during one beet season and the lessons to be learned from the experience of that period will be called upon now to enable a proper decision to be made upon that question of excluding beet from the licences transferred to the Railway Company.  Bear in mind that all the persons who were engaged in this business of carrying beet for reward in the Carlow area or in fact any other area, have not yet had their licences transferred to the Railway Company.  During the last season they were entitled to continue and as long as their licences are not transferred they will be entitled to continue in the business for the next season or the season after.  There is, however, a problem in the other areas where the carriage of beet for reward by companies <Col N="123" /> other than the Railway Company was not practised previously. The question for consideration is whether the Railway Company, with the new equipment with which it is providing itself and having regard to the nature of that equipment, will have as much as it can do to carry all the beet that will be offered to it in those other areas without taking on the additional task of replacing the private carriers of beet in the Carlow area as well.  It is not impossible that the full utilisation of the Railway Company's equipment in all the other areas may, at some time, involve the granting of additional licences to existing carriers in these areas to carry beet during the next season and the season after that, because the amount of beet to be carried in these years will be considerably greater than the amount of beet that had to be carried in any earlier year.</P>
    <P>There is another objection to the amendment.  This amendment is to be retrospective.  It purports to provide that the carriage of beet for reward without a licence not only shall be but shall be deemed always to have been legal.  That would create an extraordinary situation, having regard to the fact that people have been prosecuted and convicted for the offence of carrying beet merchandise without a licence. The effect of the amendment would be to nullify the decisions of the courts and that would possibly involve the repayment to the persons convicted of the fines which have already been levied upon them.  I am not quite sure of what the effect generally would be but it is an amazing proposal, having regard to the circumstances, that the law should be amended retrospectively to the date on which the original Act was passed.</P>

      <P>The amendment has been slightly altered since it was moved in the Dáil.  I was thinking of the amendment which the Beet Hauliers' Association had moved in the Dáil.  They have changed their hand <Col N="124" /> a bit since.  It is also a fact that the price of merchandise transport by road is going to be increased in consequence of the enactment of the Road Transport Act.  That is inevitable.  That is a situation to which we must have regard in connection with the question of the transportation of beet because the beet price has been fixed over a number of years by agreement between the Sugar Company and the Beet Growers' Association.  The reason why the cost of transportation by road is going to be increased is because, as stated here before, the majority of the independent concerns were carried on on the basis of very low wages, indeed, while the Railway Company are required to pay and are, in fact, paying standard rates of wages to those employed upon their lorries.  A very large number of the independent operators were individuals who were driving lorries owned by themselves. They were getting from their business a very small return&mdash;a return barely sufficient to keep them in existence. The necessity for road transport legislation and railway legislation was due to the fact that the activities of these independent operators was making the whole transport business uneconomic and bringing down not merely the independent companies but also the main transport companies of the country. There was not a transport operator, practically speaking, in the Irish Free State who was carrying on his business at a profit and, in 1933, we were faced with a situation in which a complete collapse of our transport organisation was likely to result if a change was not effected.  That change had inevitably to take the form of increased charges for transport, because existing charges were too low.  Transport was being sold at less than the cost of production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very glad to hear certain Senators referring to the fact that the price of beet is not high enough.  That is a surprising development from that quarter.  I hope that these Senators will use their influence with colleagues of their Party in this House and the other House, and also outside, to stop the campaign which they are carrying <Col N="125" /> on in connection with the cost of sugar because, if they succeed in carrying out their campaign and forcing down the price of sugar, it is going to mean that there will be a smaller return for the grower of the beet from which the sugar is made.</P>

      <P>Apart from that, the amendment is one that must be resisted.  If, in the country as a whole, or in the areas of the new factories in particular, or in Carlow as a special problem, it appears that the Railway Company will be unable to deal with the beet that will offer, having regard to their equipment and the nature of that equipment, then licensees who are entitled to carry beet for reward under existing carriers' licences, issued to them under the Road Transport Act, will continue in operation and, if necessary, new licences will be issued.  The first concern must be to ensure that the business is kept upon an economic basis&mdash;that the old conditions and cutthroat competition will not be restored in relation to this particular form of merchandise transportation or, indeed, any form of merchandise transportation. The Railway Company have engaged in very considerable expenditure to equip themselves to deal with this business.  They are still spending large sums upon the provision of equipment and, if that equipment should be adequate to deal with the problem of beet transportation, then, I think, the policy of the Road Transport Act should be given full effect.  It is only if that equipment be inadequate&mdash;and it probably will be inadequate for some years to come&mdash;that the necessity for allowing private operators to continue <Col N="126" /> the transportation of beet will have to be decided in their favour.</P>

In the Second Reading debate, that was not made quite clear and that was, I think, what influenced Senator Wilson to put down this amendment.  We are not thinking of associations of beet haulers or any other haulage companies in the Free State.  We are merely trying to protect the farmers, and if an amendment to effect that can be made on Report, I <Col N="127" /> would ask Senator Wilson to withdraw the present amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 7 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>7.  &mdash;Section 63 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion at the end thereof of the following <Col N="129" /> words, and the said section shall be construed and have effect as if the said words were and always had been so inserted, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In construing this section every person who immediately before entering the employment of the licensee had been employed in the operation of vehicles of the class used for the purpose of the business authorised by the licence mentioned in this section by a firm, company or other undertaker acquired by the licensee or by a firm, company or other undertaker of which the licensee is deemed to be the successor shall be entitled to have calculated for the purpose of this section the period during which he was so employed.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to remove an unfair position that arose under Section 63 (1) of the Principal Act.  Under that section a worker whose company was taken over by a new undertaking was guaranteed compensation provided he had at least five years' service.  We found by experience that in a few cases companies by which workers were employed had, perhaps during the 12 months before being taken over, changed to a new licensee.  As a result, workers were only credited with six or 12 months' employment, while in reality they were employed for ten years.  They were deprived of the compensation which it was intended they should get.  We have come across one or two cases where the licensees changed within a year or 18 months before being taken over under the Act and the workers were deprived of compensation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of the section was to secure for the worker who had five years' continuous service in the same business the benefit of the compensation provided if he did not get employment with a company acquiring the licence.  If it has worked out that because of a change of ownership some time within five years the worker has been denied compensation, then the intention of the original Act has been evaded.

      <P>Section 6, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;manufacture&rdquo; in line 26 to insert the words &ldquo;of not more than 20 lb. in any one week, produced and manufactured on their own farm and not sold for resale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the amendment is to exempt farmers producing non-creamery butter from the provisions of this Bill.  In fact, if the amendment is accepted it will save the Department from itself.  It must be remembered that 20 lb. of butter represents the produce of only two good cows for the greater part of the season.  Under the amendment such people will be relieved of the necessity of registering as producers and paying 5/-, of registering as distributors and paying £1, and, <Col N="131" /> relieved from paying 39/- per cwt. on the butter they produce.  The Minister recognised the necessity of making an exemption in the Kerry cattle area by excluding farmers there from the provisions of the Bill.  There are several other parts of the country where that argument holds good as well as in Kerry, in portions of Connemara, Mayo and Donegal, where one, two or three cows are kept and less than 20 lb. of butter per week is sold to customers.  It is, I think, a great injustice that a man who produces a limited quantity of butter should be compelled to register, and go through all the paraphernalia that the Bill imposes as to registration as a producer and distributor, and as to keeping accounts and stoppages and other things that the Bill states he must comply with. That class of producer is a very important man in the country.  He produces butter which he supplies to certain customers from one year's end to the other.  It may be argued he gets a good price.  He is entitled to get a good price, and he is entitled to all he can possibly make out of the produce of his two or three cows.  If he is compelled to pay 39/- a cwt. he will simply be knocked out of business.  Thirty-nine shillings a cwt. to such a man would be a terrible imposition.  No matter what the Minister says, and no matter what the officials of his Department say about his getting more for his butter, he will, under the conditions that are to be imposed, get a lower price than he is getting at present. He will not get more than 5d. or 6d. below the price of the best creamery butter, and, when you take 4¼d. off that, it will leave him something very much less than the cost of production. Moreover, it will be impossible to administer the Act so far as the farmer with two or three cows is concerned. He cannot comply with the Act and it really means passing a law which cannot be complied with.</P>

We have been told by Senator Counihan that this amendment is only a reproduction of what has been already done for one part of the country and which ought to be done for others.  Apart from that, it strikes me that we are dealing here with a class of people who are likely, if allowed to operate under the amendment, to turn out a specially attractive form of butter which a great number of people desire to get.  You can get it elsewhere and why not in this country as well I cannot understand.  Perhaps the Minister has an insuperable objection to the acceptance of this amendment at the moment, but if he could see his way to accept it I think it would be well worthy of consideration in the interests of the commodity itself and in the interests of a number of people living in parts of the country with which I have association.</P>

I think the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; has been put into the amendment by mistake.  It asks the Minister to keep a register of the non-creamery producers of butter of not more than 20 lb. in one week.  But surely that is the class the mover of the amendment desires to have excluded, and that being so, the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; should be out; otherwise it defeats its own object. If the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; remains in you would have the ridiculous position that the Minister would be keeping a register of people who are not going to be affected by the Bill, and would not be keeping a register of people who come under the Bill.</P>

      <P>Senator Counihan is wrong in saying that the Kerry Cattle Area is excluded from the levy.  That is not so.  It is not exempt from the levy, but we can impose a special levy. We could impose a higher levy if we thought it advisable.  It is quite possible that other parts of the country may be the same as the Kerry Cattle Area.  I am hearing a lot since this Bill came up for discussion, about the farmer with two and three cows. It seems extraordinary to me that we should have a farmer with two or three cows producing 20 lb. of butter a week, and at the same time supplying milk to his own family.  At the census, in connection with this matter that we had taken, the yield of a cow is 3½ lb. of butter in the week, so that a farmer would require to have six or eight cows to produce 20 lb. of butter per week and supply milk to his family at the same time.  There is no use talking about progidies in cows but they would have to be prodigies if two produced 20 lb. of butter per week as well as supplying milk for the farmer's family.  We, are, therefore, really dealing with middle-sized farmers in this amendment.  I think this question should have been raised on section 16 where Senator Bagwell has three or four amendments dealing with the size of farms that he wants to have exempted from the Bill.  Senator Bagwell has an amendment, No. 7, which alters the production from 10 lb. to 20 lb.  That amendment has more or less the same effect as Senator Counihan's.  Senator Counihan made the point that under section 16 a licence would be issued at a cost of 5/-.  Five shillings is a small sum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  That only applies to the dealer; not the producer.  If we were to accept all these amendments they would alter the whole finance of the Bill and would give a better price for a time for the butter produced by the people whom Senator Counihan has in mind, by 4d. a lb. which the consumer would pay.  Others say we will not be able to collect the levy at all.  I think Senator Counihan is right.  These people would get the benefit if his amendment was carried.  But in that case, we could not give them a bounty. The factories that blend butter and export it would get less bounty.  That would react in the poorer areas where these factories get most of their supplies. Most of the supplies of these factories come from Clare, Kerry and West Cork.  These districts are as poor as any area in the country.  If this amendment of Senator Counihan is accepted it is quite possible that these particular people will get ½d. or ¾d. a lb. less for their butter because they are not in a position to supply direct to the consumer.  They have butter for one six months of the year and little or no butter for the other six months.  Their summer is short and their winter is long.  If they have any butter during the winter it is sold to the blender.  In this Bill, we are seeking to improve the position of these people especially.  As I pointed out, even in anticipation of this Bill the blenders are paying more&mdash;in fact, 2d. a lb. more&mdash;than last year for that butter.  If you said to the blender we cannot give the 25/- bounty we contemplated because we cannot collect it to the extent that we hoped, they would have to alter their prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go into the whole issue as to how these levies and bounties would operate, but Senators must see that if the lowest class of butter, that which goes to the blender, suffers by a halfpenny or a penny a lb. then probably all butter will fall in price.  Very probably those people that Senator Counihan seeks to benefit would not continue to benefit to the extent of 4d. a lb., as the cost of butter would go down by the <Col N="135" /> lowering of the bounty.  I think it is not advisable to accept this amendment. I did hope that whole matter would be argued on Senator Bagwell's amendments rather than on this stage of the Bill.  I am afraid if this amendment is carried it would entirely alter the Bill with regard to keeping a register and so on, and I am afraid it would necessitate the alteration of many other sections.  Section 16 was put in to exempt certain people from the levy.  To bring people who come under Section 6 under the exemption would complicate the drafting of the Bill very much.</P>

      <P>I would like to support this amendment.  I think that people with two or three cows in very poor districts can be found in every county and even in every parish, and I think they are as well entitled to consideration as any that can be found in the Kerry area.  The Minister said that the supplier with two or three cows would not be able to have as much as 20 lb. of butter a week.  I altogether disagree with that.  I know people who have more cows and yet cannot afford to use the butter they produce themselves. Taking an average of 1 lb. of butter per day from each cow the owner of two or three cows would easily have 20 lbs. of butter in a week. They sell that butter in the neighbouring towns and that is a point that should be considered in support of this amendment.  Taking suppliers with a large number of cows they keep a certain amount of milk for their home use.  They keep perhaps one day's milk which they use for their families and their workmen.  I could point to many instances of this kind.  Whether for large suppliers or small a strong case can be made in support of the figures in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister talked about the effect that the acceptance of this amendment would have on different sections of butter producers, and expressed the fear that he would not have enough money to pay the amount of the bounty which he considered should be given to the exporters of butter.  I should like to <Col N="136" /> know from the Minister whether the levy which is being imposed under this Bill is the sole source from which he intends to pay bounties on the exported butter.  It appears from what he said that if we delete the section, as this amendment proposes, if these people had not to pay a levy the amount of money which he would have for paying bounties would be seriously diminished.  Evidently he cannot say at the moment what the total amount of the loss would be.  Is the Minister going to depend entirely on these levies for the payment of the bounties on exported butter?</P>
      <P>Sub-section (7) of section 41 states:</P>
      <P>Whenever the moneys standing to the credit of the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Fund are insufficient to meet the payments required or authorised by this section to be made out of that fund, the Minister shall, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, pay into the said fund such sum as may be necessary to enable the said payments to be made out of the said fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now up against the proposition that if the Minister makes a miscalculation, by thinking that this amendment will take very little off the total levy, and adheres to his statement as to the amount of bounty he is going to pay, and if this amendment reduced the amount of money which he is going to receive from the levies, then the mistake which he has made will mean that there will be a call on the State funds and the Oireachtas will have to make up eventually the deficiency in the bounties.  The House should be very careful because if we are going to emancipate certain sections of the butter-making community from this levy, we may be increasing the taxation of the ordinary citizen.  It is a difficult question and I do not know how the Minister can deal with it.  I think the principle is that the proceeds of the levy will go to pay the bounties and any diminution in the levy would mean a diminution in the bounties.  If the Minister makes a mistake in calculating the amount which he will receive from the levy, <Col N="137" /> and he has not sufficient to meet the bounties, the State will have to make up the deficiency under Section 41. Before the Minister concludes, I wish he would say whether he thinks the levy will pay the whole of the bounties. Does he anticipate that any miscalculations may be made which will throw further taxation on the ordinary citizen and that the Oireachtas will have to make up the deficiency? Looking at Section 41, which provides that any deficiency will have to be made good by the Oireachtas, it seems to me that we may be dealing with some bigger question than we are inclined to consider at the moment. We may find that the community will be called upon to pay whatever balance may be necessary to make good the deficiency in the bounties.</P>

      <P>I should like to say one or two words arising out of what Senator Jameson has just said.  I have several amendments down myself, and I do not want to repeat the statements that I am now going to make when they arise.  This amendment has to do with the same subject, to wit, certain exemptions of certain classes of non-creamery producers from the operation of the Act.  It is important to that extent although it is not so essential on the question of exemption as an amendment which I have down later on because even if this amendment were defeated, it would not prevent others from securing the exemption which is desired by some Senators in this House.  Still the two things seem to hold together but my view is that if it is necessary in the national interest that a bounty should be paid on exported butter it should be paid out of the Consolidated Fund and should not be paid by taking it in levies from other producers who are incidentally one of the most valuable classes of agricultural producers.  I think nobody deems it desirable to hamper or interfere with the creamery producer but I do not think we should be deterred by any idea that if this levy is not imposed, it will have to come out of the Consolidated Fund.  I think that is exactly where it should come from.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that he prefers that this question would be argued on Section 16 and on Senator Bagwell's amendment, but they are two distinct amendments.  The object of this amendment is to exclude completely from the provisions of the Act the person who produces 20 lb. of butter in one week and sells it. Senator Bagwell's amendment is that this person must register and pay the registration and distributor's fee.  He comes under all the provisions of the Act except that he can sell 20 lb. of butter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody knows that at this time of the year two cows will produce 4 lb. of butter per day. That would be 24 lb. per week.  If there are cows which produce less milk, the milk will have a bigger fat content. I have seen two gallons of milk produce 1 lb. of butter.  These are details which we can argue later.  The Minister's main contention is that if he excludes these small farmers&mdash;these deserving and industrious people&mdash;from the provisions of the Bill, and from the obligation to pay 39/- per cwt., he will not have enough to pay bounties on the export of butter, that it will take so much from the amount he will have to pay on the butter exported to England.  That is the principal objection the Minister has to excluding people who sell 20 lb. in one week, that it will take 4½d. per lb. out of the fund which he has to pay the bounty; but it is only the creameries who will get that bounty and there will be nothing going back <Col N="139" /> to the man who pays the 4½d.  Payments will be made out of that fund only on the butter exported.</P>
      <P>Senator Dillon very wisely pointed out that there are many farmers in his part of the country who do not send milk to the creameries and who supply their agricultural labourers with butter.  In such cases they charge a nominal price, but according to the provisions of this Bill, if they do that they will be breaking the law unless they include every lb. of butter which they sell to agricultural labourers in their return and pay 4½d. per lb. on it.  I think the Minister has not put forward any sound argument for this proposition.  If, as he says, the fund will not be sufficient, that is a case in which he could make up the deficiency out of the Central Fund to meet the bounty.  I heard nobody on these benches objecting to that, except Senator Lynch.  I hope the Minister will not persist in refusing to accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>I wish Senators would get one thing clear&mdash;that this has nothing to do with the bounty on creamery butter.  The Creamery Fund is solvent en its own.  We are collecting enough levies from the creameries to pay the bounty on creamery butter and we are not going to take a halfpenny of this for creamery butter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no use in repeating things, as far as Senator Counihan is concerned, because he either does not understand them or he does not want to understand them.  The Creamery Fund is solvent.  We will not take a halfpenny from the farmers' butter to assist creamery butter.  The people who would be hit by this amendment are the people in the poorest districts producing farmers' butter.  There is no doubt about that. If we do not collect this levy on the great bulk of farmers' butter, then there will not be a sufficient bounty on the export of farmers' butter and butter exported from the factories.  If you do not keep up the price of that <Col N="140" /> blended butter, then all farmers' butter is going to come down in price and it is the farmers' butter you are going to hit.  For goodness' sake, do not say that we are trying to benefit creamery butter as against farmers' butter.  If that is used as a debating argument, have it so, but it is not so. The Creamery Butter Fund has been working for the last three years and it worked out for the three years almost exactly as forecasted.  There was never a halfpenny taken from farmers' butter to assist creamery butter at any time.  It is suggested that I should pay this out of the Exchequer.  I should like some of those Senators who make that suggestion to go further and suggest where it is going to come from.  I am not going to suggest to the Seanad that we should tax anything in order to operate this stabilisation of butter prices, but would any Senator suggest the source from which the money can be got?  I said here on Second Reading that when the Minister for Finance comes before you with the Finance Bill, if Senators can make any suggestion as to any other source from which the money could be got, I, for one, will agree.  I am not against that at all.  Why does not some Senator suggest what we should tax?  Most Senators are dissatisfied with taxation as it stands.  They probably will claim that the tax on sugar, tea, and on everything else is high enough already, but at the same time they tell you to take it out of the Exchequer.  You cannot take out what is not there.</P>

      <P>I want to put this to Senator Jameson, that sub-section (8) of Section 41 provides that where any money is advanced by the Exchequer to the butter fund it must be returned to the Exchequer before the 31st May following.  Therefore, the Senator need have no apprehension that the money will be taken out of the Consolidated Fund, because if it is it will be taken by way of loan and must be returned to it again.  Our experience of the last three years has shown us that there is a great deal of export during the months of June, July and August.  The bounties have to be paid out all the time that butter is being exported.  From the middle of September to the end of November there is not much export.  During all that time butter is leviable.  It is being consumed in the home market.  The fund is made up during that time.  We have to get an advance of money from somewhere during the summer months. That money is paid back again during the autumn months, and provision to borrow is made in sub-section (7). Under that sub-section, power is given to get an advance from the Exchequer rather than that we should have to arrange with a bank for the loan of money.  But if we get an advance from the Exchequer we have to pay it back again out of the butter fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole of the bounty is paid out of the fund.  Senator Counihan is not right when he says that we are trying to get the bounty in order to pay the tariff going into Great Britain.  I pointed out on the Second Reading of the Bill that the equivalent of the tariff has been paid on most occasions by the subsidy out of the export bounties.  Senators will remember that the Act that was passed <Col N="142" /> in 1932 was introduced in the month of April of that year before there was any tariff going into Great Britain.  It was brought in to try and bring the price of butter here above the world price.  It had nothing to do with the economic war.  The economic war part of it is fixed by the Export Bounties Fund and does not arise here at all.  I was never opposed to the bounties under this Bill being paid out of the Exchequer.  The only difficulty that I have is this: if the money is to come out of the Exchequer what are we going to put a tax on in order to raise it? If Senator Counihan and Senator Bagwell have any good suggestions to make in that direction, and that these suggestions meet with the approval of all Senators, then I am sure I will have no trouble in getting the Minister for Finance to accept them.</P>
      <P>Passing from that, I still hold that the 2-cow man that can produce 20 lb. of butter in a week is the exception, because if we had cows in this country that were able to produce that quantity of butter we could become almost as big exporters to the British market as New Zealand.  At present we only export about 20 per cent. of the quantity that New Zealand is able to export.  But if the cows all over this country were as prolific as Senator Dillon's cows or Senator Counihan's then, as I have said, we would soon be as big exporters of butter as New Zealand.  In the case of the man with two or three cows, it is usually found that they are not all in full milk at the same time.  Such a man will always try to have some milk and butter for his own family all the year round.  As a rule, one cow will calve in the autumn and the other in the spring.  He is never embarrassed by having his two cows giving ten gallons of milk a day, as Senator Counihan pointed out, for the reason that the two cows would not be in full milk at the same time.  I hold that it is for the man with six or eight cows that Senator Counihan is arguing in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want again to point out to the Seanad that if this amendment is <Col N="143" /> accepted it is going to alter the Bill entirely.  At the moment, I do not quite know what its acceptance would involve.  It would mean, I think, that very little levy would be got off farmers' butter.  There are not, I venture to say, 2,000 farmers, certainly not more than 4,000 or 5,000 farmers in this country, selling more than 20 lb. of butter a week.  That would mean that all the other butter would be free of levy.  The result would be that we would get no levy at all.  Therefore, we could give no bounty, and then would have to come down to the world price for butter.  That would mean 6d. per lb. for farmers' butter.  If the blenders had to export farmers' butter at 6d. per lb., might not the grocer, in competition with them, intercept some of it and sell it to his customers at 7d. or 8d. per lb.  Therefore, the effect of the amendment would be that farmers selling butter would have to put up with a price of 7d. or 8d. per lb. for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I may have stated inadvertently that the bounty was to help the creameries.  What I meant to convey was that the tax on the non-creamery butter was for the purpose of raising the cash to pay the bounty on non-creamery butter exported, and that none of that money would come back to the man who was selling 10 lb., 14 lb. or 20 lb. of butter in the home market. There is no question, but that the tax of 4½d. per lb. will hit that class of man desperately hard.  It is not going to increase the price for his butter to the home consumer by 1d. In connection with a number of Bills that have come before this House, we have again and again heard statements to the effect that they would bring great results to producers.  Experience has shown that the opposite has been the case. The House will remember that statements of the kind were made here in connection with a number of Bills dealing with agriculture.  Those Bills were applauded by some of my friends here.  They were to bring great benefits to the farmers, but when they were put into operation we <Col N="144" /> discovered that they had the opposite effect.  I think that the farmer who is selling 20 lb. of butter a week deserves consideration, and I ask the Seanad to support my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not feel that I can walk into the division lobby and vote on this amendment without first giving some reasons for my vote. Senators to the right and to the left are saying that the Minister ought to accept the amendment, so that a Senator like myself standing, so to speak, in the centre, is in a rather difficult position.  I, like many others, am a dairy farmer, and for the past couple of years I have been paying a levy at the rate of 4d. per lb. on butter.  The farmer who sends his milk to the creamery is getting 11d. per lb. for his butter fat.  One lb. of butter made up will not contain 1 lb. of butter fat because it will have at least 16 per cent. of water. Neighbours of mine, during the past couple of years, have been in the position of being able to obtain 1/6 per lb. for their butter, while I was selling my butter fat to the creamery at 11d. per lb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no desire whatever to tax my neighbours.  I know that most individuals feel that every tax is unjust.  I presume that the majority of Senators know that, if we had what is taken from us as a tariff on our butter going into England added to the present price of creamery and farmers' butter, then we would be coming nearer to an economic price for the butter that we produce.  If we had an open market with no tariff against us then, as I said on the last occasion, the price of our butter, in common with the price paid for Australian and New Zealand butter, would to-day be round about 80/- or 85/- per cwt.  No farmer in the country would be satisfied with that. Farmers would not keep in butter production if that was the highest that they could obtain for their butter.  It is quite true to say that before there was any economic war it was found necessary, by the introduction of legislation, to raise the price of farmers' butter.  It is now <Col N="145" /> round about 100/- per cwt.  In order to pay that price there is a tax on the creamery-farmer and a bounty contribution from the State.  It seems to me that in present circumstances there is a very great temptation for many of our creamery farmers to leave the creameries and go in for this other type of butter production.  Take the case of a man with nine or ten cows.  He can turn out from 30 to 40 lb. of butter in the week.  If he can get 1/6 per lb. for that butter, then he is going to receive as much money in one week for it as he would get from the creamery in a month.  I have examined the figures very closely myself, and I find that that represents the position.</P>
    <P>With that situation you can have internally such intensive competition here through a disorganised industry as to reduce the price of farmers' butter so low that the consequences of it at the moment cannot be foreseen.  It may be said that one can go back to the creamery, but if you do the creamery may be closed, because if, for the reasons I have stated, suppliers have left it and gone in for the other type of production, the operating costs would have become so high that the only alternative left to the creamery was to close down.  I know a number of creameries that have had to close because farmers found this other type of butter production more profitable.  These creameries are standing there to-day, a tribute to the efforts of a certain number of people, as well as a tribute, perhaps, to a lack of a proper spirit of co-operation in the district as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that this tax on farmers' butter has already had the effect of raising the price of it in the open market.  I have no knowledge of that; I have to accept what the Minister states.  Some people may say that that is not true. I feel that if we are going to have, as we can very well have, a higher price for the farmer who will manufacture his butter at home than the <Col N="146" /> creamery farmer can get for his butter fat a great many of our creameries will not be able to keep going and we will have so many people turning out farmers' butter that the price will be very much lower than it is to-day.  That is the situation, frankly, honestly and fairly, as I see it.  I cannot feel that I could walk into the division lobby against this amendment that is so strongly advocated and that is really so popular because, as I say, no individual wants to carry an added burden of taxation.  If the Minister would accept a suggestion from me, I would urge that he would procure from the Land Annuities Fund what would make up the difference.</P>

      <P>If it is the Minister's view and the view of the officials in his Department that this levy is going to raise the price of the farmers' butter generally, including the man with three or four cows, who has not been able in the past to turn out butter of a sufficiently high standard to secure trade in the towns and who has had to take his butter into the open market and sell it to the factories at whatever price he can get, I have no information to contradict that view; I have to accept it. Senator Counihan questioned that, but it does seem to me that the possibilities are very strongly in favour of the Minister's case, that this tax is going to raise the general level of the farmers' butter which is being sold to the factories, but the levy is going to be imposed on such a very small section and the total receipts will be so trifling that it is not going to have any appreciable effect in raising prices.  I am to pay the tax myself.  I do not like to have to pay it. As I said the other day, if the economic war were not in progress and Britain were not collecting a tax on farmers' <Col N="147" /> butter I may not have to pay the tax at all.  I sympathise with myself if I pay, but if I do not pay I admit that the return to myself will not be as high as it is.

I am not in any way convinced by his speech.  He bases his case altogether on what may happen when this Bill becomes an Act&mdash;that the towns and villages of the country will be flooded with farmers' butter. I disagree with that.

      <P>Farmers for generations have been in the habit of taking butter to the shops.  Grocers will not be able to take their butter in future. They will be notified to that effect.  The Minister's arguments are <Col N="148" /> altogether in the air.  There is nothing solid to go on.  Talking about the economic war, why, if we had our markets open to us for other products it would not matter to us very much whether we got 2d. or 3d. a lb. for our butter, which is a sideline.  There is nothing solid to go on in this Bill.  It is a confused and complicated thing.</P>

      <P>I do not wonder that there is so much silence on the opposite side of the House because I think the Opposition has done a very great service to the Government in connection with this Bill.  If the Bill had been allowed to pass in its original state, only allowing 5lb. of butter to be sold without licence, I have no hesitation in saying that it would have done enormous injury to the Government.  It was most unpopular.  Through the intervention of the Opposition, it has been improved and we are likely to improve it still more.  If we can get an amendment carried increasing it to 20lb. it will be a great improvement and I can assure you that it will do a great amount of good to the present Government. There is great anxiety about creameries.  I think I know as much about creameries as most people.  To my cost, I tried to uphold the creameries at a time when it was not so easy to keep them going.  There was no such thing as loans or privileges of any kind.  I started a creamery and a number of guarantors, including myself, were very near being cut out of business through it.  We had not so much sympathy then.  The sympathy seems to be all in favour of the creameries as against people who are trying to manufacture their own butter.  In the county from which I come, and I might also say the adjoining County of Cavan and the greater portion of Donegal, <Col N="149" /> very little butter is sold in the public market.  Most of the butter is sold from the farmers' houses in the local villages. If we now pass an Act that will injure that industry we will do an amount of harm from the health point of view, if from no other.  At the present time agricultural labourers and artisans are able to get good farmers' butter, which they prefer very much to creamery butter when they can get it at a reasonable price.  If those farmers are driven out of that industry and are forced to come to the creamery I feel that a lot of people will be deprived of butter for their families.  As I said on the last occasion, it will have a very demoralising effect.</P>
      <P>In the county that I come from&mdash;I am not ashamed to state it&mdash;our best industry is smuggling.  Perhaps the Minister would not have the time, but I think it would be a good thing if he would come to the County of Monaghan and spend a week or two on the Border.  I would undertake, if he would be satisfied with my humble residence, to put him up and to drive him around so that he might see the tremendous industry that is carried on.</P>

I am making an appeal for the poor man and for the agricultural labourer because in the district I come from they cross the Border to buy their butter in Northern Ireland at 10d. a lb.  The agricultural labourer crosses the Border and buys his sugar for 2¼d. per lb.  He would have to pay 4d. in the Free State for it.  That is only an example.  We are held up, and I am proud of it, as one of the best paying counties in Ireland. <Col N="150" /> We pay our rates well.

      <P>I bow to the ruling of the Chair.  I know the Minister has a very difficult task.  I know that he is in a difficulty trying to help the creameries while not doing too much injury to the farming industry.  At the same time the Minister has stated that there are a few districts that will suffer because they only have butter for a few months in the year and as a result they sell their butter in the market at a very bad price.  We are not in that position.  We get a fair price for it throughout the year.  I hope that one district of the county will not suffer at the expense of another.  I think the Minister would be well advised to accept the amendment before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Before this amendment is put, I should like to say, apart from the merits of the amendment at all, that I think if it is carried it is going to disorganise the machinery of the Bill which provides that nobody shall have the right to sell butter except he is registered.  Section 16 gives power to the Minister to grant certain exemptions.  If this amendment is carried it will mean that anybody who does not sell butter in excess of 20 lb. per week will not have to register at all.  Consequently, he will require no exemption.  It will mean, in effect, that the overwhelming majority of those who produce butter in the country will not be registered at all.  Some people, undoubtedly, will take advantage of that by not registering, although they do sell in excess of 20 lb.  It will be the task of the Government, or those charged with the administration of the Act, to go round and make raids and investigations throughout the country in order to ascertain whether those who have not registered are selling less than 20 lb. of butter per week.  The principle involved in this amendment <Col N="151" /> think, be dealt with on Section 16 and not on this section.  If the Bill is to be administered as an Act, you must have the necessary machinery and, to be fair to those who desire to observe the law, you must have a check.  You cannot have that check unless all those who desire to sell butter are registered. I suggest to Senator Counihan that he withdraw this amendment and let the issue be decided on Section 16.  If the amendment were carried, it might do an injustice to those who want to observe the law and it would certainly throw out of commission the machinery of the Bill.</P>

I think that Senator Counihan might withdraw his amendment without fear that any harm would be done to the amendments which I have down later.  On Section 16, we can decide what line we will take on the general principle.  If this section be left unamended, we can deal with the question of exemption later. Registration does not necessarily control exemption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the ordinary case, there is no doubt that renewal would be granted.  The desire of the Department would be to get the levy from everybody selling butter and there would be no question of refusal to renew.  There is a type of case, however, in which it might be dangerous to compel the Minister to renew.  Let us take the case of a butter dealer who might, during the month of February, be dealing in butter, not having renewed his registration.  An inspector may come along in the middle of the <Col N="153" /> month and say that he will prosecute him.  In that case, if Senator Counihan's amendment were carried, all the dealer would have to do to get out of the prosecution would be to apply for a renewal.  He would then have to be registered retrospectively and, in that way, he would get over the charge.  That is the only case I can think of in which the Minister would exercise his discretion and refuse registration until the court had heard the case.  There is not a great deal in the provision.  As a matter of fact, I think that the sub-section could be dropped, because the position is that if a person comes along before the year is out he must be re-registered for the following year.  This sub-section says that if he comes along within a month he may be re-registered retrospectively if the Minister thinks fit.  The same would apply if he came along three months later, although he would have to be registered afresh.  It would make no great difference if the sub-section were left out.  A person would not be refused a renewal unless there was a prosecution pending against him.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="155" /> The arguments I used in the previous case apply to this amendment. The question I should like to ask the House is what courts are for if it it is not to consider offences.  Is it not more likely that a court, hearing a charge against some individual, would be able to give a more detached and impartial decision than either an inspector of the Department of Agriculture or the Minister, who would be influenced by the inspector? We do not know what class of inspectors will be appointed under this measure when it becomes an Act. Where a man is in danger of losing his livelihood, I think there should be no objection to procedure by which the Minister would apply to a court to have the registration cancelled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the usual clause which appears in the Dairy Produce and all similar measures.  When notice is served on the licensee that he will be removed from the register, he is informed that he has fourteen days to make objection and that, if objection is made, an inquiry will be held.  For the last three years, I have been administering the Dairy Produce Act, the Eggs Act, and the Cereals Act and, over and over again, I have signed notices to registered persons that their names would be removed from the register unless they applied within 14 days for an inquiry.  I have never, in that time, been asked for an inquiry.  If they had asked, an inquiry would have been held.  I mention that to show that it is only in cases where there is absolutely no doubt that this is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It often happens that a person goes out of business.  An inspector goes around every fortnight or every month.  He finds that a man has gone out of business.  He has to get returns under the Act because the person is registered and, therefore, has to call occasionally.  Eventually, he comes back to the Department and says that the man in question has gone out of business but did not ask to have his licence revoked.  All we can do is serve notice on him saying that the Minister proposes to revoke <Col N="156" /> his licence unless he lodges an appeal. If we get no appeal, the licence is automatically revoked.  A person may die, leaving relatives who are not interested in the business.  They do not take any steps to carry on the business or to have registration revoked.  We have to carry out the same procedure in that case.  Under (a)  where we find that registration was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation&mdash;I personally have never come across a case of that kind&mdash;if we serve notice on the person concerned and give him 14 days to appeal against revocation, while offering to hold an inquiry if requested, I think the person is well safeguarded.  These inquiries are public and the registered person can engage senior counsel if he chooses.  No Minister is going to risk a public inquiry like that unless he has very good grounds&mdash;much better grounds than he would have if going to the District Court.  He might go to the District Court and take a chance on the District Justice giving a decision in his favour but here he has to justify himself at a public inquiry at which senior counsel may be representing the person aggrieved.  In these circumstances, I am certain he will take no chances. The power has been used so sparingly that not one person has ever asked for an inquiry under these Acts.  It would be very troublesome to go to the District Court, especially under a Bill like this, with so many registered people, some of whom perhaps might go out of the production of butter or might sell their cows and go in for a different system of farming. We would have our inspectors calling every fortnight looking for returns.  We must do something.  A man might say that it did not matter to him if his licence was revoked as he did not require it any longer. What can we do except to serve notice?  Senators need not be afraid of this.  If a registered person was an irresponsible person, not caring whether the licence was revoked or not, we would have to have a provision for getting the costs involved and for the trouble of going to court. The present system is much easier and <Col N="157" /> I am sure it is fairer.  I do not think any Senator can mention a case connected with the Department of Agriculture, during my term of office or that of my predecessor, where there was any grievance under sections like this in any of the Acts that were passed.</P>

We should remember that we are legislating for the future.  I have no doubt about the present Minister and his officials seeing that justice is done, but it is better if a man is going to lose his licence that the courts of the land should be called in to decide the matter, and not the Minister.  The Minister says that enquiries were not asked for.  If so they can serve notice and bring people before the courts.</P>

      <P>There is considerable experience of this type of section in other Acts.  I know one individual who was dealt with under another Act.  If a man dealing in eggs, butter, or other agricultural products commits an offence the practice has been to take away his licence.  In my opinion such a man would not court an inquiry in public.  In the instance of which I have knowledge the licence was taken after the person concerned had been warned and delivered the goods.  As far as the public was concerned there was no publicity.  Having paid the penalty, the man's licence was restored after some time.  It would be a real injustice to bring a man into a public court to have him examined by lawyers.  So long as the administration <Col N="159" /> remains as it is I think the present method is probably more favourable to the parties concerned than to have to go into court.</P>

    <P>On the Second Reading the Minister will remember I made it clear that I objected to the principle of the Bill, as it seemed to me to be tending to interfere with one of the most desirable types of agriculturist we have: the farmer producer of butter.  At that stage if I thought there was any chance of getting the House to amend the Bill by cutting out Parts II and III, dealing with the farmer producer, I would have moved to that effect.  That is why I have put down these amendments, the object of which is to exempt from the operations of the Bill and the levy, farmers who produce not more than 20 lb. of butter per week.  These are definitely small men who would be hit by the 4d. levy.  I have limited the amendment to 20 lb. because that quantity is sufficient to make a difference between getting out of business or otherwise.  If the amount is made 10 lb. it is hardly worth while. The wording of amendment 6, instead of leaving the matter dependent on the Minister's decision, removes all possibility of preferential treatment.  A <Col N="161" /> small man would have the right to go on producing a certain quantity and not paying the levy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Senator Bagwell in the amendments dealt generally with this section.  The general effect of the amendments would be that any person who was selling less than 20 lbs. of butter per week would be entitled to a licence and exemption as a right.  In fact the amendment goes further than Senator Counihan's amendment, in this way, that the butter could be sold to a dealer for re-sale.  Senator Counihan at least limited exemption to people who sold butter direct to consumers but not for re-sale.  These amendments would knock out the provision about re-sale and would make it impossible to deal with grocers and dealers.  If an inspector went into these places he would be confronted with butter, some of which was exempted from levy, and some of which was not exempted.  It would be difficult to decide on what amount of butter there should be a levy.  Another amendment says that the Minister should not attach any conditions to the licences, and lastly, that he should not revoke a licence unless the conditions attaching thereto were not being complied with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, of the five amendments, I would be inclined to say that No. 10 is the amendment that could be agreed to.  There is no intention of ever revoking one of those licences unless some condition has not been complied with.  Now, to come back to amendment No. 1.  If these five amendments were carried, it would put the Bill into a worse position than even if Senator Counihan's amendment had been carried.  The first of Senator Bagwell's amendments is intended to substitute the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;may.&rdquo; There are a few cases in which discretion should be left to the Minister. I think it would be very difficult, if there were three or four adults living in the same house, for example, a father, mother, son and daughter, to resist the claim of each one of the four of them.  They could come along <Col N="162" /> and each look for a licence for 20 lbs. of butter and it would make the whole thing impossible to work.  It may be argued that this particular amendment does not go as far as that.  I am afraid it does.  Another case I have in mind is this: it was mentioned by Senator Baxter.  Suppose a person leaves a creamery whose suppliers are desirous of co-operating with their neighbours.  These people relying upon the creamery would have dispensed with their dairying apparatus, their instruments for churning, and so on.  Now, this person might leave the creamery because he may have some grievance, or perhaps he might come to the conclusion that making farmers' butter would pay him better.  I say that particular individual should not get a licence.  Certainly, if we had a co-operative Act, which we propose to introduce some time or other, that person would not be allowed to leave the creamery.  I hope Senators will see the justice of not giving such a person facilities, and thereby enabling him to leave his neighbours, with whom he had promised to co-operate, in the lurch.  He might come out and seek to get an exemption licence under which he would get 1/2 or 1/3 or 1/4 for butter, compared with what Senator Baxter said represented 11d. for butter fat which is not the same thing as butter.  So that I say the Minister should have discretion.  I do not see how any Minister could resist an exemption claim at the moment, at any rate, except for the reasons I have given. There may be others.  Take the first amendment, where it is obvious that more than one member of the household would look for an exception and secondly where a person who left a creamery might come out to make farmers' butter after leaving his neighbours in the lurch.  These are two instances that occur to me in which a licence should be refused.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was very condescending in his willingness to accept amendment No. 10 which practically means nothing except the other amendments were carried also.  I <Col N="163" /> do not think we could say much on this amendment that has not already been said on amendment No. 1.  The Minister quoted Senator Baxter as saying that a man would only get 11d. for his butter fat.  But creamery suppliers are guaranteed 100/- per cwt. and they may for butter sold in this country charge up to 144/- per cwt.  There is the great difference and without repeating what I said before I think this amendment ought to be accepted.  In this amendment there is one guarantee, that everybody must register, and I think that will fix up Senator Bagwell's point.</P>

      <P>I have only one thing to say as regards the Minister's observations on the first amendment and that is that it appears to me that the claim of four people in one household to be exempt does not present any real <Col N="164" /> difficulty.  In such a case the Minister would refuse a licence and he would be quite right.  The conditions and circumstances would preclude that. They cannot all own the farm and if they did it might be that they could not produce more than 20 lbs. of butter.</P>

The rates at which the levy under this Part of this Act on butter shall be payable in respect of the month of April, 1935, and every subsequent levy month commencing before regulations under this section fixing rates of levy on butter have come into operation shall be as <Col N="165" /> follows, that is to say, on creamery butter 39/- per cwt., and on non-creamery butter 39/- per cwt.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 18, sub-section (3).  To delete in lines 33-34 the words &ldquo;thirty-nine&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the word &ldquo;twenty.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of the amendment is to alter the levy on non-creamery butter from 39/- to 20/-.  I do not think it requires very strong argument to convince the Seanad that it is not just or fair to charge the same levy on butter which is only making 8d. and 10d. per lb. as on butter which is being retailed at 1/5 and 1/6 per lb. Senator Baxter talks about the creamery paying this amount but the creameries are guaranteed 100/- per cwt. and they are getting very much more.  The levy is paid over to the creamery on the biggest portion of the butter exported but no matter how high the levy is on non-creamery butter, it will not come up to a terrible amount.  If any money is required I would suggest to the Minister that he should find it in some other way than by levying it on farmers of all descriptions.  He has insisted on keeping the farmer who has only one or two cows in this Bill and on making him pay 4¼d. on the butter he produces.  If he accepts this amendment and changes the levy to 20/- per cwt. he will be doing something reasonable.  I still contend that it is not right to levy anything on this butter but as the Minister has insisted on his proposal, I think it only right to have the levy reduced to 20/- per cwt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that Senator Counihan exactly realises what the amendment means.  If he looks at the sub-section he will find that it says that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...the rates at which the levy, under this Part of the Act, on butter shall be payable in respect of the month of April, 1935, and every subsequent levy month commencing <Col N="166" /> before regulations under this section fixing rates of levy on butter have come into operation shall be as follows:&mdash;that is to say, on creamery butter, 39/- per cwt. and on non-creamery butter, 39/- per cwt.</P>
    <P>This is only fixed until regulations are made.  That means that the people concerned who have been buying butter&mdash;grocers, traders, manufacturers, and so on, who have been buying butter for sale on the home market&mdash;are buying it knowing that this is the provision in the Bill.  They are buying it knowing that they have to pay a levy of 4¼d. a lb.  If Senator Counihan's amendment were carried it would bring that levy down to 2½d. per lb. and it would only have the effect of putting 1¾d. into every trader's pocket in respect of every lb. of butter they have bought since the 1st April. It will not make any difference to the farmers because after the Bill is passed regulations can be made altering the levy, if advisable, but until regulations are made this only affects those who have been buying butter up to the present and until the Bill is passed. I do not think that Senator Counihan means to confer that benefit on traders who have been buying butter for the last two months, under the impression that they would have to pay a levy of 4¼d. per lb.  They have taken account of that in their books and have bought their butter on that assumption.  There is no reason why we should present them with a profit of 1¾d. which they did not expect.  This amendment would have no effect on the farmer who has sold his butter.  It only applies to butter already bought.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that this 39/- is only a temporary arrangement.  I should like to know what the levy is going to be when the Minister makes his regulations.  I am satisfied to withdraw the amendment if, on Report Stage, the Minister will introduce an amendment to make the levy 20/- immediately after the passing of the Bill.  It would not interfere with the levy he has put on the creameries.  I think it is important that we should realise that somebody <Col N="167" /> has to fight the cause of the farmers who are butter producers and who are not sending their milk to creameries. If the Minister will retain the levy of 39/- for the people he mentioned, I am satisfied, but in future let it be only 20/-.</P>

      <P>I do not want it to be taken that we can fix the levy at 20/- after the regulations are made.  The bounty necessary for the butter exported will determine the levy.  If there is a good collection it may be possible to make the levy less after some time.  I do not know whether it will be made less or not and I could not possibly agree to accept the amendment in that way.  If Senator Counihan only realised it, I have been fighting the cause of these farmers, for whom he says he speaks, in the Dáil for the last two months against the Senator and others.</P>

      <P>I wonder would it be very wise to consult representatives of the industry connected with the sale of a specified description of butter as to whether the Minister ought to fix a maximum price?  I think the buyer of the butter has as great an interest in the maximum price as the representatives of the industry.  I think it would be very unfair to consult representatives of the industry without hearing the other side.  The Minister, in that case, would be quite certain to get an advice which would be favourable to the vendors of the commodity and not favourable to the consumers.  For that reason, it would be wisest to leave matters entirely in the discretion of the Minister and let him if he thinks proper consult whom he wishes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Agriculture Act, the Minister has power to set up a consultative council to advise him on any matter.  That power was availed of when the Stabilisation Act of 1932 was passed and a consultative council was set up.  That consultative council will be appointed if this Bill becomes an Act.  All classes are represented on the consultative council&mdash;managers of creameries, suppliers to creameries, producers of farmers' butter, buyers of farmers' butter, and consumers.  That body would always be consulted on any order that has to be made under a section such as this.  I do not say at the moment that this section will be made operative.  This section was inserted so that we could use it if necessary.  There was, as a matter of fact, an attempt made about last February 12 months to corner the butter in the country because it was known <Col N="169" /> that we kept a certain amount of butter, the quantity sufficient for our needs in the winter.  There was an attempt made to corner that butter, but luckily we were able to deal with the matter at the time because the Dairy Disposals Board held a lot of butter. By placing that butter on the market they countered the attempt that had been made to corner the market.  There was also a threat made by me that foreign butter&mdash;Australian butter&mdash; would be licensed-in, if necessary, to bring down prices.  At any rate, the threat to corner the market and put up prices was not carried out.  Instead of using blackmail methods to deal with such a situation, should it ever arise, we think it is better to take power in the Bill to deal with it.  It is only in such cases that this power would be used.  Everyone knows that there is a certain amount of butter there for the winter.  It is possible that three or four people might combine to try and corner it, and then about the month of February put up the price.  We can deal with a situation like that under this section.  The consultative council would be called together to consider it.</P>

It says that the Minister may, at any time by order revoke or amend any Order previously made by him; that is to say, the Minister is given a discretion.  The Minister cited a particular case, but when the Oireachtas is passing an Act it cannot anticipate the classes of case that may arise.  The Minister is taking power to fix prices, to make Orders, to revoke Orders and to do quite a number of extraordinary things.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 39.  After the words &ldquo;creamery butter&rdquo;, wherever they occur, to insert the words &ldquo;or non-creamery butter.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think that this amendment might be discussed with amendments 13 and 14. The Minister is taking power to fix maximum and minimum prices for creamery butter as well as power to make a levy of 39/- per cwt. on creamery and non-creamery butter. But he is leaving the producers of non-creamery butter to go and fish for themselves in getting a price for their butter.  The price of it may come down to 5d. or 6d. per lb.  I understand that it is the opinion of fairly sound authorities in this country that that will be the price after the levy of 39/- per cwt. is put on.  I had a letter dealing with this, which I regret I did not bring with me, from a producer of non-creamery in the County Tipperary. He wrote to a very important Dublin buyer of non-creamery butter asking him what he thought the price of that butter would be in his factory after this Bill had become law.  He replied that the outside price of it would be 5d. or 6d. per lb.  In order to prevent that taking place I have put down amendments Nos. 12, 13 and 14. In amendment No. 14, I propose:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the Schedule the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="171" /> 2. On non-creamery butter&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  in the case of a consignment of not less than 5 cwts&mdash;£5 12s. 0d. per cwt;</P>
    <P>(ii)  in the case of a consignment of less than 5 cwts&mdash;£6 0s. 0d. per cwt.</P>
    <P>The minimum price set out in the Bill for creamery butter is £7 1s. 0d. per cwt. for consignments of not less than 5 cwt., and £7 5s. 0d. per cwt. for consignments of less than 5 cwt.  I am proposing that the prices should be fixed at £5 12s. 0d. and £6 per cwt.  If the Minister will accept the principle of the amendments, I do not think we will quarrel about the price that he will put in the Schedule as the minimum price.  I think that in all justice non-creamery butter producers should be treated in the same way as the creamery butter producers.  Both will have to pay the same amount of levy.  Therefore, I think both ought to be safeguarded in the matter of price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The objection that I have to this amendment is that I am afraid it would be altogether unworkable. Every one will admit that farmers' butter is not of uniform quality. Creamery butter is practically uniform in quality.  It is made under regulations issued by the Department. It must be made in a certain way, and, therefore, the quality is as near uniformity as it is possible to have it.  If a minimum price were to be fixed for farmers' butter you would, I think, be creating a very difficult situation.  Certain consumers would consider that some of it was worth nothing at all.  They would not buy it.  More of it might be considered to be superior in quality to the best creamery butter, and, on that account, I believe that many people would be prepared to pay more for it than for creamery butter, the reason being that they preferred it. You have farmers' butter that is worth 1/4 and 1/5 per lb.  If we were to fix maximum and minimum prices we would probably injure that butter because, in practice, I fear, the minimum price would become the <Col N="172" /> maximum.  Hence you would have the price of that butter coming down to perhaps 1/1 per lb.</P>
      <P>Great difficulty would be experienced in dealing with farmers' butter that was considered not to be worth the price fixed for it.  There may be certain consumers here who would be prepared to use farmers' butter, even though it was not very good, if they got it cheap.  They would not be allowed to buy it and would have to go elsewhere.  In the case of confectioners, and the manufacturers of confectionery of all kinds, they usually buy farmers' butter through the factories.  They would be bound by this amendment if it were passed. They might possibly say that the butter was not worth the price fixed, and might prefer to take creamery butter at a higher price rather than risk taking farmers' butter of uncertain uniformity.  There would be great difficulty in deciding the price that we should fix, because it is almost certain that no matter what price we fixed it would be too low for some of the butter and too high for a great deal of it.  The result would be to knock it out of the market altogether.</P>
      <P>But, supposing that we got over that difficulty, we would then be faced with the difficulty of enforcing observance of the fixed price.  I do not anticipate any great trouble in enforcing the minimum price for creamery butter because, as I have already pointed out, there are cooperative societies in existence and they would be inclined to co-operate with one another in keeping prices up.  They are in a rather well organised trade.  These societies combine occasionally for the purpose of dealing with certain questions, and on the whole there is a very good spirit amongst them.  They usually carry out any promises they may give to one another, so that without any supervision at all I think the creameries would be inclined to pay the fixed prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the class that Senator Counihan's amendment deals with, you have farmers all over the country, and, consequently, great trouble <Col N="173" /> would be experienced in enforcing the minimum price.  I think it would be impossible to do it.  For instance, how could we control farmers who sell their butter direct to consumers? You also have farmers selling their butter to blenders in the open market. In that case, possibly, we could see that the minimum price was paid. Take the case of butter bought by blenders.  They are paying from 8d. to 8½d. per lb. for it.  Possibly they could pay 9d.  I do not know.  With the levy and the bounty that is set out in the Bill, I think that is the most they could pay.  The price in the export market is about 73/- per cwt. at present.  If you let the export bounty that we are paying go against the tariff and add 25/- to the 73/- you arrive at the figure of 93/- or 94/- per cwt. for butter at the present time after you have made an allowance to meet expenses.  The expenses referred to are intended to cover the cost of transit to England.  When you deduct the expenses for blending, allowing, say, 10/- per cwt., that brings the price down to about 84/-, so that the blenders cannot pay much more than 9d. per lb. for this butter. If we fix the price at a 1/-, that butter cannot be disposed of.  It will be left there and no one will buy it.</P>
    <P>If the industry were organised sufficently and we were able to classify farmers' butter, something might be done, but, in the absence of that, I fear the amendment would not be workable. In view of all that, the Senator, I hope, will realise that where you have butter, some of which is worth 8d. and more worth 1/5 per lb., with butter of varying qualities in between, it would be impossible to enforce a minimum price.  If you had a minimum price of 8d. at the present time, I am afraid it would have a bad effect on buyers all through the country.  As we have not a uniform quality in farmers' butter, I think it would be a rather dangerous thing for the House to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Even there you have different qualities of butter.  The Senator knows a good deal about the butter that is produced in County Kerry.  I myself was in the butter markets in that county on a few occasions. There is no doubt from what I saw that there is a great difference in the quality of the butter that is marketed there.  Some of it might not be worth 5d. per lb.  If the general price were 8½d., probably some of the butter marketed would not be worth 5d.  A difficulty would arise then as to what was to become of that butter if we could not get any one to take it even at 5d.</P>

      <P>But the Minister is not putting any restriction on the factories as to the price they will pay. What I want to guard against is that the factories will not be allowed to send buyers through the country to cut down prices.  I think that if the factories were compelled to pay a minimum price it would be a great help to producers.</P>

      <P>On this section, a fine of £100 is provided in the Bill.  It sounds drastic, and if it is not intended to impose such a fine, it ought not to be placed at such a high figure.  Here we have provision for the cancellation of registration of premises on conviction or failure to pay levy.  Perhaps the Minister has good reasons for having the section as drastic as it is. If so I should like to hear them.</P>

      <P>I think what I said here before about the revocation of licences <Col N="175" /> would apply here.  In all those Acts where there are levies&mdash;I know it was in the last Act of this kind, the Cattle Act, and some other Acts where levies are collectable &mdash; cancellation is only used as a last resort.  If a person did not pay the levy the Department got after him.  If he paid it and said it would be all right in the future we certainly would not cancel his licence. It is only where he is absolutely hopeless and continues to defy us that it will be done.</P>

      <P>You may have a manager, for instance, who is not doing the business for a creamery that he ought to do and cancellation might impose a great hardship on a whole district.  It sometimes happens that an individual is very hard to deal with. The only way to deal with him is to remove him altogether, but it often happens that the people in charge do not take that step or, for various reasons, are incapable of taking it.</P>

      <P>I do not think a case such as Senator Baxter mentioned would ever occur.  In any case not alone is the manager notified but also the chairman.  There is always a certain fear that a manager may try to conceal his shortcomings from the Committee, so that when a notice goes to the manager notice also goes to the chairman. I should like to point out also that if there is any offence like failing to keep records, the person concerned could bring the Minister to court to show cause why he removed him from the register.</P>

      <Col N="176" /> SECOND SCHEDULE.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Second Schedule stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to the Second Schedule, the minimum price is fixed at 141/- per cwt.  You will notice that what is tantamount to the price to the retailers is fixed at 4/- above that figure.  That is not the point that I wish to put to the Minister, although it only amounts to three-sevenths of a penny per lb.  Senator Counihan, when speaking on his amendment seeking to include a minimum price for non-creamery butter, fixed the amount at 8/- per cwt.  That three-sevenths of a penny per lb. profit to the wholesaler, in my opinion, is sufficient to enable him to continue business but the quantities mentioned, I submit to the Minister, would bear changing.  In the case of Dublin a consignment of less than 20 cwt. of butter may be bought at £7 5s. 0d. per cwt.  If a number of retailers join together and purchase in bulk just slightly over 20 cwt. they will get it at 4/- per cwt. cheaper and I do not believe that the amount of the saving will be passed on to the consumer. I believe that wholesalers serve a very useful purpose in the life of the community and I can see a way here where their whole trade will be jeopardised.  I suggest, for the consideration of the Minister, that the amount of 20 cwt. should be increased to 60 cwt. in the first instance, not necessarily in one consignment but spread over say a week.  That would make it more difficult for a body of retailers to come together and do a wholesaler out of his legitimate trade. The same position would exist in the country, and I suggest that, in order to obtain a price of 141/- per cwt., all purchases should be made in lots of 60 cwts. and so obviate any difficulty for the wholesale trade and enable them to serve what in my opinion is a very useful function.  I suggest that the Minister should consider the matter and if necessary bring in an amendment on the Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>I might mention that this matter was considered very carefully and, as a matter of fact, the trade <Col N="177" /> generally&mdash;wholesalers, retailers and creameries&mdash;were consulted to a certain extent.  At any rate, in regard to this Schedule, I do not think that any purpose can be served by bringing in an amendment, because if a case were made afterwards that the figures are unfair to any particular interest or if trade in general could be improved by altering the figures, we can make the gap of 4/- wider or narrower or raise the 20 cwts.  All these matters can be considered when the Bill goes through and alteration can be made by Order. This Schedule only holds until an Order <Col N="178" /> is made, so that it would not be necessary to amend it.  It certainly would not be necessary to hold up the Bill to amend it.</P>
