      <P>To-day we have an exhibition on both sides of the House of the impartiality of the superior House of Parliament in this State.  I think that the action of this House to-day is one of the most scandalous that has ever taken place in it in showing up its partiality on Party principles. I am as much opposed to the resolution that comes from the other side of the House as I am to the amendment that comes from this side of the House.  I only wish that I was in a position to defeat both of them and, if possible, to propose a Committee that would have some signs of impartiality.</P>

      <P>I only wish to say, Sir, that the procedure indicated by the proposer of the first motion must be regarded as absolutely essential if the matter which has to be considered is to get any kind of equitable or a judicial consideration.  This procedure has been rendered inevitable and essential because of the action taken in the other House where that House, which will represent half of this Committee of Privileges, has sent as its quota to that Committee a quota that, if one may describe it in such words as Senator O'Neill's words compel us to use, has already prejudged the question at issue.  In order to secure that the matter at issue shall be considered, it <Col N="1487" /> is essential that this House shall send to that Committee a quota that has before it the idea of having the matter considered.  It is for that reason and for no other reason, that the course suggested by the motion from this House was taken.</P>

      <P>I regret greatly that this question has arisen in the House. I think it is a very great pity that the other House&mdash;and I speak with the utmost respect&mdash;did not adopt the practice, as this is a constitutional question, of electing one representative from each of the political groups in that House.  Instead of that, they have elected two members of the Government Party and one member of the Labour Party, who support the Government Party.  Now, that, Sir, is very regrettable.  It has happened, however, and, in order that there may be a fair tribunal, as far as having the same number on each side is concerned&mdash;the same political numbers on each side, although, really, politics ought not to enter into this question at all&mdash;it has become necessary in this House to propose the resolution which was moved by Senator Wilson.  I am sorry that the question has arisen, but I put it to the House if it is not in the interest of fair play and decency that the three members who were named in that resolution should be elected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, Sir, that there is a danger of the position being somewhat misunderstood. It has to be remembered that the signatures which had to be secured numbered, I think, 62 or 64 in the other House, and I think it was clearly an indication of the attitude of mind of the entire Opposition in the other House when these signatures were secured.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that is a question of interpretation.  It is reasonable, I think, to assume that those people who signed the contention that this was not a Money Bill had already made up their minds and, in the circumstances, I do not see how you would expect the Government in the other House to nominate people who had <Col N="1488" /> clearly indicated already their prejudgment in that way.  Accordingly, they did what was reasonable in the circumstances, I think, and two Government nominees and a Labour representative were nominated on the panel. I am quite prepared to say that, in this House, if we felt that there was any reasonable chance of getting an unbiassed view from the Opposition here, we would be quite prepared to stand by it.  I want merely to explain the reason why the constitution of the three representatives of the other House was made as it worked out. Obviously, the people who signed the declaration that this was not a Money Bill, or that the matter should be brought into question, had made up their minds already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of those who allowed his name to be nominated for this Committee, I should like to reply personally to the remarks made by Senator Connolly.  This is a constitutional matter.  The persons who signed the declaration did not say that this was not a Money Bill.  They asked that it should be referred to a Committee of Privileges.  I consider it highly desirable that in this matter we should have a judicial decision.  I admit that the matter is debatable. It is not a certain matter by any means.  It is a matter in which there is room for two perfectly honest opinions, to my mind, and it is desirable that the matter should be decided by the judge who will have to preside over the Committee and, personally, I hope that will happen.</P>
      <P>I would have preferred that we should have some members from each Party in this House and from each Party in the Dáil.  I fear that, unfortunately, things being as they are, the matter may be a Party vote and, without making any reflections&mdash;and I do not think any Senator will accuse me of it in this case&mdash;I believe there would be a danger that, if you appointed six members of one Party, there might not be a judicial decision at all and that, to my mind, would be highly undesirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>As I proposed three names, I wish to say, with regard to the three Senators concerned, that Senator O Maille is very well qualified <Col N="1489" /> to determine this question because, for many years he was Vice-Chairman of the other House; Senator Lynch is a lawyer of great learning and experience; and Senator Fitzgerald is a member of this House who has spoken very frequently and very sensibly in this House.  Accordingly, so far as the personnel of the Committee which I propose is concerned I think there can be no reasonable objection to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Adverting to the remarks of Senator Connolly, in which he stated that, because 62 members of the Dáil signed this petition to set up a Committee, therefore, they had decided in their minds that this was not a Money Bill, I could just as easily remark to the Senator that those who did not sign could also be conceived by us as saying that this is a Money Bill.  Therefore, that argument of his falls by the board.  It is entirely with a view to having a judicial decision on the merits of the question that we on this side of the House have tried to bring about that that Committee will have on either side a proportionate representation of Opposition and Governmental members, and I have no doubt that the men we have selected are admirably suited for their task. Senator O'Hanlon has been LeasChathaoirleach for a period.  Senator Douglas has also been Leas-Chathaoirleach and is very closely in touch with the Standing Orders.  Senator Blythe has been a Minister for ten years.  I contend that those three candidates, whom I ask you to select, are very well suited for the position and, if they are placed on the Committee, will do justice both to the other House and to this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to what Senator Connolly and Senator Wilson said, stressing the advantages of both panels, let us assume for a moment that the panel in which Senator Wilson is interested is passed and accepted by this House.  If there are three men on your side and three from the Dáil on the Government side, it would obviously devolve on the Chief Justice to make the final decision on the matter at issue.  However, I am inclined to the view of Senator Brown. I think his suggestion a good one. <Col N="1490" /> There is no reason why, even for once, this House should not assert its independence of thought and action by not following what has been done in the other House.  I suggest to Senators that, for once, they should take up a typically independent attitude, and say that on this question they will not follow the example of the other House but will nominate one from each Party on this committee.  Senator Brown has suggested that and I do think his suggestion should be followed, but I suppose it is too much to expect that this House would do that in view of its past record, its past history and its partiality.  I suppose that in this matter it will abuse the majority that it has by overthrowing us, and also abuse the opinions of the majority of the people in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>The position that we have to-day is this: that there is a provision in the Constitution put there purposely, I take it, in order to defend the minority.  The minority in the other House has made use of that provision in order to table such a motion as we have before us to-day.  With all due respect, I submit that the minority in this country, by doing that, has not only done itself a grave evil but that it has done a grave injustice to all minorities in the future.  That provision was put in for the protection of minorities, but the minority on this occasion have hopelessly abused that provision by bringing forward a motion to decide such a simple matter as this.  Perhaps simple is not the proper word to use.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. MacEllin Mr. MacEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate it is obvious to anyone, certainly to anyone who has respect for constitutional procedure and usage, that &ldquo;money&rdquo; is written all over the Bill which is the subject-matter of this motion.  Again I suggest to the minority that they ought to be very careful in using an Article in the Constitution put in for their special protection, and that they should not abuse the power which it gives to them as regards such a trivial <Col N="1491" /> matter as this is, because it is perfectly obvious to everyone that the Land Purchase (Guarantee Fund) Bill is a Money Bill.</P>
      <P>This Article in the Constitution has been put in, as I have said, for the protection of minorities.  They are people who are supposed to have great respect for the Constitution, but I suggest to them that in the action they are taking on this matter they are doing greater harm to themselves than they are to the Government.  May I suggest to them that at this, the eleventh hour, they ought to leave personalities and Party politics out of this and take up an independent attitude for once by nominating to this committee one from each Party?  If they do that we will vote for their motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelStaines" hpid="Mr. Staines Mr. Staines">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to Senators that we ought to get down to rock-bottom on this.  The Oireachtas of this country is elected on the principle of proportional representation.  The Dáil is elected on that principle, and so were some of the members of this House.  The remaining members of the Seanad were elected on the principle of proportional representation by the combined vote of the Dáil and Seanad. I suggest to Senators that we cannot have it both ways.  When the Dáil was electing its representatives on this committee it should have given a fair <Col N="1492" /> show to all Parties in the Dáil.  The Government did not do that because the President thought that the Seanad was gone and that he could set himself up in this country as an absolute dictator.  The Seanad is not gone yet. In order to balance things up, it is our duty to-day to put on this committee three members of the Opposition.</P>

      <P>'Se mo thuairim go mba ceart do lucht an Choiste seo a mbarúil a thabhairt do réir an chirt agus gan baint a bheith acu le ceisteanna poiliteachta.  If I understand rightly the contention put forward by Senator Douglas and Senator Wilson, it is this: that the function of the three representatives on this Committee to be selected by the Seanad is to vote directly opposite to the way in which the Dáil representatives will vote, so that the onus of deciding the question at issue will be thrown upon the Chief Justice.  I think that is a very wrong point of view to take.  Anyone elected on the committee from this House ought to vote on the question at issue on its merits.  It is one that ought to be above Party consideration.  With Senator O'Neill, I deplore the fact that the Seanad is approaching this question in a Party spirit.  A decision on this question ought to be given on the merits alone, and ought not to be influenced by Party considerations.</P>

We shall probably have to meet again for the Report Stage of the Conditions of Employment Bill.  I am willing to do either, but if it is agreed to postpone it until then, we could get all the other business disposed of to-day.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 42:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 43 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>43.&mdash;Every employer who employs any adult worker or young person to do for him any form of industrial work shall whenever and on every occasion on which he permits such adult worker or young person to <Col N="1497" /> work overtime enter in the prescribed register the prescribed particulars concerning the overtime employment of such adult worker or young person.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that employers are not entitled to have their employees working more than a prescribed number of hours without getting permission to allow them to work overtime. We think it desirable, in the interest of everybody concerned, that, where overtime is worked, it should be entered in a register kept for the purpose and that the register should be open to inspection whenever required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Supplementing what Senator Farren has said, there are provisions in the Bill regarding the amount of permitted overtime&mdash;weekly, monthly or yearly&mdash;but there is no provision made to ensure that a record shall be kept of the number of hours worked.  Consequently, some kind of register is necessary.  In the larger establishments, the ordinary time-sheets are kept.  In many small establishments, it is questionable whether such time records are kept. Where regular time records are kept, it may be provided under this section that they be kept in a prescribed form.  Where time sheets are kept, a check is available on the amount of overtime worked, but unless some such provision as this is inserted there is no assurance that time records will be kept, and if time records are not kept there will be no check on the amount of overtime worked.  It seems to me that some amendment of this kind is essential to the proper working of the Act.</P>

I do not see how you could enforce provisions with regard to overtime if there were no records.  The same records, however, will not be suitable in every case and I am not sure that an omnibus clause is the best form of clause.</P>

      <P>It is, undoubtedly, correct that to enable the overtime provisions of the Bill to be enforced a record will have to be kept by each employer whose employees work overtime but, as Senator Douglas has pointed out, different conditions may apply in different trades.  Furthermore, the amendment moved by Senator Farren is incomplete.  A more elaborate provision would have to be embodied in the Bill if the obligation to keep such a record were to be imposed under that section of the Bill. Under Section 64, power is taken to prescribe and require the keeping of whatever records are necessary to enable any of the provisions of the Bill to be enforced.  It is under that section I propose to make regulations prescribing the records to be kept of overtime worked by employees so as to ensure that there will be adequate means of enforcing the provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 43:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 44.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  It shall be a good defence to any proceeding taken against any employer for a breach of the provisions of this section if such employer proves to the satisfaction of the court that he took reasonable care to ascertain the facts and that he did not knowingly permit a worker to work overtime.</P>
      <P>I place some importance on this amendment, either in its present form or submitted in some other way.  The section makes it an offence for an employer to employ a person for the excessive hours provided in the Bill, if the other hours have been worked for another employer.  I do not object to that, because the Bill would be a farce if there were not some such provision; but it seems to me that either the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; should be put in, or preferably an amendment such as I have put down.  The employer who works a man who has been employed by another employer must get his information from the worker himself or from the other employer.  He cannot have his staff watching another employer to see if the man has been employed there.  His action must depend on information supplied to him and I think this amendment of mine is the proper way of dealing with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was suggested in the Dáil that the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; might be put in.  I recognise that if you simply <Col N="1500" /> put the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; in there would be no obligation on the employer to make all the inquiries necessary, but my amendment provides that it shall be a good defence that the employer did make inquiries and got wrong information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickLynchKC" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to draw attention to one observation of the Senator who moved this amendment&mdash;that it is an important amendment.  In my opinion, it is one that should not commend itself to the House, and I submit that on a little reflection most Senators will agree with me.  In the case of a large employer, who employs managers or clerks of work to superintend the employees, this section would always let him out, because the large employer's knowledge would be the knowledge of the person in immediate contact with the worker who would be acting in contravention of the spirit of the section. In the case of the small employer, he probably might be caught.  The suggestion is that except you can prove that the employer, the man at the top, who employs quite a number of people, was aware of the circumstances, he could not be held guilty.  If the employer can prove that he did not know, as the work was supervised by his manager or clerk of works, then he is out every time.</P>
      <P>I agree that this is an important section for the workers, and I think that this amendment should be rejected by those of us in the House who are in sympathy with the objects of the Bill, which aim at alleviating to some extent the conditions of employment of the workers.  I have taken the liberty of calling the attention of the House to this amendment, because of the elementary principle that no employer is criminally liable for what his manager or clerk of works does.  Therefore, if you put these words in, you could not convict an employer in any case where he had a manager or clerk of works over his employees.  It is a most important section, requiring every attention, and, in the circumstances, I think this amendment should be rejected by anybody who has any sympathy with the workers and their treatment in a reasonable and humane way, as is contemplated in the Bill.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to understand the latter portion of this suggested addition to Section 44.  The object of the section is that an employer would not engage a person to do industrial work unless he is satisfied that person has not worked the maximum number of hours specified in the Bill.  In Senator Douglas's amendment, by some peculiar process he brings in the question of overtime&mdash;&ldquo;and that he did not knowingly permit a worker to work overtime.&rdquo;  I fail to see where that comes in in the section, which is really concerned with the prohibition of double employment.  I endorse what has been said by Senator Lynch as regards relieving the employer of the responsibility.  We all know that in most cases when a person is employed, particularly in large firms, it is not the employer who employs that person; it is the employer's servants, the manager or the foreman.  If this suggested addition were accepted, it allows the loophole that any employer who wants to get rid of his responsibility can say &ldquo;So far as I am concerned, I have no knowledge that this man was employed; the first I heard of it was that my foreman or manager engaged him.&rdquo;  I think the House ought to reject the suggested addition.</P>

      <P>I think the amendment would make the condition worse, from the point of view of the employer, than the Bill itself.  I would like to know what is the true construction of Section 44 as it stands.  Is it necessary for the prosecution to show that the employer had intent?  Under the section, would it not be sufficient for him to show that he exercised reasonable care and was not aware that the employee had worked the number of hours specified in the Bill?  I think that so far as the employers are concerned, their position under the section is much better than would be their position under the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think possibly Senator Kennedy has found a flaw in the wording of the amendment; perhaps I got a little bit mixed up about overtime. I think, however, his criticism of my amendment is unfair.  I have <Col N="1502" /> tried to avoid the very thing which he criticises the amendment for, and if it is not clear in the amendment, it should be possible to make it clear.  I want to make it clear that if an employer proves, not that he did not know, because that is not sufficient, but that he took what the court would regard as proper steps to find out the facts and he got wrong information supplied to him, he should not be guilty of an offence.  Senator Comyn believes that would be the effect of the section as it stands.  Another lawyer told me it would not, and lawyers on two sides are always the trouble of my life.  They caused an enormous amount of trouble on another occasion by their disagreement. Assuming that to be the effect of the section, what is the objection if it is made clear beyond doubt that it is?  The reason I did not do as was first suggested to me, simply to insert the words &ldquo;that he did not knowingly do so,&rdquo; was because I thought that would be open to the criticism of Senator Kennedy.  When you say it will be a good defence if the employer proves he took all reasonable steps to ascertain the facts, that means that if another employer or worker gives him wrong information, that employer would not be responsible.  That is what I am trying to achieve.  I quite admit that the amendment might need re-drafting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to analyse this section and amendment, I would like the House to consider one question. Suppose a workman who had a good character and whom the employer had always found to be a useful man, came to his employer and said: &ldquo;I have worked only 20 hours for the past three weeks,&rdquo; and suppose the employer believed him, and the employer's manager confirmed that, would that be a good defence for an employer under this section?  I think it would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with any form of industrial work done on any day.  If a certain number of hours have been worked on that day, and if an employer employs the workman for another number of hours on that same day when the full hours have already been worked, then it is an offence. <Col N="1503" /> Senator Douglas has admitted the faulty construction of this suggested sub-section, but I would draw his attention to the phraseology &ldquo;if such employer proves to the satisfaction of the court that he took reasonable care to ascertain the facts&rdquo;.  In the instances quoted by Senators Kennedy and Lynch, the employer, who is the man to be prosecuted, does not ascertain any facts, but simply employs his foreman to take on such employees as he wishes.</P>
      <P>The principle is that the employer who would be the person prosecuted would be responsible for the acts of his foreman.  If you prosecute an employer, and he pleads that he had taken care to ascertain the facts, that would exonerate him under the new sub-section.  There is another feature that is still more important.  This is not a new principle.  Senator Douglas knows, or he would be aware of it if he looked the matter up, that the Shop Acts legislation embodies the same principle.  A shop assistant, who is also a dressmaker, for instance, cannot be taken on to do long periods of work after the ordinary hours when the shop is closed, and the working hours are finished.  That makes the shopkeeper responsible for keeping workers on doing additional work and that principle is already embodied in legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is no harm to try to get a clear view of the circumstances with which this section of the Bill is designed to deal.  Both employers' organisations and workers' organisations represented that a practice had developed in certain areas of workers, and particularly skilled workers, when they had finished their normal day's work on behalf of their employer, taking on occasional work for householders and others, to the detriment not only of employers in that industry but of workers in that industry also.  It was the intention, in a Bill designed to limit the working day, that that thing should be prohibited.  It was designed to provide that the aggregate work done by any worker should not exceed a permitted maximum.  Therefore <Col N="1504" /> this section was inserted in order to make it unlawful for an employer to employ a worker, or for a worker to work for his own or another employer in excess of the maximum hours.  An amendment was moved in the Dáil to provide that it should not be an offence for an employer unless he actually knew that the worker had worked a certain number of hours and that the total of his work exceeded the permitted maximum.  I resisted that because it would impose upon the prosecutor the obligation of showing that it was done knowingly, and, consequently, it would open up avenues of evasion that were not desirable.  At the same time I think it would be a good defence for the employer to say that he made all reasonable enquiries and did not know.  If that is so I think it is better to leave the Bill as it stands.  Although I see no objection in principle to the amendment, I think it is not necessary to have it in the Bill because the principle of it is there already, and taking into account the further fact that prosecutions, by inspectors, will not be proceeded with unless there is good ground to believe that there were mala fides in the matter, I think there is a double safeguard for the employer, in such circumstances as the probability is that he will not be prosecuted unless the Department reasonably believes that he was knowingly breaking the law, and, the further fact, that the courts who are always inclined to lean against the Department, will be inclined to take a favourable view of the person prosecuted.  The amendment if inserted might really cause more difficulty than good, and might well result in the general provisions being more stringent against the employer.</P>

The Minister says it would be a bad plan to alter the section although he thinks the principle in the amendment is right, but it is no answer to say that a court would hold it as a good defence.  The Minister is not a court. He is only putting up a hypothesis. Time and again you hear a judge say: &ldquo;I am here to administer the law.&rdquo;  The judge administers it although he may not like it, and although he may think it a very hard case.

      <P>Section 48, sub-section (3).  To add at the end of the sub-section the words: &ldquo;Provided that where the industrial work is carried on in more than one premises, the employer may fix a different interval for the workers in each of such premises&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a little difficulty with regard to this amendment.  As far as I can read the definition of an industrial undertaking, <Col N="1507" /> it might include a factory in Dublin, one in Galway, one in Cork and various other places.  It seems to me that an industrial undertaking could include more than one factory, and you might have an undertaking in which different classes of work would be carried on.  It seems to me that the purpose the Government have in view is that all the employees should have their meal hour at the one time provided the work was carried on in one premises.  I am not sure that the word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; offers the best definition. What I have in mind is a case where you might have one factory in Drogheda and another in Dublin.  The meal hour in Dublin would be, say, from 1 to 2 and in Drogheda from 1.30 to 2.30, but my reading of the section is that the undertaking must have the same meal hour for all workers in all their factories.  That is, I think, a mistake. Representations have been made by one firm that it has a number of people at work in one place in Dublin. There are two buildings in the case of this undertaking and I believe they are fairly well divided.  In the case of one building it would be necessary to leave some of the workers on at meal time owing to the continuous nature of the work, but in the case of the other premises there would be no difficulty whatever in having the same meal hour for all workers.  Generally speaking, all workers have their meal hour at the one time, but there are some traders where that is not possible. The Minister takes power to deal with that but I want to provide that where the premises are quite distinct, all the workers need not have the same meal hour provided the workers in the same premises have the same meal hour.  If the Minister would look into the amendment I would be satisfied to leave it over to Report Stage.</P>

I should, however, point out, to correct one statement made by Senator Douglas, that where work is done on continuous process this section does not apply.  It only applies to ordinary day work and not to continuous process <Col N="1508" /> industries.  In so far as there is any doubt that different intervals can be fixed for meal hours in respect to workers employed in different premises, I am prepared to see if that doubt can be removed.</P>

      <P>I think there is a doubt but, if the Minister is prepared to look into the matter, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment until the Report Stage.  Supposing you had a textile factory in which you had, say, 300 or 400 workers doing weaving. There would be no difficulty in having the same meal time for these workers, but then there might be, say, 50 workers doing finishing in a separate shed.  I do not know whether finishing is, strictly speaking, a continuous process but it is of the nature that if you start finishing a piece and you stop in the middle of the work, you spoil it. In other words, it is not practicable to have the same meal time for all the workers.  Could the Minister make an exception in regard to a certain number of these workers?</P>

      <P>Section 48, sub-section (6).  To insert before the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(6)  Any employer who permits a worker to whom this Act applies to remain in a room in which any form of industrial work is carried on during <Col N="1509" /> any part of the time allowed for meals shall be guilty of an offence under this Act.</P>
    <P>The object of putting down this amendment is to ensure that the same regulation as exists under the Factory and Workshops Act will be included in this Bill.  I do not think there is any need to elaborate the necessity for that. It is very much the same provision as is included in the Factory and Workshops Act.  It is very desirable to ensure that when people are having their meals, there will be no work carried on.  I do not think the Minister will oppose the amendment.</P>

If the Minister could say that he would permit this provision to continue until he can deal with the matter in the forthcoming Bill, that would be satisfactory.  In the meantime, there may be an interval of one, two or even three years.  If the Bill goes through in its present form, this provision in the existing Act will be repealed and there will be nothing to replace it.</P>

Whether that requirement will be extended to cover other or all forms of work is a matter that will arise for decision in connection with the Factory and Workshops Bill which is to be introduced shortly and not in connection with this Bill.

There are certain processes of industrial work in which this is essential.  I know ordinarily it is not done, but there are some industries where the process is a continuous one and in such cases this must be allowed.</P>

      <P>In any event the extension of the provisions to the existing <Col N="1512" /> Act is to cover other forms of work.  That is a matter that should not be dealt with in this Bill.  The only matter that arises is whether we are repealing something now which will leave a hiatus between the period of the passing of this Act, its coming into force, and the introduction or passing of the promised Workshops and Factories Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not that Act with me, unfortunately, at the moment, but I understand that the sections that are repealed are Sections 23 to 56.  The whole of the sections dealing with the matter of the provisions in the case of women and young persons are in fact being repealed by this Bill.  That being so, there is nothing in this Bill to ensure that any protection in regard to taking meals in a workroom while work is being carried on is retained. That protection section being repealed by this Bill, there will be no protection in this matter of meal hours while work is carried on.  In the ordinary textile factories, even a tobacco factory, as this Bill is drafted work can be carried on during meal hours.  Half the people can remain sitting at their looms in a cotton factory having their meals, nominally off work, but really simply waiting for the opportunity of evading the inspector's eye.  The provision under the Factory Act is to ensure that the workers in textile industries and such other industries as are manned by women shall have an opportunity to get away from the work during the meal hour.  Therefore it was made an offence to allow these people to take their meals in the room where the work is being carried on. That provision is being repealed under the present Bill.  We want to insert something in the Bill to ensure that that provision will be maintained until the new Factory and Workshops Bill is brought forward.</P>

Senators have to remember, for instance, such things as a breakdown of machinery in the actual concern.  Is the process of repairing that machinery to be allowed to go ahead during the dinner hour?  Are you going to prevent the workers from effecting repairs during the meal hours?  There are certain other industries, such as shipyard works, where a number of machines may be engaged on certain urgent orders.  I think this whole amendment will have to be definitely qualified.  The amendment, as it stands, would prohibit any form of industrial work being carried on during the meal hour.  The amendment should be withdrawn in view of the Minister's assurance.</P>

The present Bill has no provision of this nature.  If the Minister would tell us how he is going to enforce his safeguards in the interests of the factory workers in the interval between the passing of this Bill and the introduction of the promised Bill we would be satisfied.  Until he can show us how he is to do that I do not see how the workers are going to be protected.  We fear he had no power, because the power he has up to this is being repealed.  If he can show us that he retains the power to enforce this provision we would be satisfied, but the present position is that we do not know when the promised Bill will be introduced.

      <P>Before you pass the section I should like to ask the Minister what is the meaning of the words in Section 48, sub-section (5): &ldquo;premises of his employer&rdquo;?  If you have seven or eight sheds or buildings in one factory is each one of those a separate building?  The Bill does not say so.  Now if a person remains in any of those is he not still on the premises of his employer?  He will be deemed to be there under the section. I am not clear that that may not create a difficulty where one of the sheds is set apart for meals.  The whole thing depends on the meaning of the word &ldquo;premises.&rdquo;</P>

In a factory such as I have mentioned, one shed, which might be 100 yards away from where the industrial work is going on, may be set apart for meals.  According to Senator Comyn, the men who would ordinarily be allowed to take their meals there would have to be turned out of that shed during meal hours.  I know it is only a technical point.</P>

      <P>I have put down this amendment for the purpose of getting information. In Section 26, there is a sub-section similar to the one which I propose to insert here.  If it is necessary to have the sub-section in Section 26 it ought to be necessary also in Section 49, because under Section 26, if an employer does not pay to a worker certain moneys which he is entitled to receive for labour given, this sub-section comes into force.

      <P>I want to raise a point which might come under this section or Section 54.  Is it quite clear that boiler repairs could be done on Sunday?  When it becomes an emergency under Section 54, or there is a reasonable anticipation of a boiler bursting, I agree it could be done. But it is more or less usual in certain factories to get boiler repairs done regularly so that there is no reasonable anticipation of danger.  If that is not done on a Sunday it will put workers out for a day.  It is not because it is mainly a matter of danger but to allow other workers to go on without interruption.  The Minister would have power to deal with this under Section 49 (1) (e). That is the only place it is referred to.  It seems to me that the doing of boiler work or work on similar machinery, which is necessary to enable a factory or industrial undertaking to go on with the ordinary work on the weekdays, is just as important as newspapers or broadcasting or any of the other things which are exempted from the Sunday work provisions.</P>

There are only two of the public holidays which must be given&mdash;Christmas Day and St. Patrick's Day&mdash;whereas any other public holiday may be substituted, as the Senator is aware, by certain Church holidays.  If we were to prescribe the form, we would have to prescribe a form setting out these public holidays or certain other Church holidays substituted for them.  Otherwise you would be defeating another section of the Bill which requires the employer to give only a month's notice of such change, whereas if he had to put up a notice in the prescribed form <Col N="1518" /> it would probably involve a much longer decision on his part.  I do not know that the notice is necessary in the new circumstances.

      <P>I think that what the Minister said only tends to make this addition all the more necessary. Take the case of an employer giving notice of his intention to substitute one of the Church holidays, as set out in the Bill, for one of the other holidays and giving the usual month's notice.  It is quite possible that some workers may be employed within that month, and I certainly think that it is not putting any great expense on an employer to ask that he should put up in his factory notice as to what the public holidays are.  As we all know, there are many factories in which workers are engaged during busy seasons for a period of short duration, and many of them might come into work under such conditions without knowing what were their rights in regard to holidays.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say that, in my opinion, I do not think it matters very much whether the notice is put up or not.  As a matter of fact, I think that the more notices you put up the more you will defeat the object of the notice, and when you have notices put up in both languages all around the place, the less attention will be paid to such notices.  As far as the employer is concerned, or the employee for that matter, I do not think that one other notice will make much difference one way or other, because I think that the whole tendency of the Bill is towards having too many notices rather than too few.  However, I do not think that any employer would object to this particular notice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Kennedy misunderstands the type of notice prescribed under Section 53.  Notice in the prescribed form will be notice in the prescribed form applicable to all factories.  Consequently, that notice could not specify or take into consideration all the various needs or contingencies in regard to a particular factory.  Notice must be given under another section and, therefore, any notice which could be prescribed in Section 53 would be only a replica of the relevant section of the Act.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister can have any objection to this amendment, at any rate.

      <P>Section 63, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in line 27 to insert the words &ldquo;after consultation with representatives of persons interested in the relative form of industrial work and after consideration of the cost involved.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a certain amount of misgiving with regard to Section 63, and I think it would help if the Minister would agree to this amendment, the object of which is to provide that he would consult with the persons concerned in the relevant industry before he makes an Order for the furnishing of statistical returns.  There are some statistical <Col N="1523" /> returns that are absolutely essential, no matter what they cost.  On the other hand, there are some statistical returns that would be very nice to have if they did not add substantially to the cost of the factory and, consequently, to the cost of the goods produced by the factory concerned.  There are other statistical returns that will cost hundreds and hundreds of pounds. I should like to be sure where some official in the Department gets it into his head that he would like to have certain statistical returns, and where he succeeds in getting the approval of the Minister, that, before the Order is made, the persons affected will have time and be given a chance of informing the Minister of what the cost of compiling these returns will amount to.  Some of these returns, as we all know, are very costly indeed by reason of the extra work involved. Very often we pass things here in the House and we have not the remotest idea what they will cost until we come up against it afterwards.  I am sure that the Minister himself has realised this in his own Department.  I want to be quite sure that the Minister will be informed of the possible cost that may be involved in the compiling of such statistical returns.  I think that, before making the Order, there should be an opportunity given to inform the Minister of the additional cost that would be imposed on an industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly think that no Minister would, and I am quite certain that no Minister will, contemplate making an Order under this section, without having due regard to the cost involved in the making of these returns. I could not agree, however, to put in the Bill a form of words which would have the effect of compelling the Minister to have such consultation and which might negative his Order in the absence of consultation beforehand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would urge the Minister to consider this before the Report Stage and see whether he cannot do something about it.  I have a good deal of experience of statistics.  They are very useful, of course, but the getting of statistics is a thing that can be very much abused.  It is all right, of course, to order the getting of statistics if you have not to pay for the preparation of them.  From my experience, I think that their preparation in relation to a good many matters can be frightfully wasteful.  I can see the point of the Minister.  I think it would be a very difficult thing to amend this amendment, but, perhaps, the Minister would be good enough to look into it and see if something cannot be done to meet the point of Senator Douglas between this and the Report Stage.  I think that something on the lines suggested by the Senator ought to be done, although not necessarily in the form that he has suggested.  I think that if the section were allowed to go unamended it would simply open the way, not necessarily for the present Minister, but perhaps for some future Minister, to require the preparation of all <Col N="1525" /> sorts of statistics.  We all know that there are certain types of people who have statistics on the brain.  I think that this section, if unamended, would just give them the opportunity that they would love to have.  It might lead to an enormous waste of time and of expenditure, and for that reason I hope the Minister will look into this before the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that any representations that are made by interested persons, that is persons affected by the requirements of the Department in the matter of making statistical returns at the present time, are very carefully considered.  This section is very largely required in order to enable us to get the power of the statute behind our request for returns which we are now getting, to a very large extent, voluntarily from employers all over the country, but in the changed circumstances of the past two years the value of the voluntary returns has been very largely diminished by the failure of a small minority to make returns.  It is in order to make more valuable the information which we are at present getting that this statutory power is required.  It is most unlikely that any unreasonable request will ever be made, or that any representations made on behalf of employers and the owners of business generally in respect of these returns, will not be listened to. I think I can say that every effort will be made to meet them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that a fortnight's notice of the intention to make regulations should be given so that employers would be enabled to make representations to the Department. The making of these statistical returns is very costly.  I think that if the Minister had before him figures showing the percentage cost of making returns to Government Departments in relation to the cost of the commodities concerned, he would find that it is quite a considerable item.  In the case of certain factories it amounts to quite a considerable figure.  In many cases it involves the employment of additional staff.  While I recognise the value of these returns, I may say that this section has caused a good deal of <Col N="1526" /> uneasiness amongst employers.  There is a good deal of grumbling about it, and I think that something should be done to meet the point of view of employers, because this work does lead to a good deal of additional expenditure.</P>

      <P>On the Second Reading of the Bill, I made a statement to the effect that by the repeal of the Employment of Women, Young Persons and Children Act, 1920, it seemed to me that every section of that Act, so far as it relates to any form of industrial work as there defined, was being repealed.  It has been represented to me since that, in fact, the extent of the repeal is to any form of industrial work as defined in this measure.  Now, I am not quite sure that the only form of industrial work which is being repealed is that which is defined in this measure, because industrial undertakings are defined in the other Act.  The purpose of my amendment is to make clear and unquestionable that the repeal of the Act of 1920, so far as it relates to industrial work, is only the industrial work which is defined here.  I am not sure that it is necessary to do that, but it appears to me to be desirable to do so.</P>

I know that the Minister talked several times about the new Bills that are coming forward.  What I am uneasy about is as to what is going to happen during the interregnum. I want to be quite sure that, in the period between the repeal of the measures set out in the Schedule to this Bill and the enactment of new legislation, the protection afforded to workers under the present law will not be absent.  I want to get an assurance from the Minister to see that there is no worsening of the conditions in the case of women or young persons or any other person who may be covered as a consequence of the repeal of the Acts set down in the Schedule to this Bill.</P>

      <P>What does the House desire?  You said that it might be taken on January 8th.  You have the atmosphere on the abolition of the Seanad on January 15th.  This is prolonging our existence from the 15th to the 22nd.  I do not know what the President will do.  The Dáil may have to come back if we make amendments in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Apart from that, it would be desirable, in the interests of this Bill, which has been very much like an agreed measure.  The discussions in both Houses were conducted in a manner in which all Bills should be discussed.  In view of the atmosphere that will be prevalent on January 15th it would be better if this Bill were discussed before that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of this motion are explicit. It asks the House to set up a tribunal to inquire into a matter which is regarded as of urgent public importance. Representations were made to the Executive Council and to my Department with regard to grievances of town tenants that it is alleged arise under the existing law.  As the representations made and the details furnished were too vague and too incomplete, an opportunity is required to have them examined by a competent tribunal.  The details furnished to us were in such a form as would not warrant the Executive Council introducing legislative proposals.  The terms <Col N="1531" /> of this motion restrict the scope of the tribunal it is proposed to set up to what is commonly known as occupying tenants.  They will include, as well as ordinary occupying tenants of houses, occupiers of tenements, flats and so on.  The representations so far made; in the overwhelming majority of cases, bear on that particular problem.  It is because this is regarded as an urgent and a serious matter that the motion is brought before this House.  This tribunal is regarded as being likely to give more satisfactory results than an ordinary commission of inquiry, as it will have the same powers as a High Court with regard to securing the attendance of witnesses, the production of documents and the taking of evidence on oath. The tribunal will probably consist of a legal man&mdash;either a judge, senior counsel, or some other lawyer of standing&mdash;as chairman, with a representative of the Department of Justice, the Department of Local Government and Public Health and of the Valuation Office.  The Dáil has approved of this motion.</P>

      <P>I do not want to deal with the general purport of this motion, but I want again, as I did previously, to refer to the form in which the tribunal is set up.  I have no doubt it is a very convenient form but it is surely stretching the Act very considerably to set up a tribunal on a plea in this form, that this is a matter of urgent public importance. We know that the Act under which tribunals were set up was enacted to deal with the matters of urgency and <Col N="1532" /> of immediate public importance&mdash;very urgent matters, which had suddenly arisen and that required to be dealt with rapidly.  Numbers of inquiries of this kind were not urgent in the sense that the Act contemplated.  This is a very useful device but, as to whether &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; here implies that the tribunal should make these inquiries between now and the new year, which would be implicit in the proposal, I very much doubt, and I suggest for the consideration of the Minister and his colleagues that some new formula should be adopted and new powers taken.  This form is using the phraseology of an Act not intended to deal with this kind of inquiry.</P>

      <P>As regards the adjournment, if the Land Purchase (Guarantee Fund) Bill, 1935, is decided by the Committee of Privileges to be a Money Bill, the period of 21 days in regard to it expires at midnight on Wednesday, 1st January.  In those circumstances, I would suggest to the House that I should summon a meeting of the Seanad for Monday, the 30th December, or Tuesday, the 31st December, for the purpose of taking the Second Stage of the Bill, and also a motion to take all the stages.</P>
      <P>If the Committee of Privileges decide that the Bill is not a Money Bill, the question will not arise and the House will stand adjourned until Tuesday, 14th January.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to wish all Senators a happy Christmas.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.20 p.m.</P>
