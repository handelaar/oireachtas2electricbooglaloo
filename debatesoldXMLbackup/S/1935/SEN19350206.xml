      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 16, sub-section (1).  To delete in line 3 the words &ldquo;one year&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;two years.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 16 deals with the case of a person who left the Free State and went to reside permanently in another country, let us say the United States of America, since the 6th December, 1922, and there married a citizen of that country.  If he or she was a citizen of the Free State in 1922 it says he or she shall, before the expiration of one year after the passing of this Act, lodge with the Minister a declaration of election to retain Saorstát citizenship or he or she shall cease to be a citizen.  It was represented to me that in such a case one year might be insufficient to allow such persons to become acquainted with the obligation resting upon them, and that, at least, another year should be given to such persons to elect whether they would wish to remain citizens of the Saorstát.  The object of the amendment is to increase the period from one year to two years in respect of those referred to in Section 16 (1).  It is a matter whether we consider one year sufficient time to give that class of citizen an opportunity to become aware of the new conditions.  I suggest that two years is a more appropriate time than one year.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment, which I urge should be accepted.  I understand that notification will be made by the consulates, but I agree with Senator Johnson that there might be portions of vast countries like the United States of <Col N="1198" /> America where intimation might not be conveyed to people who might desire to retain Irish citizenship, and for that reason I trust the amendment will be agreed to.</P>

      <P>This amendment was introduced to meet a point raised by Senator Johnson.  In other parts of the Bill it is applicable to orders laid before the Houses, and this appears to me to be, perhaps, one of the most important orders to be made under the <Col N="1200" /> Bill.  On that account we think it only right that the order should be laid before the two Houses.</P>

      <P>May I ask the President what has become of the amendment we adjourned from the Committee Stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to move the amendment because I think we can secure our purpose in another way.  The intention is that the whole code, when passed, should come into operation at the same time and I think that we can secure that because the other two Bills are to come before the Dáil immediately.  In view of the fact that the amendments passed to this Bill will have to go before the Dáil, I think we will be able to arrange matters so that the three measures will come into operation on the same date.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>On that question, I desire to submit to the House some considerations why we should not complete the Report Stage to-day.  I do so not with any obstructive idea but from what I consider to be in the true interests of the Bill.  In reply to the question which I put to him a moment ago, the President indicated that the Aliens Bill will be coming before the Dáil on its re-assembly.  The relation between that Bill and the one we are discussing is very close.  In fact, I think it might be said that the Aliens Bill is really supplementary to this Bill.  It is surely of the first importance that there should be no discordance between the provisions of the two Bills.  It is not improbable, I suggest, that when the Aliens Bill has made some progress in the Dáil we may discover some anomalies in this Bill which it would be desirable to correct for the purpose of establishing harmony between the two measures. But, if we completed the Report Stage of this Bill to-day and if flaws or defects were discovered in it subsequently, then it would not be possible to rectify them except by means of <Col N="1201" /> the introduction of another Bill and that, I submit, would not be the best way to deal with such a contingency.</P>
      <P>That may be considered a somewhat speculative or theoretical consideration. Still, I think it is one which is well worth weighing before it is dismissed from the minds of the members of the Executive Council.  But there is another and more practical reason for the suggestion I am making, one which has come to my notice by a further examination of the Bill since we dealt with it in Committee.  When I disclose it I think it will indicate that there is some reason for asking the House not to complete the Report Stage of the Bill to-day and the Government not to press for the completion of the Report Stage to-day.  I ask Senators to turn to Section 2, paragraphs (c) and (d). It will be noticed that amongst those who are to be claimed as natural-born citizens are the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(c)  every person who was born on or after the 6th day of December, 1922, and before the date of the passing of this Act in a ship registered in Saorstát Eireann, and</P>
      <P>(d)  every person who is born on or after the date of the passing of this Act in a ship registered in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very good.  But there is nothing in this Bill to implement these provisions. Here is the importance of the point I am making: that in Section 24 or 25 provision is made for securing the necessary information for the registration of natural-born citizens who are born abroad or born in Northern Ireland, but there is no provision whatever in this Bill for securing statistics or information relevant to the class I am referring to, namely, natural-born citizens born on a ship registered in Saorstát Eireann.  I think it would be essential, in order to make these two paragraphs operative, that there should be inserted a section imposing &ldquo;on the master of every such ship the duty of entering the fact of such birth in the log and furnishing the Registrar-General with particulars of such in due form.&rdquo;  It would be then duly registered, and the name might be entered <Col N="1202" /> in one of the registers proposed to be established by this Bill, if that was thought desirable.  But in this Bill as it stands there is no such provision.</P>
    <P>How does the Government propose to secure the statistics and information necessary for this purpose&mdash;that is, relating to natural-born citizens born on a ship registered in Saorstát Eireann?  If these paragraphs that I have quoted are not to become largely &mdash;I will not say entirely&mdash;a dead letter that information must be secured.  I take it that this could not be entirely an oversight on the part of the draftsman. It would seem to me that for the procuring of such information the Government are relying upon old British statute law for the source of such information.  That statute law is to be found in Section 27 of the Births and Deaths Act, 1874, and Section 254 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894. Briefly, the procedure provided by this British statute law is that when a child is born on a British ship, the master of that ship must record that event in his log book and when the ship arrives at any port in the United Kingdom&mdash;this is the wording of the statutory source from which this information can be derived&mdash;the master must make a return of the facts to the Registrar-General of Shipping and Seamen in London.  A further sub-section states that if the child's father is an Irish subject of His Majesty, the Registrar-General of Shipping and Seamen must send a certified copy of the return showing the birth of such a child to the Registrar-General of Births and Deaths in Dublin.  Any lawyer who is conversant with these Acts knows that the facts are as I have stated.</P>
    <P>Two important facts are disclosed by this.  Firstly, under these two paragraphs which I have quoted, we are claiming as natural-born citizens all children born on a ship registered in Saorstát Eireann, but from this source &mdash;and it is the only source from which we can at present secure the information&mdash;there is no return made to the Registrar-General in Dublin unless the father of that child is Irish or with the exception of the case in which the mother of an illegitimate child <Col N="1203" /> happens to be Irish.  Apart from that, there is no return made of such birth from such source.  The position is, therefore, that such information as is procurable is incomplete for the purpose of this Bill and, secondly, for a certain very important provision in this Bill, we are relying upon the officials of a British Department to supply statistics and information and these, when supplied, are, as I have indicated, very incomplete in their nature for the purpose of this Bill.</P>
    <P>That is not exactly in accord with the status which we have been claiming and which this Bill ostensibly aims at securing, and I think that from what I have said it will be clear that it would be unwise to complete the Report Stage of this Bill to-day until the obvious hiatus or flaw in this provision is rectified.  For that definite and practical reason, and for the reason that I mentioned in the beginning, that in the light of the other Bill which relates to the provisions and purposes of this measure, other anomalies may be discovered, it would be desirable to rectify them before this Bill passes from this House, as this will be the last opportunity for amending the Bill.  I suggest that it is a sound line of action to pursue to allow this Bill to remain in the Seanad until the other Bill has made some practical progress in the other House. We can then see how far the Bill, as it will stand when the matter I have drawn attention to has been amended, will be efficient and workable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>The point raised by Senator Milroy reminds me of a debate at which I presided two nights ago at the Solicitors' Apprentices' Debating Society.  In that debate I pulled out of one hat the subject of debate and out of another the name of the apprentice who was to speak to it and, on the spur of the moment, he had to speak as best he could.  But first, listening to Senator Milroy, one thought that there might be something in the legal point he raised, particularly as we know from the debate on the last occasion that he was thoroughly conversant with the Merchant Shipping Act, an Act which is, <Col N="1204" /> I think, the longest in the Statute Book and the most difficult to understand. If you examine this section, I think you will find that the draftsman of this Bill had thought of and thought out the very question that is disturbing the mind of the Senator. So far as I can see, the position is this: a person born in an Irish ship is a natural born citizen of Saorstát Eireann.  The Merchant Shipping Act and the other Act&mdash;the Act of 1872, I think&mdash;to which the Senator has referred, provided for the case in which a child was born in a British ship.  The particulars must be entered in the log book, and when the captain comes to any port in the British Isles a communication has to be made to the registrar in London, and in the case of a person whose father is Irish that communication must be transmitted for registration in Dublin.  Do these arrangements not provide fully&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for the case set out in Section 2?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>This claims that all children born on a ship registered in Saorstát Eireann are Irish-born citizens but the return of the information from London relates only to the child of an Irish-born father.  With regard to others, there is no information at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>The ships that are registered in Saorstát Eireann are very few.  We know them and we know the masters.  Look at Section 2. It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The following persons shall be natural-born citizens of Saorstát Eireann, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(c)  every person who was born on or after the 6th day of December, 1922, and before the date of the passing of this Act in a ship registered in Saorstát Eireann, and</P>
      <P>(d)  every person who is born on or after the date of the passing of this Act in a ship registered in Saorstát Eireann, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1205" /> Let us deal with (c).  The Senator is afraid that there would be no account taken of a child born in such a ship, but in the Acts of Parliament which he has cited to the House, which are enactments dealing with the Free State and made laws of the Free State, he has the machinery for finding out such a person.  The name of that person must go to London and must be transmitted to Dublin, and in that way you will have in the Registry here in Dublin the name of the person born in the Irish ship.  If I am wrong in that, I am open to correction. Then comes</P>
    <P>(e)  every person who was born outside Saorstát Eireann on or after the 6th day of December, 1922, and before the date of the passing of this Act and whose father was, on the day of such person's birth, a citizen of Saorstát Eireann&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Milroy was not referring to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am bound to point out that the nationality in that case followed the citizenship of the father. Then we come to</P>
      <P>(f)  subject to the subsequent provisions of this section, every person who is born outside Saorstát Eireann on or after the date of the passing of this Act and whose father was, on the day of such person's birth, a citizen of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now looking rapidly through these questions we find that in Section 2 at all events, the nationality of the child follows the citizenship of the father. Without knowing anything as to how this section came to be drafted, I think that the section is drawn with a thorough knowledge by the draftsman of the legislation already in existence with reference to the registration of the birth of children born on board ship.  It would be a very serious error if a thing like that were omitted, and I do not see how a draftsman could complete the drafting of a Bill without the case of a child born on board ship having been brought to his mind and having been dealt with by him.  It is <Col N="1206" /> rather late in the day for Senator Milroy to spring on this House a question like that where we have not the statutes before us.  But I think the House may take it that the Bill, which has been subjected in the Dáil and in the Seanad to the close scrutiny to which this Bill has been subjected, is now as perfect as we could make it. This Bill has been closely scrutinised and in the case of ordinary legislation coming before this House, when we have done our best so far as lies in our power to consider the various clauses of the Bill and to examine the amendments and objections made to it, what we usually do, and the right and proper thing to do, is to pass the Bill and leave it to fortune afterwards. That is what we do in respect to other Bills.  I do not see why we should, in regard to this Bill, cast an aspersion upon it, upon ourselves and upon the Dáil by the suggestion that would be involved in the hanging up of this Bill in apprehension of some terrific blunders that may be found out in it afterwards.</P>
    <P>There is another point made by Senator Milroy.  He said there is an Aliens Bill coming on and he asks why should we not hold up this Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill until we are dealing with the Aliens Bill. Something, he says, may occur to us in our discussion on the Aliens Bill that would affect our opinion in regard to this Bill.  Now the two things are as much separated from each other as right is from left.  They are in separate watertight compartments and they have no relation whatever to each other.  I would ask the Senator not to hold up this Bill.  I accept fully what Senator Milroy says that he is not actuated by any desire to obstruct this measure.  I quite accept that.  But I think his reading of the 500 sections of the Merchant Shipping Act and the other Acts to which he referred has puzzled him somewhat.  These Acts are even puzzling me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelStaines" hpid="Mr. Staines Mr. Staines">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Comyn has misunderstood Senator Milroy altogether. There is no intention on this side of the House to hold up the Bill, and I did not hear Senator Milroy saying any <Col N="1207" /> thing that would suggest that.  The Senator asked a very straight question. He made reference to two or three points.  One point in which I am interested is this:&mdash;We all know that if a child is born on a British registered boat or ship, that that child is properly registered as, and under ordinary law becomes, a British citizen or British National&mdash;call it what you like.  The point that Senator Milroy raised has not been answered by Senator Comyn. This is the point I would like the President to answer:&mdash;Supposing a child were born on an Irish registered ship, where is that child to be registered? Is it at Ringsend, or at Howth, or with the Registrar-General in Dublin, and does that registration confer Irish nationality?  Incidentally, this Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill has brought us into the nationality of ships and shipping.  A Dublin citizen, Senator Milroy's brother, stated yesterday that there were two lines of Saorstát Shipping&mdash;the Saorstát Continental Steamship Company and the Limerick Steamship Company.  Now that is a statement made by a very responsible man.  I rang up a man this morning who is interested in Dublin shipping and he gave me a whole lot of other lines that he says are registered in the Saorstát.  He mentioned the L.M.S. and two or three other companies. Now I want to know are these Irish registered or British registered. That is what a good many of us want to know.  Would one not like to know whether his child, if born on a ship, is to be registered as an Irish citizen or as a British subject?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember in the old days crossing to Holyhead and Liverpool, and on coming back during the war time, we were always asked our nationality and I always said Irish. The man who asked the question said &ldquo;British,&rdquo; I said &ldquo;Irish.&rdquo;  Eventually, they got so much into the idea they did not ask your nationality.  They simply said &ldquo;British,&rdquo; and you said you were Irish.  I remember one evening saying &ldquo;No, I am not British, I am Irish.&rdquo;  I had not got much choice in <Col N="1208" /> the matter.  The man's answer to me was &ldquo;British,&rdquo; and he shoved me up the gangway.  There was no good fighting the question out with him. Are our ships Irish or British?  If a child is born on one of our Irish-registered boats, is that child Irish or British?</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. Gogarty Dr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one serious omission from this Bill and it is this: that there is no clause precluding an Irish-born citizen from being at the same time a citizen of another country.  This question was raised in 1916.  Of what country was the President a citizen in 1916; of what country is he now a citizen, and when did he become a citizen of that country? That is what we would like to know. If there is to be a retreat out of the country in times of stress and perhaps in times of non-stress, we would want to know if this precludes us from citizenship in another country.  We have heard something about Irishmen abroad coming home, but it is far more likely that the riff-raff of Europe will come over here and become, under these easy stages, citizens of Saorstát Eireann.  It is only fair now that if there is to be citizenship given it ought to be given without having a sort of back door to it.  This aspect of the matter is to my mind a very important one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure, Sir, that Senator Milroy has not raised a very important question on this Bill.  It would be a pity, if he is right, that the Bill should pass this Stage without <Col N="1209" /> our having some opportunity of looking further into it and of seeing if it really is what I am inclined to think it is, a serious point.  Under the Bill as it stands, every person born on a ship registered in Saorstát Eireann will become an Irish citizen but there is no machinery for that in this country.  A child born on a British ship whose father is Irish, under the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act will, I think&mdash;that is my recollection of it&mdash;be duly registered in the office of the Registrar-General in London and I think the office of the Registrar-General in London is bound to communicate with the office of the Registrar-General here because the child's father was Irish and would naturally search here for the registration of his child's birth.  In the case of a child who is born on a ship registered in Saorstát Eireann, it does not matter where he comes from, that makes him a citizen of this State, but there is no machinery, I am afraid, in this Bill to provide for the compulsory registration of that kind of birth. If that is so, I think we ought not pass this Stage of the Bill to-day.  I may say that I blame myself somewhat for not noticing this point before, but I have not had time to look into it and I am speaking more or less from recollection of my knowledge of the Merchant Shipping Act.  The President will recognise that it may be a serious flaw in the Bill that we cannot carry out what all of us desire that we should be able to carry out.</P>

      <P>I submit that the same conditions will apply to a Saorstát registered ship.  The obligation will be on the captain of the ship to record the <Col N="1210" /> event on his log and notify the authorities. I do not see anything very much in the point at all.  I understand that under the Merchant Shipping Act, the captain is bound to keep a log and the captain and the owners are responsible for conveying information of such an event to the proper authority.  I presume that in the case of a ship registered in the Saorstát, the same obligations would apply to the captain.</P>

      <P>There appears to be a good deal of confusion of thought here and I attempted to intervene earlier to point it out.  We are not registering every person or we are not making provision that every person, who may be a natural-born citizen, should have his birth registered here. It is only in particular cases that we are making provision for the registration of certain facts, in this case the fact of birth.  There will be quite a number of natural-born citizens born outside the country.  We are not making provision for the registration of their births but I take it they will have to prove the facts that will enable them to claim that privilege.  The same thing is true of a birth on a ship.  If a child is born on a ship, and wants to claim the privileges of citizenship here, the person who claims Irish citizenship for the child, or the child himself when he becomes an adult, will have to prove the facts.  What the Senator seems to think is that we should provide a means by which a person can prove this fact. There is no difficulty in proving such a fact at the present time, as far as I understand.  We would have to make very strange provisions indeed if we had to provide a means whereby a person born of Irish parents in a country or a district where there was no register of births could prove the fact of birth.  Some other means would have to be adopted to prove the fact that the person was born outside Ireland of Irish parentage.  I think the point is not germane to this Bill at all. It might come into a Merchant Shipping Bill, and I understand there is one being drafted at present, or to some other type of Bill.  It is not necessary to provide for it in this Bill and it <Col N="1211" /> is not a flaw in the Bill that such provision is not made in it.  I think Senators are talking beside the point.</P>

      <P>Might I put a question? I think what Senator Milroy is arguing is that under this Bill we should give equal chances by proper registration of birth to children born on a ship to become Irish Free State citizens, as under the Merchant Shipping Act the British child has to become a British citizen.  That seems to me to be the point after listening to the debate, that equal protection should be afforded to children who desire to be Irish Free State citizens as under the present law, under the Merchant Shipping Act, is given to the British child.  That seems to be the hiatus in this Bill.  I have been listening quietly to the discussion and I cannot see that anything has been said which would prove that there is as good protection under this Bill for future Irish citizens as there is for the British child who is born on a British ship.  If any of these provisions are missing, there is not the same protection on an Irish ship as there is on a British ship for either an Irish or a British citizen.  That seems to be the hiatus.  The point does seem to be of importance, that future Irish citizens should have as good protection as a Britisher.  This Bill should make that perfectly clear.</P>

If a ship registered in Saorstát Eireann carries with <Col N="1212" /> it the obligations to the Saorstát that a ship registered in Britain has to Britain, then I think no question arises at all except&mdash;and I think this is the idea behind Senator Milroy's suggestion&mdash;that notwithstanding the obligation upon the shipping master, there have been no means adopted whereby a shipping master's duty can be fulfilled.  If there is a means whereby that Irish shipping master can notify the fact of births on his ship, I do not think any question arises at all, because the Irish ship has to do to the Irish authorities what the British ship has to do to the British authorities.  If that is so, surely no question arises.</P>

      <P>I simply want to repeat once more that the matter that has been raised in this connection is a matter for the registration of births and is not properly germane to this Nationality Bill.  It is a matter that might be raised if the Merchant Shipping Act or some measure of the kind were before the Seanad but it is not germane to this Bill.  If the Seanad so wishes, there is no reason why the Fifth Stage of this Bill should not be postponed but I think it is better to finish the present Stage.  We shall have the Aliens Bill and the Bill to amend the Constitution before the Seanad in a short time and if there is any desire on the part of Senators to keep the Final Stage of this Bill over until then, I have no objection. With regard to amendments, in any human work which is left over, you will always find opportunity for amendment. Anybody who has written anything and put it aside realises that, when taken up again, something is always found that can be amended.  A reasonable time has been given to the consideration of this Bill and the only thing to do is, as Senator Comyn suggested, to enact it and, if any flaws are then disclosed, they can be repaired by an Amending Bill.  It is desirable to foresee all the defects possible but there is always power of amendment if some point has not been foreseen.</P>

      <P>I mentioned two Acts. The provisions are very similar in both.  The Registration of Births and Deaths Act, of 1874, provides that where a birth occurs on a British ship&mdash; as things stand, that would include a ship registered in Saorstát Eireann&mdash; the captain is bound to return the particulars to the Registrar-General of Shipping and Seamen upon the arrival of the ship at any port of the United Kingdom.  Where it appears that the father of any child so born or, if the child was illegitimate, the mother was Scotch or Irish, the Registrar-General of Shipping and Seamen is required to send a certified copy of so much of the return as relates to the birth to the Registrar-General of Births and Deaths in Scotland or Ireland, as the case may be.  There is no provision in existence to make the master of Irish-registered shipping craft fulfil the same requirements towards the Irish authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to put a point to the Minister which it is not necessary he should deal with here.  It will be aufficient if he deals with it elsewhere.  A similar matter was raised last week but, since then, communications have been received from the boatmen who have been employed in previous years by the Lax Weir Company.  They are in a very great difficulty and their minds are perturbed by a communication received on 9th January.  That communication stated: &ldquo;I received your letter in connection with the coming fishing season and very much regret to state that I heard definitely yesterday the Lax Weir will not work this coming season.  Should this decision be altered, which is unlikely, I shall convey the information to you.&rdquo;  On the 4th February they were further informed that &ldquo;the Lax Weir Company would not work the water.&rdquo;  The boatmen asked if they would be allowed to fish the weir themselves and they were told that they would not but that it would be protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I understand the position from what the Minister said last week, but it is very important for the peace <Col N="1215" /> of mind of these men that they should know where they stand.  It appears that the Lax Weir Company is not going to work the fishing this year.  We do not know when the property of the Lax Weir Company will be taken over by the Electricity Supply Board.  Even if it is taken over forthwith after the passage of this Act there will be at least two but more likely six or seven weeks' wages lost by these men, which may seem a very small matter to the Electricity Supply Board, but which is of very great importance to the men concerned.  If the property is not taken over for six months, then the provisions of the Bill will be of no use whatever to these men, because the open fishing season immediately preceding the acquisition will have passed and these men will not have been employed.  I assume that the intention is that the Lax weir will be acquired by the Electricity Supply Board almost at once, but every week's delay makes a difference in the earnings of these men.  It is desirable that the Minister should make a public statement of what his will is in this matter and that the Electricity Supply Board should also make a statement of their intentions in regard to these men, who are at present being deprived of employment.  They ought to have begun their fishing on the 1st February, but they are at present idle and there is no prospect of their being re-employed for some weeks, at all events. They are losing their earnings and they do not know what their fate will be in the next six months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill gives the Electricity Supply Board a magnificent national asset, namely, the waters of the River Shannon and the fisheries of the Shannon.  And the object of this measure is to protect these fisheries, to preserve them, and to develop them to the greatest possible degree.  That is a very laudable object, and, in order to carry out that object, I think it is necessary that there should be unification of control.  Now we are valuing the security of those fisheries and their value, at a very low estimate, is £5,000,000.  In that connection I would <Col N="1216" /> like to mention that, under the jurisdiction of the fishery conservators of the Shannon, there is a river with magnificent gravel patches and a wonderful spawning ground, with lakes for the fish to lie in.  This is the Inagh River in the County Clare.  But fish cannot come up that river because a very inexpensive work has not been done.  I applied, during the régime of the last Government, to have a salmon pass erected in the river at Ennistymon. It was refused, I suppose, because I advocated it.  I hope it will be carried through by the present Administration.</P>

    <P>What applies here will also cover amendments Nos. 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 19.  As I think I pointed out when the Second Reading of this Bill was before the House, the Bill originated on the recommendations of a private committee that was set up by the then Minister for Justice, to go into the Report which was known as the Carrigan Report.  That committee considered all aspects of the case.  There were legal men on that committee who had experience of the difficulties that had to be contended with in cases that were likely to arise under this Bill. The Bill went before the Dáil as an agreed measure.  Certain amendments were moved by various Deputies but when the position was examined these amendments were withdrawn, <Col N="1217" /> and none were insisted on other than those that were agreed on by the joint committee.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is desirable to have any very long discussion upon a Bill of this sort, and I hope I shall be forgiven by the House for not going into details as to the reasons that prompted the Committee in arriving at the conclusions they did.  I suggest that this Bill is, to some extent, an experimental measure.  It is only when it has been in operation for some time that we will be in the position, perhaps, to see its defects, if there are such defects, and to provide remedies if remedies are required.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the point of view put forward by the Minister in this matter.  This is not a political Bill and, therefore, we do not need to bring any political considerations into it.  The Government has the means of studying these matters, getting information and reports that Private Deputies and Senators have not.  Personally my view is that as the Bill cannot be discussed in detail, the wisest course that Deputies and Senators could take in the matter would be to accept the view that the measure will be carefully considered by the Government and that they will do what is best with it having regard to all the considerations that arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">

      <P>I accept in spirit the general lines taken up by the Minister, but while accepting the spirit of what the Minister said I do not think that the course he proposes is necessary having regard to the circumstances. This is not a Party measure.  It is not a measure on which there is any strong difference of opinion.  It originated as a result of joint action, by agreement. When this House received the measure it appointed a committee.  The Minister did not then put forward the views that he has stated now.  The committee discussed the matter and with one exception they were unanimous in making certain suggestions.  These were agreed just as the original proposal came before the House.  I am not at all satisfied that some measure of agreement with regard to some of the <Col N="1218" /> suggestions made by the committee would not be found in the Dáil if this measure was sent back to them.  I do not want a lot of discussion but I, for one, though strongly in favour of some of these proposals, would not for a moment think of holding up the Bill or going in for anything in the nature of public discussion or wrangling over any of the amendments.  For instance, I mentioned amendment No. 20.  I think there is good reason for its wording.  I think the non-Party committee in the Dáil that originated it ought to have an opportunity of considering the amended wording suggested for Section 16.  The proposal to amend that as I understood came from an eminent lawyer, Senator Lynch.  The amendment was proposed by me, Senator Lynch accepted it and we agreed.  My point is, there is a suggestion that met with approval of all Parties in this House.  It seems to me, if you send it back that there are one or two matters which, without unnecessary discussion, might be dealt with by the Dáil.  We want this Bill, which to a large extent is experimental, passed.</P>

I, more than anybody else probably, do not wish to see this Bill held up.  I congratulate the Minister and the Government on bringing it forward. I believe that it has been too long delayed, and anything we can do to hasten its passing into law we certainly shall do.  However, when we come to No. 14 I shall have something to say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join Senator Blythe in asking the House to <Col N="1219" /> take the long view with regard to this particular measure.  It has been stated by the Minister that this Bill is the result of the deliberations of a representative committee of all parties that was set up in the Dáil to consider a question of great urgency and of great importance in this country.  The committee was presided over by the Minister for Justice in the last Government and there were representatives of all Parties on the committee.  They had before them the report of the Carrigan Commission and they went very fully into all the particulars with regard to the matters that have to be considered under this Bill.  That committee, after an exchange of views, an examination of important witnesses, and an examination of all the documents and reports dealing with the particular matters contained in and dealt with in this Bill, arrived at a unanimous decision.  The unanimous decision was what is contained in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee's recommendation was sent to the Government and the Government produced this Bill.  The Bill went before the Dáil, and the members of the Dáil, to their credit, decided to accept the Bill that had been drafted and prepared in the committee as a unanimous decision of this very representative committee of the members of the Dáil.  The present Minister for Justice considered, and the Government considered, and I think rightly, that in the public interest and in the interest of all concerned it would not be advisable to have a public discussion on the details of this Bill if it could be avoided.  The members of the Dáil agreed to that and the Bill was passed through all its stages without any amendment whatever.  The Bill has now come to this House and, as the Minister says, it is an experimental measure.  If, after the Bill becomes law and when it comes into operation, any amendments are found necessary, then the Oireachtas can amend the legislation.  I join with Senator Blythe in asking the members of the House to accept the Bill in the same spirit in which the members of the <Col N="1220" /> Dáil accepted it.  There were members of all parties and all persuasions in the Dáil who considered this Bill in committee, and all the matters that can be dealt with here were considered in committee with expert advice on them.  The result of their deliberations was this particular Bill, and I do not think that the Minister or the Government are asking too much of this House in asking that this Bill be accepted as an experimental Bill.  When the Bill becomes law and has been in operation for some time, if any defects are discovered it would then be very easy to amend the Bill at a later stage.  I, therefore, join with Senator Blythe in asking the House to accept this Bill and pass it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the effect of this argument.  This Bill has been referred to as an experimental Bill, but every Bill or every Act is experimental. I am concerned, in this case, with the method of asking the House to say &ldquo;ditto&rdquo; to what the Government said on the advice of a committee of members of the Dáil. Apparently, this House has been entirely ignored and it is assumed that the House will do whatever the Government said.  Of course, it was under the regime of the last Government that the Committee of members of the Dáil was <Col N="1221" /> formed.  All the information may have been before that committee, but no information is before this House.  That aspect of it, I think, is important, because we are really dealing with a social evil of enormous importance&mdash;probably, from the way the matter is talked about, of very much greater importance than some of us imagine.  Yet, we are asked to deal with such a subject without any information whatever.  That is to say, the Government, in the words of Senator Blythe, are in a better position to know the facts than any private member, and, therefore, they come along and say &ldquo;Do this&rdquo;, and we do it without question.</P>

      <P>I do not know that what Senator Johnson has said is exactly a just representation of the case.  I am in favour of this measure on its merits. I think that the terms of the Bill are better than the terms of the amendments, and that is the reason I am in favour of passing the proposal now before the House without further discussion.</P>

      <P>As Chairman of the Special Committee appointed by this House, I think it is right that I should say a few words, because I feel that the Minister has put the House and the committee that was appointed by this House in a very false position.  Neither the House nor the committee had any idea of the attitude which the Minister has assumed here to-day and which has been backed up by Senators on this side of the House.  We had no idea of the attitude that the Government were going to take about this Bill and that this House was not to be allowed to consider a single amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I venture to say that if that had been known when the Second Reading of this Bill was under consideration here and was passed, the House would never have thought of appointing a committee.  Why, it would have been merely a farce, and the members of the committee itself&mdash;speaking for myself, and I am sure I am also speaking for every other member of the committee&mdash;would have declined to act on a committee of that kind and with those limitations. <Col N="1222" /> I think that this is not the way that the House ought to be treated in connection with this matter.</P>

Surely it is not suggested that I could have exercised control in any way to prevent the House from going into that matter.  It was a matter entirely for the members of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I was ordered abroad and I was abroad when the Second Reading of this Bill came before the House and when the Committee was appointed.  It does seem a most extraordinary thing that at that time the Government did not say what they intended to do.  Apparently a great deal is being made in the whole of this discussion of the constitution of the Dáil committee.  They represented every section of political and religious feeling, etc., and, therefore, they were such a splendid committee that there was to be no party discussion on the subject matter of the Bill.  In connection with a Bill of this kind, I believe that was absolutely the best policy that could possibly have been adopted and it was undoubtedly the policy which the Seanad followed.  Believing that they should also look into the matter, they appointed an absolutely non-political lot of Senators to look into it and to advise them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the whole situation is reversed. What we are hearing to-day has nothing to do with non-party considerations. It is a distinct order from the Government that the amendments suggested by our committee, a committee which would never have sat if they thought they were going to be treated in this way, are to be put out because the Government do not want them.  Would it not have been much <Col N="1223" /> better for the Government to keep to the non-party principle?  Both the Seanad and the Dáil have kept to it, and the Government should have allowed the same principle to be carried through to the end.  What harm would it do to the Dáil to see what a totally non-party committee from the Seanad has to say about the Bill?  There may be something good in these amendments. We as a Seanad sitting here are not to hear a word about them.  They are to be put out because discussion is not to be allowed publicly on the subject with which the Bill deals.  I lived for a long time in the Victorian age and the greatest blot on the Victorian age was its refusal to discuss facts when people thought there was something indecent or immoral or something else about them.  Surely we ought not to do that now.</P>
    <P>It is nonsense to come here and say we are not to discuss this and that when practically every child in the country knows every single thing about it.  We are told here that we are totally to ignore the opinions of the Seanad Committee.  The other committee was a purely non-party committee set up to advise the Government. The Seanad, without any warning that they were to be treated in a different manner from what, under ordinary circumstances, they would expect, appointed a committee to advise them.  We are told now that we are not to have that advice and we are not to discuss it.  Each of these amendments is to be brought in and if they are passsed by the votes of the House the Seanad are to hear nothing more about them.  Is it a wise thing?  I wonder at the Government doing it.</P>
    <P>We are dealing here with a very big question.  There is a lot of talk about secrecy.  We have dealt with the matter as quietly as we could by appointing two committees.  I believe if there were not such restrictions as we are now talking about, a great number of Senators would follow the committee and take their advice.  I have no doubt if these amendments went to the Dáil in the same way, and <Col N="1224" /> there was nothing said from the party point of view by the Government, a great number of the Dáil members would see there was a great deal of sense in what our committee have recommended.  I dare say there are some of the amendments of a highly debatable character, but there is a good deal of commonsense in a lot of them and I can quite easily see many members of the Dáil, if they are left free, agreeing with a great deal of what our committee have put forward.</P>
    <P>It is most regrettable that the Government should now come in and take an important measure like this out of the hands of the people who are dealing with it from an entirely non-party point of view.  They say &ldquo;We disapprove of this.  We will agree to every one of these amendments and have no more discussions about them, because the subject is a difficult one to deal with in public.&rdquo;  I have heard a good deal of humbug in my time, but it is an absolutely horrible principle to bring forward that where a matter is difficult and doubtful, and so on, we are not to debate it.  Why, in the worst part of the Victorian times, they could not have done anything worse.</P>

I have no hesitation in saying here that the overwhelming majority of this House will support the Government and turn down the amendments suggested by this committee. I fully agree with the last speaker that the details of this measure are not known to the public and the less that is known about it the better.  The public, perhaps, know too much and I think in connection with a measure of this sort the Government deserve very great credit for tackling the problem.  When they are satisfied that they have a measure capable of dealing with the subject they are quite right in having it put into law as soon as possible.  I desire to support the Government in the action they have taken.</P>

On the other hand, perhaps it might be much better to discuss it in public rather than to have the newspapers publishing letters.  My objection to having it discussed here is not so much because of the people here or in the gallery.  My point is that it will be published in the papers and when the papers publish letters in connection with this thing I think they are doing wrong, and I think we are wrong in discussing the Bill publicly to-day.</P>

      <P>There is one thing I would like to point out as a member of the Committee.  I do not know whether you have studied the amendments. I think if the House studied the amendments that the Special Committee have brought in they would find that instead of not strengthening the <Col N="1226" /> Government, every amendment we have brought in will tend to strengthen the Government's hands.  We have gone further even than the Government in helping to put down the evils which are in our midst.  There was only one particular amendment on which the majority of the Committee differed from the Government, and when we come to that it is time enough to discuss the reasons why we differed from the Government on that particular matter.  I think that when the reasons are known the House will find that they are fairly common sense ones.</P>

      <P>There is an important aspect, as regards age, in this amendment. The age in Great Britain and in Northern Ireland, and formerly here, was 13 in a case of indecent assault, but, in 1922, the age was raised in Great Britain to 16, and in 1923 it was raised in Northern Ireland to 16.  Now we are going, on the advice of experts, to try to have the age raised to 18, but the Government wants to put the age back to 15, as was the case in the original Bill. That means that we are to be open to the reproach that we are giving less protection to our young girls than the Governments of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and we may have the strange case occurring that a girl on this side of the border can be assaulted at 15 while a girl on the other side of the border will be protected until she is 16.  The Minister might compromise and leave the age at least 17, and let us with all our posing about chivalry, modesty and all the rest, show that it is not mere hypocrisy.  It is certainly a most retrograde step to try to put the age back to 15, and I ask the House to support the Committee or, at least, to leave the matter so that the law will be the same as it is in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  The Minister might compromise and make the age 17.</P>

      <P>Section 14 reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>It shall not be a defence to a charge of indecent assault upon a person under the age of fifteen years to prove that such person consented to the act alleged to constitute such indecent assault.</P>
      <P>Of course, Senator Miss Browne has no knowledge of the cases that come before the court, and of the defences that are made in cases of this kind. I have considerable experience of the kind of defence that is made in a case such as is proposed to be dealt with in the section.</P>
      <P>I have never yet seen a successful defence made by a man who admitted that he committed the deed and yet tried to escape on the ground that the other party was a consenting party.  So that, in point of fact, there is very little practical substance in the contention put forward by Senator Miss Browne, although theoretically Senators might think that there was.  It has been very well put by her, but, practically speaking, the accused person scarcely even puts forward the defence of consent.  If ill-advised enough to put it forward, then in my experience and so far as I can remember I have never known such a defence to succeed.  Therefore, I think that in respect to this section the Minister has adopted a wise course.  It is right and proper that the law in regard to offences against girls should be as severe as it can possibly be made, but legislators must consider also this: it is desirable, where a guilty person comes before the court, that he shall not escape, and where an innocent person comes before the court that he shall be found not guilty.  If you make laws too severe you defeat your own purpose.  You cannot travel faster in these matters than a jury is prepared to go.  It would be a disaster if legislation was framed so unreasonably that juries would not convict in proper cases because then a guilty person would be escaping.</P>

    <P>I think it was wise of the Seanad, by the vote which it gave a short time ago, to support the Government on the sections up to Section 14 and to make no changes.  It represents a wise middle course.  As the Minister said, this is <Col N="1232" /> only experimental and it can be altered.  The age limit can be raised as soon as the public conscience admits of its being raised.  The Seanad is perfectly at liberty to make any decision it likes on the amendments that are now before it.  Senators can discuss all these sections and vote on them according to their sound judgment. There is no compulsion on the Seanad in any way whatever, but when a Bill like this, dealing with a most important and difficult subject, comes before the House I think the proper thing would be to look at it fairly and as a whole. If Senators see that the general provisions of the Bill meet with their approval, then I say let them pass it.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been drafted after long inquiry and investigation.  The age of 15 is not put down there in the interests of a guilty man.  It is put there in the interests of justice&mdash;to see that the guilty man gets punished.  Therefore, I think that Section 14 ought to be passed without any amendment.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to speak on this particular section, but in view of what Senator Comyn has said I would like to say that I personally agree with the point of view taken by Senator Miss Browne: that the object of the Committee in extending the age was because they believed it was desirable to provide the extra extension. I would like also to say that the two lawyers on the Committee&mdash;Senator Lynch and Senator Brown&mdash;supported the amendment, so that apparently there are lawyers who in this case differ from Senator Comyn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree that we ought not to discuss the amendments that are really the same as amendment No. 1, because we have already come to a decision on that.  We are now dealing with Section 14, and the object of this amendment is to strike out the recommendation made by the Special Committee to that section.  I think this section is one of the worst things in the Bill.  When I first read the Bill and saw that the age of consent had been put at 15 I thought that was due to a mistake or to a misprint. I have not had as much experience <Col N="1233" /> in cases of this kind as Senator Comyn, but I have had a very large experience of young people.  I am absolutely convinced that a child of 15 in this country, a little girl, is not nearly as old as a girl of the same age living in either England or Northern Ireland, and that we are depriving such a child of the protection that this measure would give her if the age were put at 18.  I am not very keen about 18 myself, but I think 17 would be quite fair.  I would urge on the Seanad not to be carried away by the result of the last division, but to deal with this particular amendment on its merits.</P>

It strikes me that somebody, in order to get at the Committee that considered this Bill, has dealt with its recommendations in a wholesale manner.  There is no possible doubt in my mind that the Government are making a very serious mistake as regards the action they are taking so far as the age in this particular section is concerned.  I would like to hear them justify their attitude on this section.</P>

      <P>This is an amendment which is of considerable importance.  It deals with a matter which should not be allowed to go simply by default.  This particular section deals generally with the offence of solicitation, and it then penalises the persons of one sex who are described as prostitutes.  I have held the belief for a long time that this particular offence should not be confined to one sex.  I have evidence that persons of my own sex are a source of trouble at the present time. I want them caught under the Bill. I believe the section which was put in in committee provides for &ldquo;every person who in a street or public place solicits or importunes any person of the opposite sex for an immoral purpose,&rdquo; and so on, is a much more just way of dealing with it.  Not alone that, but it is peculiarly necessary to the circumstances here. I could speak at length on this matter. We discussed it at considerable length in committee and the new section which we accepted as an amendment was proposed by me with the addition of some words inserted by Senator Lynch which were a definite improvement. There is a principle involved which I hope this Bill will support.</P>

I was at a meeting of workmen, and some of the workmen afterwards were discussing the general conditions with which this Bill deals.  Some of them happen to be men who work for the Corporation at night and they emphatically mentioned a grievous evil that was prevalent in this city&mdash;men with motorcars moving around at a slow pace in certain of the thoroughfares and enticing girls into the cars.  That evil will be met by the clause that was accepted in committee but not by the amendment proposed by the Government.</P>

It is a great evil.  But why not legislate for that evil?  Why not introduce an apt amendment to deal with this evil?  Here is an amendment that has been spoken to by Senator Johnson.  It goes too far. The new section proposed in the Government amendment is much better.  Let me read for the House the amendment advocated by Senator Johnson:&mdash;</P>
      <P>16.&mdash;(1)  Every person who in any street or public place solicits or importunes any person of the opposite sex for an immoral purpose shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall on summary conviction thereof be liable in the case of a first conviction of such offence to a fine not exceeding two pounds or at the discretion of the court to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both such fine and imprisonment, or in the case of a second or any subsequent conviction of such offence to a fine not exceeding five pounds or at the discretion of the court to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
      <P>(2)  No person shall be convicted of any offence under this section upon the evidence of one witness unless such witness is corroborated in some material particular by evidence implicating the person charged with such offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  The Probation of Offenders Act, 1907, shall apply to offences under this section as if the words &ldquo;or to the prospects of the moral reclamation of the person or persons charged&rdquo; were inserted in sub-section (1) of Section 1 of that Act <Col N="1238" /> immediately before the words &ldquo;it is inexpedient to inflict any punishment.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Every person who in a street or public place solicits or importunes any person of the opposite sex or in an adjacent street or public place, for an immoral purpose, shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall on summary conviction thereof be liable in the case of a first conviction of such offence to a fine not exceeding two pounds or at the discretion of the court to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both such fine and imprisonment, or, in the case of a second or any subsequent conviction of such offence, to a fine not exceeding five pounds or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both such fine and imprisonment.</P>
      <P>That is sub-section (1).  Sub-section (2) states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>No person shall be convicted of any offence under this section upon the evidence of one witness unless such witness is corroborated in some material particular by evidence inplicating the person charged with such offence.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (3) states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Probation of Offenders Act shall apply to offences under this section...</P>
      <P>Sub-section (4) reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;street&rdquo; in this section includes any highway, road, lane, footway, square, court, alley or passage, whether a thoroughfare or not, and the word &ldquo;place&rdquo; includes any public park or garden or any uninclosed ground to which the public have unrestricted access, and each of such words include a motor car, carriage or any other vehicle on the street or public place, as the case may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the whole of Section 16.  I say that there are only three lines of that section that are reasonable, and these <Col N="1240" /> are the last three lines, that &ldquo;place&rdquo; shall include a motor car, carriage, or other vehicle.  My argument is this: if you want to deal with these gentlemen and to punish these people who use motor cars for the purpose of vice and seduction, deal with them in a section about which there will be no mistake.  I do not mind how heavy you make the punishment and juries will not mind it either, but when you mix provisions of this sort with the foregoing sub-section I object to the form of it.  I object to the form of sub-section (1).  I ask you in your own good judgment to consider this pro-provision: &ldquo;Every person who in any street or public place solicits or importunes any person of the opposite sex or in an adjacent street or public place.&rdquo;  Suppose I were a judge or a magistrate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In the first place, the section is too sweeping.  I was going to say that in drafting it something was forgotten.  What I would say is that the section proposed to be deleted should be deleted and the section which it is proposed to insert, and which I read first, should be inserted. It goes far enough for what I might call a preliminary, for a measure which introduces a new kind of legislation, which is experimental to a certain degree.  When this legislation is working for a little while and when the public conscience and juries follow it to the full extent, then you can tighten the screw if you like but at present it is too wide.

      <P>There is just one word which I should like to say.  I am convinced that if this proposal of Senator Douglas, which came before the Select Committee, were adopted there would be very little use in passing a Bill at all for the purpose.  It would be absolutely unworkable.  We know that from the experience of the police here in Dublin.  There is first the proposal that the police must prove when they are prosecuting one of these people that they were soliciting for an immoral purpose, and as well as that, they must have corroboration. The experience of the police here in the city is that it would be quite difficult enough to deal with it without these conditions.  The proposal put forward here, we are convinced, will render the section absolutely unworkable considering the difficulties we have had to meet up to the present. Mention has been made of motor cars, but these people can be dealt with even as the law stands at present, for insulting behaviour and so on.  From what we know in the Department from the police, we are convinced that you are putting difficulties in their way by this amendment and you are making it absolutely impossible for them to deal with that branch of the evil, anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. Gogarty Dr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Comyn asked me what my feeling would be if I were asked whether a house in a street was adjacent to a street.  I really find myself in this matter in agreement with the Government, who have, for once, shown some commonsense. When &ldquo;street&rdquo; or &ldquo;place&rdquo; can be construed as any car, carriage or vehicle it is time that this orgy of <Col N="1242" /> mock virtue was punctured.  Is a man to have no privacy or no liberty?  We are told that in England a man's house is his castle, but apparently under the proposed section of the committee, a man's wheelbarrow is an open street.  One evening I went down to Ardenza, Blackrock, and I sat in my car.  Of course, the thought of anybody communing with himself in a car never occurred to our police and they shot an electric torch on me to see who was in the car.  Of course, they were greatly disappointed.  Zeal very often may overtake commonsense in these matters.  The Irish people are sometimes presumed to be a &ldquo;bull&rdquo; making and ludicrous people and when a hand-barrow can be a street or anything else, it certainly lends some colour to the presumption. I stand by the amendment, but, at the same time, I should like to have some definition of &ldquo;common prostitute.&rdquo; It seems to me that the proposed section places too much power in the hands of the police.  At their discretion, any woman who is found loitering can be arrested; but, again, the Minister balances that by saying that the Probation of Offenders Act shall apply in certain cases.  I am always anxious to strike a balance between too much power and too much discretion. It may well happen that if the police are given too much power some unfortunate woman may be victimised. There have been cases in towns in other countries in which women who were not <i>persona grata</i> with the police were put into a position of inferiority and in which a sort of blackmail was carried on.  Inasmuch as we have no registration of these women, such as is carried on in Berlin and other places, I think that the term &ldquo;common prostitute&rdquo; is one that is very difficult to define.  It is a matter altogether for the police to define.  I do not see how it can be done otherwise, unless it is held that once a woman has been convicted she might be held to be one.  I am with the Government in their attitude to this amendment, because I never heard before that a motor car was a front garden or a street.  Suppose you were out in Crumlin developing land for <Col N="1243" /> building purposes and you were handed over a wheelbarrow and told that that was the road, it would not be any more absurd than this amendment.</P>

As the Minister says, it would be quite impossible to get convictions under it, and if it were altered so as to make convictions possible, it would open the way to an enormous amount of blackmail.  I think that the Committee attempted a thing which would require a great deal more thought and care than they were able to give to it.</P>

      <P>I was Chairman of the Committee and had no opportunity, at the Committee, of expressing views on any of the sections or even of voting. Now that I am in the House, I wish to say that I consider that the amendment inserted by the Committee, instead of the original section, represents one of the most important things &mdash;if not the most important thing&mdash; done by the Committee.  Everybody who has any knowledge of what goes on in the country knows the position as regards these motor cars.  That has been recognised by virtually everybody who has spoken.  The only objection put forward is that the amendment would not be workable.  Senator Gogarty indulged in a great deal of humour as regards a motor car being <Col N="1244" /> described as a public place.  That is one of the commonest forms of legislative drafting.  A judge would have no difficulty in directing a jury on this section.  There would not be the slightest difficulty in court in working the section.</P>
      <P>I admit that Senator Gogarty is right when he says that there is no definition of the term &ldquo;common prostitute.&rdquo;  The phrase has been used in a great many Acts.  It is used in the Act which is operative in the City of Dublin.  It has never been defined, but the unfortunate class alluded to is well known to the police.  I should be very sorry to think that there was anything in the nature of blackmail in this city.  This class is a small one and is, fortunately, getting smaller every year.  It is not possible to have a definition, but I have not the slightest doubt as to the practicability of the amendment.  One of the strongest recommendations in the Carrigan Report which, through the courtesy of the Minister, Senators had an opportunity of reading, was that something should be done to prevent a continuance of this motor car scandal.  That is what has been carried out in this amendment.  I ask Senators not to be frightened by the jokes of my friend, Senator Gogarty, or by the suggestion of the Minister that the amendment would not work.  It would work perfectly well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Clarke</NameTxt>
      <P>I moved an amendment in the Special Committee to delete this from the Bill, and my reasons were very much misinterpreted in the Press. Perhaps that was why the Press did not get my reasons.  I am in perfect agreement with the Church and the State in the condemnation of the use of these things.  I think they cannot be condemned too strongly. But I am totally opposed to the Government's method of trying to deal with this crying evil.  I think in matters of this kind prohibition is the wrong method of dealing with them.  I have seen prohibition in another country where I lived, and I have seen the evil effects of it.  It was not prohibition in connection with these things, but it was prohibition that affected the individual and the action of individuals in the State.  After a certain time these individuals combined and they got up an organisation which outwitted the Government of the country in their efforts to enforce prohibition and brought that Government into contempt, and many evils developed out of it.  That country to-day if it got the chance again would never introduce prohibition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that prohibition in connection with this will work out in much the same way.  I believe you will drive the trading in and the use of these things into secret and illicit channels in which you will not be able to get after them.  You will not alone bring the State and the laws of <Col N="1248" /> the State into contempt by inserting prohibition in this Bill, but you will bring the Church and religion into contempt.  These are dangers which we really ought to look at and think of before passing such a clause.  I do think that if the Church and the State put their heads together they ought to be able to devise some means other than this clause for dealing with this evil.  We admit that if it grows to any extent in our country the reactions from it are going to be very terrible.  I cannot believe, however, that it is as bad as represented, because this is a Catholic country and if the laws of the Catholic Church prohibit the use of these things, well, then, I do not think we have really a terrible lot to fear. If you have prohibition, however, human nature is a peculiar thing, and the minute you prohibit anything the human being is inclined to rebel against it.  In the case of those who never had a desire to do a thing before, the fact that they are prohibited from doing it often creates a desire within them.  For these reasons I am totally opposed to this clause.  I think that there should be some other method by which we would be able to appeal to the higher and nobler and more spiritual side of the human being than that of prohibition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Allow these things into the country; allow them to be distributed far and wide and to be sold in every shop, and then go and appeal to the higher instincts of the people not to use them!  I am in favour of this clause.  In fact, I consider that it is more valuable than any other clause in the Bill.  I do not propose to argue this on religious grounds.  I propose to argue it on political grounds.  I say that the trade in these contraceptives would mean the destruction of this race, and it is on these grounds that I am in favour of this clause.  Not alone in this country but in all the countries of Europe the people who are charged with the government of the countries have expressed themselves as being thoroughly opposed to this trade in contraceptives because it is destructive of the race.  The argument is put forward that if you prohibit you will <Col N="1249" /> encourage, and we were cited the example of prohibition in America.  I hope that this prohibition will have public opinion behind it, and that is the difference between the prohibition in America and that proposed in this clause.  This prohibition meets with the thorough approval of this entire community.</P>
      <P>Another argument I would use is that the possession of the means of doing evil deeds makes ill deeds done, and I think that the Government are quite right in depriving young people of the means and the temptation to do evil deeds.  I will go farther and say that I do think that the introduction of this section and its defeat by you &mdash;of course, in the absurd supposition that you would defeat it&mdash;would be corrupting the youth of this country.</P>

      <P>As one who had to do with this matter when it was before the Special Committee and who opposed the deletion of the clause, I wish to appeal to the Seanad not to be influenced by the arguments of Senator Mrs. Clarke.  I am sorry, but I could not agree with her in any way and I consider that she is taking an entirely wrong point of view.  I hope that the Seanad will vote for the amendment to put back the section which was defeated.  I am sorry that Senator Lynch withdrew his amendment, which was put in by the Special Committee.  I consider that it was better than the Government's suggestion, but as he has withdrawn it we cannot do anything but support the present amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. Bagwell Mr. Bagwell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few remarks to make on this amendment, but, in deference to the Minister, I am willing to make my remarks as brief as possible.  The difference between this amendment, dealing with this particular section, and all the other amendments is that the differences of opinion in this case are of principle. It is a matter of principle.  The others were differences in degree.  Therefore, to my mind, this is a very much more important part of the Bill.  That is to say, it breaks newer ground and is, therefore, of the greatest importance. It affects a large number of people and <Col N="1250" /> there is room for difference of opinion on it.  Like every member present, I have a responsibility in measures like this which affect the welfare of other people, and very often silence is taken to mean consent.  I do not want anybody to be in a position to say that I agreed with this amendment, whether by default or otherwise. My views were those taken by the Special Committee of this House and I wish to support their recommendation that this clause be deleted. This question of contraception is eminently one proper to be threshed out in a special committee, and that was done.  The Special Committee was well qualified to deal with it. Both sexes were represented on it, as well as various Parties in the House and the medical profession.  It was a very properly constituted committee. That committee advocated the deletion of Section 17.  So do I.  The recommendations of such a committee ought not to be lightly set aside, whatever people's opinions may be, and I recognise that in this case there is room for plenty of difference of opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold a strong opinion against Section 17 and I think that I have every bit as much right to do so as other people in this House&mdash;possibly a majority&mdash;who are in favour of its retention.  People like us who are members of legislative assemblies are very often described as being Parliamentary representatives.  Perhaps we here in this Seanad are not representatives to quite the same extent and degree as members of the other House, but we are representatives all the same.  In the case of a Bill of this kind, I think that the views held by a number of people outside the House, which are the same as my views, ought to be represented here.  I think that is right.  I have no doubt that the Select Committee discussed all the points involved in this case with a full sense of responsibility and that they did so in conditions of quiet out of the arena of Party strife.  I expect that everybody said what they really thought.  I support their suggestion as an independent member of this House.  I was not a member of that committee.  I did not serve upon it <Col N="1251" /> and I am not briefed by any section outside; nor, may I say, have I had any hand in any previous consultation with people or bodies outside.  My views are the views of a considerable number of decent citizens who are not extreme in any way.  Contraceptives are condemned under two heads: that they are an interference with nature and that they are immoral.  As regards the question of interference with nature, that is a very debatable matter.  Every surgical operation appears to me to be an interference with nature.  Every treatment by way of injection, for microbes and so on, is an interference with nature and an interference that has very beneficial results.  Hundreds of things are done nowadays which, if they were done 500 years ago, would mean burning at the stake.</P>
    <P>There are wide differences of opinion on this subject amongst quite good citizens.  There are people who condemn contraceptives wholesale under any and every set of circumstances, but they have no monopoly of Christian virtues.  There are lots of decent people who hold the contrary view. I hold that the use of contraceptives is fully justified in a great many cases.  They are justifiable when it means the prevention of disease, the avoidance of injury to health, and possibly danger to life.  That is a view held by quite respectable, good-living citizens.  I am speaking now as an ordinary citizen with, I hope, a reasonable amount of general knowledge and information.  It is a very frequent thing to have contraceptives used by women under medical advice, responsible medical advice.  I hold we are not here to make moral gestures; that is not our function.  I hold that, so far as is practicable, matters of conscience are best left to the individual. Every individual has his moral adviser quite apart from the State and this House or any legislative assembly.  We are here to legislate in a practical manner if we can.  We are here to legislate for the good of our fellow-citizens.</P>
    <P>I hold that this type of legislation is not good and, in many respects, it is <Col N="1252" /> not practical legislation.  Human knowledge increases; it has done so very notably in our time and, though newly acquired knowledge is not always wisely used at first&mdash;in fact it is often abused&mdash;on the whole, increased human knowledge is a good thing and it goes step by step with an increase in Christian virtue.  I think that is a reasonable statement to make when you take into consideration the amount of knowledge we possess nowadays and compare it with what our grandfathers knew 100 years ago, and visualise the changes that have come about since that time in the matter of dealings with other people, with animals, and so on.  Generally speaking, the more knowledge we possess the more humane and less intolerant becomes our point of view. That goes hand-in-hand with knowledge, which is a good thing.  You cannot stop the advance of human knowledge.</P>
    <P>As regards this measure, where you can make it most effective is possibly in the direction that it will do most harm.  Anybody can quite easily realise what I mean by that.  I think what happens when people consider a law to be unreasonable and too extreme is exactly what Senator Mrs. Clarke described.  I agree with every word she said on that subject, although I have not had her advantage in seeing how prohibition worked out in the United States, because my visit there was long previous to it.  It certainly drove the thing underground and made it worse.  What you will do by this legislation is, you will drive underground what is now overground. Whether that is a good thing or not is a matter of opinion.  Personally, I do not think it is.  I think whenever you drive a thing underground to the extent of having decent, well-behaved citizens who have the welfare of the State at heart breaking the law, it is a very bad thing.  That is what happened in the case of prohibition and that is what will happen in this case. I think legislation for conscience' sake can be very unpractical and mischievous.  For my part, I hope there will be a division on this because I intend to vote in support of the views <Col N="1253" /> expressed by the Select Committee of this House; that is to say, I shall vote against the Government amendment, which is for striking out the Committee's amendment and going back to the original clause.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. Gogarty Dr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was very courageous of Senator Mrs. Clarke to adopt the attitude she has adopted in view of all the Long Ju-Gu-ism and Mumbo-Jumbo going around upon this highly debatable question. She made a most sincere contribution to the debate.  I am glad that the Seanad decided to discuss this openly and not to hide it, as the Carrigan Report was hidden.  Some self-advertising chemists and others have been talking about racial suicide.  As if nations were only increased by those whom their mothers did not wish to fear. But there is a worse thing than racial suicide and that is racial syphilis. That is the one thing that undermines and saps away the vigour of the race, not in the third or fourth, but even in the twentieth generation.  I presume that the aspect of the prevention of disease was completely lost sight of by some people in the consideration of this matter.  They viewed it possibly from the aspect of the prevention of birth. If the Carrigan Report were published, reference might be found there to the dreadful alternative facing the unfortunate poor&mdash;and it is not amongst Senators or well-to-do people, but amongst the poor.  The alternative to unwilling birth and bastardy in Ireland is infanticide.  That is what they have confronting them.  I know the ignorant classes are not the classes that might use this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great objection to the curtailment of families is that the intelligent people, the governing classes curtail them at the expense of national intelligence and development.  People of different religious persuasions may have their own views on this matter.  Some people may not think as we do but then we have the Constitution in so far as it says that all religions will be free in this country.  It is absolutely impossible to stop the use of contraceptives and it would be difficult to differentiate nicely between the medical and the religious aspect, if one <Col N="1254" /> is empowered to purchase a contraceptive under a doctor's order.  Senator Colonel Moore has suggested that there would be some abuse here.  Undoubtedly it is a difficult matter.  It is an impossible thing to hold back the little scientific knowledge that goes to the use of these things.</P>
    <P>There was a time shortly after the discovery of ether when it was a monstrous outrage against what was called &ldquo;Nature&rdquo; to utilise it in childbirth.  It was considered an outrage when it was suggested that a woman should not be allowed to be tortured by the pangs of childbirth.  The man who was responsible for the discovery approached a certain Methodist protagonist of this Sadism and pointed out to him that there must be a certain amount of pain in childbearing according to the Bible. The Bible also stated that there must be a certain amount of sweat on one's brow when earning one's living. He pointed out further that stockbrokers and those in pulpits did not necessarily perspire while earning their bread.  It has not cost the world anything or made human affection less dear because women are not tortured into death or lunacy or into great physical weakness by withholding a little chloroform or ether while in childbirth.</P>
    <P>When one considers the tremendous revulsion of opinion against that ancient prejudice, it is enough to make us consider how it may be in ten or 20 years' time in regard to these so-called contraceptives.  First of all, the people who use them are not the people who would be excellent propagators of good citizens, and it seems to me when we talk of racial suicide that the whole thing is a want of confidence in human nature.  There will be always parents and always children. As to those people who are supposed to make an immoral use of a little chemistry&mdash;after all, it is a very easy thing to destroy the male element; any vinegar will do it; you cannot take all the cruet-stands out of the country &mdash;I think it would be far better if people realised the medical results of almost ineradicable diseases from the woman's point of view.  These venereal diseases are not so easily shaken off by women&mdash;never, in fact.  You have <Col N="1255" /> only to go to Grangegorman to realise that.  I am sorry Senator Moore did not discriminate between the medical and prophylactic aspect of these drugs and the use of them, which I cannot naturally uphold, in order to allow people to sin without having the ordinary consequences.  As I said, the Carrigan Report consequences are harder to accept.  That infanticide means murder in this country, and it is heavily on the increase.  When we are legislating we should at least have been provided with the data necessary for the discussion of the matter.  When one has to stand up and speak openly and fearlessly, he should have the Carrigan Report to show what the alternative is in disease, in child outrage and in the fate of any illegitimate child in this country.  Is prevention not better than murder?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that there will be any measure of assent to the contention of Senator Bagwell, or at least the implication of what he said, that it was not the duty of the legislature to enact such wise laws as would preserve the morals of this State.  I do not think it is right that that should go unchallenged.  I rise in wholehearted support of the amendment which tries to secure the total prohibition of the sale and importation of contraceptives.  I think the argument which was stressed to some extent by a couple of Senators with regard to prohibition in America is a very fallacious one.  The legislature there attempted to impose upon people the prohibition of something the use of which within reason no moral law prohibited.  There is no moral law to prevent a man from using alcoholic liquor within reason; no Christian teaching condemns it.  Here the Government is trying to enact legislation to prevent the use of a commodity which is contrary to all moral law and which is contrary to authoritative Christian teaching.  That is sufficient for me and for the vast majority of members of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Bagwell also stressed the advantage of the spread of knowledge and implied that it connoted an advance in virtue.  Yes, knowledge of <Col N="1256" /> good, but what about knowledge of evil?  Does he contend that that tends to the same happy result?  I think it is the duty of the legislature to see that our youth are not contaminated, and that whatever knowledge they get shall be knowledge of good and not of evil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. Bagwell Mr. Bagwell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation: I am inclined to think that the Senator has misrepresented me.  I think he is quoting things which I never said.  I did not hear him very well What I said about conscience was that I thought matters of conscience were, as far as practicable, best left to the individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Senator's explanation.  My recollection was that he said it was not the function of the legislature to make a moral gesture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. Bagwell Mr. Bagwell">

    <Speaker pid="JamesBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably I took a wrong implication from the Senator's words. I suggest that someone wiser than the Senator or myself said that knowledge comes but wisdom lingers.  I am afraid that wisdom up to this has been a long time lingering.  I think there is no need to stress the desirability of putting this section into effect, especially the part dealing with the advertising and sale.  We know that no matter how authoritative Christian teaching may be on this matter immoral propaganda and immoral advertising campaigns can undo very much of the good done by social reformers.  I do not intend to say any more on this matter, but I considered it advisable that somebody should stress the point that there is no relevancy in introducing the failure of prohibition in America with regard to an article which is not prohibited either by the moral law or Christian teaching into the discussion of the prohibition of an article the use of which is contrary to Christian teaching.</P>

      <P>Might I correct the last Senator?  Why I quoted prohibition in America was this: I wanted to prove the effect of prohibition on the human.  I lived six years in the <Col N="1257" /> United States and I never saw either a man or a woman under the influence of drink; I never saw a man or woman take intoxicating drink.  I went through nearly the whole of the States of America in 1924 and I found that prohibition had driven these people from a state of sobriety to a state of drunkenness&mdash;that even the children were not free from it.  It was prohibition which brought that condition about.  What I said was to show the evil effects on the human of prohibiting a thing.  I do not really think that the trade in this particular thing is so great in this country that we want prohibition.  We want something else; we want something more human than laws.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express a view upon this which is different from that of any of the Senators who contributed to the debate.  This is a Bill &ldquo;to make further and better provision for the protection of young girls and the suppression of brothels and prostitution, and for those and other purposes to amend the law relating to sexual offences.&rdquo;  The Bill, almost as a whole, is aimed at preventing what the community unanimously denounces as utterly abhorrent, and in that Bill is introduced a proposal which has possibly or probably nothing whatever to do with the particular purpose of the Bill as a whole.  The practices with which Section 17 is concerned may come into the realm of the offences dealt with in the rest of the Bill; but this amendment should have been in a separate Bill altogether.  For my part, I would be prepared to support that section in a separate Bill.  I am quite prepared to accept the view that 97 per cent. of the people of this country, if challenged as to their assent or objection to that section, would agree with it, and I am quite prepared to abide by that decision.  But to imply, as we are doing in this Bill, that the use of contraceptives is in the same category as a crime against young girls and in the same category as the keeping of brothels and prostitution is a libel upon hundreds and perhaps thousands of honest, God-fearing, holy women.  It is putting their practice in <Col N="1258" /> the same category as brothel-keeping and prostitution.  I object strenuously to that combination in this legislation. As I say, if that section were put forward in a separate Bill in order to make the sale of contraceptives a separate offence, I would vote for it; but I feel that we ought to protest against combining that section with the general class of offences with which the rest of the Bill deals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a member of the Special Committee, and the point raised by Senator Johnson was made there.  This measure is based largely on the report of the Carrigan Commission, which went very fully not only into this matter, but into sex matters generally.  On that commission there were very capable people and they furnished a very complete report. What is known as Section 17 was mentioned, but the committee saw no particular relationship between what is dealt with in Section 17 and general matters.  I must say that I agree with the findings of that committee. Whatever my views may have been on the question generally, I submit that this is a matter for separate legislation, one that should not be dealt with in the incomplete and hasty way that it appears before the Oireachtas.  It is a very involved matter.  We heard an eminent doctor discuss the various medical aspects.  The majority of the committee felt that Section 17 had no relation to the Criminal Law Amendment Bill.  The Government should take up this question and deal with it in a separate Bill.  I thought it better that I should say so before the Bill passes through this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of the minority on the Special Committee who voted against the deletion of this section, I should like to call the attention of the House to a few matters.  I regret very much that the committee came to the decision they came to with regard to Section 17.  I regret it because they worked very carefully and strenuously and harmoniously until they came to this section.  As we came to decisions for the purpose of expediting the passing of the measure, we have refrained from defending our position.  The House may take it from me that no <Col N="1259" /> committee could have got down to their work more earnestly and worked more strenuously than this committee did on every section of the Bill.  As regards Senator Foran's remarks, instead of the House fearing that the committee would do anything rashly or impetuously, I fear that the decision of the committee to delete this section was taken without due consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that they did that.  I think they did themselves an injustice and that the public have been perhaps very much disappointed at their decision. It is only fair to them to say that the decision they came to on that point was, in my opinion, due to the fact that they did not sufficiently appreciate the importance of what they were doing.  Having regard to the volume of opinion that has been given expression to from all parts of the country since the majority of the committee came to their decision, it is not an extravagant description to say that the public conscience has been shocked by the decision arrived at.  I wish to safeguard that statement by explaining that although the public conscience may have been shocked, in my opinion that decision was come to owing to the erroneous impression that the bringing of a section of this kind into a Bill that was aimed perhaps, in the main, at something else, was a mistake, and that therefore it was better to eliminate it.  That is a matter of opinion.  I understand the framers were a committee selected from all Parties in the Dáil, including the Minister for Justice, an ex-Minister for Justice, and lawyers, who came to a decision after having the Carrigan Report, which was left aside for some time, before them.  The Bill was then carried through the Dáil without controversy, and I only regret that we failed to facilitate its passing through this House without controversy.  We did our best and we have been punished for any mistakes that were made.  In the same way as we are bound by the majority of the committee, they are bound by the decision of the House in the desire to pass this Bill and to have done with it.  We <Col N="1260" /> should now conclude the work that we have been engaged in by bowing to the decision of the Seanad and finishing with this Bill.  Let it be passed, as it is a pity to have any further controversy about it.  I beg the House to pass this amendment and to restore Section 17 to the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not know if I misunderstood Senator Foran's remarks, but I seemed to gather from him that there was no relation between the Carrigan Report and the Bill.  That is not so.  As I pointed out at the beginning, this Bill has been framed on it.  The committee was trying to get down to the details when framing the Bill.  They followed up the various recommendations that were made in the Carrigan Report and it was on these recommendations that this Bill was framed.  In reference to the relationship to the particular matter referred to in Section 17, there was a definite recommendation forbidding contraception, and unless I was to ask the committee to leave that business aside, or to have a separate Bill, I do not know what could be done.  If it was regarded by the Carrigan Commission, which dealt with this matter, it must be assumed that they regarded it as one that could be properly dealt with in this Bill.  The Carrigan Commission regarded it as being within their province to deal with, and made it one of the recommendations, and that is one of the reasons for this Bill.</P>

      <P>In order to remove any possible misapprehension that may arise with regard to my attitude regarding the question of age, on behalf of those who took the same line on the divisions as I took, I wish to say that if this Bill had come in the ordinary <Col N="1261" /> way to the House, if it had not been brought here under the circumstances in which it was, I certainly would have voted for every amendment on the Order Paper to-day proposing to raise the age.  But, in view of the circumstances, and in view of what I said on the first amendment to-day, that this was an agreed Bill brought about under very special circumstances, by unanimous consent in the other House, I thought the wisest course for the House to take was not to amend the Bill in any particular. Otherwise, I would have supported the amendment on the question of raising the age.</P>

      <P>With reference to what Senator Farren has said, I would like rather to reverse the procedure and say that if a proposal had been made that, having regard to all the circumstances, this Bill should be accepted by this House, it is quite likely that very reluctantly I, for my part, would have said: &ldquo;Very well; let it go.&rdquo;  But when a Committee proposed by Senator Farren himself&mdash;the names were actually suggested by him&mdash;was set up to see whether improvements could be made, then we felt we should stand by its recommendations.  We have done so, not because we wanted to change the Bill, not because we were not willing to compromise, but because we felt that, in the circumstances, we had been asked by this House to consider it and form a genuine opinion on it.  I think every member who read the Carrigan Report&mdash;I read a good deal more&mdash;did try to form a genuine opinion on the Bill.  When we did appoint a Committee, a Committee that, as I have said, was proposed by Senator Farren, and we felt it necessary to stand by some of the amendments, perhaps unsuccessfully, then our position should not be regarded as in any way different, as far as our desire to get the Bill passed, from that of Senator Farren, who voted for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a select committee consisting of nine Senators, representative of all Parties, be appointed to consider and report its opinion for the information and assistance of the Seanad on the national policy at present being pursued with particular regard to its consequences on the economic and social life of the people:</P>
      <P>that the committee be empowered to send for persons, papers and records and to take evidence:</P>
      <P>that the quorum of the committee shall be five.</P>
      <P>I labour under two handicaps in moving this motion.  In the first place, I have not engaged in a political debate for a number of years, and, in the second place I am genuinely anxious that Senators should have an open mind on this until they hear what I have to say.  I am anxious that I should be able to convince the House that it is a wise, a right and a good thing that this motion should be accepted, but I realise that some strong points I could make from my point of view might have such psychological reactions that I would create an atmosphere that would really be unfavourable to the acceptance of the motion.  For that reason, the case I have to make may not be as strong, controversially, as some, perhaps even myself, would like to make it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to set the mind of the House at rest on one point at the beginning. I have no desire that this motion should give an opportunity, or open up a way, for a discussion on the recent agreement between this country and Britain. I have not put the motion on the Order Paper with that end in view.  I realise, <Col N="1263" /> of course, that it is possible to have such a discussion on the motion.  I understand, and appreciate as well, how very difficult it is for public men who address themselves to the current problems of this country to-day not to advert perhaps to this agreement.  But, my feeling is that while there are points in favour of that agreement there are also points against, and those in this country&mdash;I believe they are the great majority of the people&mdash;who genuinely want to see an improvement in the relationship between this country and Britain will best serve that cause by saying as little as possible about the recent agreement.</P>
    <P>[<i>The Leas-Chathaoirleach took the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>I used to be an optimist about this country's future.  I would like to remain an optimist, but there are certain disturbing factors in the situation at present, which I believe the Government cannot afford to ignore, and with regard to which I feel every thoughtful citizen has responsibilities. It is becoming increasingly clear that the art of government here is far from being well understood.  We have evidence on all sides that the difficulties for the Central Government are increasing.  They are arising from the most unexpected quarters, coming from what were, up to a short time ago anyhow, in the Government's estimation of things, the most friendly quarters.  I urge that if we want to establish the fact that we have here a people possessing the qualities that are essential for success; that, in fact, we are fit to be a national entity, we should see ourselves as we are, looking on ourselves with a calm and steady gaze, neither with an inferiority nor a superiority complex, but with the attitude of mind that we are neither going to magnify nor minimise our failings, weaknesses or good points.</P>
    <P>To me it seems that our people have changed little down through the centuries.  We may say that we have had inflows of blood, but to me it appears that we still possess all the attributes of our early forefathers, <Col N="1264" /> good as well as bad.  Looking around us in the country to-day at the problems that are facing us and the manner of our facing them, we have to wonder whether or not we have got sufficient of the concrete in us to hold together.  To me it seems that history continues to repeat itself.  Away back in the days before the battle of Clontarf, we had the warring factions that made it impossible to establish a strong central Government for the country.  Our histories suggest that, had Brian lived, he would have brought the leaders of his time under his control and he would have established a strong central government. Who knows whether he would or not?</P>
    <P>Coming down through the centuries to our own time, we can look back to 1918 and to 1921.  The people united in 1918 separated in 1921 or 1922.  Some went anti-Treaty and some pro-Treaty, and quite a number of the people who were pro-Treaty broke away and some of them are now on this side and some on that side.  Then, we had the people who were anti-Treaty, and we can look back only a few years to the break there.  Following that break, there have been at least three or four other breaks in the fragments that left the Party that was once Sinn Féin, when the great majority became Fianna Fáil.  You have to-day the I.R.A., Sinn Féin, the Congress Party and fragments of the Congress Party and perhaps another.  I think it is true to say that all those who were anti-Treaty supported the Government in the last election.  I wonder if they are supporting them to-day, or would they support them if there were an election to-morrow?  To me, at least, it seems to be very doubtful indeed.</P>
    <P>Clearly, if the Government are to govern, they cannot retain the support of all these groups and if they do not govern, and cannot govern, I greatly doubt whether it will be possible to succeed them with a party who will be able to govern.  Who would suggest in 1932, for instance, that inside two years' time, it would be necessary or thought essential for the Gárdaí Síochána to go into a Catholic cathedral in this country and remain there while a Bishop addressed his <Col N="1265" /> flock on a question of faith and morals?  I wonder how many members of this House read in an issue of a patriotic journal last week an article headed &ldquo;Sermons, Socialists and Souls,&rdquo; with another heading &ldquo;Heard outside a Mountain Chapel&rdquo;?  Every member of this House ought to read that and I would respectfully suggest that every Catholic clergyman in the country ought to read it.  To me it seems an astounding situation that there is an individual in this country capable of writing such an article, but it is much more astounding that it is possible to publish such an article in this country.  In my view, the consequences of that sort of propaganda are clear and obvious.  They will be disastrous and we are galloping apace in the particular direction in which these people wish us to go.</P>

So far as I can gather, he is suggesting that a situation has arrived in which, if the present Government are to retain office, they must do certain <Col N="1266" /> things to strengthen their hand, rather than proposing a motion to set up a committee to enquire into matters affecting the economic and social life of the people.

All these are doing a great deal towards weakening Central Government here.  They are positively weakening it.  I think that none of us can look on unmoved and undisturbed at these happenings.  When you see what is happening in certain places it makes you feel that we are really trying to get back to the old clan system. Apparently that is the position in the County Kerry.  They want to get back to the old kingdom there.  These disturbances in themselves might not be taken very seriously if there were not running parallel with them the rather disturbed incidents arising as a consequence of the economic war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1269" /> I want to say right off, as far as the economic war is concerned, that frankly I am not looking for any victory for this country by the policy of the present Government or to the defeat of Britain in the economic conflict in which we are at present engaged.  But it is not going to be any advantage for Ireland that the Government to-day would have to go out of office or that its power and influence would be so undermined that it was obvious it could not succeed.  President de Valera may move his chess-men as easily and more easily than Mr. Thomas.  But this is much more than a game of chess.  We are dealing with human beings, men, women and children and the homes of the people are at stake.  I am not going to enter into a discussion on the merits of the economic war at all.</P>
    <P>What I am going to suggest in this House, and particularly to the members of the Government Party, is that they ought to remember that the terms signed by the Government at Versailles were not signed because their generals were out-manoeuvred on the ground; and not because their soldiers, man for man, were inferior to the allied troops, but because of the economic pressure on the German people at home.  If this country is going to be saved from perhaps being forced to sign a treaty that would be as discreditable and as disastrous as the Versailles Treaty was for the Germans, it is absolutely essential that the Government of the day would see to it that our resources would be so organised and so husbanded, and that such a measure of justice would be meted out to our citizens, as would enable them to hold together as an organised social entity in spite of the difficulties through which we are passing. I put it to the Executive Council, through Senator Connolly, that they ought to remember that included in the minority in the last election was a very large section of the best farmers in the country&mdash;industrious farmers who were getting the very best yields from every type of farming.  These men did not desire the economic conflict.  They are much worse off since than before and <Col N="1270" /> from their present experience it is very hard to make them believe that their position is going to be bettered.</P>
    <P>There is no necessity to produce figures to prove that these people are paying much more than the original annuity in the tax on their live stock and farm products which at present are being collected by the British. Little wonder that these people are restless to-day.  We have been told that there are two ways of dealing with it.  I would suggest that there is another.  I would suggest that the Government would readjust its point of view in its method of dealing with those farmers.  While the economic war lasts I would urge upon the Government to see that pure justice will be given to these farmers.  They are human beings and they will react favourably to what they consider is fair.</P>
    <P>In my view the first step the Government should take is to decide not to collect annuities during the period of the economic war.  I believe myself that there would be such a favourable reaction to such a decision on the part of the Government that their position would be considerably strengthened in the campaign they are carrying out.  I am positive that that is so.  Remember, it is not so much against the unwisdom of what these people consider the continuance of the economic conflict that they are up in arms against, as because of the fact that they feel that they are being called upon to bear an unjust burden.</P>
    <P>I know, of course that there are difficulties in the carrying out of such a policy as that on the part of the Government.  Perhaps the most obvious difficulty is that the proposition comes from the other side.  The proposition comes from the Opposition. That is why Executive Councils cease to be Executive Councils.  They are always very reluctant to accept a suggestion from the other side.  I believe when we have more wisdom in the art of governing in this country it will be found to be a very good policy indeed to accept such suggestions.  In this case I think the Government themselves would have good reason to be <Col N="1271" /> satisfied with the result of any such decision if they were brave enough to take it.</P>
    <P>I confess there are other difficulties. The attitude taken up in certain localities with regard to the payment of annuities is, perhaps, a problem, but there is no problem anywhere that cannot be easily overcome if the Government are big enough and bold enough to face up to the situation.  The Minister for Finance may, perhaps, argue that such a decision is going to throw his Budget out of balance.  I do not think it is going to have that effect to any considerable extent.  If the money is there&mdash;and he urges and suggests that it is there&mdash;he is not going to lose it all.  If this money is available in the country, much of it will be spent in the purchase of taxable commodities, so that it will come back to the Exchequer.  If it is not there, the Minister for Finance cannot get it.  If the economic conflict is to continue for any considerable time this decision on the Government's part is inevitable.  It would be much better in my view that it would be faced up to at once, and you would find that these people treated like that by you, would readjust their point of view as you would have done.</P>
    <P>I am not anxious to continue discussing that aspect of the case at any very considerable length, but there is ample evidence and you can ask any farmer you meet anywhere what the position is.  I know my own position.  My farm is very small.  My annuity was £22 before it was reduced to £11.  Since I came into possession of it 11 years ago, I have increased the carrying capacity of the farm by 100 per cent., but the yields of it to-day are less than they were then.  My position at the moment is that I have 11 cattle to sell.  There would be a tax on two of them of £12, on another £4, and on the balance £20.  That is £36, and my annuity is £11.  The bounty I would be able to get under the present regulations would be £2.  That is the problem that many farmers in the country have to meet.  If the rents <Col N="1272" /> and rates were to be met out of the returns of that farm&mdash;and there are many like it in my county&mdash;they could not be paid.</P>
    <P>I want to say something on the general position of agriculture in the country, and it is with particular reference to this aspect of the national position, I think, most good can come from the setting up of this Committee which I propose.  There is no denying the fact that agriculture is the foundation of Irish life.  Any violent change of policy which upsets the general scheme of things on the farm is going to react unfavourably on the country as a whole and is going, in fact, to have violent reactions on the country's life.  For that reason it must be regarded as unfortunate that it is deemed necessary to have a change of agricultural policy every time we have a change of Government.  That should not be so.</P>
    <P>It is essential, therefore, that the broad general lines of our policy, whatever it is to be, should be something on which our farmers would be in general agreement.  Now in trying to ascertain what is soundest and best we have not to set sail here on any uncharted seas.  There is ample evidence, there is data available, there is a great deal of experience, and there would be very little difficulty in determining what is best for the farmer and whether it is good politics or bad politics.  If it is best for the farmer it should be the national agricultural policy.  The question is: what are we aiming at?  If I were asked, I would say that your objective should be to give the maximum employment on the land, to have the highest possible standard for the people on it, and to get the maximum yield from every acre. If that were generally accepted, the rest would be very simple, but at present there is such general confusion that our aim, if we have one at all, is completely obscured.  When people wanted to speak disparagingly of the ex-Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Hogan, they called him &ldquo;the Minister for Grass.&rdquo;  Now, I suppose, some people would speak of our present Minister as &ldquo;the Minister for Tillage,&rdquo; but the <Col N="1273" /> remarkable fact is that to-day we have 90,000 acres more under grass than Mr. Hogan handed over in 1931, and we had 50,000 fewer cattle on that grass in 1934 than we had in 1933.  But whether it is to be grass or tillage, there is nothing discreditable about either.  There are successful farmers engaged in both types of farming.</P>
    <P>A great deal is being heard these days about tillage&mdash;in my view, a great deal too much.  Ireland never adopted tillage generally as a policy.  As far as the records indicate, the highest area under tillage was in the year 1851, when 29 per cent. of our total area was tilled.  That was somewhere around 4,500,000 acres.  In 1926 we had 12.5 per cent.  When people talk about a tillage policy they sometimes think of what is being done on the Continent. Roumania has 72 per cent., Denmark has 65, Germany somewhere about the same, France 58 and Sweden 53.  There is no doubt, I suppose, that if we were situated elsewhere on the Continent of Europe, our soil would be different, our climate would be different and we would have different neighbours.  Perhaps they would have different views about conquest, and they would have, possibly, different views with regard to food.  We have to take things as we find them, and I believe a great deal of the agitation about tillage is born of the conviction that tillage is going to give much more employment than any other type of farming.  I am not going to weary the House with figures but no argument could be more fallacious. There is ample evidence of that already.</P>
    <P>Let us take the position with regard to Limerick and Wexford.  I am sorry the Minister for Agriculture is not in the House.  Limerick had 4.8 per cent. of its area tilled&mdash;this was in 1912&mdash; and Wexford 23.3, but they had a more dense rural population in Limerick than in Wexford.  They had a much more dense population of agricultural workers in Limerick than in Wexford. They had 83 acres tilled in Wexford against every 100 agricultural workers as against 398 acres in Limerick against every 100 agricultural workers.  That is one answer with regard to the value <Col N="1274" /> of tillage as a means of employment. Wexford stands very high from every point of view in respect of tillage&mdash; in its output and in the way it handles its tillage when taking it from the fields.  Sligo can be quoted against Louth.  Sligo has 8.9 of its area ploughed as against 24 for Louth.  Yet, there is a more dense population of agricultural workers in Sligo than there is in Louth.  I do not want you to decry tillage, but I do not think that its importance ought to be magnified. We should try to assess its true value. The situation with regard to tillage is that the eastern counties are best situated for and adapted to that type of farming.  Any encouragement from the Government of a tillage policy is bound to react much more favourably on the eastern counties than on the midland counties or the counties of the west.  You will have a much more extensive area under tillage in the eastern counties than you can have anywhere else but the number of people employed will not be at all in proportion.</P>
    <P>I now come to the position with regard to wheat and beet.  Wheat is being put forward, rather unfortunately, as a sort of political agricultural policy.  Its possibilities here are well known.  Hundreds of thousands of acres of wheat were grown here before we were born but, if you look at the areas where wheat was grown, you will find that they were the counties of bigger farms and best land.  Any efforts to subsidise or encourage wheat-growing as a policy will be chiefly advantageous to the people on the best lands&mdash;the men who ought to be able to stand on their own feet if any agriculturist can do that to-day.  The tragedy about this policy of wheat-growing is that it is so much involved in the political policy of the present Government.  If you regard it as such, wheat as a policy has been a failure.  One ought to look for its success in those parts of the country where Government support is strongest.  But there less wheat is being grown than in other parts, the reason being that the soil is not suitable. Wheat cannot be successfully produced as a political policy as against <Col N="1275" /> other types of farming of which the people have experience and which proved very successful even when they had to meet intense competition from foreign countries.  I believe that we will never be able to determine whether the growing of wheat or beet will be satisfactory as a policy until normality in agricultural conditions is restored. When we are able to test the value of one crop as against another, we shall be able to decide rightly whether wheat-growing and beet-growing are types of farming which should be advocated as part of national policy or not.  I urge that the aim here for all of us should be to encourage such development on the land as will enable the greatest number of people to be employed.</P>
    <P>In trying to visualise what agriculture can do to provide employment, we have to take stock of the position with regard to the industrialisation of the country.  There is talk these days about new industries springing up everywhere.  It would seem to me as if we were to have a boot factory in every town.  I presume there is a plan, but I do not know of a certainty whether there is or not.  We have had speeches&mdash;rather able speeches, I should say&mdash;recently from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  One would gather from some of the statements he made that there is a plan. Are any of our boot factories going to be on the lines of the Bata factory or are they to be merely little industries which will survive only behind high tariff walls&mdash;factories which will provide the boots we require here at home, but which, if the tariff walls are removed, will not be able to withstand the withering blast of intense competition? How many other factories are necessary to produce the goods which, we are told, home consumption demands?  How many people are to be employed in those factories?  If there is a plan for the reconstruction of our industrial life, the Ministry ought to be able to indicate to us the number of factories essential to the production of the goods we require and the approximate number of people who will find employment in those factories. <Col N="1276" /> Recent returns show that the number of unemployed is about 138,000.  I do not want to make any capital out of that very high figure.  I realise that there are people on the register now who were never on a register before&mdash; people who will stay there as long as they are kept there.  But there they are.  Many years will elapse before these people will be absorbed by the new industries which, we are told, are being or about to be established.  It ought to be possible for the Ministry to indicate the possibilities of employment in industry.  The question will then arise&mdash;what are we to do with the balance?  Apparently, they are not to be permitted to leave the country, and the only possible source of employment is the land.  What are we going to do with them on the land?  I do not think that either wheat-growing or beet-growing will provide work for many of these people.  The problem will have to be faced in another way. Let us take the position as it is.  There is a great deal of talk about economic self-sufficiency.  The facts are that 4,000,000 acres of land are more than ample to provide us with the 700,000 or 800,000 acres of wheat and the 60,000 acres of beet and all the grain required for home use.  Four million acres would more than meet our grain requirements for human and animal use, and there are 12,000,000 arable acres in Ireland. It seems to me that it is much more important to the life of the country to determine how we are to handle these 8,000,000 acres than to decide what is to be done with the 4,000,000 acres.  Our people are scattered all over these lands to-day.  They built up for themselves prosperous, happy homes.  Until recently, they were paying high rents and rates but, in spite of these difficulties, they accumulated considerable savings.</P>
    <P>Now I urge that if all our people are not to be brought into the province of Leinster, which is approximately 4,000,000 acres, our Executive Council and the people associated with them should ask themselves how are we to manage the land in future so that every acre will earn something for the owner and enable him to pay his way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1277" /> Recently we have had statements both from the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the agricultural sphere Fianna Fáil's aim was to change the basis of the agricultural economy, to concentrate upon the production of the agricultural goods required for their own people many of which they were importing from abroad in very great quantities, and at the same time to effect such changes in the production of other classes of agricultural produce as would limit the exportable surplus to the extent for which the external market could be found.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was rather a careful statement, more so than the statement made by the Minister for Agriculture to his own constituents.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any increase in cattle production would be ruinous.  To maintain our present production is a doubtful economic proposition, certainly risky, and therefore not desirable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on he told them:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They had reached practically the limit of the available markets for eggs and bacon, and they had been maintaining their exports of milk products at great cost to the taxpayer and the consumer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know what Senator Johnson thinks of that doctrine of restriction of output.  Taking into account the fact that there are a great many people in our own country who have not sufficient quantities of butter, bacon, and eggs and meat, it seems to me that that is an amazing attitude for the Minister for Agriculture to take up. But there is another aspect which might be for us to-day really disastrous. I would urge that that attitude of mind on the part of the representatives of this country in future negotiations with Britain, when they are to come&mdash;perhaps they are going on now for all we know&mdash;the attitude of mind that no more goods should be sent to the British market than we sent in the past, is absolutely wrong.  It certainly is an attitude we ought not to take up.  It may be true that the taste of the people of Great Britain is changing <Col N="1278" /> and that they are not as fond of meat as they were, but the figures do not prove that.  Anyhow, for a long time to come, assuming tastes are changing, there is going to be a very considerable market in Britain for meat.  Last year they imported bacon to the value of £23,000,000; of that we sent them £798,000; Denmark sent them over £13,000,000 worth.  They imported butter to the extent of over £25,000,000; we sent about £1,000,000 worth of that and Denmark sent £7,000,000.  They imported eggs to the value of £4,000,000; we sent them £800,000 worth of that and Denmark sent them £1,700,000 worth.  I suggest that these figures show the way we should turn if we are really to keep our people in a comfortable way and if we are to realise that there is dignity in labour on the land and that the return for that labour should be good.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(The Cathaoirleach resumed the Chair.)</i>
    </P>
    <P>In these days, and in this House, we hear a great deal of talk about the Commonwealth of Nations, and our association in the Commonwealth with Britain.  It seems to me, if this association is to continue, there are a great many people who believe that its continuance will be contingent on the cash value that is to be found in it. There are people for whom the British Crown may have sentimental attractions; they are a small number; but they are here and they have their rights.  But there are a great many others who differ from that point of view.  There are those who hold the firm conviction that there is in the Commonwealth of Nations and in association with Great Britain, something that is of value to them in the economic sense, and that was worth keeping. That ought to be the test to be applied by our representatives when facing up to British statesmen on this question, as they will have to do some day.  What they ought to fight for is much bigger sales in the British market for what the men on the land can produce, and for what can be produced by men who cannot grow wheat or beet, and whom the State cannot subsidise to the extent <Col N="1279" /> that it would pay them to grow wheat or beet.  These people ought to get the chance of producing in the country according to their capacity what is most suitable for them to produce.</P>
    <P>The attitude of mind of the Minister for Agriculture is the wrong attitude if he is to meet British statesmen in regard to their markets.  There are poor farmers in this country and on the western seaboard who lived decent lives and enjoyed comparative comfort for 20 years.  We ought to realise that 700,000 acres of wheat and 600,000 acres of beet is not enough for people to get a living out of compared with 12,000,000 acres of land worked heretofore. Agriculture is in great difficulty to-day.  There is no desire on my part to exaggerate these conditions.  My desire is not to exaggerate them, but to get people to realise and know they exist.  There are people in this country who were brought up on the land. Some were wise enough to get away from it; others were not.  I see no difficulty in the problem confronting Senator O'Maille whose farm I pass every day, and the problems I have to face myself.  These difficulties are known to Senators on all sides of the House.  There are a great many supporters of the Government Party in the country who are as anxious as we are for the reorganisation of industry and for a position that will give the people a decent chance of living such as they enjoyed before.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other things I would like to say.  In the temper and spirit that is abroad to-day it is not easy to do constructive work.  If one has to speak the truth one can only say that it is the desire of every Irishman to decry the efforts of every other Irishman.  We have been like that, I think, all through the ages.  We have not changed one jot or tittle.  Things are being said of the most responsible men in this State that ought not to be said.  We are more uncharitable to one another and more unfair to one another than, I believe, any other race or nation.  You hear statements with reference to Mr. Cosgrave, with reference to President de Valera, that are a disgrace to a Christian people.  But <Col N="1280" /> the great tragedy is&mdash;and perhaps none of us is faultless&mdash;that this very bad example is being set by people in high places and in every walk of life.  It is little wonder that we have so much bitterness and so much that is vile away down through every artery when some of the most intelligent and exalted of our people have such a desire to speak ill of one another.</P>
    <P>Some of us are charged now and again with sabotage, with being Imperialists, and with all sorts of things that are thought to be evil.  I doubt if there is one Imperialist in this country to-day in the sense that the word was understood and used in the days gone by, but it has been used about other men in this country in our own day before, and the great tragedy for us is that great leaders are dead and in their graves now of our own generation and that it is only when these men's bones are long enough in their graves to be mingled with the dust that we discover the good that was in them.  We know well many of the things that were said of the late Kevin O'Higgins.  We know of all the charges of being an Imperialist that were levelled against him.  I was wondering the other day, when I listened to the President here, whether he had readjusted his point of view&mdash;I do not think he ever said it and I have no recollection that he did&mdash;I was wondering what he thought when he looked through the achievements of that man and when he studied the Statute of Westminster, that leading British statesmen declare broke up the British Empire, and whether he did not see him as more of a different type of Imperialist from the type of Imperialist he was referred to as in 1924, 1925, 1926 and 1927.  It is, however, when men are dead that sometimes the good that was in them is discovered.  It would be much better if the good could be discovered while they lived.  We have another example.  Who would have thought, when Mr. Desmond Fitzgerald, Mr. McGilligan and the late Mr. Kevin O'Higgins were working for the registration of the Treaty at Geneva, and when it was suggested and urged by other leaders elsewhere <Col N="1281" /> that such a deed was wrong, that they were carving out a chair for President de Valera at Geneva from which he would be able to rise to speak to the nations of the world?  Neither they thought it, I am sure, nor did President de Valera.</P>
    <P>These are merely indications of the injustices we do one another, and there is a great necessity for a change in this country to-day.  There are many difficulties abroad.  We have made a number of them ourselves.  We ought to try to lessen the evils.  I feel myself that the position nationally, particularly with regard to the policy of our agricultural industry, is such that what has been done is slap-dash and not well thought out; that there is not a plan.  I feel very strongly that, no matter what Government rules in this country, there ought to be a continuity about our agricultural policy and it ought to be acceptable to the majority of thoughtful farmers as the policy that is soundest and best.  I do not believe that you can get from a political party, acting as a political party with as the main consideration the political reactions to its acts, the wisest policy that our farmers ought to pursue.  I know that this Government had to face many difficulties, and possibly a great many difficulties that they had not the vision to realise they would be confronted with.  They are wiser than they were, but the country is poorer than it was.  The country can be held together and can be made to pull together, but an effort has to be made and a spirit displayed of which we have not much evidence yet.</P>
    <P>I believe that if this House agrees to this motion of mine and sets up this committee good will come from it and good work will be done by this committee. I think I have indicated on broad, general lines the kind of considerations that ought to weigh with this committee and the problems that it has to face.  I might have been much more general and much more specific, but I will ask people on the other side not to dismiss this proposition lightly. If the statements I make are untrue, they can be disproven.  If they are true, there is a reason for the proposition <Col N="1282" /> that I put on the Paper.  I tried to put it in as reasonable a way as I could, but I believe that there is very good reason for the setting up of such a committee and that great good would accrue from it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second the motion.  Senator Baxter, however, has left little or nothing for me to say, and, as a matter of fact, I do not intend to say very much.  There are a couple of things, however, to which I should like to refer.  I should like to bear out Senator Baxter in saying that there is probably more of disquiet and unrest in the country at the present time than there has been for many a long day, and I think it would be a good thing that this motion should be passed so as to give an opportunity of inquiring into that.  I suggest that this disquiet is caused mainly by two things: first of all, by the Government's national policy, and next their industrial policy. In connection with their national policy, I would mention that they took office and authority under the Constitution and Treaty, while at the same time their spokesmen, official and otherwise, all along have declared that they are aiming at a republic and separation from the Commonwealth. These matters in themselves are enough to cause a good deal of disquiet and unrest, because they show first of all that the Government themselves are disaffected to the Constitution under which they pass and administer their laws.</P>
      <P>The other major matter to which I should like to refer is their industrial revival.  The industrial revival itself that the Government aims at is one that has the approval and support of everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has to be remembered that to prop up this industrial revival which is pushed forward in such a hasty manner, they have to utilise an extreme measure of protection and in many cases a prohibition of imports.  That matter of high protection and prohibition inflicts tremendous loss on the export trade and affects especially the farmers trade.  It has been estimated by experts that the loss of income to the <Col N="1283" /> country is something like a minimum of £15,000,000.  I would like to comment as an ordinary person viewing that tremendous loss.  I think that loss can be connected with the 135,000 or 140,000 unemployed.  If the income becomes short in such a way as that, it follows that there must be a tremendous number of men put out of employment.  That has happened both in the case of agriculture and in the case of the industries that have been established.</P>
    <P>Again, there is no measure of selection in the industries established.  I will give one instance.  I am interested in the co-operative meat factory in Waterford as a member.  Three years ago they slaughtered and dressed 100 cattle per week.  The policy of the Government on the annuities question brought about prohibition in the case of the dressed meat trade so that it has been actually put out of commission. When selecting or discriminating between what industries would be suitable, I suggest that we should select something absolutely indigenous to the soil.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of talk about reorganising and developing agriculture.  So far as I can see, it is now becoming impossible to keep farmers' sons and daughters on the land.  Instead of trying to develop and organise agriculture it is now a question of whether he will be able to retain the young people on the land. The rush seems to be towards the towns and cities, whether because of the amenities or amusements there or because of the economic pressure it is difficult to say.  I believe the economic pressure has a big influence on the matter.  The social policy of the Government with regard to housing and expenditure in towns and cities seems to be driving the young people from the land.  I desire heartily to support the proposal put forward by Senator Baxter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Connolly) Minister for Lands (Mr. Connolly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to intervene at this stage because I may not have an opportunity later or this debate may peter out or <Col N="1284" /> it may be adjourned, and I feel that as this was, as far as I know, Senator Baxter's maiden speech in this House, it would be only reasonable that I should say something in regard to his motion.  I have listened with great interest to all that Senator Baxter said, and I could not help reflecting that his speech would suggest that we had been living under normal conditions for the last three years, and that the type of opposition the present Government had to meet was very cool, calm and deliberate, without any political passion or without any feeling of bitterness.  I regret to say that was not the case, and I think it is pretty well known throughout the country and to us all here that the very calm, dispassionate attitude which Senator Baxter very rightly took on this question bears no relation whatever to the type of opposition that the members of his own Party have offered to the present Government.</P>
      <P>One thing seems to emerge from his statement here this evening, and that is that he seeks and would welcome and desire a national outlook on national things.  But he does not serve that purpose very well by instancing the divisions that have taken place in recent years.  He has gone to some trouble to explain the differences that emerged out of the Treaty split, if I might call it so, and later out of the Sinn Fein movement, and dealt with the I.R.A. and the different sections that he claims have broken off from that organisation.  He mentions the Congress Party and the rest.  I would like to point out also that the Republican forces in the country have had no monopoly whatever of the split forces that occasionally occur in Irish political parties, and if Senator Baxter had applied the atmosphere and the attitude that he is applying here this evening to the national issues eighteen months or two years ago, things might have been very different in many respects to what they are to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am all in favour of the atmosphere which he introduced.  I do not think that anyone can, with any national pride or dignity or goodwill, look back on the different forces of opposition <Col N="1285" /> that were introduced to the present Government when it took up office and which have persisted up to the present in a quarrel, not to call it a war, that existed on certain very fundamental things with the people across the water. We pledged our word to the people on certain issues.  We went to the country on that and were returned.  I do not want to go into all the details, but we went to the country on that again and again we were returned.  That, to me, was an indication of the will of the people if there was ever any indication possible, and it seemed to me that it behoved those people who accepted the rule of the majority to stand in with the Government of the country and back it to the limit in what were its just rights.  Those just rights were claimed at that time; those just rights still stand and those just rights will be adhered to and maintained in spite of any opposition, either internal or external, so long as we have the majority vote of the people of this country.  That is the policy that is definitely fixed.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter, I think, will be the first to admit that right from the word &ldquo;Go&rdquo; we at least were not helped in our conflict with an external force by either the leaders or the rank and file of the Opposition.  I would like to draw a little contrast with what exists elsewhere.  There was recently a most violent, vigorous and offensive attack on a leading statesman outside this country.  Many of the papers in that statesman's own country are bitterly opposed to him in policy; they attack him daily on his idiosyncrasies and weaknesses as a leader of the people. It was noteworthy that the foreign Press, the Press across the water, religiously abstained from making any quotation which would have been derogatory to that statesman.  I would say it is an object lesson for some people in this country.  They might take advantage of it and try to follow the same line.</P>
    <P>With regard to the motion itself, the Cathaoirleach has ruled that it is in order and I am quite satisfied with that ruling.  But let us realise what the motion means.  It really means the establishment of a super-Government <Col N="1286" /> or super-Cabinet which will decide what is right and what is wrong in regard to economic policy in this country.  It is not in terms a condemnation of the existing Government, but it clearly indicates that not only is the present Government inefficient and incompetent, but that it should be superseded by a super-Cabinet very much on the lines, I am afraid, of the new proposals of Mr. Lloyd George. In any event, while the Government is in office, and while it has authority from the people of this country, such a proposition as this cannot be contemplated. It could not be contemplated by any Government claiming to govern and we do claim that we are the Government and that we are governing.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter has given us a considerable number of references to the Church in Ireland, to the attitude of the Bishops, and to the attitude of different county councils&mdash;the Kerry County Council, the Clare County Council, and so on. He proclaims that these are significant indications that the present Government has lost support.  I do not agree that the present Government has lost support.  There is a period for testing that and at that period the Government's attitude, its policy and whole activities, will come under review.  If Senator Baxter and his Party are able to make a right appeal, to put the right programme before the people, and are able to show that we are entirely discredited by the people of the country, there is a method whereby that can be put into force, and the people of Kerry, the Clare County Council and the rest can all have their opportunity of returning the people that they want.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter dealt with such a variety of subjects, and he spread himself in such an irregular way, if I might say so, over the whole position in this country, that it was rather difficult to keep pace with him and to follow intelligently what exactly his whole argument was.  It might be summed up by saying that he is of the opinion that the agricultural economy, the social economy and the social policy of this present Government are all wrong; that a group of Senators could evolve something <Col N="1287" /> much better than and much different from what is going on.  It seems to me that, like most Senators who have been addressing themselves to this question of the economic and social conditions of this State, he overlooked quite a number of factors which should be and I believe are obvious to most intelligent people.</P>
    <P>I have gone to some pains to explain in this House various factors that are operating not only here but elsewhere. If Senator Baxter believes that the British market for cattle exists as it did in 1929, 1930 and 1931, then I believe he is wrong.  I think an analysis or a superficial study even of the position as existing there would clearly indicate what the position is.  He also asked for a continuity of policy.  I presume he means by that that there should be a continuity of policy in regard to the agricultural production for our export trade.  I would remind him that there cannot be any continuity of policy in regard to export trade, because your policy depends entirely on what your purchasers abroad are prepared to buy from you.  We have concentrated in regard to policy on the market that we do know exists and that is beyond yea or nay available.  We argued and still argue that the cattle market which did exist, leaving aside for a moment its economic value or otherwise to the people of the country, was a diminishing quantity.  It is still a diminishing quantity; it is a rapidly disappearing quantity.  I would refer to Mr. Elliot's statement in the House of Commons a few days ago when he was asked if he understood and knew that the cattle trade in Great Britain was in a ruinous condition and that only ruinous prices to the farmer could be secured.  Mr. Elliot in his reply stated that he was well aware of it and that all the protection possible for the British producer of beef would be given.</P>
    <P>I know something about the conditions in various other countries.  I know countries that have been ruined because they were entirely in wheat. I know countries that have been ruined because they were in wheat, cotton and beef.  One would think, to hear the statements made here, that we were <Col N="1288" /> living in the pre-1929 period.  We are not.  I showed here not very long ago how world trade in agricultural products had decreased to about 40 per cent. of what it was in 1929.  Does Senator Baxter think we are immune from that?  Does he think that any continuity of policy could afford to ignore the existing conditions and the market that is available?</P>
    <P>He raises various questions with regard to the use of land.  He puts it to us&mdash;can we use all the land in this country to feed our people?  Is it necessary to use all the land of this country to feed our people?  I do not know; we do not know.  We know this, however, that the policy that was being pursued before we came into office was heading straight for ruin and that it would have been infinitely more ruinous to-day if that policy had been continued, leaving aside the economic war altogether and the big national issue of this claim of Great Britain which we will not admit.  That policy would have been ruinous and has been ruinous.  We are overlooking the fact that this policy, in these prosperous days that members of the Opposition refer to, meant the continued emigration from this country of about 25,000 people per year who are not now able to go out.  I think that that ought to be kept in mind and that since we came into power there must have been an increase of the non-emigrants by about 75,000 people in three years and that those people cannot get out.</P>
    <P>Now the logical thing to do is to expand our industrial policy to the limit of what we can do; to expand our production of those commodities which are of daily need to our people, and to try to get that harmony between the two that we can best get and can best afford.  No responsible person in any country to-day is going to claim that he is going to solve the unemployment problem.  What we have done and will do is to work to the limit to get the maximum of production for our own needs and for which we know there is a definite market.  Those people who cannot now be assimilated, until they are assimilated in the development of the country, will be taken care of to the maximum extent <Col N="1289" /> which has been provided in the various Assistance Acts and the rest.  More than that, no statesman can do at present.  To try to argue as to the present position on the basis of 1928 or 1929 is neither fair nor realistic.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter put forward a suggestion which I am glad he put forward for the simple reason that I have been anxious to deal with it.  His suggestion is that we should not collect the annuities.  I wonder does he appreciate just what that means.  Does he realise that the one security of tenure, the one right the farmer has to his land, the one justification to hold on to his land, and to establish and maintain his title, is the payment of the halved annuity?  Remember if he does not pay resumption will take place.  It is his security of tenure.  I think the greatest crime done by an Opposition in this country was the preaching of the doctrine of non-payment of liabilities.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter referred to the fact, and did it very rightly, and in very good terms, that we may be here to-day and that some other Government may be here to-morrow.  It is well that that note should be struck.  I think that it is a very desirable thing to emphasise, that a Government and the people in it are only birds of passage.  They are there for a few years of torture, and going through as much work as they can day and night.  Then another Government replaces them.  Remember, if a political Party is to preach a doctrine of non-payment of annuities, when they come into power they are going to be faced with the same gospel. Apart from policy it is a serious thing, from the moral point of view, if they are going to create a situation, that any group or any individuals can get by without meeting their lawful liabilities. There is the all-important consideration, that if we do not collect the annuities what is going to happen?  I ask Senators to consider that.  Assume the hypothetical position, that a Government was defeated in the collection. Now what is going to follow? Do you think the people of this country are going to sit down and to allow land to be held without fee or reward, <Col N="1290" /> simply because there was a squatter's right, or because they held under Land Commission agreements which they are not honouring?  No such thing.  There will be other methods.  Civilisation and ordinary order will demand other methods.  It may be one thing or another.  It may be a land tax or what you will.  I emphasise, that the only claim for a man to hold his land is by paying the annuities and keeping in good standing with the Land Commission in the settlement of them.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter went into various figures with regard to the use of the land and the production of wheat, beet, etc.  It is not within my province to deal with these matters.  The Minister for Agriculture is not here.  If we had had any idea that these particular matters were going to be brought up we would be in a position to deal with them.  At all events I am satisfied of this, that it is sound economic policy to produce 100 per cent. of the wheat needed for the people of this country, and similarly with every other commodity, whether agricultural or industrial.  It is a policy of self-sufficiency.  We know that there is considerable controversy in economic schools of thought with regard to the value and the disadvantages of a policy of self-sufficiency.  We have got to be realistic, and to realise that we have got to live, and we have accordingly to teach that when a people are not prepared to buy certain commodities from us while we have got to purchase from them, the only proper method of balancing our trade is to reduce our imports, if our exports are reduced by foreign purchasers.  I say it is sound policy, taking the world as it is, to produce these things for ourselves. I do not think Senator Baxter was cynical, but he may have been when he mentioned normalcy in agriculture. Can anyone imagine normalcy in agriculture? Can anyone conceive normalcy in the near future?  I cannot, and I have studied the reports and have heard people from different countries speaking at various conferences.  In every branch of agriculture from wheat to tobacco you find the same thing. People who have a certain crop are glutted with it, because of the world's <Col N="1291" /> lack of capacity to purchase and because of the rotten economic system that has been in existence.  If Senator Baxter brings forward a proposal to look into the root causes, then I say he will be on very good ground.  It is only tinkering with the matter and only begging the issue to talk about economic normalcy in agriculture.  Such a thing seems to me very far off and it does not help.</P>
    <P>He referred to the number of unemployed. I think I dealt with that question last week, or the week before, when I pointed out the number of people now registered for employment, and the number of people registered for unemployment assistance.  I had one case, following that statement, in one district in Donegal.  I got figures showing that at one time there were 78 people registered, in the matter of paying unemployment stamps, and that at present there are over 2,000 in that end of the Gaeltacht alone, registering for unemployment assistance. I am very glad they are, because they were living in a state of penury for 12 or 14 years, under the last Administration, and for many years before that.  It is the first time that there has been any cognisance of the position of the small struggling landholders in the Gaeltacht, and along the western seaboard, numbering many thousands, who are at present, at least, being preserved in some state of living which is compatible in a Christian community.</P>
    <P>Senator Dillon referred to various matters dealing with the keeping of the young people amongst the agricultural population on the land.  Agriculture like everything else is providing us, and providing the people of all countries like ours, with what is known as technological unemployment.  New methods are being introduced into the factories.  Even since my time in industry I have seen a machine doing what it used to take 20 men to do, <Col N="1292" /> and a boy will watch it and get better results.  The same thing will apply to some extent in agriculture.  That will go on.  Like other people, we will have to face the position as regards what we are going to do about it. We are a small country and we will not influence the economic outlook of the peoples of the world, but we will have to concentrate on the problem we are facing ourselves, to see how we can evolve some system for the distribution of the day's work according to the necessity for production.  I have often said here that we should not glorify work <i>qua</i> work.  I think we should work to live, to bring the highest standard of living and the highest standard of development to our people.  There is no reason why we should be entirely wedded to the idea that it is going to be essential for a man to work six days a week for eight hours daily.  I believe if we were an intelligent people in this world, which we are not unfortunately in economic thought, we could work down to a basis which would give us all the production we need; give us a much better standard of living than we have, and minimise work to a certain extent.</P>
    <P>With regard to the motion itself, it would be quite impossible for the Government to accept it.  It would simply mean that they were accepting the doctrine that they ought to be superseded by a super-Cabinet. We do not feel that that position has arrived and is not likely to arrive for a long time.</P>
