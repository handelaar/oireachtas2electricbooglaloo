      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are really consequential on amendment No. 4, which is the amendment designing to secure that the Board must give public notice of its intention to make a letting of a fishery.

      <P>In Senator Bagwell's absence&mdash;I know that he is in town and that he will be here in a few minutes&mdash;I should like to say that I think he was going to suggest to the Minister that the period of a fortnight ought to be made 21 days.  A great many of the local papers in this country are not published more than once a week, and if you have a fortnight as the length of time for notice to be given, it is just possible that you would have only one advertisement in the fortnight.  On the other hand, if you make the period 21 days, there will be no doubt about it at all.</P>

      <P>(a)  who, for a period of not less than three months during the twelve months immediately preceding the date of acquisition, was employed by the owner of the property which is being acquired; or</P>

    <P>and whose earnings from such employment during that period formed the whole or a substantial part of the livelihood of such person.  The amount of the compensation to be paid under this sub-section shall be such sum as, in the case of a property which is being acquired compulsorily, the arbitrator, or, in the case of a property which is being acquired by agreement, the Minister (or a person nominated by him), shall consider reasonable having regard to the loss of livelihood suffered by the aforesaid employed person in consequence of the acquisition of such fishery or fishery right by the Board, regard being had also to the likelihood of such person being continued in the employment of the Board.&mdash;(Senator Johnson.)</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 15 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>15.&mdash;(1)  Whenever a fishery or a fishing right is acquired (whether compulsorily or by agreement) by the Board under this Act, every person who proves to the satisfaction of the Board or of the arbitrator all the following matters, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  that during the whole or substantially the whole of each of the three complete open fishing seasons next before such acquisition, <Col N="1145" /> he was constantly and regularly employed at a weekly wage in or about the working of such fishery or the exercise of such fishing right, and</P>
    <P>(b)  that he was so employed by a person or the predecessor in title of a person entitled to receive the price or a portion of the price payable by the Board in respect of such acquisition, and</P>
    <P>(c)  that the wages received by him in respect of such employment formed the whole or a substantial part of his livelihood while he was so employed, and</P>
    <P>(d)  that his said employment related exclusively to the working of such fishery or the exercise of such fishing right, and</P>
    <P>(e)  that he was not regularly employed outside the open fishing season by the person by whom he was so employed during the open fishing season,</P>
    <P>shall (subject to the provisions of this section) be entitled to be paid by the Board compensation in respect of his loss of employment by reason of the said acquisition of such fishery or fishing right by the Board.</P>
    <P>(2)  The compensation payable to any person under this section shall be calculated as follows, that is to say, for every complete open fishing season during which such person complied with all the conditions mentioned in the next preceding sub-section of this section, such person shall receive a sum equal to four times the average weekly wage received by such person in respect of such employment during the complete fishing season next before the said acquisition of the said fishery or fishing right by the Board, but subject to the overriding limitation that such compensation shall not in any case exceed fifty-two times the said average weekly wage.</P>
    <P>(3)  A person shall not be entitled to any compensation under this section in relation to the acquisition of a fishery or a fishing right by the Board where it is shown to the satisfaction of the arbitrator that by <Col N="1146" /> reason of an undertaking by the Board to continue the employment of such person or for any other reason such person will suffer no loss or diminution of employment in consequence of such acquisition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide for the payment of compensation in certain cases to workers employed by persons whose fishing rights have been acquired by the Board in accordance with the provisions of the Bill.  There are certain points of difference between the proposal in the Government amendment and that embodied in the amendment in the name of Senator Johnson.  I gather that the Senator is anxious to provide that compensation will be paid not merely in the cases of persons who lose their employment in consequence of the acquisition of fisheries under this Bill, but also that persons who have already lost their employment through the destruction of or the reduction in the value of fisheries since the 1st October, 1929&mdash; that is, such fisheries as may now be acquired by the Board under the provisions of this Bill.  The objection to that is, I think, fairly clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The adoption of the proposal would widen the basis of compensation so much as to create considerable dangers and it would give rise to justifiable claims for compensation from other persons similarly affected. There is no logical ground upon which a case could be made for the compensation of a workman who has lost his employment on a fishery since 1929 in consequence of the operation of the Shannon scheme that could not also be made for several other classes of workers.  Certain lands were flooded in connection with the construction of the scheme and it is possible that farm workers previously employed on these lands also became disemployed.  Certain mills were put out of action and the workers employed there would also have a case to put forward if the Senator's proposal were accepted.  Again, certain hotels specialised in catering for visitors who went to that part of the country for the fishing and their trade was reduced, with <Col N="1147" /> a probable reduction in the staff employed.  If the principle of the amendment were to be accepted it would constitute a precedent which would have the effect of making impossible certain desirable developments that might otherwise be well worth while undertaking.</P>
    <P>To some extent this argument I have used could also be used against the Government's proposal.  The reason why we bring forward that proposal is because we contemplate that a considerable number of persons who are at present engaged or who have been engaged in connection with the Shannon fisheries will still be employed by the Electricity Supply Board on similar work and the purpose of the provision is to ensure that there will be, on the one hand, a very direct inducement to the Electricity Supply Board to employ such persons in preference to other persons and, secondly, to ensure that there will not be undue difficulty created for the Board if it is to choose from the number of such persons a lesser number to be employed in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>The Senator also proposes that compensation should be paid to persons who have had not less than three months' employment during the previous 12 months from the owner of the fishery.  I think three months would be much too short a period.  The proposal in the Government amendment is that a person to be entitled to compensation must have been employed during the whole or substantially the whole of each of the three complete open fishing seasons next before the date of acquisition. The amendment proposes also that the person to be compensated must be able to show that the earnings received by him in respect of employment in the fishery formed the whole or a substantial part of his livelihood while he was so employed, and also that he was not regularly employed outside the open fishing season by the person by whom he was so employed during the open fishing season.  There are certain types of cases that might arise&mdash;for instance, where a whole-time workman of an employer who acted for <Col N="1148" /> him in connection with his fisheries during the season and in other capacities afterwards, would probably still continue to be employed by that employer.  He would not be entitled to compensation.</P>
    <P>The basis of compensation is a sum equal to four times the average weekly wage received in respect of employment during the complete fishing season, subject to a maximum of 52 weeks' average wages.  The amendment also proposes to exclude from compensation those persons who will be employed by the Electricity Supply Board in connection with the fisheries after the date of acquisition.  I think the amendment goes a long way to meet the points made in Committee and especially to meet the points in regard to the basis of compensation for such persons and I would be very hesitant about extending it in any way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that the Minister has gone some way towards meeting the cases submitted to him in my amendments, but I do not think this can be considered a very generous provision. On the point the Minister made regarding paragraph (b) of my amendment, as affecting the Castleconnell boatmen who were referred to last week, I admit the Minister has certain grounds for his arguments that the logical conclusion would be that other men who suffer by this acquisition would also be entitled to compensation. But the difference lies here, that in the cases in question there is actually a sum proposed to be paid over, whether by way of compensation or by way of the price for acquisition, to the owners of the private fisheries and the men who made their livelihoods out of these fisheries are left without compensation of any kind.  As I understand it, there is no assurance given, no provision made, in the terms by which this compensation or these prices are proposed to be paid to the owners, that they shall provide something out of the fund that will become available to them for the compensation of the workmen they employed.  That, I think, is a matter which should be urged upon the Minister as strongly as possible&mdash;that in justice there ought <Col N="1149" /> to be some provision made whereby out of the compensation to be paid to the private fishery owners some portion should be earmarked for the workmen who are really the sufferers by the loss of the fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (a) of the amendment the Minister has put forward seems to me to be open to question on this ground, that only those who have been employed during the whole or substantially the whole of three complete open fishing seasons next before the acquisition are to come within the category of compensatable persons. One does not know how soon this acquisition will take place.  The Minister said last week that the Lax weir had not been operating for the last couple of years&mdash;I forget exactly the period.  Quite conceivably they might say: &ldquo;We shall not operate this particular fishery that it is intended to acquire, even this year.&rdquo;  They might postpone the acquisition for a year and evade the obligation that this particular paragraph involves.  &ldquo;The whole or substantially the whole of each of the three complete open fishing seasons&rdquo;&mdash;that might be evaded by not employing any of these men for the whole of the present season.  It would be well to have some assurance that no advantage will be taken of a fault in construction; there might well be a flaw in the interpretation of this section.  I am told, for instance, that for the last year, at any rate, and probably for this year, although there is some doubt as to whether the fishing will be carried on by the Lax weir this year and whether the men who have been normally employed will be engaged for this current year, that it has been the practice for the company to engage the men in the ordinary way by the week, and then, during the season, possibly because the fishing was good, to put them on to some other form of engagement, but not employment in the ordinarily accepted sense. If that is the case this particular provision might rule out the persons concerned. I am also doubtful about the effects of paragraph (e) of the proposed new section, as to why a person who has lost nine months' work should be ruled out of compensation because he <Col N="1150" /> is employed for three months in another capacity by the same company. If the fishing season is a nine months' season and he is deprived of employment during that period, then, by virtue of the fact that he is employed for the other three months regularly by the company, he shall lose all compensation under this Bill.  That seems to me to be a real defect.  I cannot understand the reason for it, and I think that the Minister's explanation is by no means satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made it quite clear that he cannot consent to the proposals in my amendment.  He has gone some way towards meeting the case made, but I would ask him to bear in mind, if he cannot amend the amendment that he has put forward, these doubts as to the effect of the amendment and give the House some assurance that any fault in drafting or any flaw that may be discovered at some time, will not be allowed to be taken advantage of by the Electricity Supply Board in fulfilling the obligations that the section intends should be imposed upon them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will not adopt the absolutely new method of compensation which has been suggested by Senator Johnson.  Part of the compensation, the Senator says, ought to come out of the compensation that is given to the owner for his loss.  When you go before an honest arbitrator he has to measure the loss of each claimant who is claiming compensation for his own loss.  If an amendment, such as Senator Johnson has suggested, were made in the proposed new section introduced by the Minister, the result would be that an honest arbitrator would have to give compensation to the owner himself, plus whatever he would have to give to his own unemployed fishermen.  That, I submit, is absolutely absurd, because in the end the Electricity Supply Board would have to pay both, just as they will do when this amendment is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment, of course, provides that the compensation to be paid to these workmen will be paid by the Electricity Supply Board apart and distinct altogether from the <Col N="1151" /> sum paid to the owners of the fisheries. At the same time I am aware that some fishery owners on the Shannon, whose interests were acquired when the works were being constructed, did themselves, without being under any statutory obligation to do it, provide out of their compensation for the creation of a fund to pay some compensation to their workpeople who became unemployed. I agree that if we provide that compensation is to be paid to persons of this class, then that compensation must be paid by the body that acquires the fisheries, the body that is responsible for the changed circumstances, rather than by the person from whom the fishery is acquired.  The fact that the compensation is to be paid by the Electricity Supply Board rules out the possibility of evasion which Senator Johnson fears.  If the Electricity Supply Board does not acquire the fisheries forthwith then, obviously, it will be in the interests of the owners of the fisheries to fish them as fully as they can this year.  They stand to lose nothing by fishing them or to gain anything by failing to do so.  The value that would be derived from the operation of the fisheries would be far more, I think, than any charge that might arise, even if the compensation were to be paid by the former owner of the fishery, and not by the Electricity Supply Board.  The fact that it has to be paid by the Board and not by the former owner means that the former owner has no reason for not taking full advantage of the fisheries so long as he can.  In any event, I can assure the Senator that it is the desire and intention of the Electricity Supply Board to acquire all these major fisheries as soon as possible, so that their programme may be put into operation without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention of the amendment is to ensure that every person who is regularly employed on these fisheries and who loses that employment in consequence of the acquisition of the fisheries by the Board, that is, who is not re-employed by the Board, will be compensated on the basis set out.  I give the Senator the assurance that, if it should prove in practice that there <Col N="1152" /> is any flaw in the amendment which would deprive from getting compensation any person whom we intend should get it, the necessary amending legislation will be introduced forthwith. I do not think that any such flaw will be found to arise.  In any event, I think that the Electricity Supply Board will be more inclined to put a generous interpretation on its powers than the reverse in dealing with matters of this kind, because, obviously, it will be to its interest to secure and maintain the good will of everybody who has been previously associated with the operation of these fisheries.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to know if the Minister has anything to say on the point I raised last week in reference to certain fishermen who fish with snap nets on the Maigue.  They will be prohibited, by the operation of this Act, from doing so in future.  It may be said that as these are tidal waters they can claim no rights there: that they were simply exercising a public right, but at any rate, by the passing of this Act, they will be automatically deprived of any earnings they could make out of fishing there. I raised the matter last week.  The Minister promised to look into the position and perhaps he will now be able to give us some information as the result of his inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have gone into this matter and find that a couple of snap nets have been used in the tidal waters of the Maigue.  The fisheries there are, of course, public fisheries, and the snap nets have been used in the exercise of that public right.  The Senator is correct when he states that the operation of this Bill, when it becomes an Act, will make it impossible for those who have been accustomed to engage in snap net fishing in the tidal waters of the Maigue to continue to do so.  I have considered that matter <Col N="1153" /> and I have come to the conclusion that despite the fact it is not possible for us to delete the section which prohibits snap netting in tidal waters because of the consequences that would arise, mainly in the tidal waters of the Shannon rather than on the Maigue, at the same time we could not, of course, accept any proposal that persons should be compensated for being prevented from exercising what is a public right.  That would involve the adoption of a new principle which would be most undesirable.  I have considered how the particular case of the few men who are involved in this matter can be dealt with and I think we will be able to meet them all right.  The maximum number of licences for drift nets which the Bill allows is, in fact, in excess of the number of drift net licences which were issued last year or the year before, and I shall ask the Minister for Agriculture to provide, when making his regulations concerning the issuing of drift net licences, that, while the first preference in the issue of these licences will be given to those who had them in the past, the second preference will be given to those men who are snap net fishing in the tidal waters of the Maigue, so that they will be able to continue that fishing.</P>

      <P>On the Second Stage I commented on the absence from this section of a definition of &ldquo;alien,&rdquo; a word which is used in the side notes of a number of sections, and the <Col N="1154" /> President, in concluding the debate, indicated that an Aliens Bill was impending which would define aliens. I should like to know if the President could give us any idea as to when that Bill might be circulated because, I think, it has a bearing on this Bill. I do not want to anticipate the discussion on any other section, but the final amendment sets out that this Act shall not come into operation until such and such a date prescribed by the Minister, and there are terms in the Bill which, it seems to me, may not harmonise with that.  They are such things that operate on the passing of this Bill and if the Bill was delayed in its operation, until the Aliens Bill also became an Act, certain things that follow, according to the Bill as it stands, on its passing, might be affected by the time factor which might intervene between the passing and the coming into operation of the Bill, so that if this last amendment has any bearing on the operation of this Bill, I suggest that it would be well to have some indication of when the Aliens Bill is likely to be circulated, and, therefore, some idea as to when it might become law.</P>

The first sequence is <Col N="1157" /> lettered (a), (b) and (c).  The second sequence, I think, deals with a different matter, but it is lettered (d) and (e), and so is made to form part of the first sequence.

      <P>(a)  if such person is at the passing of this Act or becomes thereafter permanently resident in Saorstát Eireann, be deemed to be a natural-born citizen of Saorstát Eireann, or</P>

    <P>(b)  if such person at the passing of this Act is permanently resident outside Saorstát Eireann and is not a naturalised citizen of any other country, be deemed, upon being registered in accordance with the <Col N="1159" /> next following sub-section of this section, to be a natural-born citizen of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>(5)  No person whose right to be deemed to be a natural-born citizen of Saorstát Eireann under the next preceding sub-section of this section is made by that sub-section conditional on registration in accordance with this sub-section shall be deemed to be a natural-born citizen of Saorstát Eireann unless, within one year or, where the Minister (before or after the expiration of such year) because of special circumstances so permits, within two years after the passing of this Act, the name of such person is registered&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is the second of the substantive amendments and it is the amendment to which I referred on the Second Reading.  Its purpose is to take out of the section dealing with certificates of naturalisation and so forth the case of persons who were born in this country and who did not happen to be domiciled here and so become citizens under Article 3. The intention is that if they come in permanently to reside <Col N="1160" /> here, they shall be deemed to be natural-born citizens.  If, on the other hand, they remain outside the country and even become citizens of any other country, on registration they shall be deemed to be natural-born citizens.

      <P>I think the point I alluded to in regard to Section 1 arises on this, but I find it difficult to follow the phraseology or sequence of some of the points in this.  As a layman it strikes me that this might apply to many places where a similar phrase occurs.  I suggest, therefore, that the President or his advisers might look into this in the meantime and that the term &ldquo;at the passing of this Act&rdquo; might be substituted by &ldquo;at the coming into operation of this Act.&rdquo;  I take it that this law will not be enforced until it comes into operation. I gathered from what the President indicated that it will not come into force for about three months, so that the effective period, so far as I can gather, would not be two years but one year and nine months.  If the period was intended to be two years, it should be dated from the period when the Act comes into operation.  I think the consideration bearing on that will be found applicable to several places where these words &ldquo;at the passing of this Act&rdquo; occur.  I suggest that it might be looked into and, if my opinion is accurate, that the necessary changes might be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have a little more light on this section.  I called attention to this on the Second Stage and quoted from the President's statement when he suggested that the only purpose that this was intended to effect was that if a person, or the child or grandchild of a person, who had done signal honour or rendered distinguished service to the nation, applied for naturalisation, certain formalities would be dispensed with.  I suggested that, while sub-section (2) might bear out that view, sub-section (1) certainly gives it a much wider scope.  Sub-section 1 reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Executive Council may, if and whenever they so think proper, cause a certificate of naturalisation to be issued under this Act to any person or to a child or grandchild of any person who, in the opinion of the Executive Council, has done signal honour or rendered distinguished service to the Irish nation.</P>
      <P>There is, I think, a clear indication of spontaneous initiative on the part of the Executive Council without any request for naturalisation by the individual concerned; and if the intention is to confine the operation of this section to the purpose indicated by the President in the paragraph I cited on the Second Stage, then I say that that should be clearly and explicitly set out.  In any case, I do not expect that the President will agree with my view on that point; but, if not, then I suggest that we should get some more light on what exactly sub-section (1) is intended to convey or to cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further, I do not understand why the children or grandchildren of a person who has rendered distinguished <Col N="1164" /> service should come within the category of those favoured persons.  There must be some definite reason for this. If it is desired to dispense with certain formalities in the case of certain persons, I think we ought to know who they are.  They cannot be very numerous.  If, however, the purpose is merely to dispense with certain formalities in regard to distinguished aliens or non-citizens, or their children or grandchildren, I suggest that that should be very definitely set out.  It is a curious and novel provision that is proposed here. I read very carefully the passages in the Dáil Debates which dealt with that and certainly there seems to be an entire lack of convincing reason on the part of the President in his advocacy of this section.</P>
    <P>If the intended scope of this section is what he indicated, I think that he has gone much beyond that in the section as it stands at present.  If it is intended to be a process of conferring this as a recognition of merit, introducing some species of Order of Merit, I think it is a very poor substitute for anything of that kind.  If there is any person of another country who has rendered distinguished service to this nation or this State I think that merely to dispense with certain formalities and inscribe his name on the roll of citizens is a very poor attempt to show the appreciation that this nation should indicate for the services rendered.  If that is not the object that is in view, I do not see what the objective of the section is at all.  If it is intended to take away certain formalities in certain special cases when certain persons have made application for naturalisation, then I think it should be clearly set out that that is the specific purpose of the section.  At present it seems to have a much wider scope.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to give what I hope is the ordinary view of this section.  When I read this Section 5 it occurred to me that it lifted the Bill altogether out of the ordinary humdrum legislation in relation to nationality and that there was some imagination in the conception of it.  I <Col N="1165" /> recalled that a provision such as this must have existed in the laws of the great civilised States of the past.  I conceive that the intention is to do honour to people who have served this State, or whose fathers or grandfathers have served this State.  Senator Milroy asks why we should go back as far as the father or the grandfather. The reason is that a certain man may have served this State in the last year, or the last ten or fifteen years, and this service may not become known for 15, 20 or 40 years, because every man who serves this State does not blazon it about on the day he renders that service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>The hereditary principle exists here.  The next point made by Senator Milroy was: why should citizenship, as a matter of honour and dignity, be conferred upon a person unless he makes an application for citizenship? I wonder whether the Senator really means that to be taken seriously, because I think it would be very ridiculous, say, in the case of Themistocles if he had gone to Sparta and asked them to make him a citizen.  Citizenship which is conferred as a matter of distinction, as a matter of honour, as a reward for services, is given freely without being asked.  So far as I can read in this section, I think it is conceived according to the highest principles and that it is carried out in the proper way.  For that reason, I think there is no substance in the criticism which Senator Milroy has made of this section.</P>

      <P>I quoted it on the Second Stage.  In Column 1226, Volume 54 of the Dáil Debates of 13th December last the President is reported as saying:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In cases where an applicant for naturalisation is himself a person who has rendered, in the opinion of the Executive Council, signal services to the country, or, if a son or a grandson of such a person applies for naturalisation, is it not right that the Executive Council&mdash;it is not merely the Minister in this case&mdash;should be in a position to grant that naturalisation without insisting on the conditions imposed elsewhere?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is really what the section means. My only argument is that if that is all that is intended, the operation or power of the section should be limited to that.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Milroy is to be congratulated on raising this question.  I have not read the passages in the Dáil Debates which explain the Executive Council's intention regarding it, but on reading this particular section I had in mind the freedom-of-the-city sort of thing.  I assumed that the initiative in that case must come from the Executive Council, but I hesitate at once over the principle involved in this&mdash;that signal service done by a man might be honoured in the grandson-because once we begin to introduce that principle in matters of honour we are getting right back to hereditary Second Chambers and, perhaps, hereditary monarchies.  I, for one, am not inclined to accept that principle for a moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is something to be said for Senator Milroy's interpretation.  Perhaps the history of this would make it clear.  The intention was that where the son or grandson or the person himself had rendered signal service to the country and where he applied for a certificate of naturalisation that in such a case the ordinary conditions, responsibilities and so on should not be demanded. Then the question was if there was such a case, or if the Government had to deal with such a case, whether it was fair to ask that the person should formally apply?  Or if it came to the notice of the Executive Council that such a person wished to become a naturalised citizen, whether that person would have to apply in the ordinary way or whether there was to be more generous action on the part of the Executive Council by which they would dispense with the ordinary requirements or formalities? I do not think that the present Executive Council would hesitate before they would use it in a general way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case where the person wanted to become a citizen would have to be an outstanding one.  In such a case we should not proceed in the rather mean way of compelling the person to go through all the formalities which are required in the case of a complete stranger who had no association with the country that entitled him to special privileges in the matter.  There is, of course, the danger that a subsequent Executive Council might use it in quite a different way from the way in which it was intended when this section was drafted.  I would hesitate myself very much before I would put that section into operation and issue a certificate in such a way as one might get the freedom of a city.  However, as it stands, it can be used in that particular way.  The original intention was to dispense with the ordinary conditions in the case of a person who is the son or grandson of a person who did some outstanding service for the country.  It may happen that the son or grandson may have directly suffered as the result of what the father or grandfather did for the <Col N="1168" /> country.  By that action they might be said to have deserved well of the country.  They might have deserved well of the country themselves by reason of the sacrifices they might willingly or unwillingly have been compelled to make.  However, I do not think you are establishing the hereditary principle much in this.  As regards the other question, I think myself that we should meet the case half-way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>On this question I do not know whether a certificate of naturalisation confers citizenship.  That question did not occur to me until now. But if it does confer citizenship, that implies also the duties and responsibilities of citizenship.  If a certificate of naturalisation confers citizenship, then we should not confer citizenship on a person who is not prepared to accept the duties and liabilities of citizenship.  If we are to confer citizenship on a person with its rights and privileges as a mark of gratitude for what that person himself or his father or grandfather did, then citizenship must only be conferred on somebody who is living here and who accepts the responsibilities of living here, or on somebody who is in the service of the Government outside the country.  Something slightly different from that should be given, for it is something in the nature of a recognition or a mark of gratitude.  It is something like having conferred on one the freedom of a city, but that involves no liabilities and no acceptance of the responsibilities and an attitude of obedience towards the State.  From the discussion it seems to me that this is a matter that should be reconsidered on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator will look carefully at the Bill he will find that a naturalised citizen has the rights and obligations of a natural-born citizen.  Therefore, if this certificate is issued to anybody it does imply that the person accepting it will have the same obligations as the natural-born citizen. It is not intended to give privileges that do not imply obligations as well. I think the history of the whole <Col N="1169" /> scheme here indicates that it is intended to be a more generous dispensation in the case of the person to whom we are referring; just as if we said: &ldquo;All right, we will not insist on the other qualifications in your case.&rdquo;  On the other hand, it could only be given where the person to whom it is given is willing to accept the obligations of citizenship as well. I do not think that there was in mind anything such as is implied when the freedom of a city is given to one.  The words in the section really originated because the possible case was mentioned to me of where a person might wish to become a citizen.  I think, as a matter of fact, the case raised is covered in the Bill in the section as it stands.  I think the proper thing to do would be to dispense with the ordinary conditions, and if the ordinary conditions were dispensed with it would be only a case where the Executive Council happened to go a step farther.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is really a question of what was the intention.  If it is not the intention to make it something like the freedom of a city, then there should be some formal indication from the person that he wanted to be a citizen here and that he was prepared to accept the rights and duties of citizenship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that in some at least of the Constitutions of various European States which have been formed in the last 10 or 15 years you will find there is a provision of this kind and so far as I know it has not led to any great injury in any of those States.  Senator Johnson said there is time enough yet.  I think it would be very dangerous to give a certificate of naturalisation to a person which would entitle him to the rights of citizenship without any of its duties and obligations.  I think that would be a most inconsistent thing.  It is a thing which has no precedent so far as I know in the constitution relating to citizenship in any European State.  There is a clause similar to this&mdash;and I am sure I read it quite recently&mdash;in the Constitution and Citizenship Act of other European States.  When reading these things I <Col N="1170" /> understood the purpose was&mdash;I suppose it was a mixed purpose&mdash;to give some exceptional facilities to people who had done service to the particular State.  The exceptional facilities might be very small.  This is probably the smallest exceptional facility that could be given to any person who had done service to this State in the last 10, 15 or 20 years.</P>
      <P>I know nothing about its history or origin, but I would say that in one sense it indicates a desire to give to certain persons some small facilities for acquiring citizenship.  There might also be behind it the desire to give those facilities as some sort of mark of distinction, some sort of recognition. I do not know if that is the case but that is the view which I took of this section, having the advantage of construing it now without knowing how it originated.  I am construing the section now as we read it without knowing anything about its history in this Bill.  Looking at it now and reading it, I think this section ought to be retained without any alteration because it properly expresses what naturally is a sort of gesture to people who, or whose fathers or grandfathers, have suffered for this country or who have done some signal service to this country.  Now I would say to Senators &ldquo;Do not be afraid in this case of hereditary principles.&rdquo;  There are no such things as hereditary principles enshrined in this section at all.  As soon as Senator Johnson heard the words &ldquo;hereditary principles&rdquo; I could see his figure getting taut and his eye getting ready for battle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The President in explaining this said that it was not by any means the intention that a person, <Col N="1171" /> to whom a certificate is issued by the Executive Council, should not fulfil the obligations of citizenship but one of the conditions in Section 4, which the Executive may dispense with, is that the person intends after the certificate is issued to have his usual or principal place of residence in Saorstát Eireann and that such person has made a declaration of citizenship of Saorstát Eireann.  If those conditions may be dispensed with, then the President's intention is not being fulfilled.  Sub-section (2) says that the Executive Council may authorise the Minister to dispense with these conditions.  Some of the conditions are that the person shall declare his intention to accept the obligations of citizenship.  The President says that such person shall be obliged to accept them.  There seems to be a little inconsistency in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I did consider this whole question very carefully, and after full consideration I came to the conclusion that it was just as well to leave it as it stood.  We had, in fact, drafted a long amendment to make it appear that it was the original power, that it was purely a dispensing power. Then there was the other consideration that if we did dispense, we might as well do it generously and graciously. With regard to the obligations, I should like to consider that statement of Senator Johnson again.  I know we did exclude a person who was a number of years away from the country&mdash;in other words the residence qualification was not to be insisted upon on a number of occasions.  We shall probably come to that later however.</P>

      <P>As Section 5 stands at present it is in the power of the Executive Council without any notice&mdash;I was going to say to the victim&mdash;to the person whom they seek to honour, to confer on him a certificate of naturalisation. <Col N="1172" /> He will have to accept automatically and without his knowledge, obligations about which he knows nothing.  Perhaps the President would consider between this and the Report Stage if something could not be inserted in the section which would prevent that.

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>

I do not know, however, whether any difficulties would arise in relation to another citizenship.

In that case we would possibly create a double citizenship.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>In this very long section there is a great deal involved and more elucidation is essential in respect of some of the matters dealt with. Sub-section (2) says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whenever the Executive Council is satisfied that by virtue of the law for the time being in force in any country, citizens of Saorstát Eireann enjoy in such country ... all or any of the rights and privileges of citizens of such country, the Executive Council may by order declare ...&rdquo; certain things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I suggest is that all such orders should be laid on the table of each House and should be subject to approval or annulment.  In Section 26 there is a provision which would seem to <Col N="1181" /> indicate that that would be done, but I should like to be confirmed in that impression.  Section 26 says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may, by order, make regulations in relation to any matter or thing referred to in this Act as prescribed or to be prescribed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then it goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every regulation made by the Minister under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It does not seem to me to follow that it will be obligatory on the Executive Council to lay upon the Table the orders themselves, especially the orders bearing upon sub-section (2) of Section 23.  I think that that should be done&mdash;that we should know before such orders become operative what it is that the Executive Council has committed itself, or the State, to in respect of reciprocal privileges.  I suggest that that is a flaw in the structure of the Bill which could be remedied with advantage and which would make for the continuance of democratic control over Executive action. I take it that that will not be regarded as a controversial point, that this omission was unintentional and that it will be rectified before the Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the President what reciprocal privileges this State would propose to confer upon the citizens of another State.  It seems to me that, under sub-section (5) practically every privilege that our citizens enjoy in other countries could be negatived. I listened to the President discussing this matter in the other House and I read his statement in the Dáil Debates. He spoke in a general way of reciprocating privileges granted our citizens elsewhere, but he did not give any definite instances.  For instance, I take it that it is not intended to allow any non-national to enter into our Civil Service, our Army or our police force; and in certain matters dealing with the control of manufactures they are practically precluded from embarking upon industrial enterprise in this State.  I am not saying that these restrictions are not sound and conducive to internal <Col N="1182" /> stability.  What I ask is what are the privileges that this State is going to confer upon non-nationals in countries where our people enjoy wide and important privileges?  I should like the President to be more definite than he has been on these points.  I do not want to elaborate these matters, as I think I have said sufficient to indicate the point upon which I would like some light thrown.</P>
    <P>There is one other question on which I would like to have some further light thrown.  This sub-section (5) (c) of Section 26 reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Nothing in this section or any order made under this section shall operate</P>
    <P>(c)  to entitle any person to become or to be the owner of a ship or a share in a ship registered in Saorstát Eireann and having the status of a ship registered under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, unless such person is a citizen of a country between which and Saorstát Eireann, or between the Government of which and the Government of Saorstát Eireann, a convention exists and is in force by virtue of which citizens of such country are entitled to own any such ship or share in any such ship as aforesaid.</P>
    <P>This retains and emphasises the importance of the shipping register under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894. It is interesting to know what that status is.  That specifically lays down what is the status of ships owned by British citizens.  I want a statement from someone familiar with this matter, and who is acting as one of the advisers to the Government, as to whether the shipping register under this Citizenship Bill is embodied as the basis of the status of our ships.  The Shipping Act sets out that a naturally born British subject, and so on, comes within the category, in one way or another, of a British subject.  This Bill, I am aware, enables amendment to be made to the Shipping Acts if such is sought or desired.  But it seems to me&mdash;and I would like to have the opinion of someone conversant with the <Col N="1183" /> legal side&mdash;that we are retaining the Shipping Act in this Bill <i>holus bolus</i> without any variation whatever.  Are we not, in effect, making the status of ships registered in Saorstát Eireann the status of British ships in this section? If that is so, it seems to me to be at variance with the spirit of the declaration made by the sponsor of this Bill.  This British Shipping Act of 1894 makes it clear that no ship registered within the British Dominions or Commonwealth can be owned, or in part owned, by other than citizens of the Commonwealth.  I should like to have some elucidation of the law in the latter part of this section.  Can we make a convention with some non-Commonwealth State and by such convention enable the citizens of that State to own ships within this State? It seems to me that if we stand on this Shipping Act without any amendment we are doing something that will render the section inoperative.  I am not raising this matter from any controversial point of view.  I am raising it because the matter seems to me to be ineffective as it stands.  My interpretation may be entirely inaccurate and, if so, I would like the matter cleared up so that we may be quite sure that this section is going to effect what it purports to do or what the Government expect it would do under this Bill. Personally, I cannot see how it is going to be incorporated in this Bill without some amendment adapted to the circumstances of Saorstát Eireann if it is to be effective and I would like to have some further light thrown upon the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>First, with regard to the mutual rights and privileges.  It is intended to confer upon people of other countries with whom we have a convention by which our citizens are accorded certain rights, rights similar to those accorded to our people. What we say is that in such a case the convention itself would set forth those rights.  The rights that would be accorded by us would be similar to those and, therefore, would be specified in the convention.  The convention would set out the rights and privileges <Col N="1184" /> of both sides.  It would be bi-lateral or multi-lateral, but usually bi-lateral. What this Bill says is that where such a convention is entered into the citizens of the other country would be accorded rights and privileges similar to the rights and privileges accorded by the other country concerned. Where by law our citizens in another country enjoy certain privileges, then in that case the Executive Council would order, by virtue of that, that the citizens of the other country would be accorded similar privileges here. I cannot tell you what the privileges in general are, but whatever they may be, similar privileges would be conferred on the citizens of the other country here.  As Senators will notice, we have excluded certain cases in other sections.  We have done that deliberately.  The first case is that of a group of qualified persons, as somebody suggested we should call them in these new Acts instead of using the existing phraseology.  This does not confer rights that are specially restricted to a certain group or class.  The next is that it does not enable a woman, for instance, who might not become an Irish citizen or who might marry an Irish citizen and, if British law remained as it is in that regard, might be regarded as a British citizen and therefore coming in indirectly to share in the privileges accorded only to our citizens or to citizens of another country with which we have relations.  In other words, if her title, so to speak, to be regarded as a British subject was, by British law, to be deduced from her marrying somebody regarded as a British subject, that would not enable her to get the rights here that would otherwise be conferred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third case is the one to which Senator Milroy referred at length. That is the case of a ship.  As the Senator is aware, we have an agreement with regard to rights hitherto accorded to British ships, provided they are completely Irish-owned.  In virtue of that convention, these rights are not to be accorded to ships which were not completely Irish-owned, and we say that unless by a special convention a right of this sort were <Col N="1185" /> accorded, this general section would not cover such a case.  Senator Milroy, of course, is right in this: that if the present arrangement continued we could not enter into a convention with another country without agreement with the States with which we already have this existing convention.  I think there is nothing that need be changed. It is simply a matter of protecting an existing convention and saying that unless a new convention were arranged such a ship would not be accorded the privileges which Irish-owned ships at present enjoy.  There would be a barrier, however, to our making an agreement with other countries unless we made it by agreement with the States with which we have an existing convention.</P>

      <P>The President did not deal with the point raised by Senator Milroy regarding the orders made under this section.  Section 26 makes it obligatory to lay upon the Table regulations of various kinds, some of which might be important and some of which might be merely formal and would probably be automatic.  This is a much more important matter, however, and I think it would be necessary to make it obligatory that an order under this section should be laid upon the Table, if only to give a formal opportunity to either House to discuss the making of that order and the conditions specified in the order. I take it that the President has no objection to this section making it obligatory to lay an order upon the Table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Johnson is quite right in saying that I did not deal with that point.  I meant to do so but was switched on to some other point and forgot to deal with it.  It does seem to me that there is a case for laying this on the Table of both Houses.  At the same time, Senators will remember that, in the first place, there is the convention itself which, <Col N="1186" /> in all probability, would be a matter to be discussed by Parliament.  Therefore, the terms of that would imply this other, and consequently there is no order in that case.  Then, in regard to the order, which would be issued by the Executive, where certain privileges are conferred by law in the case of other countries, any such order would have to give similar privileges to the others.  I see no great objection at any rate to having that section amended in that respect.  Accordingly, I shall try to have it done on the Report Stage.</P>

    <P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment No. 21:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 27 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>27.  The Minister, or the Minister for External Affairs, or any diplomatic or consular officer authorised in that behalf by the Minister for External Affairs may, upon the application of any person who is a citizen (other than a naturalised citizen) of Saorstát Eireann and upon payment by such person of the prescribed fee, issue to such person a certificate in writing stating that such person is, at the date of such certificate, a citizen of Saorstát Eireann.</P>

      <P>It was thought that it might at times be desirable that a certificate should be available for a person who might want to prove his or her nationality abroad, and this gives power for the issuance of such a certificate. I find that the Departments concerned would prefer if the amendment ran &ldquo;The Minister for External Affairs&rdquo; without bringing in the Minister for Justice, who is the Minister in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am sure the House will agree to the deletion of the words &ldquo;The Minister, or&rdquo; and let it read &ldquo;The Minister for External Affairs....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Amendment, as altered, agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 27 to 31, inclusive, agreed to.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment No. 22:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 32.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  This Act shall come into operation on such day as the Minister shall, by order made after consultation with the Minister for External Affairs, appoint.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it might be as well to leave this amendment over until the Report Stage.  I would like to have it reconsidered in the light of the remarks made by Senator Milroy. I may have to amend this so as to meet Senator Milroy.</P>
      <P>Further consideration of amendment adjourned to Report Stage.</P>
