      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Section 9, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;proper&rdquo; in line 20 to add the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided always that before exercising such power of demise or letting the Board shall give to each of the following persons, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  the owner or owners from whom the Board has acquired any fishery or fisheries or fishing right or fishing rights;</P>
      <P>(2)  the person or persons (if any) who at the date at which the Board acquired such fishery or fisheries or fishing right or fishing rights was or were the lessee or lessees or tenant or tenants thereof; and</P>
      <P>(3)  the person or persons (if any) other than such owner or lessee or tenant who at the time when the Board is about to exercise such power of demise or letting is in occupation of the bank of the river opposite or from which the said fishery or fisheries or fishing right or fishing rights can be enjoyed;</P>
      <P>a notice in writing stating the nature and particulars of the proposed demise or letting, and the last day on which tenders for the acceptance of the proposed demise or letting will be received by the Board.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I move this amendment in lieu of the <Col N="1095" /> second amendment which I moved on the Committee Stage, as I saw that that amendment did not really meet the case.  The amendment is intended to ensure that any person who may have had an interest in the amenities of any fishing which is acquired compulsorily by the Board shall have a fair opportunity of reacquiring such fishing by bidding for it in the ordinary commercial way.  This amendment does not purport to give any particular advantage to anybody.  The fishing is in the market and the Board will very probably get the best bid they can.  This is only to ensure that those who have been connected with any particular fishing beforehand shall have an opportunity of resuming those amenities if they think fit to pay for them what is necessary.</P>
    <P>As to No. (1), obviously the prior owner is a person who should have an opportunity of resuming the amenity. As to No. (2), the person who was a tenant of such fishery might have been the tenant for many years and might have really a greater interest in the amenities of it and the sentimental side of it than the owner.  As to No. (3), such a person obviously should be considered. He will not have the fishing beforehand, but he lives there and is obviously a party whose interests ought reasonably to be considered and he ought to be given a fair opportunity. I hope the Minister will see his way to accept the amendment, which does not in any way curtail the rights of the Board to get the best offer they can in an open market.  This is just to ensure that those people who have association with such fisheries should have a fair opportunity of bidding for a fishery.</P>

      <P>I am in some difficulty in respect of this amendment.  Senator Bagwell's original amendment on the Committee Stage was one of those which I undertook to consider with a view to seeing whether it was possible to adopt them in any form which would <Col N="1096" /> meet the intentions of their movers.  I arranged to have an amendment prepared which I thought would go some way to meet Senator Bagwell's point and also the idea of Senator Johnson, as expressed in his amendment, No. 2 on the Order Paper, to-day.  These amendments were not completed until yesterday and, consequently, they were not available for consideration to-day.  It might be possible to arrange to deal with these other amendments upon the Order Paper to-day, then adjourn the Report Stage, and on the next day on which the Seanad is to meet consider the two amendments which will be brought forward to meet the points raised.  I should say, for the information of Senator Bagwell, that the amendment I would have made would be one requiring the Electricity Supply Board to give adequate notice by publication in the newspapers circulating in the locality of its intention and desire to make a letting of any fishery in the district.  I think Senator Bagwell's amendment that notice in writing should be sent to certain parties would be undesirable inasmuch as the failure to give this notice to any of the parties might invalidate the subsequent letting. That would be an undesirable position.  I think it would meet Senator Bagwell's point and protect the interests of the parties who have a concern in these fisheries if publication, a reasonable time in advance of the date on which the Board proposes to make the letting, is made in at least two newspapers circulating in the locality.  If, therefore, the Seanad would postpone this amendment now and have the Report Stage on a subsequent date, adjourning the consideration of the matter to-day, I could arrange to have an amendment prepared which would meet the Senator's point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>I leave myself entirely in the Minister's hands.  I think the amendment the Minister has outlined to the House will probably meet the case, for though it does not directly ensure that those concerned will see those notices, still if they are particularly <Col N="1097" /> interested they can very easily, if not on the spot, depute someone to look after the matter for them.  I am quite satisfied to leave my amendment to stand over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 14, sub-section (4).  To insert before the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4)  In any case where a fishery or fishing right is being acquired by the Board, either by agreement or compulsorily, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say: compensation shall be payable by the Board to every person&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  who, for a period of not less than three months during the twelve months immediately preceding the date of acquisition, was employed by the owner of the property which is being acquired; or</P>
      <P>(b)  who, for a period of not less than three months in each of any three consecutive years since the 1st day of October, 1929, was employed by the owner of the property which is being acquired and was deprived of such employment by reason of injury to the fishery or fishing right in respect of which a price or compensation is being paid;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>and whose earnings from such employment during that period formed the whole or a substantial part of the livelihood of such person.  The amount of the compensation to be paid under this sub-section shall be such sum as, in the case of a property which is being acquired compulsorily, the arbitrator, or, in the case of a property which is being acquired by agreement, the Minister (or a person nominated by him), shall consider reasonable having regard to the loss of livelihood suffered by the aforesaid employed person in consequence of the acquisition of such fishery or fishery right by the Board, regard being had also to the likelihood of such person <Col N="1098" /> being continued in the employment of the Board.</P>
    <P>This proposed new section is an alternative to the sub-section I had on the last Order Paper.  This alternative arises from an observation that was made by the Minister regarding the Lax Weir, saying that there had been, in fact, for the last year or two, no fishing; so that my original proposal would automatically have ruled out some of the very men I had in mind.  Consequently, I put forward an alternative which was intended to cover the men who had been employed by such organisation before the failure of that part of the fishing.  I understand the Minister has drafted an alternative proposal which may be acceptable. But I want to deal with the matter in a little broader way.  I assume that this will be dealt with in the same way as the last amendment&mdash;that is to say, it will be finally deferred until next week.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to the position of people who have been deprived of their employment by reason of the fact that where certain fishing rights have been given up, certain compensation has either been given or is about to be given. Even these two amendments of mine would not cover all such persons.  I think it is essential or it is certainly desirable that such persons should be included in any amendment that is going to be inserted in the Bill.  At the last meeting of the Seanad the Minister made a statement to the following effect: &ldquo;The fisheries between Parteen Villa and Killaloe have been acquired. They will be transferred to the Electricity Supply Board when this Bill will be enacted.&rdquo;  I cannot understand that.  I cannot understand their being acquired and not being put into possession of the Board.  Perhaps the Minister would enlighten us on that, because it seems to me it would affect the language that should be incorporated in such an amendment.  If these fisheries have been acquired by somebody and not transferred to the Electricity Supply Board, then the question of acquisition, which is the phrase used in these amendments, would have a doubtful meaning.  I <Col N="1099" /> want to include, if possible, the right of the men who have been for years employed as boatmen.  That is to say, the persons who have lost their employment. The persons who own the right of fishing in and about Castleconnell and some other parts of the river have quite clearly and demonstrably lost an income by virtue of the failure of the fishery in a particular portion. As I understand it, compensation has either been paid or is agreed to be paid to these.  So far again as I understand it, there has been no provision made that part of such compensation should go to the men who have really lost their employment.  No provision has yet been made to recompense such men in any way.</P>
    <P>I happened across an important authority on such matters in a discussion on a similar subject in 1930.  That authority said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The attitude of the Minister towards the Killaloe fishermen seems to be altogether unjustifiable.  He talks about a general principle and says they have no special right, because anybody may come in and fish where they are fishing.  The real fact is that there are 20 or 30 people who have been fishing there, and they have followed this particular occupation as their source of livelihood. Now, by public action, this livelihood is going to be taken away. It is by the action of this State that is being done.  Whatever general principles may be adduced in favour of neglecting them, the fact is that these 20 or 30 individuals are now going to be deprived of their livelihood on the River Shannon by State action.  I do not know whether this Bill is such that we could propose to it an amendment dealing with compensation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, that was a statement made by Deputy de Valera on the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill, 1930.  It was made on the 5th June, 1930 (Volume 35 and column 585 of the Official Debates).  It applies not only to the men who were immediately under discussion, but applies with treble force to the men who were for <Col N="1100" /> years employed on these fisheries by the lessees of the fishing rights.  By the failure of that fishery in that particular locality, these men who own the rights apparently get compensation or are likely to get compensation, but no provision has yet been made for recompensing the men who lost their employment.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister in any amendment that he will introduce or agree to will not exclude men of that character.  It seems to me that the very Bill under which this discussion took place covered an analogous case in that of men who were employed for wages in electricity undertakings which were being closed down by the action of the Board.  They were compensated and were entitled to compensation under the 1930 Act.  It seems to me there is a perfect analogy but, apart from any verbal analogy, the case in equity and justice is impregnable. I think there can be no answer whatever to the case that these men have made, and I hope will continue to make, if their claim for compensation, or at least for a share of the compensation that is to be paid to the owners, is not met.  That share should be provided for in making any assessment of compensation.  I think, a Chathaoirligh, that the discussion on this cannot come to a conclusion to-day, that it will be postponed until next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has considered, and is still considering, the recommendations made last week on behalf of the workmen employed in these various fisheries.  Compensation has been given to owners of fisheries which were injured.  That was under the Acts of 1925 and 1927.  It is now proposed to give compensation to the owners of fisheries which are to be acquired and the Minister is, I think very properly, considering the question of giving reasonable compensation to the workmen who will be put out of employment <Col N="1101" /> by reason of the acquisition of the fisheries.  When I say reasonable compensation, of course I mean compensation having regard to the fact that probably they will be re-employed and may get work elsewhere.  There is then a class of men who seem to be left out of the general plan, namely, workmen employed by the owners of fisheries whose fisheries have been injured as the result of operations carried on under the Acts of 1925 and 1927.  The owners of the fisheries are to get compensation for the injury, and some men have been put out of employment&mdash;not very many, I suppose; I do not know how many&mdash;but the logic of the situation would seem to be that if workmen employed on fisheries that are to be acquired are to receive compensation, then workmen who are thrown out of employment by reason of the operations that injured the fisheries ought to receive reasonable compensation.  Of course I only mention that matter for the consideration of the Minister in the open House here.  I do not want to approach the Minister privately or by way of deputation; I am putting it forward here for the consideration of the Minister.  I think that is practically what Senator Johnson has proposed, but I think I would go further in saying that it is quite possible to do this by the insertion of a few words in any new amendment which the Minister may consider it right to introduce.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained, it is my intention to have moved an amendment which will provide compensation on a certain basis for any workmen who may become disemployed in consequence of the acquisition of a Shannon fishery by the Electricity Supply Board and in cases where such workmen had a certain continuity of employment in the Shannon fishing industry.  I gather that what Senator Johnson wants to achieve, however, is that not merely will these people be compensated but also any person who may have lost his employment during the past eight or nine years in consequence of damage done to a Shannon fishery by the construction of the Shannon hydro-electric works.  That is <Col N="1102" /> something to which I could not possibly agree.  The Shannon Electricity Act of 1925 provided for the payment of compensation to persons whose fisheries were damaged and the payment of compensation to other persons whose fisheries were acquired in connection with the construction of the works.  It would be, I think, entirely impracticable to go back now to every one of these cases for the purpose of compensating, regardless of present circumstances, any worker who may have become disemployed in consequence of the operation of that Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the amendment does not deal with such a case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's amendment proposes to go back to the 1st October, 1929.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>But the fishery must have been acquired by the Board: &ldquo;In any case where a fishery or fishing right is being acquired.&rdquo;  That is the gravamen of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite, but the proposal is that wherever a fishery has been damaged and compensation is payable to the owner of the fishery in consequence, instead of paying compensation for that damage, the fishery will be acquired.  I gathered from Senator Johnson that he wants to provide in any such case that not merely will the workers who may become disemployed by the acquisition of the fisheries be compensated, but also any worker who may have become disemployed in consequence of damage to the fishery since 1929.  The proposal which I would put forward would be to compensate workers who become disemployed in consequence of the operation of this Bill.  I do not think it is possible for us to go back and endeavour to repair now whatever consequences the earlier enactments of the Oireachtas may have had.  Whatever Senators may think of the wisdom of the earlier enactments and the effect of them, they were put into operation and various consequences followed.  It is not, I think, now wise to go back because if we were to do so we would open a very wide field indeed and <Col N="1103" /> appear to give a basis for claims for compensation to many people whose interests were adversely affected by the construction or the operation of the Shannon scheme other than workers employed in the fisheries. Persons who suffered in some cases severe consequential damage from the operation or the construction of the scheme were not given the right to compensation under the earlier Acts. We are proposing now that where workers become disemployed in consequence of the operation of this Bill, that is the acquisition of fisheries by the Electricity Supply Board, compensation will be paid if the circumstances justify it.  I make that qualification because the fact is that a very large number of the workers who were employed on the fisheries are casual workers in every sense.  Their ordinary avocations and ordinary sources of income are not the work they get on the fisheries.  They work on these fisheries only for a short period in each year.  The cases in which the income derived from that work would constitute the main source of livelihood of the individual would not be many.  In the case of the Lax Weir, for example, the procedure was that, apart from a small permanent staff, when seasonal operations required a considerable addition, casual workers were recruited through the Labour Exchange.  The workers employed in any one year might never have been employed before on that work and might never be employed again.  I do not think that casual workers of that type could substantiate a claim to compensation because the weir on which they did get that occasional work has been acquired by another body.  Where a worker was employed with any degree of regularity, where the income he got from that work was an important part of his means of livelihood, then compensation would be payable on a fixed basis if his employment should terminate.  Compensation would not be payable if the worker merely transferred from one employer to another and became an employee of the Electricity Supply Board.  Perhaps we can leave the discussion of <Col N="1104" /> that matter over until the amendment I have prepared is before Senators, when they will be able to see what it is intended to provide for.</P>
      <P>I should like to clarify one point raised by Senator Johnson.  He referred to fisheries acquired in connection with the construction of the works and not yet transferred to the Electricity Supply Board.  These fisheries are, for the most part, of no value now. The Senator will remember that the construction of the electricity supply works on the Shannon was not undertaken by the Electricity Supply Board but by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He acquired the property and constructed the works and, only when construction was completed, were they handed over to the Electricity Supply Board.  The fisheries which were destroyed in consequence of flooding by the damming up of the waters have remained the property of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. They were not transferred to the Electricity Supply Board and they will not be transferred until this Bill shall have become law and that particular section can be put into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Acquisition will not cover these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They have already been acquired.  They had to be acquired before the works could be constructed. They have been acquired for about ten years.  The fishermen concerning whom the President was speaking in 1930&mdash; the Senator quoted his remarks&mdash;were, however, in an entirely different class from any fishermen we have been discussing in relation to the operation of this Bill.  These fishermen were not employed by anybody.  They were people who occasionally supplemented their income by exercising a public right of fishing in the waters around Killaloe.  There was a certain stretch of water there upon which there was a public right of fishing, and these people availed of that right and, no doubt, derived a certain income from their activities.  They had, however, no claim to compensation, because the right which they were no longer able to exercise, the fisheries having been <Col N="1105" /> destroyed, was a public right&mdash;a right which anybody here could exercise just as well as they did.  In fact, quite a number of the people concerned in that matter had other sources of income of various kinds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the men employed by the owners of fisheries, there are, I think, very few in respect of whom any real hardship resulted, inasmuch as they were found other employment as bailiffs, or in some other way in connection with the river, or were compensated by the owners from whom the fisheries had been acquired. The case for which we are proposing to provide now is the clearly defined case in which people who had certain regularity of employment in this class of work, that employment representing a main source of their income in the course of the year, were deprived of that employment in consequence of the new conditions on the Shannon.  I do not think we should extend the scope of the compensation proposals to include others than such persons.</P>
      <P>Further consideration of the amendment postponed.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 postponed.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 (Government Amendment):</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 18 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>18.&mdash;(1)  The Minister for Agriculture may, if he thinks fit, at any time by order authorise the Board, for the purpose of acquiring statistical information and the purpose of carrying out scientific investigations or for either of those purposes, to close, at such times, during such periods, and in such manner as he may specify in such order, the free gap in any specified weir in the waters of the Shannon fisheries.</P>
      <P>(2)  Whenever the Minister for Agriculture by order under this section authorises the Board to close the free gap in any weir in the waters of the Shannon fisheries, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1106" /> (a)  notwithstanding anything contained in the Fisheries Acts, 1842 to 1925, it shall be lawful for the Board to close such free gap under and in accordance with such order;</P>
    <P>(b)  Section 10 of the Fisheries (Ireland) Act, 1845 shall not apply in respect of any obstruction placed in such free gap by the Board under and in accordance with such order.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with Section 9 of the Fisheries Act, 1863, every weir owner must maintain a free gap to allow a share of the fish to go up the river.  The Electricity Supply Board have represented the necessity for the temporary closing of the free gap if they are to have any means of counting the salmon which pass up the river and also for the purpose of scientific research.  Hitherto, there has been no means of ascertaining the number of salmon in the river, all existing statistics relating to catches. The Department of Agriculture are in agreement with the principle of this amendment which, it will be observed, provides that the Minister for Agriculture will determine where and for what period the free gap will be closed. Our information is that this method of scientific investigation has been utilised on a large scale elsewhere, particularly in Alaska and British Columbia, where the salmon fisheries are a very valuable industry.  The second part of the amendment is necessary as one of the provisions of the Fisheries Act, 1863, enabled a police inspector or, now, a member of the Gárda, to remove any obstruction in the free gap.  The whole purpose of the amendment is to enable the salmon fishing industry in the Shannon to be put upon a scientific basis and to facilitate the ascertaining of information necessary to do that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 22.  To add at the end of the section the words &ldquo;provided <Col N="1107" /> that this section shall not apply for a period of three years after the passing of this Act to any person or the successors in title of a person who during the period of twelve months preceding the passing of this Act has lawfully exercised a right of fishing with a snap net in such tidal waters.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment relates to Section 22, which prohibits fishing with a snap net in the tidal waters.  Section 21 restricts the number of licences to fish with nets in the tidal waters in the future to the number of persons or bodies that have been fishing for the last year or two years.  Under other provisions of the Bill, the Abbey fishermen are being deprived of their right to fish in the fresh waters and are to receive compensation for their property and for loss of employment.  By virtue of Section 21, they will not be allowed to fish in the tidal waters with snap nets and, of course, they will not be allowed to fish with any other kind of nets because the number of licences is to be restricted.</P>
    <P>Now the position of the Abbey fishermen, as I understand it, is, at present, as it was for many years past, that they have a right to fish in the fresh water of the Shannon; but they had also the additional public right of fishing in tidal waters in the Shannon estuary.  Portion of their earnings has come from the exercise of the right to fish in the tidal waters with snap nets.  What is proposed to be done by this Bill is: Where the right of fishing in fresh water is taken away they have a right to compensation for the loss of that right and certain earnings as workmen.  But they are to be deprived also of the right to fish in the tidal waters with snap nets and any other kind of net.  We are, thereby, depriving these fishermen of certain rights, which, it seems to me, they have exercised along with the rest of the public, by not including them in the number in Section 21 of licences that may be issued.  So that part of their earnings is taken away for which they get no compensation at all.  There is no compensation for being deprived of the right of snap-net <Col N="1108" /> fishing in tidal waters.  I think that is quite unfair, and some provision should be made to allow these men compensation for the loss of their livelihood so far as these tidal waters are concerned.  They should get an equivalent to their loss.  Whether snap-net fishing is a desirable thing or not is not a matter upon which I am speaking now, but I am suggesting that a three-year period should pass before prohibition becomes effective in the case of people who have been fishing with snap nets in the last twelve months.</P>
    <P>Another matter has been brought to my notice which I think is worthy of consideration but has not yet been mentioned publicly, as far as I know. There are a number of poor men fishing the Maigue river with snap nets and I think this Bill will deprive these men of their rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>If that assumes that they are not going to be acquired it only shows how difficult it is to understand the sections of this Bill unless we understand more clearly what is to be the general policy of the Board.  If fishermen in the Maigue and other waters are to be allowed to continue to fish with snap nets then the Minister is right.  But if snap-net fishing is so disastrous in other parts of the Shannon, I cannot understand how it is found to be unobjectionable in the Maigue.  These are matters no doubt that the Minister will take into account. If there are fishermen fishing for a long time, who are to be deprived of their rights, something certainly should be done on their behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole answer to Senator Johnson's two points is this. First, the Abbey fishermen have no <Col N="1109" /> rights of fishing in tidal waters independent of the public rights; and, secondly, it would be obviously useless, even worse than useless, to spend large sums of money and go to great trouble to acquire the private rights of fishing in fresh waters, if we were to allow an unrestricted amount of fishing in the tidal waters.  It is not that snap net fishing in tidal waters is going to be disastrous.  What would be disastrous to the whole idea and policy contemplated by this Bill would be an increase in the number of nets in the tidal estuary consequent upon the acquisition under this measure of the privately-owned fisheries.  The Senator raised this point in Committee.  He made some reference to the Lax Weir, and intimated that there had been some dispute between the Lax Weir and the Abbey fishermen concerning certain rights of fishing with nets in portion of the tidal waters.  The Lax Weir fishery is a several fishery which is exclusive of public rights created by title recognised by the courts.  It stretches along portion of the river from a little distance above Limerick Town, in tidal waters.  The Abbey fishery is another stretch of the river above the Lax Weir, and there is between the two a very small stretch of the river, not more than 100 yards, along which a public right to fish exists, and where the Abbey fishermen have been fishing occasionally with snap nets in the exercise of that public right.  I cannot find that it is possible for either the Lax Weir Company or the Abbey fishery to put forward any sustainable claim to the ownership of that fishery. It is a public fishery.  The operation of this section is not directed against the Abbey men in any sense.  The whole purpose of this section is to ensure that the amount of net fishing in the tidal waters will not increase in consequence of the acquisition of other fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Abbey fishermen have fished and do fish in the estuary below the Lax Weir, which is a several fishery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No licence to fish in the estuary with snap nets was issued since 1927.  That is why the proposal here is <Col N="1110" /> to issue no more licences for snap net fishing.  The number of licences for drift nets and draft nets will enable those who had them in the past year to get them again, but will not permit an increase.  It would be reasonable to expect after the Abbey fisheries are acquired that the people who exercised the right to fish there would probably take out licences for net fishing in tidal waters, and you would have just as much fishing going on, if not a lot more than ever went on before, with the result that all the measures that had been taken to improve the value of the fisheries and to protect them would have been nullified by that increase in net fishing.  That is the basis of the Bill &mdash;to restrict the amount of net fishing to the same number of licences as has been issued in recent years.  The Abbey fishermen have a right of fishing with snap nets in fresh waters. That right is exercised by them only, and can only be taken from them on payment of compensation for depriving them of such rights.</P>

      <P>Yes, fresh waters.  If they have fished in tidal waters, they have done so in the exercise of a public right and, obviously, it is a matter for the Oireachtas to decide to what extent a public right is to be interfered with; but if we do interfere with it we cannot provide for compensation.</P>

    <Title>Reclamation of Land&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Seanad requests the Executive Council to cause an examination to be made of the tidal inlets in County Dublin with a view to ascertaining&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the acreage of land capable of reclamation in such inlets or any of them;</P>
      <P>(b) the cost of such reclamation;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1111" /> (c) the proportion of such cost that would be expended in labour and the relief of unemployment afforded thereby; and</P>
    <P>(d) the value of the reclaimed land for agricultural or forestry purposes.</P>
    <P>I have been told, a Chathaoirligh, that this motion would be more suitable for discussion before the Dublin County Council and that, if I intended to have it discussed in this House, I should have included the coastline of the whole country.  That, possibly, is correct in other circumstances, but my reason for definitely naming the coastline of County Dublin is that the Board of Works issued an invitation for suggestions as to relief schemes in any particular place.  That was my reason for the motion and, furthermore, that as this coastal reclamation, as far as the Government is concerned at all events, must be only an experiment, I believed that the County Dublin would be the best place to try out that experiment.  I have been told also that my resolution is too vague and that I should have put down more definite requests to the Government to start work on this scheme immediately. I do not think, however, that the putting of the resolution in that form would have any greater effect.</P>
    <P>My object is to point out how unemployment can be relieved and to induce the Government to adopt a scheme which will give a return for the money expended on it; a scheme which will secure hundreds of acres of valuable land which will be a national asset for forestry and agricultural purposes. The coastline of County Dublin must be familiar to most citizens, and I am sure that it has occurred to them, as it has occurred to me, how easy it seems to reclaim a very big stretch of land along that coast, particularly as the inlets in many cases are very small.  It would secure hundreds of acres of very valuable land, which has been done in other parts of the country.  If you look along that coast, you will see that, when the tides are in, there is a big stretch of country completely covered with water, and <Col N="1112" /> that when the tide is out there is nothing but a stretch of land covered with mud and with very little water in any part of it.  When you think of that, it is very difficult to understand why the reclamation of that land has not been undertaken by private enterprise long before now.</P>
    <P>There are many places along the coast which could be reclaimed, but I shall only refer to two in the County Dublin, and they are Malahide and Rogerstown.  The inlets in those places are very narrow, and I am sure that hundreds of acres could be reclaimed with a very small outlay. Coastal reclamation is not new.  It has been carried out in most of the countries of Europe, notably Holland. Thousands of acres have been reclaimed in that country along the banks of the Zuyder Zee.  In Southern Italy the whole new province of Littoria has been created from reclaimed land under the Mussolini régime.  In England reclamation work is going on in the Fen district, and a scheme is being prepared to reclaim the whole area of the Wash.  In this country we have somewhere about 5,000 acres of land reclaimed in the County Wexford. Previous to that reclamation, that area was a whole stretch of mud-banks, but now that 5,000 acres is the most fertile grazing land in the country.</P>
    <P>The Government and public authorities are paying thousands of pounds in relief every week to able-bodied men who cannot find work.  This unemployment benefit&mdash;this free beef and free milk&mdash;no matter how you describe it, must always bear the stamp of charity.  It is demoralising and should be stopped, and work, as far as possible, should be found for those able-bodied men.  Irish labourers, up to now at least, never wanted charity and never would accept it.  In my native county, in my young days, even the poorest of the poor would sooner starve than accept outdoor relief.  I am afraid, however, that times are changing and if this system of unemployment relief, and free beef and free milk, continues, it will not be work that the labourers will be looking for, and it is not work that they will accept.  They will try to continue to <Col N="1113" /> live on relief and it is not work that they will look for.  Neither will their children look for work, but they will follow the example of their fathers and live on charity and relief.</P>
    <P>President Roosevelt has correctly described this policy of doling out unemployment relief to able-bodied men as a narcotic and a subtle destroyer of the human spirit.  That is also the opinion of all thinking people.  There are many schemes which could be adopted to relieve unemployment and which would give a return for the money expended upon them.  I have in mind such schemes as the draining of waterlogged land and the planting of shelter belts.  Under present circumstances drainage and other work on the farm cannot possibly be undertaken by the farmers.  They have no money to pay even for necessary work. I think that sort of work should be assisted in some way by the Government. As regards the hundreds of thousands of acres throughout the country that are waterlogged, it might be advisable if the Government initiated a system of drainage and I am sure most farmers would be satisfied to pay portion of the money that would be expended, in the shape of increased annuities.</P>
    <P>There are other schemes which could be undertaken, such as giving portion of the wages which the farmer would expend on work over and above the ordinary routine business on his farm, work such as scouring ditches and other things of that sort.  If a farmer were to employ men who are at present getting unemployment relief, as distinct from those who are his constant workmen, he should get portion of the wages he would pay to those people.  Anything would be better than this policy of paying men to remain idle.  They could adopt some scheme whereby men getting unemployment relief would be given three days' work at something more than the prevailing agricultural rate. I appeal to the Government to initiate some scheme to relieve unemployment and put an end to the demoralising <Col N="1114" /> effect that the dole is bringing about all over the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second the motion.  We have ample evidence everywhere of the demoralising effect of the doles.  No later than this week the superintendent of home assistance told the County Wexford Board of Health that there was little doubt that owing to the conditions in rural districts and the low wages, numbers of people deliberately arranged to lose their permanent employment in order to qualify for unemployment relief or home assistance, especially since the free beef was added to the dole.  That condition of affairs has been apparent to us all during the last few months. It will be greatly aggravated in another fortnight or so when the beet campaign is over, because additional numbers of men will be out of work and they will be applying for the dole. I am aware of instances, and I could give proof, where men have deliberately provoked quarrels with their employers by refusing to do certain work or by making themselves so hopelessly inefficient that no employer could keep them.</P>

      <P>I am merely illustrating the effect of the doles.  Senator Counihan said that any kind of useful work would be better than to keep paying men to remain idle.

      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confine myself to the effect of what is known as the economic war on the farmers, and I will say that that war has made it impossible for the farmers in many cases to pay their workmen as much as a man will get in the shape of unemployment assistance.  Just take into consideration the effects of the dole and the free beef scheme.  These things have created a very difficult position for the farmers.  I know people who have had men in their employment for years on the best possible terms&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator, the point is that if they are unemployed, will you be able to show us how they could be relieved by this motion?  You must not tell us the dole and all these other things are wrong.  Those things are not touched on by the motion.  Show us how unemployment is going to be <Col N="1116" /> subdued by Senator Counihan's motion?  Anything of that nature I will allow you to discuss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tried to point out that unemployment is being created in this way and the dole and the free beef scheme are having certain effects.  I fully endorse what Senator Counihan has said with regard to land reclamation and I can point to the mudlands in Wexford as an example. I do not know much about the particular place in Dublin to which the Senator's motion refers and I can only deal with that in a general way. I have, however, certain knowledge about reclamation work in Wexford. Probably before anybody here was born, back in the time of the great famine when there was distress and unemployment just as there is now, the mudlands of Wexford harbour were reclaimed by private enterprise.  That work was an extraordinary success and it meant that 5,000 acres of the most valuable land was added to County Wexford.  The land is free from certain diseases on account of the salt content.  Prior to its reclamation it was covered by the tide.  It was reclaimed with great success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were other areas also reclaimed, such as the sloblands at Ballyteigue. They were reclaimed successfully to the extent of several hundreds of acres.  Perhaps some of that scheme was not quite so successful as in the case of Wexford harbour, but at any rate hundreds of acres of valuable land were added to the county.  I think this scheme of reclaiming mudlands could be adopted by the Government. I do not doubt that it could be better done by private companies, as in the case of Wexford.  In the present circumstances, however, the work could be undertaken for the purpose of employing many people who are now getting the dole.  There is plenty of other work that could be undertaken. I know farms where, owing to the impossibility of paying labour or getting men to do such work as the cleaning of ditches and drains, a lot of the best of land is deteriorating in value, being overgrown with rushes. The drains are stopped and the drainage done years ago is now of no use. <Col N="1117" /> No farmer would be able to get work of that kind done on his own.  He could not afford to pay for it out of his own pocket.  It would be very desirable, I think, if some scheme could be devised whereby grants might be given by the Government for the doing of that class of work.  Unemployed men could be engaged out of the Government grants instead of having money distributed to them in doles. An arrangement might be made so that the farmer whose land was benefited would pay a proportion of the cost.  Schemes of that kind would be very useful indeed.  I do not know whether they would have much effect now, because as we read in the newspapers a few days ago, there is now going to be a general revaluation of the land of the country and that will not encourage people to carry out improvements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>He was ably seconded by Senator Miss Browne, most of whose speech concerned itself with an attack on labourers because of the fact that they happened to be unfortunate enough to be unemployed, and because this Christian State attempts to do something to relieve the consequent distress.  Senator Counihan, in moving his motion, dwelt at great length and laid strong emphasis on the fact that the unemployed labourers of the <Col N="1118" /> country were getting doles and, if you please, free beef.  But, in the course of his speech, he never referred to the fact that for very many years the farmers of Ireland have been getting grants&mdash;the agricultural grant and other grants.  Of course, it was no crime for the farmers to accept grants, but it is a crime for unfortunate labouring men with wives and families depending on them to do so: men who are able and willing to work.  Because, being denied the opportunity of providing for themselves and their families, the State steps in and passes an Unemployment Assistance Act to enable these unfortunate people to keep body and soul together, we have had these tirades from Senator Counihan and Senator Miss Browne to-day. Senator Miss Browne talked about the position in which labourers had put themselves.  She said that they had made themselves inefficient in order that they might get dismissed from their employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. These were not my words.  What I said was that these were the words of the home assistance official in County Wexford.  He used them in the report that he made to the County Wexford Board of Health.  They are not my words at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, at least Senator Miss Browne quoted them.  From my experience of some of the farmer-employers in this country, and the miserable wages they offer to these unfortunate men, I would not be a bit surprised if they did that.  They would at least be better off than working for some of those large-hearted people that we hear about.  The Labour Party does not believe in, or stand for, this system of doles for anybody. We believe that man has the God-given right to get useful employment, and that in return for his labour he should be paid a sufficient wage to enable him to live without having to get charity from anybody.  But we know, unfortunately, that that is not possible, due to the introduction of modern machinery.  It has been responsible for displacing thousands of <Col N="1119" /> men so that the inventors may become millionaires.  The result is that thousands of workers are thrown on the scrap heap and that there is not sufficient employment to go around. But there is no reason why there could not be sufficient employment.  If the advice of the Labour Party, as embodied in its programme of reconstruction which was submitted to the first Dáil and to both of the Governments which have been in power in this country since, had been adopted, much useful work could have been undertaken and that would have been better for everybody concerned.  It would be better for people to be getting useful employment than assistance. But, unless we are prepared to put back the hands of the clock, I am afraid that both here and in every country in the world we are going to have large numbers unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that I am dealing with the motion, a motion which asks that certain works of reconstruction be undertaken.  In my opinion, the objects which the motion sets out to achieve can only be achieved if they are carried out in a national way and on a large scale.  I was rather surprised at seeing this motion on the Order Paper, because it is pretty well known that a programme of reconstruction works on a large scale, embracing such matters as are dealt with in this motion, has been put before the Government.  I do not think it is the duty of the Government to deal with these suggested works in a parochial or local way.  This motion speaks of the County Dublin, but I do not think it is the business of the Legislature to deal with such important issues as these in a parochial way.  It is the duty of the State to consider all these matters in a national sense.  The unemployed in Cork, Galway, Kerry and in every other county in the Free State have as much claim on the consideration of the Government as the unemployed in the County Dublin.  This is a matter that should be engaging, and <Col N="1120" /> I believe is engaging, the attention of the Executive Government.  It is the duty of the Government to provide useful schemes of work and remunerative employment for people who are unemployed and who are entitled either to employment or maintenance.</P>

      <P>I am not going to insinuate that the underlying arguments of Senator Counihan were motivated by anything but the very best of intentions, but his motion as it stands is condemned out of his own arguments.  Firstly, he drew attention himself to the very local and rather parochial aspect of his motion.  I am just wondering, as a new Senator, if this motion is passed what is going to happen to the sheaves of similar motions which we are going to have coming from Wexford, Galway, Cork, Tralee and other places around the coast where not alone the problems mentioned in this motion, but such problems as coast erosion are causing very serious concern.  I am just wondering what those interested&mdash;in my opinion, in the more practical schemes of internal drainage&mdash;think about this proposal?  The only chance, in my opinion, that Senator Counihan had of getting a motion such as this passed was to have dropped its local aspect and put his proposal forward from a national point of view.  But, even from that point of view, there are objections. I do not know what power of initiation this Assembly has.  I look upon the other House of the Oireachtas as the initiating body and, as Senator Counihan has friends there, a measure could be introduced to deal with problems of such serious magnitude. As the motion reads it stands condemned by some of the arguments that were used in its favour; that this is not the correct line of approach and, in my opinion, is not a very practical line of approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an Inter-Departmental Committee in existence for dealing with this question, and advertisements appeared in the Press calling for suggestions not alone from public bodies but from individuals. This motion is rather belated, as the final date for the reception of schemes for the putting of the unemployed <Col N="1121" /> to work is drawing to a close. The proper line of approach would have been for the Senator&mdash;if he is not a member of a local authority&mdash;to get some friends on such a body to discuss it.  This motion should engage the attention of the Dublin County Council or the coastal borough bodies which are in a position to bring forward sound arguments in its favour.  We have had general principles enunciated by Senator Counihan; we have had no facts.  Public bodies have engineers and surveyors in their employment who have, in the course of their professional capacity, examined this situation.  It will surprise me if something like what is suggested here has not been before local authorities.  I read in to-day's Press that a rather big project has been suggested in County Dublin, consisting of the making of a marine lake where the labour content would reach the magnitude of 80 per cent.  Whether it is practical or not, I do not know. That is a practical line of approach. Probably a description of such a scheme has been sent in to the Inter-Departmental Committee.  While, in the main, I agree with the principle underlying the motion, I will be compelled to vote against it.  We all realise the difficulties of the unemployment situation.  Measures have been taken by the Government, with a serious sense of their responsibility, to deal with what we all hope is but a temporary situation.  While we realise the seriousness of the problem, I take it that we are all agreed upon the necessity of curing it.  The motion should be altered to make it a national one, when it will become a serious one for this House to discuss and to see if there is a more practical line of approach to its solution.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As this is no new question it should be discussed on the merits, in order to raise it above the level in which it was discussed here by previous speakers. We have a very long coastline with a number of estuaries, bays and inlets. <Col N="1122" /> I was a follower of Mr. Arthur Griffith. I read his writings closely, possibly 40 years ago, when he dealt with the reclamation of land along the coast. I remember distinctly that he described what had been done to the Landes on the north-west coast of France in the way of reclamation work, and told how they were subsequently planted.  If something like that had been done in this country we might not now have to be paying exorbitant bills to foreign countries for the timber used in our housing schemes. If we go further along the north coast of Europe, we find what was done in Ostend and on the Zuyder Zee in Holland.  Anyone who read the late Mr. Erskine Childers' book, &ldquo;The Riddle of the Sands,&rdquo; will remember that there was in it an appeal for reclamation work at the mouth of the Elbe and along that coast.  Recently, we find that the new leader of Italy has converted what was possibly something like fever swamps into good land.  If we go back further we find that in the 17th century the English did some reclamation work in the Humber and that land was reclaimed from which there is now derived a revenue of about £10,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>While I do not agree with some of the remarks of my colleague, Senator Fitzgerald, I think any work that tends to increase the area of the State is good work, because reclamation really means an addition to the area of the State.  Some reclamation work was carried out on the Foyle some years ago, and Senator Lynch will be able to tell us what was done on the Fergus. In Senator Counihan's native county, I think he can speak of what was done there, because within 30 miles of where he lived reclamation was carried out in an estuary of Kenmare Bay.  Reclamation work has also been done on the Lee, the Barrow and the Suir.  I agree with Senator Fitzgerald that the motion should not be confined to County Dublin, but should take in the country as a whole.  Anyone who knows the coast of County Dublin knows how it lends itself to reclamation work.  Outside Skerries, there is a little island and it should not be very difficult to build a promenade to <Col N="1123" /> connect the town with that island and make it a beautiful health resort. Anybody travelling along the railway line from Malahide to Donabate will have seen the tract of land around there which leads as far as Seatown, Swords, along the Broadmeadow river.  Then we come to Senator O'Neill's stronghold, Portmarnock, where there is a lovely strand which would lend itself to reclamation.</P>
    <P>Let us now come to the Bay of Dublin and to what has been done there and in the City.  Dublin itself is largely built on reclaimed land.  If you take up any history of Dublin you will find that the whole north side, from Ballybough Bridge along by Beresford Place and up as far as Capel Street Bridge, is largely reclaimed land, and the names of some of the streets proclaim that, because you have Newfoundland Street, which derives its name from the fact that it is newly made land.  We can also read that in the past the Duke of Leinster came in a boat from the north side to his town residence, Leinster House.  In the Bay of Dublin, a new park has been made entirely by the Dublin Corporation, with all its faults.  I remember when the sea waves washed the wall along the Fairview Road and so does Senator O'Neill.  It is now a beautifully filled-in park, and further reclamation work is being carried out by the same body in the Dollymount direction.  The Dublin Port and Docks Board has reclaimed land to add to its docks space.  It has already reclaimed 80 acres, and a further 36 acres are now in process of reclamation.</P>
    <P>I am rather disappointed that Senator Counihan did not give us any very clear indication of what might be done apart from these relief works and I am going to make a suggestion now which may not be worth the paper it may be written on.  There is a corner of the Bay of Dublin along by Monkstown and it would seem to me that if a line were drawn from Dun Laoghaire harbour up to Seapoint or Blackrock and the corner filled in, as has been done by the Dublin Corporation in Fairview, there is no reason why, in the future&mdash;after all, we have got <Col N="1124" /> to think of the future&mdash;it should not be utilised as an aeroplane base.  You would then have a ship terminus, a railway terminus and an aeroplane base in the one spot.  It may be very costly but if full value is got for the cost, it would be all to the good.  I may be asked how that could be filled in.  There are two ways of reclaiming land.  One way is to build embankments and the other, to fill in material, as has been done in Fairview.  My idea in regard to the Monkstown project would be to fill it in.  I am not going to dictate to the Dun Laoghaire Borough Council as to how they should conduct their business, but, at all events, we know that the Blackrock township in its day filled in and elevated Blackrock Park and we know that they are now engaged in similar work along by Williamstown and Booterstown.  There is no reason why, if this was done in a national way, it could not be carried out if the project was taken up seriously between the two corporations.  I do not think it would take very long to fill up this place if we added to it the cleansing of the streets of the city.  Instead of being destroyed in destructors, the refuse could be carried out there.</P>
    <P>Coming now to the so-much talked of Blue Lagoon, these things are all very fine in their way.  There may be a time in the near or distant future when these beautiful projects can be carried out, but there are some of us in the City of Dublin who are conversant with the situation in the city and while there are as many as 14 human beings living in one room, some of us, at all events, will not countenance the spending of the citizens' money on these fantastic projects until the housing problem of Dublin is solved.  When that has been done, these other suggestions may get attention.  I do not see any objection in the world to passing this motion, provided that it gets a national complexion rather than a local or county complexion, but in connection with the points I have raised, I would suggest to Senator Counihan that he should alter paragraph (d) by the inclusion of the words &ldquo;or any other useful purposes.&rdquo;  The purposes are limited to agricultural or forestry <Col N="1125" /> purposes as it stands.  If this reclamation work could fulfil some useful purpose, as in the case of the work carried out by the Dublin Corporation and the Dublin Port and Docks Board, it would be all to the good, but the manner in which this is worded would cut that out.</P>
    <P>As I say, I do not see any objection in the world to passing this motion provided it gets a national complexion rather than a parochial or county complexion. I understand that the Government have had this question under consideration for some time and I believe that, in years gone by, when Mr. Arthur Griffith was writing about these things, if you had had a national Government, these questions would not be left until now without being dealt with.  I think it ought to be passed and I hope the Government will give it due consideration.</P>

I am not going to follow them in that line of argument. I think the matter is more important and should be treated in a serious manner, and I think it is unfortunate that the people who are moving in this matter should attack the most unfortunate people in the community. It does not help their object in any way.  I appeal to them to try and remove from their minds altogether <Col N="1126" /> the venom which they appear to have against the unemployed.  It is not their fault that they are unemployed; they are victims of one kind or another.  It is very unbecoming for people in fairly good positions to take advantage of that to abuse and slander people who are not in a position to answer for themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to occupy the attention of the House for any length of time in dealing with this motion.  With the permission of the House I just wish to place a few considerations before it for consideration. I would suggest that this motion is both inopportune and unpractical.  I would suggest that it is inopportune at the present time to ask the Executive Council to start on an examination of a question of this sort, as to the possibility of the reclamation of lands from tidal waters.  It is inopportune, because it is certain to take some time, and the problem of unemployment is one that cannot be dealt with by stopping short; it has to be dealt with in a practical and rapid way if it is to be dealt with at all, so as to be effective in curing the evils aimed at by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This question of the reclamation of lands from tidal waters is one of a very difficult and perhaps of a very scientific kind.  So difficult is it that old people say that what you take from the tide the tide has a habit of taking back again.  Those who know anything about the reclamation of land from tidal waters know that that consequence has frequently occurred where it has been tried.  It was tried in the Fergus reclamation works by private enterprise some 50 years ago. The reclamation there of 500 or 600 acres of lands swallowed any amount of money.  The land was reclaimed, apparently effectively, by the erection of very big battlements to protect it from a small tidal river.  It was excellent land, as Senator Miss Browne indicated such slobland would be, for four or five years.  It gave great crops of beans and was excellent land for grazing cattle on account of the saline properties associated with the grass <Col N="1127" /> that grew there.  What happened?  At the end of five years a big tide came with a storm and went over the bank and when it went over, of course, it had to go out.  It could not go out over the bank but it swept the bank away at a corner and all the money was lost.</P>
    <P>That 500 or 600 acres remained for about 20 years, when some enterprising person purchased the slobland from the bankruptcy official, I suppose, who had charge of the realisation of the property, for a nominal sum and proceeded, about 300 or 400 yards further in, to make an embankment enclosing a smaller quantity of land with a large amount of slobland outside the embankment which would be a protection against the strength of the tidal waters in case of a storm.  That was also apparently a great success for about ten years, or perhaps less, when the tide came in again and swept away the embankment when going out.  Now it is slobland again.  If Senator Counihan means to ask the Executive Council to enter into an inquiry as to the practicability of reclaiming any particular piece of slobland from tidal waters; to stop the other means which they are adopting for solving the question of unemployment and start an inquiry which would not be at all useful, except you have very expert evidence before you, and go to the expense and the waste of time and the absurdity of that at the present time, when so many obvious means are suggested for dealing with the problem of unemployment, such a proposal is, I would respectfully suggest, both inopportune and unpractical.</P>
    <P>I did not intend to interfere in this discussion because the matter had been so well dealt with by people who are competent to deal with it, but it is one in which I take a great interest, because I have seen the effects of endeavouring to reclaim lands from the operation of tidal waters.  I have seen the difficulties of it, and it is not a thing that can be done in a casual and haphazard way. It requires scientific inquiry and is unsuitable at the present time.  There <Col N="1128" /> are other means of dealing with the problem of unemployment.  I understand that these means are being resorted to.  Whether they will succeed or not is a matter for prophecy. Whether they are practical or not remains to be seen, and, of course, the Government must run the risk of being censured by Senator Counihan and Senator Miss Browne as to the methods adopted in dealing with the problem.  I suggest, however, that at the present time this motion is one which could have no good result whatever and would rather reflect on the House if passed in its present form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Connolly) Minister for Lands (Mr. Connolly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion has raised quite a number of points, some of them very interesting, some of them very helpful, and others of them not so useful.  I do not wish to go into any great detail with regard to it.  I think it is not altogether unhealthy that a matter like this should be brought up here.  It indicates to me that Senator Counihan has changed his base somewhat, and has got a new type of motion, which he can move at intervals.  The parochial nature of the motion does, in my opinion, militate against it.  There is also the fact that considerable attention is being paid to the problem of finding useful public works for the relief of unemployment, and that this Inter-Departmental Committee has been meeting and working intensively on the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various suggestions will, no doubt, emerge from the work of that Committee. I hope when they do emerge we will find that interest and backing from Senator Counihan and his friends on the main issue that will be involved in such proposals.  I allude to the cost, the necessity for finding the finances for such works, possibly resulting in taxation.  I am all in favour of public works, and I think most of us here and elsewhere are in favour of the policy of providing employment rather than relief money for unemployment or public assistance.  But it has to be remembered that the unemployment problem cannot be solved on the lines that Senator Counihan indicates when he says &ldquo;start work immediately.&rdquo;<Col N="1129" /> One has to have a scientific, technical and an experienced basis to work on.</P>
    <P>It is well known that certain public works are very high in labour content, and that certain other public works are very low in labour content.  The desire or the necessity is to get a combination of essential public works that will be of permanent value to the State and give a high labour content.  Even with unlimited money and great resources it is not an easy matter in this country to start public works of a beneficial nature.  It is true that we have available engineering experts, surveyors and planning, but we have not had that intensive national interest in our expert staffs.  When I speak of this I am speaking of the engineering forces and the different other highly technical qualifications that are needed to plan, carry out and administer such works.</P>
    <P>I have seen the unemployment problem faced in other countries.  I am reasonably aware of that problem as it is facing President Roosevelt in America to-day.  With unlimited capital, with no limit to the money that will be made available for public works, it is there found almost impossible to face this problem as we would like to see it faced.  That brings me to another issue&mdash;what the Americans call technological employment&mdash;and it is a peculiar thing that the more intensively industrial a country is, the less employment pro rata it will provide. I have experience of that in my own small way with the Gaeltacht industries, where we are trying to provide uneconomic employment in scattered areas.  In the very nature of things industrialisation goes to militate against units in a remote area where large scale production does not operate.</P>
    <P>One point that was made to-day, which I wish to deal with now, and it is the main reason why I am speaking on this motion, was the question of unemployment.  Senator Miss Browne, I think, it was who referred to the unemployment figures.  She quoted the figures of last week.  I am rather glad she did, because it gives me an opportunity of referring to the unemployment figures which had been published <Col N="1130" /> by the Press.  These figures have been heavily leaded in the Press here and equally heavily leaded in the Press across the water.  Our unemployment figures at the moment mean something very different to what unemployment figures meant three years ago.  At that time the people registered at the Labour Exchanges for benefit.  In the main, registering at the Labour Exchanges meant the registering of those people who anticipated the drawing of benefits through unemployment insurance. When it came to a question of giving out relief works throughout the country, the present Administration decided, definitely, and at the beginning, that all those who sought relief work would have to be registered at the Labour Exchanges.  They even went so far as to insist on those people in outlying districts registering through postcards in their postal area.  That arrangement has enormously increased the number registered as unemployed and has created altogether a different state of things to that which existed three years ago.</P>
    <P>Then the further step was taken under the Unemployment Assistance Act which gives to every person who is available for work the right, under certain means qualifications, of getting certain benefits.  We know that practically every small farmer in the Gaeltacht, for instance, and in the Western seaboard registered for unemployment assistance.  Many of those people, in fact most of them, have houses and small holdings.  They are available at times for relief works or for unemployment assistance up to a certain point.  I want to make it clear that the figures published now are a complete analysis of those who claim for unemployment assistance or unemployment insurance.  We are satisfied &mdash;and I think the trade unions and the trade organisations through their societies will bear out what I say&mdash;that there is considerably more employment at the present time than there ever has been in recent times in Ireland. The explanation of the unemployment figures to which Senator Miss Browne has referred is found in the facts I have stated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1131" /> This unemployment problem is unfortunately not confined to any one country.  It is prevalent all over the world.  It is found in the United States, in England and in Germany. We have our share of it here.  It is entirely desirable that people be provided with the means of earning what was given to them rather than that they should suffer from the demoralising effects of the dole.  But it is not going to be suggested at this hour of the day that those for whom work cannot be provided are going to be deprived of public assistance, unemployment assistance or free beef.  I object very much to that being dubbed charity.  It is not charity for an unemployed worker to draw unemployment assistance. These unemployed are a State responsibility, and they are accepted as such.  We are not living in the days of the 1850's, when soup kitchens and charities were handled in that way.  We are living in a period when States all over the world accept responsibility for their citizens.  That is a state of things that is going to exist and to continue.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of public works, I am not sure that these public works or the scheme that has been put forward by Senator Counihan is a practical proposition.  I will undertake to see that it is brought to the attention of the Inter-Departmental Committee which is where Senator Counihan should have sent it.  I understand with regard to this particular work that an examination was made in 1920, and that it was found that it would be a practical engineering job. But it is very questionable whether it would be an economic work in any sense, or that the resultant lands would be of any real value.  I am not in a position to express any views on that matter.  It will be the work of the Inter-Departmental Committee to investigate such things amongst many other things that are under consideration at the moment.</P>
    <P>There are many types of reclamation, of course, possible.  In my particular Department certain experiments have been made with regard to internal <Col N="1132" /> reclamation&mdash;reclamation of bogs, the reclamation of large areas and the plantation of the people on the soil.  Several of these schemes have been costly.  I think all reclamation will be found to be costly.  Some of them have disclosed a great difference of opinion amongst the people in the area as to the advisability and the advantage of carrying out reclamation of this type.  My own feeling about the matter, as a result of whatever little experience I have had, is that the best type of reclamation I can see in the country is that in which small farmers who are living adjacent to bogland, are encouraged by grants to reclaim additional acreage within their own holdings.  That, I think, has worked out fairly satisfactorily under the Department of Agriculture.  In my opinion they have not gone far enough. I hope to see them going further The reason that is the most successful form of reclamation is that it does throw the responsibility for the value of the reclaimed land on the owner of the land.  In other words, if you pay him a grant of £5 per acre, if he has to undertake the work himself and knows that he will own the land afterwards, that will result in his putting his best efforts into working the land and into making it really worth while.  The State responsibility is definitely fixed.  The money is paid over on the results achieved.  He is given a certain grant at the beginning of the work and then, if he is successful in reclaiming the bog, acre by acre, he is paid the balance.  The grant works out at £5 per acre.</P>
    <P>I think that it is the most desirable type of reclamation in this country at present.  It might be much more widely extended.  I mention that because the motion deals mainly with the reclamation idea.  I am not in a position to offer any opinion on the various suggestions such as Senator Healy and others have made.  I do not see anything particularly objectionable in Senator Counihan's motion which can be dealt with by the Inter-Departmental Committee.  I think there is a great deal in the point that has been made that the motion is too parochialised and that, instead of dealing <Col N="1133" /> with the matter from the national point of view, the Senator has dealt with his own immediate area around Dublin.  I agree with Senator Farren's analysis of the labour position.  I have explained my own views as to how these figures are constituted.  I must certainly say that so long as the Government is in power it will take cognisance of the fact that those citizens who cannot be provided with work must be provided with reasonable maintenance, until work is available or we are in a position to provide it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGriffith" hpid="Sir John P. Griffith Sir John P. Griffith">
      <NameTxt>Sir John P. Griffith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with considerable interest to the discussion but there has been no reference made to the fact that the question of coast erosion, the reclamation of tidal areas and afforestation, has been examined by a very powerful Royal Commission within the last 25 years.  The full details are well worth studying for those who are interested in the question.  I have done a considerable amount of that study myself and have come to the conclusion that the suggested reclamations referred to in the motion would be very expensive and of very doubtful utility both in their use afterwards and in the use of unemployed labour.  The question of unemployed labour was fully discussed at the Royal Commission to which I have referred in connection with these reclamations in tidal areas.  I have come to the conclusion that several of the speakers to-day thought of this question rather too much in the sense of local improvements, whilst we know that the unemployment problem is a national one.  I have placed my views before Ministers very strongly from time to time in regard to the question of the reclamation of bogland on which the Minister for Lands spoke here to-day. We have got millions of acres of bogland and they would provide admirable work for almost any class of labour. I certainly would suggest that if the terms of this motion are placed before any committee, they should not be limited to the schemes that have been proposed for the County Dublin.  My own impression is that if the reclamation of 800 acres of land at Malahide were undertaken it would cost something <Col N="1134" /> like £500 an acre if it is done economically.  If it is done merely by hand labour, it would be an endless job because there are 800 acres to be raised some ten feet or so.  I do not wish to throw cold water, if possible, on any efforts to utilise the unemployed but I do not really think that we can look to this scheme as a very fruitful source of help.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion has led to a very valuable discussion, a discussion which is particularly valuable by reason of the statement of policy which we have received from the Minister and the speech made by Senator Sir John Griffith, an engineer of the greatest eminence.  I was glad to see that on all sides the opinion is that work rather than doles should be provided for the people.  I was particularly pleased to hear from Senator Farren that it is work men want and not charity.  How is work to be provided? If you like, some work may be provided in the reclamation of the inlets around the coast of Ireland, but it seems to me that that is not the most urgent, the most profitable or the most universal kind of work that could be engaged in.  Senator Lynch has told you about the attempt to reclaim the very fertile reaches of the Fergus. I think that if many of the schemes suggested in speeches here this evening were carried out they would merely mean a reclamation of sandbanks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sir John Griffith told you that the reclamation of the coast of Co. Dublin up at Malahide would cost £500 or £800 per acre.  Have you considered at all the fact that beautiful sandy beaches available for the public would be converted into fields, some of them good fields and some of them very bad fields?  I have given a lot of thought as to the way in which employment can be given in this country and the sums expended on the dole reduced.  I think it is an axiom that it is much more economic to improve land that is above the sea level than to endeavour to win from the sea land which is around our coast.  There is plenty of employment and plenty of room for employment in the reclamation <Col N="1135" /> of land all over the country, particularly the reclamation of bogland and swampy land.  Throughout the world there are millions of people at present unemployed.  Perhaps it is impossible to find employment for all these people in the highly industrialised cities, but I deny that it is impossible to find employment for all the people in this country.  There are plenty of opportunities for the full employment of the people of this country. These opportunities can be provided by the inland reclamation of land.  I say now without hesitation, in the presence of men of experience and eminence, that employment in the reclamation and improvement of land would be economic and would return a full reward for the money expended. The employment figure of 125,000 or thereabouts has been mentioned.  We know that this is, to a certain degree, artificial, by reason of the fact that no person can get employment on relief works unless he is registered.  We know that there are thousands and, perhaps, tens of thousands registered now who would not, in ordinary circumstances, have been registered as unemployed.  Making due allowance for that, I submit that there are thousands reluctantly receiving doles at present who should get remunerative employment.  I was glad to hear that the Minister accepted responsibility for finding employment or providing some sort of payment for these men.  The statement was categorically made here that responsibility is accepted. It follows that the Government must examine every scheme for the provision of employment.  No great objection could be taken to the scheme proposed by Senator Counihan, with the amendment proposed by Senator Foran, that an examination be made of the tidal inlets.  That examination can be very short and very simple, having regard to the findings of the Royal Commission mentioned by Senator Sir John Griffith.  Full inquiry and examination need not consist of anything more than reading the Report of that Royal Commission. When that is done, it will be found <Col N="1136" /> that the most remunerative method of employment would be by reclaiming and improving the land which Nature has won from the sea.  I am particularly anxious that our public men should realise that, in finding employment for the people, the great source is the land.</P>

      <P>I wish the sea would ignore the land which, from time to time, has been reclaimed from it. Senator Lynch called attention to the reclamation that took place on the Fergus, where banks were built up. The sea, was, however, more vigilant than the people who were interested in the land.  It lapped over the bank, a capful at a time, and, when it had made a little breach, down came the whole thing.  Why I say that attention should be given to reclamation inland is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is no use in having public works carried out if the engineering expenses, the preparation of maps and other things, use up most of the grant and leave only a small portion for the man who gives his sweat and daily labour to the work.  This discussion has, I think, done good, and the motion with the amendment might be accepted without doing any harm. It does not, however, deal with the entire problem.</P>

      <P>Naturally, as one who was bred, born and reared in North County Dublin, I take an interest in anything that is brought forward concerning it.  I am sufficiently national in my outlook to agree with the motion as amended.  The reason I have risen is merely to recall, as a matter of interest, that the lands mentioned by Senator Counihan were included in a scheme adopted so far back as the days of Grattan's Parliament in 1782.  I do not propose to take much further part in the debate as the question has been fully thrashed out already.  When I heard my friend Senator Lynch, and my friend Senator Sir John Griffith say that it is very difficult to reclaim such land, it occurred to me to ask: &ldquo;What about Holland?&rdquo;  If the Hollanders can do it, I do not see why the Irelanders cannot do it also.</P>

      <P>I had no intention, in speaking to this motion, to offend any section of the House, no matter what their political views might be.  I think that the attack made on me by Senator Foran and Senator Farren was unjust and uncalled for.  The only idea I had in moving the motion was to point out to the Government a way of relieving unemployment.  I pointed out, in the course of my speech, the evil effects which I believe the handing out of this dole will have on the unemployed.  I am entitled to my opinion and I have very high authority to back it up&mdash;no less a person than the President of the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Foran said I should not have launched such an attack upon the unemployed; he said I was slandering the unemployed.  I fail to see where I made one single unjust remark in my speech.  The unemployed have my sympathy just as much as they have the sympathy of Senator Foran, but I do not start blowing my own horn on every hilltop.  When matters come to be reckoned up it may be found that there are as many good works to my credit in regard to the unemployed as Senator Foran has to his credit.  I <Col N="1138" /> have been accused of moving a parochial motion.  I asked that this coastal reclamation should be examined.  I thought it better to name some inlets on which a try-out could be made.  I think those I mentioned were the best places and that is the reason for my naming County Dublin.  Senator Fitzgerald is new to this House but he thinks it is inferior to deal with this matter as compared with the Dáil or the county councils; he said this motion would be more suitably moved in the Dáil.  I do not think so.  I think it is eminently suitable for discussion in this House.  Senator Lynch and also, I think, Senator Sir John Griffith disagree with the reclamation of coastal inlets.  Senator Lynch touched on the money expended on the reclamation of the Fergus.  It is possible he is right in what he said. I know the Fergus, but I do not know the land that has been reclaimed there. I would point out to Senator Lynch the slobland in Wexford that has been reclaimed, and where the embankments have stood the tests for more than 100 years.  It is amongst the most fertile land in the country.  I could point out to Senator Lynch land in the County Kerry that has also been reclaimed and where the embankments have stood the test.  If the embankments on the Fergus are not what they should be, it must be due to bad engineering and bad work.  Senator Lynch also said that this was not an opportune time to make these suggestions. I cannot agree with that.  Only a fortnight ago the Board of Works invited everybody in the country to send in suggestions for relief works. I sent in a statement in reply to that invitation to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, who is in charge of the work.</P>
    <P>All I ask in this motion is that an examination should be made of certain tidal inlets.  I think Senator Comyn said that the inlets that I suggested should be reclaimed were only sandbanks.  That is not so.  These inlets that I mentioned are mudbanks. When the tide is out they are completely covered with mud and a little sand.  But even if they were sandbanks, we all know the value of sandy <Col N="1139" /> soil in these districts for the market gardens.  We all know the value of the land around Rush and Lusk and Skerries, and we know how valuable that land is from the market gardeners' point of view, and we know how industrious and well off are the people living in these localities.  I am satisfied with the way the Minister for Lands received my motion and with his statement that it would be brought before the proper quarter.  That statement <Col N="1140" /> was tantamount to accepting the motion which I moved.  He said that he would do what my motion required him to do and I certainly have no objection to that statement.  I think Senator Farren need not have been so bitter in his attack on Senator Miss Browne and myself.</P>
