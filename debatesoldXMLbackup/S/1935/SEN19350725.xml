      <P>Yesterday we came to an agreement not to take the Unemployment Assistance (Amendment) Bill, 1935, next week but to put it off until the following week.  This was arranged in order to meet the wishes of the Labour Party but I have heard that on reconsidering the matter the Labour Senators have decided that they will not ask the Seanad to meet the week after next for the sole purpose of considering that Bill.</P>
      <P>I think that Senator Counihan also objected to certain of the Bills which have come up from the Dáil this week being put through all their stages next week, but I do not know if he feels strongly on the matter and as far as I can judge the rest of the House would like to conclude the business that is ready for us.  I would like some expression as to what would be most convenient for Senators, but in any case we shall take the Second Stages of all the Bills next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>As members of the Seanad are aware, the effect of a Reserved Commodity Order in relation to any commodity is to create a position that any person proposing to manufacture that commodity in the Saorstát must receive a licence, to which may be attached a number of conditions which are set out in Section 23 of the Control of Manufactures Act, 1934.  A Reserved Commodity Order cannot become effective until it has been approved of by resolutions passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  One of the reasons why that power of making commodities reserved and, consequently, capable of being manufactured only under licence, was that the Executive Council desired to secure that certain industries would be established in the western part of the country.  There was another reason which was mentioned at the time the Bill was going through and which related to the possibility of getting manufacturing processes done here only if the whole of the market could be secured for the one concern.  That, however, does not arise in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason why it was decided to make sewing cotton a reserved commodity was to ensure that power would be exercisable to secure the establishment of the industry in the western part of the country, it being deemed an industry suitable for establishment in the West, and because it was not possible to arrange for any firm to engage in the establishment of this industry in the West unless they could be secured against competition from other firms which might establish themselves subsequently in the centre of the market, in Dublin or in Cork.  The decision was made following an arrangement with a company which has been formed for the purpose of establishing a factory at Westport <Col N="812" />&mdash;a company called the Irish Sewing Cotton Company.  That company is associated with a British company called the British Threadmills Company, Ltd., of Leicester, and 50 per cent of the capital in the Irish company is held by that British company and 50 per cent. by business people in Westport and vicinity.</P>
    <P>The company has a capital of £20,000, which is considered adequate to finance its earlier activities, but it will be necessary to increase that capital considerably before the full degree of manufacture, which it is proposed to undertake at Westport, can be undertaken. It is anticipated that the employment to be given there, when the full process of manufacture has been undertaken, will be from 150 to 200 hands.  A large proportion of these workers will be female workers. It is apparently the practice in this industry in all countries to employ female labour in many of the processes and the firm at Westport arranged to send a number of such workers from Westport to Leicester to be trained. These workers have been trained at Leicester and are now back at Westport training other local workers in the various processes involved in the industry.</P>
    <P>The arrangement concerning price which has been made with the company is that the thread produced at Westport will, quality for quality, be sold at a price not exceeding the price at which similar thread is sold in Great Britain by the firms associated in the British cotton thread combine.  It is proposed to attach the usual conditions to the licence in regard to the employment of nationals, the utilisation of Irish materials, and so forth. Under Section 25 of the Control of Manufactures Act, the company will be required to pay such wages to its employees as would be paid if the business were carried on under a contract between the Minister and the holder of a licence containing a fair wages clause similar to that, for the time being, contained in contracts made by Ministers and Government departments. There is, at the present time, an import duty of 40 per cent. on <Col N="813" /> imported cotton thread.  Until recently, however, licences were being issued freely for the importation of cotton thread.  In fact, as Senators may be aware, licences were not altogether necessary because the definition of thread in the original Resolution imposing that duty was successfully evaded by certain people and a large quantity of thread came in without payment of duty and without the necessity for getting licences.  The issue of licences, however, was suspended a few weeks ago because the Department of Industry and Commerce had reason to believe that there were adequate stocks of thread in the country to supply all reasonable requirements.  The manufacture of cotton thread will be done at Westport in all stages from the yarn up.  It is not proposed to spin yarn from raw cotton at Westport.  That process, apparently, is not done in a thread factory ordinarily, and, in any event, it appears that the total amount of yarn required in the country would be just sufficient to keep one yarn spinning company going. Consequently, we would be inclined to discourage this firm from undertaking yarn spinning in the hope that, later on, we may be able to get a firm to undertake yarn spinning in the country.</P>
    <P>The company has barely started.  At the present time, it is not yet producing any thread for sale, and only a few of the final processes of manufacture have been undertaken; but it is anticipated that, within the course of 12 months, the extension of the industry to cover all processes of manufacture will be completed.  With regard to the provisions of the Control of Manufactures Act, public notice was given of the intention to make sewing cotton a reserved commodity and objections were invited from all parties interested.  A majority of the objections received, however, were not relevant to the Order, but were mainly objections from firms and persons engaged as agents for the importation of cotton thread and were directed more against the idea of manufacturing cotton thread at all in the country <Col N="814" /> than against making cotton thread a reserved commodity.  There was one British firm, however, that indicated their willingness to undertake the manufacture of cotton thread in the country, and there was one objection, which was perfectly relevant and orderly, from a firm in Dublin, called The Irish Linen Manufacturing Company, which said that the machinery they had installed for the purpose of manufacturing linen thread was suitable for certain processes in the manufacture of cotton thread, and that they proposed to do so.  As I have said, our main reason for making this a reserved commodity was to ensure that the industry would be established in the West; and it would be contrary to the intention of the Government to permit a firm in Dublin to undertake the same industry.  In any event, that firm is not yet undertaking all the processes of the manufacture of linen thread which it was formed to undertake. I do not think, however, that they are pressing their objection.  At any rate, having considered that objection, which was relevant, and all the other objections, the Executive Council felt that there was no reason why they should not proceed with their intention to make the manufacture of sewing cotton a reserved commodity. Sewing cotton is the first commodity which has been made a reserved commodity under the Control of Manufactures Act, and the reason for making it a reserved commodity, is, not because we consider it necessary to do so in order to have the commodity manufactured here&mdash;we could have had it manufactured here without making a Reserved Commodity Order&mdash;but that we felt it desirable to create a position in which this industry would be located in one or other of the western counties.  That was the reason why the decision to make sewing cotton a reserved commodity was arrived at. In view of the arrangements made with the firm in question&mdash;a firm which has had considerable experience of the industry and which is, apparently, going in a proper way about the establishment of this industry, and which has entered into an undertaking to sell that thread, ex factory, at <Col N="815" /> Westport at the same price as obtains ex factory in Great Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Company which is independent of the British Thread combine.  It has a capital of £425,000, and from inquiries made it was clear that it had a very favourable standing in trade circles in Great Britain and that it manufactured a very good quality of thread, the sales of which were increasing and which were being sold in Great Britain somewhat below the combine prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether or not he is aware that this particular firm produces certain classes of cotton that are required in the industry.  I am informed that, in certain industries, there are certain classes of machines for a particular type of thread that has been found most beneficial for use in the trade in this particular industry.  I should like to know whether the Minister is aware that this particular firm produces this particular class of cotton thread, and, if not, will he take steps to see that licences will be issued to the manufacturers concerned so that they can get their requirements of raw material to enable them to keep their industries going?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, it is proposed to manufacture all classes of thread at Westport and to manufacture a full range of colours in due course.  At the present time, however, the dyeing plant has not been installed, and I imagine that that will be the last stage of manufacture to be undertaken.  Until they are able to undertake that, however, threads of such colours as they do not make will be imported free of duty when the position of stocks already in the country has been regulated. <Col N="816" /> At the present time, there are considerable stocks in the country and it is not necessary to import further stocks, but, ordinarily, it is the intention to allow these articles to be imported until the factory can produce them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister ought to make sure that this firm at Westport can produce the particular sort of thread which I have in mind.  I understand that there is a certain technical term in connection with this process, which is known as &ldquo;left twist.&rdquo;  I understand that a certain machine, the revolutions of which are up to 2,000, was designed to deal with this particular process, and that this type of thread is being adapted to suit such types of machine.</P>

      <P>Is it manufactured in Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  There are manufacturers in Ireland who use this particular type of thread.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be certain that the company, in Westport will endeavour to supply that type of thread, because the big market is the industrial market for thread, and not the domestic market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but if this particular firm is not able to produce that will the industrialist here get a licence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, certainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMacLoughlin" hpid="Mr. MacLoughlin Mr. MacLoughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to call the Minister's attention to the fact that there is a special type of high-class machine on the market now and that the thread has to be specially fitted for it.  As a matter of fact, there is only one firm in Great Britain undertaking this process, and they supply it to the makers of the machine. I know of one firm which, if they do not get a licence to import the thread, will have to scrap their machine, which costs quite a lot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this occasion I do not wish to speak as a politician but as a business <Col N="817" /> man and if I venture to criticise the Order making sewing cotton a reserved commodity I hope I will not be accused of sabotaging Irish industry.  I am in thorough sympathy with the policy of developing every industry which it is possible to develop here.  I disagree however with the policy of furthering industrial development by the creation of monopolies.  I regard the principle of giving a monopoly of the manufacture of any article a bad one.  And it is in my opinion particularly bad in the case of sewing cotton where there are so many qualities and varieties as to make it practically impossible for a single firm to cater efficiently for the trade of the country.  Sewing cotton is one of the most important raw materials of the clothing trade.  Nothing causes so much inconvenience in a factory or retards production more than bad or indifferent qualities of sewing cotton.  Managers of factories have, therefore, to exercise great care in the selection of sewing cotton for the various processes.  Experienced managers have found that sewing cotton made by one particular firm is more suitable for one process than another and, accordingly, to get the most suitable threads for the different processes one has to go to two or three different makers.  And now, if manufacturers are compelled to buy from one firm all the qualities and varieties they require, I am afraid it will result in needless loss, inconvenience, and dislocation of business.</P>
    <P>I notice that the firm with which the Westport factory is associated is the British Thread Mills of Leicester &mdash;no doubt a very reputable and efficient firm.  They do not, however, according to my information, manufacture thread from the raw cotton.  They do not spin the raw cotton into yarn for the manufacture of thread.  They are what is known in the trade as &ldquo;doublers.&rdquo;  They buy the single ply yarn from spinners, put it through the process known as &ldquo;doubling,&rdquo; then wind it and spool it and in case of coloured threads, dye or mercerise it. It is, I understand, these later processes which it is proposed to undertake at Westport.  The British Thread <Col N="818" /> Mills will buy the yarn from British spinners, &ldquo;double&rdquo; it in the mill at Leicester, and send it across to Westport to be wound or spooled.  The Minister stated in the Dáil that they were not going to spin yarn from raw cotton in this country nor did they desire cotton yarn to be spun here. That is, I suppose, because the trade of the country is too small to keep a mill going for the spinning of yarn&mdash; and to my mind the trade of the country is too small for any single firm to produce on an economic basis&mdash;even from imported yarns&mdash;the large variety of threads and the different forms of make-up required by the manufacturers and the domestic retail shops of the country.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister think that a concern of the dimensions of the factory at Westport, even when it is fully developed and has the maximum of 200 hands employed, can possibly produce thread in the innumerable varieties and in the 360 different shades which are produced in Great Britain to-day&mdash;all of which are now required by modern fashions?</P>
    <P>The Minister has explained that in the meantime these threads will be allowed to be imported free of duty.  I think it will be a very considerable time before the Westport factory will be able to produce anything but the very plainest lines in thread, and that for years they will be coming for licences to import threads that they cannot produce.  No doubt the Minister will grant licences but it will be interesting to see if manufacturers will continue to get licences or if licences will be given only to the mills.  If they are, it will be interesting to know what they will charge for imported threads.  The Minister said in the Dáil that arrangements had been made so that the prices of Westport products would not be higher than the corresponding prices in Great Britain.  He stated that that was a very satisfactory arrangement in the Government's opinion.  So it would in everyone's opinion if it was carried out.  Would the Minister be surprised to learn that the firm in Westport is demanding <Col N="819" /> prices far in excess of those current in Great Britain?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. MacEllin Mr. MacEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>How much?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMacLoughlin" hpid="Mr. MacLoughlin Mr. MacLoughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I can show the Minister quotations and I can show Senator MacEllin some quotations received even within the last month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. MacEllin Mr. MacEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>Quote one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMacLoughlin" hpid="Mr. MacLoughlin Mr. MacLoughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I will give one quotation.  The Westport firm quoted 67/- per gross for thread which can be bought in Great Britain for 48/- and 50/&mdash;where they wanted 2/5½ for 10,000-yd. cones used in the hosiery trade as against 1/8½, the price at which they are at present being bought.  According to my arithmetic, that is roughly a trifle of 45 per cent. more than the price current in Great Britain.  The Minister mentioned that the total requirements of this country amounted to £75,000, and 45 per cent. on that would mean £33,750, which I regard as a very tidy sum with which to reward yearly the unselfish zeal of the British Thread Mills, Ltd., of Leicester, for sending their yarns over to be finished in Westport.  Of course, people may say that if manufacturers here have to pay an increased price for raw materials it involves no hardship, as they can pass on the price to the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But what about firms trying to do an export trade which, I think, in the opinion of the Minister, is a very commendable form of enterprise?  I say that Irish firms in the shirt and collar trade can have no chance of doing an export trade if they have to pay 45 per cent. more for thread than their competitors in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  I know an instance where an Irish firm within the past two years, which heretofore competed for big London contracts at the January and July sales, lost these contracts merely by having to pay 33? per cent. duty on cardboard boxes which they could not get in Dublin at any price lower than the price in Derry, plus the duty.  Two very big orders were lost and, if in addition to the duty on cardboard <Col N="820" /> boxes, 45 per cent. more is to be paid on thread, the bit of export trade that is left will be wiped out.</P>
    <P>The Minister made what I think was a sensational statement in the Dáil about an organised and well-planned conspiracy between a British combine and certain wholesale merchants to smash the Westport factory.  Since he made the statement I have been making inquiries in trade circles, and I could not find anyone who knew anything about it, or who heard anything about it.  What is definitely known is that a certain amount of thread is being imported as the Minister explained, and that certain firms took advantage of the loose word ing of the Government regulations and imported considerable quantities of thread as three-ply yarn.  They did so openly.</P>
    <P>If the Government were caught napping and permitted thread to be imported as yarn they have only themselves to blame.  If this is the only basis of the Minister's charge of a perfectly prepared and well-planned conspiracy, then I think the Minister's charge is very far-fetched.  Of course the Minister may have other evidence. He says he has overwhelming evidence. If so, the best way to unmask and frustrate the conspiracy would be to make it public.  It would be fairer to everyone concerned, and especially to people who know nothing about the conspiracy, and have got none of the dumped thread.  At the present moment unfortunate manufacturers do not know where they are.  The Minister said that licences were being issued freely for thread.  As far back as last November they were refused licences to import thread and were referred for their supplies to the Irish Thread Company of Thomas Street, Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>For the cotton thread?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMacLoughlin" hpid="Mr. MacLoughlin Mr. MacLoughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I have personal experience of this.  I was referred to this firm last November when I was refused a licence.  I was told I would get supplies from Thomas Street, Dublin.  When this firm was written to it took nearly three weeks <Col N="821" /> to get a reply, and then curiously enough it came from Belfast.  Sample orders were promised to be sent out at the end of January but they never came.  Then they were promised in March, in April and in May, but they never came.  The firm wrote a couple of weeks ago as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That as the Free State Government had made thread a reserved commodity, the question still remains unsettled as to whether we shall be allowed to produce a proportion of the cotton required.  Meantime, all our operations are suspended and no further quotations or samples will be sent out until the position is cleared up.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I read the Minister's statement in the Dáil and I heard his statement here, that this firm had lodged an objection to thread being made a reserved commodity but that their objection was not pressed.  I wonder why their objection was not pressed and if any influence was used to have it withdrawn.  The Minister stated that this firm operated only in linen thread.  If that is so, why was their name given as being able to supply cotton thread?  Westport is not yet in production.  They have sample orders in hands for over five weeks which they have not delivered, and if manufacturers had not had the foresight to lay in a stock of thread their workers would be idle for the last month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister wants to have thread made in this country, why does he make it a reserved commodity and allow manufacturers to be left at the mercy of one firm?  If the monopolists have a grudge against any particular firm or do not think you are a nice person to take tea with, they can absolutely ruin the business by holding up supplies or by sending them thread made from an inferior yarn.  Of course, they could appeal to the Department and look for redress, but it would take a month to have a complaint investigated.  In the meantime business would be held up.  I cannot understand why, in the manufacture of this article, the Minister should want to eliminate competition and to <Col N="822" /> get &ldquo;a corner&rdquo; in it.  Most of the evils of the world's industrial situation to-day result from the cornering of commodities.  In most countries the wit of statesmen is baffled to counteract the craze of &ldquo;cornering.&rdquo;  Here our statesmen are going out of their way to create &ldquo;cornering.&rdquo;  There are just as eminent firms in the &ldquo;doubling&rdquo; trade as the British Thread Mills, Ltd., of Leicester, and I am sure more than one of them would only be too glad to come here and start operations if given the same facilities as the Leicester people.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to manufacturers and users of thread that their eggs should not be all placed in one basket.  They should have the advantage of competition in the production of thread. The Minister and the Department should make an effort to get other firms to start operations similar to the Westport one, because competition is the only effective guarantee that manufacturers have that prices will be controlled or that quality will be kept up.  I understand that the great object of the Control of Manufactures Act, under which this Order was made, is to prevent foreign control of industrial concerns here.  Will not the British Thread Mills, Ltd., of Leicester effectively control the Irish Sewing Cotton Company of Westport? No doubt Saorstát citizens may control 50 per cent. of the share capital.  But I do not think it is suggested that the people who possess 50 per cent of the share capital at Westport have even I per cent. knowledge of the trade. The British Thread Mills of Leicester will supply all the technical knowledge, and by supplying all the yarns, they will as effectively control the Westport concern as if it were a branch of their own mill which, in fact, it will be. What we are asked to approve of is the giving of a monopoly to the British Thread Mills, Ltd., of Leicester, and to permit them to exploit Irish manufacturers and users of sewing cotton in the matter of price.  The quotations sent out by the firm show that they are already attempting to do this.  These quotations prove that they are going to make good use of their monopoly, <Col N="823" /> and to extract from Irish manufacturers and users of thread the highest price they can for their products. If the Minister will insist on confining the trade to a single firm that thus early shows, I might say, its grasping propensity, and enables it to create a corner in thread, then I think he is doing a very bad day's work for Irish industry, and instead of helping industrial development he will hamper and hinder it.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to spin a yarn as long as Senator MacLoughlin. While the Senator was obviously sincere in what he had to say for those associated with the trade, nevertheless he was definitely pessimistic.  That is typical of the general attitude that has been adopted by the Opposition towards the development of Irish industries since the present Government took office.  The general feeling that was then held has been exploded, that we could not do this and should not do that.  The Senator made a lot of bones about giving a monopoly in this industry.  The total thread trade of the Free State is worth only about £60,000.</P>

      <P>In a trade of £75,000 it can hardly be suggested that there is room for others to come in and compete, apart from the fact that the Minister can always question the prices being charged.  I put it to Senator MacLoughlin that Coats are one of the greatest cotton thread manufacturers in the world.  They had practically a monopoly here up to the present.  Ninety-five per cent. <Col N="824" /> of the trade of the country was done by Coats and they charged their own prices.</P>

      <P>They had such a grip on the drapery wholesale trade here that they practically charged their own prices and the prices of Coats here were 15 per cent. higher than the prices operating in England. Senator MacLoughlin comes along and makes a lot of disparaging remarks about the factory started here.  Prices are quoted but we have control over the prices here now and we had no control over them up to now.  The Senator says that this firm is only in a small way in the thread industry, while he admits that they are a very reputable firm.  It is as well for the Seanad to know that the great manufacturing firm of Coats spin hardly one per cent. of the thread which they manufacture. That may be news to Senator MacLoughlin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. MacEllin Mr. MacEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the fact. There are a score of spinning manufacturers from whom every thread mill in England buys.  Why do they do that?  Because different spinners specialise in the different qualities of thread and it is far more economic even for Coats to buy from some of these spinners than to spin themselves.  It would be very bad policy for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to set up a spinning industry here.  As a result of investigations by the Department and by its technical advisers, the conclusion has been arrived at that this industry can very <Col N="825" /> well do what Coats are doing in England&mdash;buy the raw material most suitable for the trade of this country from the spinners and manufacture it.  They intend to provide for all the requirements, in shades and quality, of the different manufacturers here and of the trade generally.  Arrangements are being made to provide at least 200 different colours.  They expect to be in a position to do the dyeing of 200 different shades before Christmas. These are the facts and, under the circumstances, I do not think that Senator MacLoughlin was justified in being so pessimistic.  The British Thread Mills Company were one of the few firms in England that survived the intensive price-cutting by Coats with a view to bringing them under the combine.  The fact that they were able to survive is a justification of the quality of their thread.  In the factory now about to be set up, we shall have the advantage free of all their technical advice and all the experience which they have acquired during the last 40 years in England.  When they were able to survive that competition in England, I am sure they will provide just as good quality in their Westport factory.  In the Dáil, a lot of remarks were made which were, to say the least, unfair.  I do not mind Deputy Dillon's remarks&mdash;that he would get a firm of repute to spin and make thread in this country within two weeks.  That man was only talking in glorified ignorance of the subject.</P>

      <P>I have no connection in any shape or form with this factory but I am from Mayo and this is the first factory which has gone to Mayo. It is established in one of the poorest <Col N="826" /> and most populous districts along the western seaboard.  These people are not interested in politics or in anything but the development of the West. The remarks made were not fair. These are not the type of people who will enter into public controversy to defend their position.  Suggestions of sweated labour were made about the factory.  That is not so.  The machines were only erected within the last fortnight and are now only on trial.  They are not working to capacity at all, and they are likely to go wrong for the next week or two.  The mechanics are still, more or less, running them in. In these circumstances, only a few girls are employed.  The directors of the company selected about 20 girls and brought them across to England. These girls were brought from the farm-houses, had no experience of industrial life and had never before stood at such machines.  They paid the expenses of these girls, paid for their keep and gave them 10/- per week pocket-money while over there.  On their return, some of them were quite proficient but more of them, naturally, were not.  Last week was really the first week some of them got to work properly at the machines and one girl earned 36/6 last week.  The basis of payment, I need not say, will be the same as that in England.  The conditions of work&mdash;payment, hours, and so forth&mdash;will be identical with the conditions in England.</P>

      <P>I have no interest in the factory, financially or in any other <Col N="827" /> form, except that I am a Mayo man and that this factory is in Mayo.  I have stated that publicly.  I have explained the position as I see it. Everybody in Mayo knows that these girls were brought across to England and trained there.  I hope that the same results will be got by the girls working in the factory in Westport as in the English factory in time.  When they have experience, and when they have learned the art, I have no doubt they will be able to earn the same wages as are earned by these girls in England, which are from £2 to £3 a week.  Naturally, it is all piece-work. The industry has not yet started, and the least people might do is leave it alone.  If anything which is seriously and radically wrong occurs, representations can be made in this House.  It will take some weeks to get the machines working normally, and, with experience, I think it will be found between now and Christmas that the conditions are good.  Those in charge seem to be anxious to treat their employees properly and to give them fair wage conditions.  If they do not, the Bill now coming from the Dáil will operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the very reasoned and well-informed statement of Senator MacLoughlin will receive the careful consideration of the Minister. I think it deserves fairer treatment than that accorded it by Senator MacEllin.  I am prepared to accept Senator MacEllin as an authority on eggs and matters of that kind but, in matters connected with thread, I should much prefer to accept the evidence and authority of Senator MacLoughlin, who is closely associated with that business.  It is, I think, utterly unfair that every time that anybody offers criticism&mdash;no matter how fair, how unbiased and how unprejudiced&mdash;<i>mala fides</i> must be attributed to him and he must be accused of trying to sabotage the industry under discussion.  Senator MacEllin has indulged in special pleading.  He says he has no connection whatever with the firm concerned and yet he proceeds to pledge the firm in regard to such <Col N="828" /> important matters as prices and conditions of service for the employees. I do not know what authority he has for that.  We are asked to accept the statement of a Senator who has no connection with the business as binding the firm or as something that is worth considering.  The firm could repudiate that statement to-morrow or even to-day, so that his statement is of no value in view of his repudiation of connection with the firm.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to take special notice of what Senator MacLoughlin has said.  We are giving a monopoly to a branch of an English firm.  It will be just an agency for the English firm.  We are giving that monopoly in connection with a very technical manufacturing process&mdash;an article that, as the Senator pointed out, affects every branch of the clothing industry. It involves 360 different colours, for one thing.  The technical experience at the disposal of that firm is, presumably, represented by the few girls who were sent over for a couple of months to Leicester to be trained and who come back trained for the turning out of the many colours and the hundreds of different shades required in this industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that he is going to ensure that the prices charged here will be world prices, or the prices for the same thread, quality for quality, that are charged in Great Britain.  That is his promise.  Senator MacLoughlin gave a quotation from a firm which, in one case, demanded 45 per cent. more, quality for quality, than the same thread would command in Great Britain.  Now, that was not a mere statement, because the Senator read it from the billheads of the firm itself.  I trust that the Minister will take that statement and examine it.  I hope he will go to the firm and see what they mean by their promise, and also that any promises they make are going to be implemented.  Quite a number of clothing factories have been established here.  They have been opened with full pomp of flag and trumpet.  These are now going to be absolutely sabotaged and held up by the activities of the <Col N="829" />&ldquo;boloney&rdquo; factory in Westport.  It probably will not be able to supply the materials they require, or it may insist on prices that will result in raising the cost of the commodity to the consumer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. MacEllin Mr. MacEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEllin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>One should consider whether it is good policy in setting up one factory, seriously to injure another factory or, indeed, numerous factories, and so put out of employment the workers employed in those factories. Senator MacLoughlin gave us an example of an application in regard to thread.  He was referred to a Dublin firm and months afterwards he found that he could not get the thread.  Have we any guarantee that the same thing will not happen here when the whole thing is vested in one firm?  I would like the Minister to assure himself now that he can rely upon the promises given by the promoters of this firm being implemented.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of rates of pay and conditions of service, we have Senator MacEllin's assurance that they will pay full trade union rates.  I would like to know if the Minister is in a position to confirm that?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>That can be interpreted in various ways.  Senator MacEllin says that the rates generally will be from £2 to £3 a week to girls.  I suggest that we should ascertain if a rate will be fixed according to the fair wages provision.  Will it be up to £3 per week for girls?  It could be a miserably low rate, and it could be far and away below the rate paid for similar work in Leicester.  We should like to have an assurance that the firm at Westport are not going to employ sweated labour at a lower rate than they pay on the other side, because of the fact that they have got a monopoly here for the thread that is to be used throughout the whole of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>My attitude is somewhat different from that of the previous speakers.  I am prepared to <Col N="830" /> concede that the firm in question is very well equipped, that it is a firm with a good reputation, and that it will pay wages probably on the Leicester scale as the boot manufacturers from that city have done.  I imagine from the course of the discussion, that some conflict arose from the fact that the Coats combine has been mainly supplying the retail trade for the home use of cotton, and that Senator MacLoughlin is more concerned with the trade from the point of view of the manufacturers in the new sewing industries that have been established and are developing.  It is certainly a very important matter to be assured that price, quality and variety will be available for them.  Now, all these requirements may be well satisfied by the Minister's assurance.  The question of price, and the quotation given by Senator MacLoughlin, appear to me to be due to the fact that there is a 40 per cent. duty, and the Westport people appear to have interpreted their assurances to the Minister on this: the British price plus duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I said the price in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The price in Great Britain plus the duty here.  If that is not so they appear to have broken their promises.  I am sure the Minister will look into that, because I have no doubt he has the interests of sewing firms, of manufacturers of clothing and such like in his care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, what is a more important matter to me is the policy that is involved in this proposition.  It was under Part III of the Control of Manufactures Act that the power that is now under discussion was conferred. When that measure was under discussion the Minister gave assurances to the Dáil and, possibly, to the Seanad that it was not likely that &ldquo;more than two or three Orders at the most&rdquo; would be made under that Part of the Act.  This is Order No. 1, and this is a company with a capital of £20,000 to deal with a commodity of which the sale will probably be in or about £75,000.  I think it is a very <Col N="831" /> good point in the Government's policy that they should seek for the distribution of industries throughout the country, but I am very doubtful indeed as to the wisdom of establishing an industry of this kind in Westport under the provisions of this Act.  If that policy is followed one can look for perhaps 20 other industries of similar dimensions with a consumption value for £50,000 to £100,000 a year which might possibly be established in different parts of the country. In fact that would be to proceed by way of this Act to establish similar firms with monopolies.</P>
    <P>That is not in accord with the understanding that was given when this Act was brought to the Dáil and the Seanad.  At that time the Minister said that proposals were under examination for certain chemical industries which involved the investment of very large sums of money. The impression created was that the powers of Part III of the Act were to deal with classes of industry of which only two or three were likely to be required; where large sums of money would be necessary, and where it would be impossible to get the equipment or the technical knowledge required within the country.  The feeling was that there would be no possibility of establishing such industries without such powers and such promises.</P>
    <P>Here we are departing from the notion that those powers of monopoly are to be reserved for these large industries.  Cement and motor tyres were taken, as instances of the kind of thing that was in mind.  Following the passage of two Bills dealing with these commodities we were encouraged to believe that this power was given to the Minister to deal with similar classes of industry.  Now we come to a £20,000 industry and a £75,000 market.  That, to my mind, puts it in a very different category.  I am very loth to allow the powers of that Act to be used for the establishment of this kind of industry, with this kind of monopoly, and I think it would require much more evidence of the <Col N="832" /> need and the necessity for this procedure before the House could pass this resolution.</P>

      <P>There are just a few points that I wish to deal with.  On one side we have a Senator telling us that a small firm employing 200 people is being established in Westport, and that it is going to be carried on under the control of a British firm.  On the other side we have another Senator telling us that up to this the thread industry has been controlled by Messrs. Coats.  It seems to me that while you are doing away with one firm that is outside your control, you are introducing another firm that has its principal centre of manufacture also outside the country.  From the course of the debate one gathers that employment is going to be given to 200 or 300 girls in this new industry. The question of price is an important one.  We have been told by those who claim to speak with authority that present prices are extremely high. Now is the time, I suggest, when we are establishing this new industry st Westport to make sure that the prices charged will at any rate not be higher than the prices charged in England, and that, if possible, they will be lower. We know what happens when monopolies are created.  Prices go up.  Now is the time to take steps to control prices, and not leave it until it is too late, when the most that we can do if there are any complaints is to raise the matter on the adjournment.  Steps should be taken now to ensure that the price charged for thread here will not be any higher than it is now.  In view of what we have been told we should see to it that the price is not higher than that charged in England.  I fail to see myself how the prices can be the same because there is very keen competition in England in this trade.  If this Leicester firm, or any other firm in the trade in England, quote for thread in this country they are going to quote for as high a price as they can possibly set.  The Westport firm when they start have got to train people.  Their <Col N="834" /> turnover will be very small and they will have to pay freight on the thread. I fail to see how they can produce it exactly at the same price as British thread unless they are given some form of subsidy by the Government.  We have had experience of some other monopolies in this country.  They did not appear to be monopolies, but in actual fact they are.  I am referring to the flour milling industry, which has forced up the price of an essential commodity for the people to a point which is very much higher than the price in England.  Possibly the same thing is going to happen in the case of this industry.  Senator O'Farrell made a point regarding the question of the wages.  If this firm is going to pay the same rate of wages as is being paid in Leicester I find it difficult to understand, taking into account the other charges which have been enumerated, how they are going to be able to sell thread at the price at which it is being sold in England.</P>

      <P>I desire to make a few observations on matters which I am rather troubled myself about and which, perhaps, troubled some other Senators in the course of the discussion. I am sure everybody will admit, notwithstanding the method of criticism of some of my friends and what has been said by Senator MacLoughlin, that we are all trying to do the best we can.  This is a matter of business and we ought to be very careful. Senator MacLoughlin, evidently, is a specialist in this matter and knows what he is talking about.  He has certainly given us a great deal of information. I should like to get for my own guidance and the guidance of the House a little information from the Minister.  Before I would ask him for that information I should like to say that I am sure everybody in the House would regret very much that any action of this sort would have the inevitable result of raising the price of what is, perhaps, a necessary commodity, and everybody in the House would regret it if the employment of labour was at a wage that would not commend itself to anybody who is interested in the <Col N="835" /> worker.  Although some of us do not profess it perhaps as ardently as others, I am sure we all feel that everything that can be done by this House to protect the interests of the workers should be done, no matter what Party we belong to.</P>
      <P>This appears to be one of the first Orders of this kind.  Perhaps the Minister would be kind enough to tell us, because I am sure we are all anxious to assist in the promotion of industry and the giving of employment, for what period the Order will be in force.  Perhaps he would tell us also what power of revision or supervision there is.  I am sure the House will be perfectly satisfied that when the time for revision comes the Minister in office will bear in mind that he has a duty to perform as regards the remuneration of the worker and the price that is charged for the commodity as well as the supply of the commodity as it is required by the trade. While what I am saying is meant to get some information for myself, I hope it will help us to come to the decision we all desire, to help industry as far as we can.</P>

      <P>I want to get a little information also.  Would it be within the competence of the Minister, provided this Order were passed into law and he found that the clothing trade in which thread is a vital material were dissatisfied with the products of this factory, to open the ports and let in thread from Britain?  In that way he would have a counter-stroke and be able to remedy whatever damage may be done.  We are all in favour of helping industry.  I think in that way a check could be kept upon this factory.  I do not want to go in for the industry of yarn-spinning.  We have had enough of yarn-spinning here this evening.  We had Senator Comyn yarning about the eastern coast.</P>

      <P>There is one thing to <Col N="836" /> which I should like to draw attention. It is rather a word of criticism as to the procedure involved in this.  The Minister has informed us that the assent of the two Houses of the Oireachtas is necessary to make orders of this kind operative.  That may be so in theory but, in actual fact, is it expedient or is it likely that when the Minister has more or less entered into an understanding with a firm and the firm has embarked on a certain expenditure in the preliminary work of erecting a factory and a certain stage in the construction has been reached that the Oireachtas is going to refuse the Order?  I say it is worth consideration whether or not the time for placing such an Order before the Oireachtas should not be before that stage has been reached so that if, upon examination, the mature opinion of the Oireachtas was that such an Order should not be made the persons concerned would not be involved as a result of such decision in serious financial loss, as undoubtedly this company would be if this Order was refused.  I think it is hardly fair either to the persons concerned that their capital should be hazarded by the possibility of the Oireachtas refusing the Order and it is hardly fair to the Oireachtas to put them in the position that they are not really free to judge the matter on its merits because an adverse decision on their part might have an adverse effect upon an enterprise.</P>

      <P>I should like to say that at the outset of this discussion I asked the Minister certain questions because I was anxious to protect existing industries in the country. From information that I have received, I felt it was necessary that either a guarantee should be got that this particular firm would be in a position to manufacture certain classes of thread that are required for carrying on industries, and if they were not in a position to supply the requirements of the manufacturers that licences would be granted to those manufacturers to enable them to get the raw materials to <Col N="837" /> carry on their industry.  I intended making no speech further than that. I do not think it is necessary for any member of the Labour Party to say that he is in favour of an industry being started in Westport.  That goes without saying.  There is no necessity for anybody to get up in this House in the best Jeremiah Dempsey style, to ask is the East in favour of the West.  That particular type of thing may be suitable for the cross-roads but it is not suitable for a legislative assembly.  Then to go on to talk about alleged advocates of labour and to talk about dishonesty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

A capitalist like the Senator who has interests in in the West and the East &mdash; recent events have proved that he is a great champion of the West, but when there is benefit to be got for himself he is not averse to having an interest in the East&mdash;is the man who talks about the alleged advocates of labour.  I suggest to the Senator, for his own peace of mind, that the less of that talk we hear from him the better.  I could go back over 20 years and remind the Senator of his partiality to the Labour Party more than 20 years ago.  I do not want to be forced to do it.</P>

      <P>This Bill implies a monopoly.  Although we are all certainly in favour of the establishment of the industry it is right that we should understand that big sacrifices, probably, are involved in the establishment of this as well as many other industries.  The statement made by Senator MacLoughlin deserves the most serious consideration.  Amongst the many things he said&mdash;and he produced figures&mdash;was that the prices of this very important material were likely to be increased.  Everybody knows that the cost of clothes has gone up.  To bring the matter down to bedrock I suggest that an addendum should be made to this Order to ensure that the prices of thread will not be increased beyond the British prices for thread of similar quality.</P>

      <P>I desire to deal briefly with the remarks made by Senator Wilson.  He suggested, as a means of keeping prices in order, that the market should be opened to the British thread.  History has told us that whenever an industry of any importance succeeded in this country English manufacturers flooded the market until they succeeded in crushing out the home products.  When they had crushed them out they came along and doubled the price that had been charged before the establishment of the Irish industry.  I suggest to the Minister that he can regulate the prices through the Prices Commission or some such organisation, but I advise him that in no circumstances, while a new industry is finding its legs in Ireland, should he open the market for foreign competition.</P>

      <P>What astonishes me in this debate is the sudden and furious rage of the Labour Party against the establishment of a factory in the West of Ireland.  Nothing seems to annoy them so much as to say <Col N="839" /> that the West should be looked after to some extent and that there should be an occasional factory set up there. That attitude is quite beyond my understanding.  I come from County Mayo.  I was brought up there.  I have no interest in this factory beyond that I should like to see something done for the West.  We have very few factories of any sort in the West. Why should this issue be raised just because we attempt to start a factory in the West?  I do not want to enter into an argument about this, but I do feel annoyed by the side issues that have been raised.  I think that Senator Farren should know better than to use the terms he has used in this connection. As a matter of fact, I was quite surprised at the terms he used. I am quite sure that the Senator is a reasonable person enough, and I do not see why he should be so enraged. Senator O'Farrell, who raised the storm first, started off by using similar arguments.  I think that this matter should be argued in a more reasonable way and that we should wait to find out what the Minister has to tell us. I am interested, mainly, to see our eyes turned westwards.  The eyes of Ireland have been always turned eastwards, for many reasons, into which I will not enter.  I want to see our eyes turned westwards and to see as many industries established on the West coast as there are on the East coast.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Minister will say with regard to Senator MacLoughlin's statement as to the figures quoted by this firm, but it seems to me that, in administering the Act under which this Order is made, the object and justification for giving a monopoly is that the goods should be supplied at, approximately, the same prices, or very little above the prices, at which they could be imported, and that the conditions for the workers should be equivalent to those that prevail ordinarily outside. The persons who get a monopoly get very considerable advantages, and it is easily conceivable that one concern, operating in a small market, might be practically an economic unit, <Col N="840" /> whereas, if there were not a monopoly, there would be other firms engaging in the same business, with the result that the prices would be different; whereas, when there is a monopoly, and where there is not, perhaps, the same selling difficulties as there would be if there were not a monopoly, and where there are other advantages such as a monopoly gives, the granting of a monopoly is justified only by making sure that, approximately, the same value is given as the outside manufacturer would give.  While, at the same time, there may be some fractional increases in the price, owing to special circumstances, the price ought to be somewhat near the price of the imported article.  Even the biggest outside manufacturer, where there is not a monopoly, has all sorts of organisations to maintain which are not necessary where a monopoly exists. Such a manufacturer has to face all sorts of difficulties which the man with the monopoly would not have to face, and I think that the principle which ought to be observed in this case, and in all cases, ought to be one whereby the manufacturer paid for his monopoly by giving value that could not be expected by ordinary tariff arrangements where there would be a splitting of the arrangements, and so forth.  I hope that the Minister will give some answer to the effect that, if he cannot deny, as I presume he cannot, that these quotations are correct, he will be able to say that he has come to some understanding whereby, after the first initial period in which the workers have had time to become expert and the lines and ordinary routine of the industry had been established, such prices will not be quoted and that the industry will be able to give 5 per cent. or 10 per cent. or something like that.</P>

      <P>I do not want to intervene in this debate, but as Senator Colonel Moore seems to think that the Labour Party opposes the starting of a factory in the West, and lest there should be some other Senator of the same opinion, I wish to say that we are not opposed to the establishment of a factory in the West, but that we <Col N="841" /> are very apprehensive of a factory being started, whether in the West, the East or anywhere else, where the working conditions will not be good.  We are speaking purely on behalf of the employees, and, surely, we need not offer any apology to anybody, whether in this House or outside it, for that anxiety.  I have listened to a good deal of the discussion.  Unfortunately, I was not here when Senator Comyn made an uncalled-for attack on the Labour Party.</P>

I want to say, however, that the only useful part taken in the discussion was the part taken by Senator MacLoughlin.  Senator MacLoughlin talked as a man who knows his business&mdash;a practical man&mdash;and, naturally, he is representative of the manufacturing mind in this country, and he wants to have an assurance that he will be able to carry on with his business. I happen to know that Senator MacLoughlin's business is mainly an export business and it is very much to his credit that he can compete in the London market with any manufacturer in or outside this country.  Consequently, when he talks on this matter, he talks as a man who is thoroughly competent to discuss the matter, and, as he is apprehensive about the position, I am sure that the Minister will largely confine himself to the remarks or points raised by Senator MacLoughlin, and I must say that, whether it is because of his practical knowledge of the business or not, it is something unusual for him to speak in this way.  The Senator has been extremely modest or moderate in putting forward his case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should say that the passage of this resolution, and the making of this article a reserved commodity, does not, of itself, confine its manufacture to anybody.  There is no statutory restriction on the number of persons who may receive licences, but, in fact, I do not think that there would be room for more than one firm to engage in it so long as the market remains at its present size.  Of course, the market is expanding and, at some other stage, for various reasons, it might be desirable to issue a licence to some other concern to undertake this manufacture; but the intention of the Order is that, if there were a second firm licensed to manufacture at any time, it would have to be in the same neighbourhood as the first factory or else such arrangements made as would protect the first factory so far as possible.  So far as prices are concerned, it is intended that, when the preliminary period of training and so on is over, the prices, ex factory at Westport, will not exceed the prices ex factory at Leicester. That is not a matter of a promise.  It is a matter of an undertaking that can be imposed on this firm as a condition of its licence if this resolution is passed.  If they do not comply with these conditions, they will find themselves subject to a penalty which may amount to £50 a day and also to the revocation of their licence.  It is not anticipated, however, that that will happen.  It is possible that the price quoted at the moment may be higher than the British price, but it must be remembered that the firm has not yet started production.  At the moment, it is only engaged in running in machines, and I imagine that, for some time to come, it will be only manufacturing for stock and that it will be some weeks before they will be able to offer goods for sale.  In any event, the provision as to prices does not become operative until the licence is issued, and the licence will be subject to the conditions I have mentioned.  I am sure that Senators will understand that a firm getting a licence under this provision <Col N="843" /> is in an entirely different position from a firm getting a licence under another part of the Act, because a licence under Part III can be made subject to very severe conditions&mdash;so severe that, in certain cases, such as those mentioned by Senator Johnson, some firms preferred to proceed without having a reserve commodity order&mdash;and so far as prices are concerned, the undertaking given by the firm concerned is that the prices, ex factory at Westport, will not exceed the prices, ex factory, at Leicester, and that will be much more easily enforceable in that way than by the Prices Commission.  I do not know what prices the factory are quoting at the present time.  I am surprised to hear they are quoting any price at all, because I understood that they were only producing for stock at the moment and were not in a position to supply goods for sale.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be interested in that matter.  The firm is not subject to the undertaking at the moment. It has not got its licence.  The Order does not become operative until the Resolution is passed.  The licence will then be issued, and from the date of its issue the firm will be subject to the conditions imposed therein, and its undertaking in respect to prices, that under like conditions of sale ex factory Westport prices will not exceed prices ex factory Leicester.  It is their intention to make the full variety of threads and, in so far as they may not be in a position any time to supply threads of any class or colour, manufacturers will be allowed to import free of duty.  At present licences to import are not <Col N="844" /> being issued because there are adequate supplies in the country.  That is not entirely correct because manufacturers are getting supplies.  The hold-up in licences is in respect to persons engaged in the sale of thread. In any event, the issue of licences will be resumed in a short time, when the position in respect to stocks of thread in this country will be clarified.  The earlier that we can get to the position that we can resume the issue of licences the better I will be pleased, because the present position is most undesirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to deal further with that except to say that the existence of these stocks does not ease the situation unless these stocks are sold. So far persons who hold these stocks at present are not disposed to put them on the market at all.  It is true that the factory at Westport does not propose to spin cotton yarn from raw cotton.  I do not think its requirements would justify the installation of a spinning plant for doing it.  Before it is possible to have a cotton spinning plant we will have to have the cotton weaving industry established on a more extended scale. The next stage in the extension of cotton will be an extension of weaving and only after that the installation of a spinning plant. That would be possible if we were weaving cotton cloths that are now imported, but not otherwise.  It is not intended to give the factory at Westport sole rights to import cotton thread. They have no exclusive licence to import cotton thread.  These licences are issued to persons previously engaged in the importation of cotton thread.  The licences that will be issued in respect of that commodity will be to persons previously engaged in the business of importation and in proportion to their previous imports. That is the ordinary practice followed by the Department, because it appears to be the fairest method of allocating the business remaining amongst those who have been previously engaged in it.  Up to the present, so long as licences were issued we were not so rigid in the restrictions.  The necessity <Col N="845" /> for rigidity and control will not arise until a fairly large quantity of thread is available for sale from the Westport factory.</P>
    <P>I would be curious to look into the matter of the reference of an applicant for a licence to the Irish Thread Company of Thomas Street, Dublin.  It is quite possible a mistake was made by an officer of the Department. Obviously a mistake was made somewhere, because we would never refer to the Linen Thread Company an applicant for a licence for cotton threads, particularly when the effect of the Order is to prevent that Linen Thread Company manufacturing cotton thread.  Under no circumstances would we encourage them to do that. We would certainly object to that company doing so until they have fulfilled what they undertook to do with regard to linen thread when the duty was imposed on linen thread, and when this firm was installing plant and when they are not yet fully in manufacture. All processes of manufacture are not being done.  Under these circumstances we are urging them to concentrate on the job they started before tackling any other job.  If an applicant for a licence to import cotton thread was referred to that factory, it was clearly a mistake, because it is linen thread they are engaged in producing.</P>
    <P>It is not quite correct to say that the purpose of the Control of Manufactures Act is to prevent foreign companies engaging in industry here. The purpose is to enable us to control foreign companies engaging in industry. We could not get this industry started without outside technical assistance and we could not get that assistance except by enabling the outside firm investing capital in the concern to ensure its safety by exercising effective technical control.  It was on that basis the firm was established. It is possible when additional capital has to be secured for this undertaking&mdash;I mentioned that that would have to be undertaken in the future&mdash;that a higher proportion of the total capital will be held by Irish shareholders, and a greater part <Col N="846" /> of the control exercised in Ireland. At present the capital is held 50 per cent. by the British Thread Company and 50 per cent. by Irish interests. There are four directors, two being Saorstát nationals and two British nationals.  The chairman is one of the British directors.  So far as rates of wages are concerned, Senators have not to rely entirely on the assurance of Senator MacEllin.  The Department of Industry and Commerce are aware of the company's intention to organise the factory here on the same basis, in relation to hours of employment, and rates of wages, as the concern in Leicester.  In any event, the statutory obligation is imposed on them, when the licence is issued, of paying fair wages.  I think that gives the Department sufficient power to exercise control which ordinarily it cannot exercise.</P>
    <P>In so far as Senator O'Farrell complained of Section 25 not being likely to be effective, I would point to the fact that it was inserted on the proposal of Senator Johnson when the Control of Manufactures Bill was before the Seanad.  Senator O'Farrell can be assured that we will take good care that clothing and similar factories where thread is used as raw material will not be adversely affected to any extent which would interfere with their development.  I do not think Senator Dillon was right in saying that the cost of clothing had gone up.  I noticed in the returns received by the Department, dealing with the cost-of-living index, that it was clear during the past two or three years that the retail price of clothing has been going down.  In fact, in the majority of the clothing trades, I think there is rather intensified competition amongst the firms which are operating to keep prices level.  The licences which are issued under Reserved Commodity Orders are issued for an indefinite period.  They are not issued for any fixed period. Conditions can be imposed which would have the effect of limiting them in respect to time.  The licence, however, is ordinarily indefinite, subject only to revocation on the application of the <Col N="847" /> licensee, or when the licensce has been convicted of a breach of one or other of the conditions.</P>
    <P>Neither is there anything in the Reserve Commodity Order which imposes restrictions on the imports of sewing cotton.  Sewing cotton is subject to 40 per cent. duty, and even if this Order were made and, if sewing cotton was a reserved commodity, there is nothing to prevent the removal of that duty or the regulation of thread imports, whichever we consider in the interests of the country.  If, in fact, the factory engaged in production was not producing or not conforming with the conditions of the licence, the importation of thread would have to be resumed or increased to enable requirements to be met.  In reply to Senator Milroy, I would like to say that the Seanad is quite free, as far as I am concerned, to reject this motion if they so choose.  If the firm decided to proceed with the erection of their factory, before the Reserve Commodity Order was made and approved of by both Houses of the Oireachtas, that is their concern.  Probably they would be involved in some loss if no Reserve Commodity Order was made.  I think the net result would be that they would minimise that loss by transferring their plant from Westport to Dublin.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Industry and Commerce, I would be completely discharged from any obligation if the Order was not made following rejection of the motion by the Seanad.  In so far as the firm might be involved in loss by rejection of the Order, that is due to the fact that they decided to embark on the erection and equipment of the factory before the Order was confirmed.  It is desirable that the Order should be made, because it is only when the Order is made we get power to impose the conditions I have referred to in respect of prices, quality, maximum output, and the other things set out in the Control of Manufactures Act.</P>
    <P>The only other matter necessary to refer to was raised by Senator <Col N="848" /> Johnson.  He questioned generally the advisability of making a Reserved Commodity Order in respect of sewing cotton.  I have not the particular words I used when the Bill was before the Seanad.  My recollection is fairly clear that I indicated that Reserved Commodity Orders would be made in two types of cases, one where the industry could be established only on the basis of supplying the whole of the market from one concern, and where substantial capital investment was necessary.  I gave an example of that type of industry, cement and rubber tyre manufacture.  I also indicated that the Act gave power which could be used in order to secure the establishment of industries in localities in the west of the country where, in the ordinary way, manufacturers would not be likely to go, because they would place themselves at a competitive disadvantage as against manufacturers established in other centres.  In the majority of cases we have to bargain with intending industrialists when they come to the Department with projects, and desire to get them to go outside Dublin, to towns around the country, where it is desired to have industrial activity commenced, by refusing to afford protection or some facility which always would be given, unless they conformed to Government policy in that regard.  That is not a very satisfactory way.</P>
    <P>In fact, a very large number of industrialists just proceed with their plans and are not in the position of requiring any facilities from the Department of Industry and Commerce, particularly when protection has already been afforded to an industry in which other people are engaged.  In the case of the establishment of the factory in Westport, if we imposed a duty merely any other firm could put itself in a position to avail of that protection and could establish a factory.  It would not require any facilities of any kind from the Government. No restrictions can be put upon it in order to get it to establish its factory in some other place than that which it chose to adopt.</P>

      <P>I am speaking from my recollection.  I referred to the desirability of trying to get industries established in certain areas.  In fact, the only two Reserved Commodity Orders the Government proposed to make were for that purpose.  The other one has not yet come before the Oireachtas.  It may not be made because of certain reasons. In that case, it was proposed to make an order in respect of art silk knitted fabric.  That was different from this case, inasmuch as there was no immediate proposition to establish a factory for that purpose.  We proposed to make it a reserved commodity and to announce that licences would be given to anybody who would establish factories in certain named counties.  That may not come to anything.  In view of the provisions of Section 17 of the Control of Manufactures Act, it may not be possible to make that article a reserved commodity at all.  This is the only case in which a Reserved Commodity Order has been made, so far, and the reason is the desire to establish an industry in the West.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he has made any provision for checking the weights of the millers and corn buyers who will buy the corn and pay on the basis of so many lbs. per bushel.  I have heard many complaints in that regard.  In my own experience, in several loads of wheat delivered to the same merchant there was a discrepancy of from 1½ to 2 lb. between wheat out of the same land and from the same threshing. Something must have been wrong with <Col N="850" /> the machine for testing the weight or there must be something wrong with the honesty of the miller or corn merchant when such a discrepancy occurs. I have heard of many cases of a similar type.  The Minister should provide some means of checking the weighing by corn buyers and millers and see that they carry out their part of the bargain.</P>

      <P>My experience is that you bring in your sample and the wheat is put into a little scale like a cocoa tin which registers the number to the bushel.  You can look at it and, if you are not satisfied, you can have another &ldquo;go,&rdquo; but he will not allow you to pack the wheat into it.  I think that any farmer could follow up his wheat and see that it was properly dealt with.</P>

      <P>This section is intended to provide for some sort of apparatus that will be absolutely reliable.  If there is anything wrong with the present apparatus, it is that it is too small.  It holds a very small percentage and we should like to have it so arranged that it would hold, perhaps, a quarter of a bushel.  Then there would not be these discrepancies.  If you rub off three grains in this small measure, it makes a big difference.  If they are compelled to use a large measure, it will be more reliable.  We intend to provide for some sort of automatic register so that the farmer himself can read off the result.  I am afraid it would be impossible to do that this year because we should have to give a few months' notice to the buyers to instal this apparatus.  We could not do that now.</P>

    <P>The object of this amendment is to raise the price of wheat by 3/- per barrel.  I am sure everybody will agree that an increase of 3/- per barrel, raising the price to 26/6, is not very exorbitant for millable wheat.  When we consider the cost of producing an acre of wheat, I am sure the Seanad will agree that 26/6 is not an exorbitant price to seek.  It will hardly be argued that £1 12s. 6d. is sufficient profit for a farmer out of an acre of millable wheat. Wheat growing is precarious at any time in this country.  I have had experience of growing wheat for a great many years and I do not remember, for a considerable time, when wheat could be harvested with so much ease as during the past two years.  I remember when I bought wheat for 10/6 for 20 stones for cattle feeding owing to the fact that it had been destroyed by the weather.  That may happen to a large percentage of the wheat which we grow in this country. Consequently, the farmers, in growing wheat, are taking a big risk and they require an economic price by way of insurance against the loss of their crop.</P>
    <P>I should much prefer to have a price per acre, even if it was guaranteed by the Government by way of bounty.  It would ensure that the farmers who grew wheat and, through no fault of their own, were not able to harvest it, would not be at the loss of their crop. The Minister turned down that proposal, and I think the least we can do is provide an economic price for farmers who produce a millable sample. <Col N="853" /> I have before me costings by the Cork Committee of Agriculture in connection with the production of an acre of wheat.  With a few of the items I do not agree.  The Minister has already got a copy of the costings, and I am prepared to argue against him in respect of any item which he says is too large.  There is one item which is over-valued in the costings.  The return for straw is given as £1 5s. 0d. per statute acre.  In my opinion, straw was not worth that price, even in Dublin, where there is always a better market than in any other part of the country.  Straw did not return 25/- in County Dublin in the last two years. This year, I do not think, we will be able to dispose of wheaten straw at any price.  The greater part of it will, probably, have to be burned, as stall feeding is practically knocked on the head now.  The stall feeders who stall-fed for the last two years are not going to continue the process, which was an absolute loss.  In that way, straw will be useless, and the allowance of 25/- in the costings will have to be taken off.  In the costings, the production of a statute acre of wheat was given as seven barrels at 23/6, which made £8 4s. 6d., with straw at 25/-.  The cost of an acre of wheat came to £7 10s. 0d., and the total price to £9 9s. 6d.  The profit is worked out at £1 12s. 6d.  Under my proposal, the profit would be advanced to £2 12s. 6d.</P>
    <P>I do not think that that is an exorbitant profit for a farmer who produces an acre of millable wheat. It would not go very far to meet his outlay for the rest of the year.  Wheat is now one of the principal crops which, according to the Minister, the farmer must depend upon for his revenue and the price I suggest is not too much.  The amount which I propose would mean very little in the cost of bread, although some Senators may say that it will raise the price of bread to the poor.  I have gone into the matter and I find that an additional price of 3/- per barrel would mean 1/15th of a penny on the 2 lb. loaf.  I do not think that even the poorest person would grudge the farmer an economic price for his <Col N="854" /> wheat even if he had to pay 1/15th of a penny extra for his loaf.  We hear a lot of talk of sympathy with farmers, but when a proposal is put forward in this House to give the farmer some return for his labour we find that the people who are very loud in expressing their sympathy are prepared to go into the division lobby and vote against the smallest concession for the farmers.  They will down the farmer every time.  That is the policy.</P>
    <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with many of the arguments put forward in this House by Senator Jameson, but I was surprised at his speech on the Second Reading of the Bill, because he seemed to think that it was a monstrous proposition that the general public should be taxed one-fifteenth of a penny to compensate the farmer.  It surprised me that Senator Jameson, whom we all look up to as our sheet anchor when we need help, should be the first to turn me down.  Senator Johnson wants help when he is out to get increases in wages for workers, and when he is pleading for widows' and orphans' pensions.  The position is that the farmer-Senators have the Labour Senators up in arms against them. The Fianna Fáil farmer-representatives always answer the crack of the Party whip.  I would like to see a little more independence displayed by the farmer-representatives in this House.  I want to get support for the proposals I am putting forward to help the farmers of the country.  The farmers are entitled to receive this help, and for that reason I hope the amendment will be passed.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that I cannot agree with Senator Counihan's suggestion although I am a farmer-representative. In saying that I am showing some of the independence which he has spoken of.  Since this wheat question was first mooted I have always held the view&mdash;I am not against wheat growing in any way&mdash;that to subsidise the fellow who has got the type of land on which wheat can be grown is a <Col N="855" /> great injustice to the men whose land will not grow wheat.</P>
      <P>I wish some of us had the land on which wheat could be grown, because if so we would be in a much better position than we are.  Let me give some figures.  Under Griffith's valuation, you have five counties with a total of 5,000,000 acres of land where the valuations are under 10/- an acre and three counties where the average valuation is under 5/- per acre.  In the remaining 21 counties, with 11,000 acres, you have valuations varying from over 10/- up to 22/-.  These valuations, as we know, were based on the capacity of the land to grow wheat.  When you take the statistical abstract it shows what is actually happening.  Taking a proportionate figure, in the five counties of low valuation you have one acre of wheat grown, to the 12 acres in the highly valued counties.  What does that mean?  A subsidy is paid on all wheat grown, and it means that the poor counties are paying a very large proportion of it for the 11,000 acres grown in the highly valued counties, in those counties where it is definitely easier to live and where the people are nearer to a market.  In other words, it means that I and my neighbours in Kerry are paying for the wheat grown by Senator Counihan and Senator Wilson, and surely they do not want that help.  I maintain that to add another 3/- to the present subsidy is going not only to perpetuate the injustice of which I have complained, but to make it very much greater than it has been. Over and above that, the increased subsidy will mean for the people living in the low valued counties that they are going to have to pay this one-fifteenth of a penny of an increase.  That will amount to 4/2 extra in the consumption of a 1lb. loaf per day.  I have always objected to the principle of giving a bounty for the growing of one type of grain.  I do not see why it should be given to one type of grain and not to the others.  I think it is an unreasonable thing to do.</P>

      <P>In view of Senator Counihan's references to me I suppose <Col N="856" /> I had better make a few remarks.  He completely misunderstood, I think, my opposition to one of the essential features of this Bill.  What I object to is taking the bounty off the backs of the whole community and putting it on to the backs of the people who eat bread.  I did not deal with the question of the 24/6 except to point out that it was going to raise the price of some of the things we make without giving any consideration to the industry.  I think the Senator should have given some more consideration than he did to the bread eaters.  His sole concern is for the wheat growers, those who get the bounty.  Has the Senator considered what his proposal is going to mean to the bread eaters when the policy of the Government with regard to wheat growing is put into full effect? The Senator gave us an estimate of what his proposal is going to cost the community.  That, I take it, is based on the proportion of home-grown wheat that is now used in the bread we eat, but the Senator's calculations will, I think, be found to be entirely wrong when the Government's policy of using nothing but home-grown wheat comes into effect.  I think it is a dangerous thing to put up the price by 3/- in present circumstances, and I think the Senator should give a little more attention to the needs of the poor.</P>

      <P>I think the Senator should be more careful about some of his remarks.  He was telling the Government that this whole experiment of theirs is an extremely risky experiment.  From his experience of wheat growing in the country he has never known wheat, he said, to be grown economically except in the last three years, and then only at the price of 27/-.  I do not know whether this experiment which is being forced on the country is a wise one.  It is going to be a very serious one for the bread eaters.  I think myself that this is running a very grave risk of inflicting very serious injury on some of those people.  Taking the cost of this experiment on top of all the other taxes that <Col N="857" /> have to be borne, there is great danger that the fanners themselves may find themselves in a precarious position.  What are we going to do if we have not enough good millable wheat to make ends meet?  I believe that the farmers themselves are running a great risk in rushing into a large production of wheat.  It is going to lead to a further increase in the price of bread.</P>

      <P>The whole burden of Senator Jameson's speech was that this proposal is going to raise the price of bread.  It happens that we are in a period when the price of wheat is abnormally low.  Five or six years ago the price of wheat in the world market was a good deal higher than it is to-day, so that if Senator Counihan's proposal were brought forward then the price of bread would not arise at all.  Suppose that the trouble between Abyssinia and Italy, which is threatened, comes to a head there will be a rise in the price of wheat, so that if the world price of wheat goes up farmers here will probably be producing wheat under the terms of this measure at a figure that will be below that world price.  Some years ago the price of wheat was 38/-.  Then it fell to 32/- and to 30/-.  Since 1931 the world price, has been abnormally low. Therefore, why the price of the loaf should be fixed according to that low standard is more than I can understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that to increase the price of bread is a crime against the poor.  I do not see that at all.  Our argument is that if it is a good policy to produce wheat, it is an equally good policy to pay the man who produces it a living wage.  Everyone knows that the price of bread does not depend entirely on the price of wheat.  On the Finance Bill I dealt with milling costs and how high they are, due to the monopoly that exists in that industry.  I pointed to the fact that there was a difference of 10/- per sack in the price of flour here as compared to Northern Ireland.  We have to meet that additional cost, and I would <Col N="858" /> like to know why Senator Jameson does not protest against it?  Does not the policy of milling all the wheat in this country increase the price of bread?  In my opinion all these charges should be Central Fund charges.  My argument is that this, like the other charges involved in the production of bread, should be a Central Fund charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>If all the other charges, the cost of milling and the extra cost of bread, are on the Central Fund, then there is a very good case for putting this on the Central Fund.  Why should not the people who are growing the wheat get an economic wage as well as all other classes in the community? I know that the Minister will not agree to this proposal because he has said that when he was giving 23/6 a barrel he was able to get 200,000 acres of wheat grown.  He also said that if he did not get the wheat he would have to raise the price.  Next year, if the acreage is not increased by 100,000 acres he will raise the price. That is his policy.  There is reason in that because there is a market here at our own door for the wheat&mdash;for 3,000,000 sacks of flour a year.  Our policy is the raising in this country of everything we need.  It applies to our manufacturing industries, and why not let it apply to our food?  If it applies to our food, let us see that there is a reasonable return to the men who enter on it in the expectation of getting a living out of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Senator Wilson mentioned that point about an economic price.  I think it is very difficult to know what are the costings in <Col N="859" /> respect to the growing of wheat or of any other farm product.  It is very hard for any farmer to get costings for one crop alone.  We do not know, for instance, whether the land is more valuable after a crop than it was before.  Several other considerations come into it.  Quoting individual figures, as Senator Counihan did, is apt to mislead.  Senator Counihan said that he bought wheat on one occasion for 10/6 a barrel because the wheat was not fit to mill for human consumption. I could give an instance, from my own experience, but I do not think it would prove anything.  After I had disposed of the 1933 crop I found that I overlooked a very small quantity of wheat.  I sold it afterwards at 24/- a barrel to a maize miller who happened to require it for chicken meal, while I had only got 23/- for the mill wheat.  That does not prove anything any more than Senator Counihan's figure does.  Quoting individual figures does not lead us very far.  I do not know about these costings that were procured by the Cork County Committee of Agriculture, but they do appear to me to be very high.  Also, I think the price of straw is quite justified. Surely £1 5/- per statute acre is not putting it high.  You would have more than a ton of straw on a statute acre and even if it comes down to 17/6 per ton, you will at least get £1 5/-.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I do not agree with the Senator, on the other hand, that the farmer should depend on wheat for his total revenue, because I know quite well that the farmers' total revenue from wheat could not exceed £5,500,000 even if they grew sufficient to meet the total requirements of our population. We do not mean to export wheat.  It is only a small item compared to the total agricultural output, but still it is an important item and, from the point of view of price, it is dependable.  We know what the price is to be even before the crop is sown.  It has many advantages, but it is not going to form the farmers' total revenue, because, <Col N="860" /> even if we have no exports, we have a very big market here for certain commodities. For instance, we use two-thirds of the bacon we produce and 90 per cent. of the potatoes that we grow. Our home market is very considerable and there is no question whatever, therefore, of wheat supplying our total revenue.</P>
      <P>With regard to this amendment, in the first place it refers to this year's harvest and next year's crop.  Wheat is almost ready for harvesting this year.  I think if the farmers were prepared to sow wheat on a certain understanding with regard to price and if it is almost fit to reap now, it is hardly necessary to say that we should increase the price for next year's crop, at this stage, at any rate.  There is only another year, therefore, to go as far as Senator Counihan's amendment is concerned.</P>
      <P>Senator Wilson has interpreted my attitude correctly.  I think it is impossible to know what is paying the farmer for wheat.  We are getting a big increase at the present price.  I am inclined to think it will be necessary in three or four years' time to increase the price, because we probably will reach a bridge beyond which we cannot go at the present price.  We shall, of course, increase it at that stage.  Senator Wilson's statement that the world price of wheat is very low is, of course, true.  He said that if the world price went up to what it was in 1928, we will have our farmers growing wheat at less than world prices.  If that were the position I think we would have a different attitude towards an amendment like this.  At least we should see that our farmers would get the world price if the world price went higher than ours. That would be a different position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the price of bread, I am not sure if Senator Counihan is right that it means one-fifteenth of a penny on the 2 lb. loaf.  I think that a 3/- increase in the price of wheat&mdash; using 25 per cent. of our own wheat or even 100 per cent.&mdash;would not mean more than a farthing in the 2 lb. loaf. It is not a big thing, I admit, but it is the principle of whether we should fix <Col N="861" /> the price; it is not that we should give the farmer a farthing more in the loaf or a farthing less but what is the fair price.  I think the only guide to getting a fair price is whether we are getting the wheat grown or not.  I might mention that it would be extremely difficult to deal with this amendment if it were passed.  However, it is only a matter of administration and I suppose this matter can be got over in the Department if it is carried.  I think, taking the amendment on its merits, the Seanad should not agree to it because, as I say, there is no known way to find out whether the farmer is having a reasonable profit or not in present circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's sole contention is that there should be no greater price than 23/6 because of the fact that the farmers are producing double the quantity this year that they produced last year, and that he is going to get sufficient wheat.  I do not think that that is any justification for keeping the price of wheat below the economic level.  We must take the circumstances into account and consider the economic conditions at the present time and why farmers are going in for the growing of wheat.  I do not want to labour that now.  I referred to it on the Second Reading. I say it is because of the Government policy.  That policy has killed other forms of production and has forced the farmer to grow wheat extensively. Would Senator Johnson and the other Labour Senators agree if circumstances arose in the labour market that employers should take advantage of the fact that so many labourers were offering themselves at any price that the farmer or employer would be justified in cutting down the price of labour, when he was able to get sufficient labour at the price he was offering?  That is the line on which the Minister is arguing, that because he is getting sufficient wheat grown at 23/6 per barrel, he would not be justified in giving a higher price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Jameson says that he does not object to giving a higher price to the farmer.  What he objects to is that the individual bread eaters are being <Col N="862" /> made to pay.  Farmers and wheat growers will be satisfied if that provision is made.  We have no objection as to who will pay the price, but the Minister says that this must be the way and this is the only way in which we can get it.  I suggest to Senator Jameson that if he considers there is no other way that he should vote for the amendment if the Minister does not accept it.  I am sure the Labour Party will be losing one of their strong arguments if they agree with the Minister's contention, that because the farmers are growing wheat at the price he is offering, and which I contend is not an economic price and is keeping the farmers working on slave labour, there can be justification for keeping the price of wheat at 23/6.  If Senators believe that £1 12/6 per acre for straw is a reasonable return, I am misjudging their sense of justice and fair play. As regards Senator Wilson's statement about the price going above the price of foreign wheat, we can never hope to compete with foreign producers.  We could never hope to compete with Canada, Australia, or any of these countries in the production of wheat. If we are going to grow wheat in this country, in justice and fair play we should get an economic price for it. The farmer should be assured of a living wage.  Senator The McGillycuddy talked about subsidising individual farmers in certain localities and putting a tax on other parts of the country which are not in a position to grow wheat.  In many cases we are going in for this big quantity of wheat because of choice.  We are compelled to do it to exist.  It is not fair for representatives, say, from, Kerry, Cavan, or Dublin, because this policy does not suit their localities, to object.  Senators should be more broadminded.  They should remember that they are legislating here for the whole country and not for individual counties.  I have as much sympathy and regard for Kerry as Senator The McGillycuddy, but I must at the same time recognise that farmers who grow wheat on land that is able to produce 12 or 15 barrels to the acre have to be considered.  Senator <Col N="863" /> The McGillycuddy mentioned Senator Wilson and myself.  Senator Wilson is paying his labourers 33/-, 34/-, 35/- or 36/- a week.  The price of labour in Kerry, Cavan, and other places, to which Senator The McGillycuddy referred, would be only 14/- or 15/- a week, and if we are to grow wheat we have to consider the cost of labour, the cost of our rates and annuities, and we must remember that the whole cost of our upkeep is very much more than in the case where the land is not suitable for the growing of wheat.  I think that the Minister has established no case for the rejection of this, and I hope that the House will accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support this amendment.  I think that there is not much to be added to what the proposer of the amendment has already stated, but I should like to add that the farmers are paying all the tariffs.  Let us take the non-producing class as against the producing class.  I say that the farmers have a right to make this claim for an increased price of wheat. They are paying an increased price for practically everything they have to use on their farms.  They are contributing all this to the urban classes and I have not seen that the Minister has made any estimate of the income of the rural districts as against the income of the urban districts.  I think it can be shown that the income in the rural districts is very small and that they have to cut down.  If they go into such. things as wheat production, it is because they are sure of getting something for it.  There is one provision in this Bill which will show how things are going. There is a section here which shows that those who provide manures or seeds for farmers will have to provide these through the Government. That shows that there is no stability for the farmers, and it adds to the case that can be made for an increased price.  In considering the question of the wheat itself, I made the remark before that I believe that wheat cannot be grown at an economic price on small holdings in these modern times.  If the small farmers <Col N="864" /> grow a few acres of wheat, as they always did, they will have to use a great deal of modern machinery, and the result of that will mean that they will require more than 26/- a barrel to make it an economic proposition. Considering the standard that obtains in other classes of the community in the country&mdash;standards of inflation which still remain, standards of wages, and especially standards of taxation&mdash; I say that we have to adjust the claims of the rural districts to an increased price, not alone for wheat but for everything else.</P>
      <P>In saying that, I do not say that I support the policy of bounties and subsidies and so on; because I believe that that is only pursuing a vicious circle and because I believe that these bounties and subsidies have to be paid, in the end, by the producer. Even taking this extra charge for wheat: all that has to be paid out of the farmers' production.  We heard a good deal, about a month ago, about economic production on the part of the farmers.  I think that the Minister for Finance complimented them on their economic production. It must be remembered, however, that all these charges come out of the farmers' pocket in the long run.  We all know that, and accordingly, I think that the farmers are entitled to a little relief.  I think that these matters should be considered, especially such matters as standards of labour, standards of wages, and so on, as against our claim to an increased price.  I think that there is a very good case for this increased price.</P>

However, I shall not say anything more about that at the moment.  I shall have more to say about it on the final stages of the Bill.  As Senator Dillon has pointed out, however, since we are in this business and we cannot get rid of it for the moment, I will vote for Senator Counihan's amendment. <Col N="865" /> However, that action of mine is not to be taken as meaning that I approve of this wheat-growing policy. I do not approve of it.  I believe it <Col N="866" /> is the greatest piece of humbug that we have ever had in this country.</P>

      <P>I was unavoidably absent when the Second Reading of this Bill came before the House.  I would like to say a few words about it now.  I agree with Senator Jameson that it is a wrong departure to put the extra charge on the consumers of bread instead of having it paid out of the Central Fund.  However, the Central Fund, as we all know, is in a very bad way, and as the money is not there this expedient had to be resorted to, and also because it is the policy of the Government to hide their deeds and to keep the people from knowing how they are being taxed and fleeced. Abraham Lincoln said that the man who could not make a mistake could not make anything, but the man who made the same mistake twice was a fool.  I do not know what we are to call anyone who goes on perpetuating a mistake.  I believe the policy of growing wheat is a wrong one, for the reason that there is very little land in highly-valued counties suitable for growing that crop.  Good land will be turned into bad land by the growing of wheat.  That is an established fact and cannot be denied.  No crop will <Col N="867" /> take the heart out of land like wheat. I do not object to people growing wheat if they want to do so.  Wheat has been grown in this country for centuries, but in small quantities. People grow a little for their own use, as small crops can be easily saved. The crop was not always saved, but was lost owing to bad seasons and an unsuitable climate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I object to this policy being forced on the country, instead of keeping to a system that was established by our forefathers with all their experience. This country is essentially a live stock country.  Live stock are the sheet anchor of the agricultural industry. Without live stock there will never be prosperity.  I stated in this House several times that bread made from home-grown wheat is inferior to other bread because of the quality of the wheat.  By chance a good sample might be got after a very fine summer from good land and from good management. I do not deny that.  That would be the exception and not the rule.  I know people who have grown wheat all their lives, but some members of such families cannot eat bread made from home-grown wheat.  They have to get loaf bread from the shops. People who use flour made from home-grown wheat have been accustomed to mix it with light flour in order to make it digestible and palatable.  Let nobody get away with the idea that this wheat policy is going to create employment. It is not.  Wheat is taking the place of other corn crops, notably oats. I am acquainted with people who grow wheat, but they do so in order to snatch at the few pennies that they must get somehow.  That is the only reason they dropped the growing of other cereals, just as those who grow beet dropped the growing of mangels and turnips.  Large beet-growers in Wexford grow no mangels now, and are not growing other corn crops.  In any case corn crops do not give much employment.  A man and a pair of horses would only take a few weeks in the year to deal with the corn crops on a farm.  Senator Wilson mentioned a short time ago that wheat was selling <Col N="868" /> at 38/- a barrel.  Nobody wanted to grow wheat then.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that a large quantity of the spring wheat that was sown in County Wexford this year was a complete failure?  In the case of a neighbour of mine who has 24 acres it came up a few inches and then ran along the ground.  It may grow a little more but it will not ripen.  What is the Minister going to do to see that such people get compensation for the failure of their wheat?  What is going to happen generally if 100,000 acres of wheat or whatever quantity the Minister requires are grown to supply the whole country with home-grown wheat? However, I do not believe that time will ever come.  I believe the wheat-growing policy will be forgotten in a few years.  The present situation cannot go on.  It is a highly uneconomic crop and that is my objection to this policy of substituting wheat for other crops.  I voted for Senator Counihan's amendment because the farmers are in such a position now that I could not conscientiously vote to keep a penny out of their pockets, that they might get by any means.</P>

      <P>Yes, from a sensible man. It is not good business to interfere. The farmers have their remedy against the seed merchants and they are well able to look after themselves.  I am sure they will adopt the remedy of getting compensation for their losses. With regard to the substitution of wheat for other crops, the statistics are entirely against Senator Miss Browne, and I am prepared to adopt the statistics as being the surest guide. The statistics indicate that a reduction <Col N="869" /> is taking place in the growing of barley and oats, amounting in three years to 13,000 acres, while there has been an increase of 73,000 acres in wheat so that there has not been any reduction in the corn crops.  As to the statement that bread made from flour from homegrown wheat is inferior to other bread, I am surprised at Senator Miss Browne adopting the inferiority complex. It must be contact with the Party she is in that has given her those ideas.  Some years ago Senator Miss Browne did not have that inferiority complex.</P>

      <P>This amendment is put forward on behalf of the Ministry in order to revert to the provision in the Bill as originally drafted, that is to say, to put the widow in the position, provided she has not reached the age of 60, that the allowance when the youngest child reaches 14 is dropped, and the widow's pension also ceases. The Seanad agreed last week that that was an unreasonable proposition and that her pension should continue at least for two years.  The case I made then should be repeated.  I find by the Official Debates that I made reference, when giving an illustration, to the age of the widow as being 58 years.  That was a slip.  I might have gone down to 55 years or to 50 years.  The point is that a widow who is not 59½ years of age and has children who are receiving allowances, loses her own pension as well as the children's allowances when the youngest reaches 14 years. The House agreed that that was unreasonable. The widow has lost all contact with the industrial occupations in which she might have been before marriage.  She has reared three or four children, her husband has died, and she is left with, perhaps, two or three children under 14 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the most difficult time of their lives, when they cannot earn or be of much value to their mother, and when she really requires assistance they lose the allowance.  The widow's position ought to be such that she can reasonably maintain herself when the children are between the ages of 14 and 16.  I think it is unreasonable to ask the House to go back to the provision in the Bill originally.  I think that we should stand by the amendment which was carried here, because this period is the most crucial in the widow's life.  It must also be remembered that there is a certain means test which may affect the income of the family.  The widow's allowance should continue for two years after the allowance to the youngest child has ceased.  When she comes to 60 the widow's pension will be automatically reallocated, and she will again receive her pension but, <Col N="871" /> for a few years between reaching that age and the time the youngest child goes off the pensionable allowance, the widow is left at the mercy of the poor law, assuming that she has no other means.  The whole of this part of the Bill is based on the assumption that she has not means enough to keep herself and her family.  I ask the House to abide by the amendment carried on the last occasion and to refuse to accept the amendment moved by Senator Séamus Robinson.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we should be given some reason as to why the House should reverse a decision which it took on the Committee Stage but no reason has been given.  It is very unusual for the House to reverse a Committee decision on Report Stage unless that decision was arrived at as the result of an obvious misunderstanding. No special reason has been advanced in this case and I do not think that any misunderstanding could have arisen.  The proposal is positively cruel.  Take the case of a woman who has one child and is getting the pension until the child comes to the age of 14.  When the child reaches the age of 14½, if the mother is still under 60, her pension ceases.  The child is supposed to have secured lucrative employment by the age of 14½ years and to be in a position to help to keep himself and his mother. Alternatively, the mother is supposed to be able to go into the labour market and, at her age, secure employment, notwithstanding the times in which we live.  When we proceed to help the widow and orphan, we should not be so pernickety as was evidenced in this Bill as it reached us and as is shown by the request that we should now revert to the original position.  When a Bill like this, which has been overdue for so long, is introduced and when we try to flatter ourselves that we have been a little generous, we should not spoil that rather weak gesture of generosity by cheese-paring in the manner suggested here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister has been <Col N="872" /> supplied with any estimate of the amount of money likely to be involved in this case.  I imagine it must be comparatively small.  For the sake of a few thousand pounds per year I do not think we should take action which may impose incalculable hardship, suffering and humiliation on a respectable widow and her children, by having her go out to do char work or some menial service to which she was never accustomed, to cover the period from the time her child reaches the age of 14 until he gets employment. All the Committee did was to give her an interim period of two years.  Even then, the child would be only 16 years.  This amendment would fix the period so that the child would be only 14½ years.  I earnestly hope the Seanad will affirm the Committee decision and reject this amendment.</P>

      <P>I ask the Seanad to pass the amendment.  My main reason is that the other provision would add to the cost of the Bill at least £20,000 a year.  That is the minimum estimate I have got.  From the point of view of human sympathy, I fully appreciate the arguments of Senator Johnson and Senator O'Farrell.  I am sure that every other Senator who would address himself to this amendment would share the same sentiments. Many Senators would like to see not alone this amendment but other amendments passed.  I myself should like to see many improvements in the Bill.  As I said on a previous stage, this Bill has been long delayed. After many years of agitation it has been brought in, and it establishes the right of certain people&mdash;it is mainly an insurance scheme&mdash;to pensions.  Whatever we may think of the details of the Bill, that is a big step in advance.  To get it passed through the Oireachtas is a big thing.  Unquestionably, sections in this Bill will, some time or other, have to be revised and improved. Unquestionably, as time goes on, more money will have to be made available. I took a personal and deep interest in this matter, and I made a great fight to get the Bill through.  It is a very complicated measure, and the drafting <Col N="873" /> of it took longer than I had anticipated. I made a fight to get it through and to get the necessary money put aside for it.  Having got that and having got agreement, so far, I feel that it would jeopardise the coming into operation of the Bill at the earliest possible date if this amendment were not accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should not be carrying out fully my own bargain if I complied with Senator Johnson's request, and there would be danger that the Bill would not be put into operation on the 1st January next, as I hope it will.  If we pass the Bill with Senator Robinson's amendment, and if the Dáil agrees to the final passage of the measure without delay, I hope to have the Bill put into operation by the 1st January&mdash; six months earlier than it might be put into force if delays are caused here.  In that way, we shall be doing a great deal to help many necessitous widows and orphans.  I appreciate fully the strength of Senator Johnson's case but I am obliged, because of the necessities of the case&mdash;financially and from the point of view of time&mdash;to ask the Seanad to accept this amendment. <Col N="874" /> I think they will be doing the greater good for the greater number by getting the Bill into operation at the first possible moment.</P>

      <P>I cannot follow the Minister when he says that the Bill would be delayed if this amendment were not accepted.  Where there is a will, there is a way.  There is no necessity to delay the Bill.  I cannot understand the Minister's objection to the amendment inserted in Committee. He says it will cost £20,000.  There are millions squandered in other ways. Does he ask the Seanad to require orphans to go out at 14 years to work or to let their mothers do menial work to keep them until 16 years, when the ordinary boy is only expected to go out?  That is the point we have to consider, and it is not a question of whether this provision will cost £20,000 or £50,000.  I think the amendment passed in Committee should stand and I ask Senator Robinson to withdraw his amendment.  I think that would be the decentest way.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Senator Kennedy I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 38, sub-section (2).  To insert before the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) This section shall be construed and have effect subject to the modification that the contributions payable in respect of an employed contributor whose rate of remuneration does not exceed four shillings per day shall be paid wholly by the employer of such employed contributor and no payment in respect of any such contribution shall be made by such employed contributor.</P>
      <P>The amendment speaks for itself.  A man with a wage of less than 4/- a day is really not in a position to contribute towards this pension, and it ought to be free in his case.  A great many people throughout the country, particularly those engaged in the agricultural industry, are receiving such poor wages that they cannot afford to subscribe to this fund.  Therefore, I think the pension ought to be free in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I cannot accept this amendment.  A somewhat similar amendment was debated in the Dáil.  The suggestion there was that no contribution be asked for in the case of certain agricultural workers.  This, in principle, is the same amendment although wider in scope.  The principle underlying the <Col N="876" /> Bill is a contributory one, although that has not been carried out to the extent of 100 per cent.  At any rate it is the guiding principle in the Bill and one that I would be very slow to infringe upon for any class or for any purpose.  I think it is a wise principle, even in the case of those who are poorly paid, and we know there are many such people in the country. But even for them I think it is a good principle.  It is one that puts them on a proper footing.  It means that they are not getting charity.  They are in the insurance principle once they pay.  They are getting something that they have paid for and that they have a right to.  In that way it disassociates these widows' and orphans' pensions, in principle, from charity and from the outdoor relief that the poor have been accustomed to for so long.  In principle, then, I would not favour the acceptance of the amendment.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly, the wages in certain industries, chiefly in the agricultural industry, are very low, so that the agricultural labourer has to see that he gets full value for every penny he spends.  If we want to combat low wages in agriculture or in any other industry we ought to do it in a direct way and not in the oblique way suggested here.  For these reasons I cannot accept your amendment.</P>

      <P>First Schedule, rule (1), sub-rule (2). Before the sub-rule to insert a new sub-rule as follows :&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) In the calculation of the annual means of a person for the purposes of paragraph (a) or paragraph (d) of the immediately preceding sub-rule the yearly value of any dwelling house in which the applicant for a pension resides shall be calculated as follows, that is to say&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="878" /> (i)  The first twenty-five pounds of the capital value of the said property shall be excluded; and</P>
    <P>(ii)  The yearly value of the next three hundred and seventy-five pounds of the capital value of the said property shall be taken to be the one-twentieth part of the capital value; and</P>
    <P>(iii)  The yearly value of so much of the capital value of the said property as exceeds the sum of four hundred pounds shall be taken to be one-tenth part of the capital value.</P>
    <P>On the Committee Stage there was an amendment discussed seeking to have the means of a widow who was applying for a pension under the noncontributory scheme assessed in such a manner that if she were the owner of the house in which she lived&mdash;the house being of a certain value&mdash;the value should not be taken into account in assessing her means.  The new drafting that I have put forward to achieve the same result is based upon the existing law in regard to old age pensions.  The method of assessing means for persons under the Old Age Pensions Act, which was introduced in 1932 by the Minister, has been taken as the method of assessing in respect of this particular class of persons.  The point is that there is a considerable number of houses in the country occupied by persons who have bought them on the instalment system. They are the legal owners of these houses, and there is the danger, a much more serious danger than, I think, the Minister will allow, that in assessing the value of that property the assessors will follow the course indicated by the Minister for Finance, and say that the assumed income from that property is the difference between what is paid out and what could be gained by the letting of that property.  Conceivably, a widow in such a house, after meeting all outgoings, might get £20 of a profit rent if she were to let that house at the highest rent obtainable. But this widow lives in the house. She has lived there and brought up her children in it.  She has a property in the house, but not something <Col N="879" /> from which she obtains income.  It is merely the home that she occupies.  I want to see that such an assumed income is exempted from any calculation of means, and to achieve that I have followed the guidance of the Minister himself when he adopted this method in the Old Age Pensions Act of 1932.</P>
    <P>A widow has a house value for, say, £400.  The first £25 of the capital value will not be taken into account; for the next £375 the annual value will be taken to be 1/20th.  If the value of the property exceeds £400, then 1/10th of the excess will be taken into account.  Whatever merit that formula has in regard to old age pensions, it has the same merit in this case.  While it may not affect very large numbers&mdash;and it may not affect any&mdash;there is no security that the Finance Department's method of assessment is not to be followed, and, having regard to the warning we have had from the Minister of Finance, it seems to me that some such provision as this is very desirable.  I think the most effective way of achieving the thing I spoke of is the Minister's own formula taken from the Old Age Pensions Act.</P>

      <P>We debated the question of principle at considerable length on the Committee Stage.  I was not able to see eye to eye with Senator Johnson then, nor am I able to see eye to eye with him in regard to this amendment.  First, with regard to this amendment, where he refers to rule 1 (a), (a) there deals with people who do not reside in the house, and I take it Senator Johnson has in mind, giving advantage to a widow who owns or partly owns a house and resides in that house.  I take it if a widow owned a house and if she did not reside in that house, that her property should be treated in the ordinary way as property and taken into account.  I imagine the Senator would agree to that.  But where the widow is owner or part owner, having several instalments paid on her house, Senator Johnson would like to have her dealt with in a more <Col N="880" /> lenient fashion.  That we are prepared to do.  We propose to put that in regulations.  Whatever advantage is given under the old age pensions method will be given to her.  I have discussed the proposed regulations with the chief official concerned, and I think we will be able to draft it in a form that will be even more advantageous than that suggested in the amendment.</P>

I do not want to seem to do anything in the nature of censuring the Chair or anything like that, but I think there is a matter of considerable principle involved, and if it were not taken in the nature of a censure but as a means of getting the matter thoroughly thrashed out, I should like it to be done.  I think it is a matter of considerable importance, because on the particular amendments that we moved the other day the Vice-Chairman would have ruled one way and the Chair another.

I would suggest, without any reference to the present proposed new Standing Order, that the question as to whether a new Standing Order of any kind was desirable to deal with the kind of position that Senator Blythe desires to attain should be included.  I was going to urge, if this matter had come into discussion, that the whole matter be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I think for the kind of amendment that Senator Blythe wanted to put forward that there should not be an absolute bar because as the thing stands neither the House nor the Chair would be allowed to discuss the kind of proposition that Senator Blythe wanted to bring forward. Surely we should not bar ourselves from taking action when we may desire to take it.</P>

      <P>I quite see your point, but you must remember that Senator Blythe's motion suggests that in any Bill it should be mandatory on the Chair to accept a particular type of amendment.  Standing Orders are for the regulation of the procedure of the House and if that is done the procedure of the House will be so determined that the regulation of business will be rendered extremely difficult.</P>

      <P>I would have been quite prepared to accept Senator Johnson's amendment that this matter should be referred to the Committee which deals with Standing Orders for the <Col N="883" /> purpose of having the thing thrashed out, because I recognise that it is difficult for an individual to draw up a Standing Order which does not go beyond what may be desirable.  I am quite prepared, if the Seanad thinks it desirable, to raise the matter in that way by way of reference to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. However, I would think it is within the competence of the House to make such Standing Orders as it thinks fit.  I would suggest it is going extremely far for the Chairman to hold that something is outside the range of Standing Orders and that a Standing Order cannot be made to that effect. That is what your ruling amounts to.</P>

      <P>The Standing Orders of every House are intended to regulate the procedure of the House, and the Senator claims to be entitled to propose to insert a Standing Order which would make it mandatory on the Chair to accept a particular type of amendment as regards every Bill. I suggest that it would be very difficult to pursue but the Senator is perfectly entitled to move to refer it to the Committee of Procedure and Privileges under Rule 39.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Chair would find some better arrangement. If there is some better way, I think we would be ready to agree to it.</P>

      <P>As a means of getting out of something like an <i>impasse</i> it is within the competence of the Chair in certain cases to accept amendments without notice.  I wonder would the Chair accept an amendment to my proposal that the whole matter be <Col N="884" /> referred to the Committee of Procedure and Privileges.</P>

      <P>You have already ruled this out of order.  I fail to see how a motion that has been ruled out of order can be referred for consideration to the Committee of Procedure and Privileges. I would suggest to Senator Blythe that he bring in a motion on another date asking the Committee of Procedure and Privileges to consider the possibility of introducing a Standing Order somewhat along the lines he has suggested.  I suggest that we ought to do our business according to the rules of order for the time being and that Senator Blythe would bring forward the motion along the lines suggested.</P>
