      <P>In reference to the amendment on the Order Paper in the name of Senator Johnson, I have to rule it out of order under Standing Order 77, because the amendment does not substitute words which state some reason against the Bill being read a Second Times, nor has it the effect of postponing the Bill to some certain date.  Standing Order 77 is as follows:</P>
      <P>The following amendment only may be proposed to the question:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) To delete the word &ldquo;now&rdquo; and to add at the end of the question the words &ldquo; this day three months&rdquo; or some other date.</P>
      <P>That is, a certain date.  The amendment under discussion is in these words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete the word &ldquo;now&rdquo; and to add at the end of the motion the words &ldquo; on a day not earlier than four weeks after the report of the Banking Commission has been presented to the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, I rule that that amendment is out of order because it does not comply with Standing Order 77.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I, of course, accept your ruling, but I want to point out that there was no motion on the Order Paper up to the time that I sent in the amendment: that is to say, the motion was merely to take the Second Stage. That is a small point.  Might I ask whether it would be in order for me to substitute the words &ldquo;that the Bill be read this day six months&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Leas-Chathaoirleach Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that a strict compliance with the Standing Order is necessary in a case of this kind.  Seeing that Senator Johnson is conversant with these Standing Orders and is one of the most experienced Senators in this House, I do not think that at this stage I would be inclined <Col N="1359" /> to accept an amended amendment of that kind, but it is perfectly open to the Senator to discuss the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason why I wanted a specific proposition and not merely a negative was that I desired to emphasise the importance of deferring the consideration of this Bill while the Banking Commission is sitting. It seems to me to be unfortunate that a Bill dealing with the Bank of Ireland should be introduced into the Oireachtas at a time when a Banking Commission is discussing and examining and will some day report upon the future of banking and of banking organisations in this country. Now it is quite possible&mdash;I have not examined the dates&mdash;that, in accord with the Standing Orders relating to private Bills, notice of this Bill was given before the Banking Commission was set up.  If that were so, it is a satisfactory excuse, but the Banking Commission having been set up it seems to me to be quite reasonable and proper that any change of the law relating to banks in this country or to a bank in this country should await the report of that Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, most of the members of the Seanad will be aware that it is only five years since the Bank of Ireland Act was passed, an Act promoted by the Bank of Ireland to considerably enlarge its powers and to remedy certain defects which it believed at that time impeded its activities. During the evidence given before the Joint Committee that considered that private Bill, Senator O'Hanlon gave expression to the view that it would, as a matter of course, be many years before the Bank of Ireland would come to the Oireachtas again with a Bill, and the promoters of the Bill did not dissent from that view.  But now we have in 1935 another Bill dealing with the Bank of Ireland, and with provisions governing the Bank of Ireland that might well have been inserted in the 1929 Act, because the matter was referred to by the promoters of the Bill before that Joint Committee, and notwithstanding the fact that they were quite well aware the grievances <Col N="1360" /> they now protest to be suffering from existed at the time that the old Bill was being promoted.</P>
    <P>This Bill has one definite object.  It is to limit the liability of the stockholders of the Bank to the amount of their stockholding.  This is found in Section 2 of the Bill, which provides:</P>
    <P>No past or present member of the Bank shall, in the event of a winding up, be liable to contribute towards the debts or liabilities of the Bank to an amount exceeding the amount, if any, unpaid on the stock of the Bank held by him at the date of the commencement of the winding up or within the period of twelve months prior to that date subject as in the next following section.</P>
    <P>Then it goes on to point out that bank notes are, of course, exempt and that the liabilities referred to are debts due by the Bank and the deposits of depositors. I should say that one of the objects of the 1929 Bill was to increase the capital stock by resolution: that is to say, that it would not be necessary to come to Parliament.  That Act also removed certain restrictions upon borrowing. The arguments of the promoters of the old Bill in that respect, as stated by Mr. Dickie, K.C., were as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every stockholder in the Bank of Ireland is liable for the last farthing he has if the Bank goes smash&mdash;for every single debt due by the Bank.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to the Bank of Ireland is this: that if I hold £1,000 of the Stock and you hold £12,000 of the Stock you would bear 12 times as much of the loss as I would.  So that the man who has most money in the Stock would have to bear his proportion of the loss in proportion to the amount of the Stock he had.  Consequently the Governors who are managing this business are concerned to see that the business will be done properly because they themselves are more liable than anyone else.  I would not call these things privileges of the Bank but they are matters that arise <Col N="1361" /> with regard to it and would be very useful, of course, for the creditors if the Bank were not able to pay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then we come to the important point:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The new stock that will be issued after this Bill is passed will be under exactly the same liability in every respect as the old stock.  No difference will be made in regard to it.  That is the way the matter stands with regard to the stock.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In arguing for the Bill of 1929, the promoters laid stress on the fact that the liability of stockholders was unlimited and that, therefore, the depositors and creditors were specially insured against the possibility of loss. The argument that was held to be valid in 1929 and that was eloquently advanced in favour of the Bill then is thrown aside in 1935.  The argument as to the importance of having, as governors and directors, stockholders who would manage the Bank efficiently and carefully because of their unlimited liability will, if this Bill is passed, go to the wall.  It will be no longer necessary to have careful management for that reason, as the liability of the directors will, under this Bill, be limited.  If there was any validity in that argument in 1929, it is a very strong argument against the present Bill.</P>
    <P>The general purport of the former Bill was, and of this Bill is, to bring the Bank of Ireland into equality regarding privileges and obligations with joint-stock limited liability companies carrying on banking business.  That is more or less implied in an argument which has never yet been stated and which I had hoped to have heard in favour of this Bill.  There was nothing, so far as I can find out, to prevent the Bank of Ireland, at any time since the Companies Acts were passed, accepting the obligations that the other banks with limited liability undertook.  Certain privileges appertained to the Bank of Ireland.  I suggest that these privileges resided in the Bank because of the ultimate security every creditor had in the fact that the people who were the owners of the stock were liable to the last farthing of their own property if the Bank went wrong.  Because of the <Col N="1362" /> strength of that position, the Bank has retained, to some extent, those privileges up to date, though it does not enjoy them to the same extent as it formerly did.  On the ground that there is a Banking Commission sitting, there is good reason for postponing consideration of this Bill.  If the arguments in favour of the 1929 Bill were valid, they would lose their validity if this Bill were passed.</P>
    <P>Two other points are of importance, inasmuch as there is no provision in the Bill to cover them.  We are on the point of passing a Bill dealing with nationality and citizenship.  It seems to me inevitable that the laws governing the Bank of Ireland will, at some near date, require to be amended in consequence of the passing of that Bill, as other enactments will have to be amended to bring them into conformity with that measure.  At present, the Charter governing the Bank of Ireland provides:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the King giving the charter in 1783&mdash;&ldquo;do ordain and appoint that no person shall at any time be capable of being chosen a governor of the said corporation unless he shall at the time of such election be our natural born subject or naturalised.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is obvious that, with the passing of the Bill dealing with nationality, that provision would have to be modified. That is a further argument in favour of the postponement of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Again, there is the question of the declaration of allegiance which, I think, still holds good.  Every governor and every director of the Bank of Ireland must, on election, make three declarations, one of which is&mdash;it was at one time an oath but it has been modified &mdash;a declaration of allegiance to the Crown.  In view of our recent history, that ought not to be a condition in the case of any person who is a citizen and is otherwise qualified to become a governor or director of this Bank.  That is a point which will have to be dealt with in any legislation affecting the Bank of Ireland.</P>
    <P>In view of these circumstances, it seems to me reasonable and proper that the discussion of this Bill should be <Col N="1363" /> postponed.  Let it be brought up again when the Banking Commission shall have reported and when we know what the intentions of the Government are regarding the future of banking in this country.  The consequences of the Bill dealing with nationality will then have been made clear and this measure, as well as other statutes, can be amended in accordance with the requirements of the nationality legislation. I oppose the Second Reading of this Bill with a view to its re-introduction in another form, if necessary, when any argument in favour of the removal of the unlimited liability of stockholders can be adduced.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Senator's speech is a speech on the motion before the House and is not merely an argument for a postponement of this stage of the Bill. The Senator's speech is a speech against the Bill?</P>

      <P>Yes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no intention of speaking on this stage of the Bill.  I understood that the arguments in favour of the Bill were to be put forward by somebody else.  Since Senator Johnson has made a strong speech against the Bill, it is well that somebody who knows the reasons for the Bill should state these reasons and the object of the Bill to the House.  Things have occurred since 1929 which the Senator did not mention.  In the year 1929 the Bank of Ireland was an unlimited liability company and was not subject to corporation profits tax. The Government has recently passed an Act which has done away with that exemption.  So long as we were an unlimited liability company we were not subject, under the law, to corporation profits tax.  The Government have, however, caused a measure to be enacted which makes us liable for corporation profits tax, though we have unlimited liability.  Not only did we suffer the penalties of that Act but we were given an extra year of it, and the corporation profits tax, instead of being 5 per cent., was increased, so far as we were concerned, <Col N="1364" /> by 50 per cent. to 7½ per cent.  That tax was extremely heavy on the Bank of Ireland and the situation as regards unlimited liability was entirely altered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of limited liability, so far as an institution like the Bank of Ireland is concerned, is really not of great importance.  If the Bank were an institution that, in the opinion of the country, was in the least likely to be wound up at any time and the stockholders called upon to pay, it could not exist as it is at present. The whole country knows that the management of the Bank of Ireland keeps its funds in such a condition&mdash; while revealing particulars of where its funds are placed&mdash;that stockholders of the Bank will never be called upon for such a contribution. Everybody who knows how the Bank of Ireland is managed, the publicity that attaches to the placing of its funds and to the auditors' comments, knows that this question of limited liability is a theoretical one.  When we compare the position of stockholders of the Bank of Ireland with that of shareholders in the joint-stock banks, we find that the stockholders have paid up the entire amount of their holding.  There can be no further calls in respect of their stock. Therefore, only in respect of deposits and notes can they be subject to any further liability in the event of winding up.  The other joint-stock banks have a still existing liability in respect of their shares.  If the other joint-stock banks were to be placed in the same position as the Bank of Ireland in respect of their shares, it would mean a very heavy demand upon their shareholders.  Therefore, it seems to be reasonable for the Bank of Ireland stockholders to say that they should be placed in the same position as regards limited liability as the shareholders of the other banks. Why the Bank of Ireland brings forward a proposal which Senator Johnson says it did not put forward in 1929 is that the reasons for remaining in the position of an unlimited liability company have been removed. Heavy taxation has been placed upon the Bank and it is right that the stockholders should get the benefits of <Col N="1365" /> the situation as well as its disadvantages.</P>
    <P>Another reason is that the stock of the Bank of Ireland is a trustee security.  We have not many securities of that class in the Free State. It is extremely difficult for trustees in the Free State to get trustee securities and yet there is no question whatever that it is a handicap on the stock of the Bank of Ireland when a trustee looks at it and sees the name &ldquo;Unlimited Liability Company.&rdquo; Therefore, it is advisable, both in the interests of the State and of everybody else that stock like the Bank of Ireland stock should be made available for all trustees.  There are very large amounts of the Bank of Ireland stock at the present moment that will undoubtedly benefit and if the Oireachtas passes this Bill it will make it a stock which will be much freer and easier to deal in. These are some of the arguments in favour of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill, I believe, has been carefully examined&mdash;and there are those in this House who can say whether it is not so&mdash;by the legal advisers of the Government, and they are advised that there is no hidden motive in this Bill, that it is exactly what you see on the paper, and that there is nothing else in it.  I dare say that we will hear from somebody connected with the Government whether or not they see any reason why this Bill should not be passed.  Now, with regard to the question of the liability of the Bank as regards notes and deposits, all banks, of course&mdash;the Bank of Ireland and other joint-stock banks&mdash;have an absolutely unlimited liability on their stockholders to pay up for all the notes.  There is no question whatever about that.  An alteration in the wording of the Bill itself has been suggested by the Government in order to make that absolutely clear, and of course the motive behind the Bill is to make it clear.  I may say, however, that the wording which was in the Bill, in which the Government suggests a slight alteration, was taken word for word from the Act of 1908, which was the Act that imposed on <Col N="1366" /> the joint-stock banks the liability for their notes.  Therefore, as the Bank believed that the same liability was being kept on the stockholders of the Bank of Ireland as on the other, the same words were adopted.  Personally, however, I am inclined to think that the amendment suggested here would be better.  Perhaps I might be in order if I read it.  If Senators will look at Section 3 they will see that the wording in the Bill is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the event of the Bank being wound up every present and past member shall, subject to the provisions of this section, be liable to contribute towards payment of the bank notes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The amendment proposed is to insert, in page 3, line 1, after the word &ldquo;contribute,&rdquo; the words:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;without limit rateably in proportion to their respective interests in the stock of the Bank.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As a layman, I say that those words are better.  They make it clearer than the words in the Act of 1908, and I think the House would be very wise in adopting that suggested amendment.</P>
    <P>As regards the Bank of Ireland, compared with the other joint-stock banks, when this Bill becomes law the Bank of Ireland will be practically in the same position as the other banks.  There will be three respects in which they will differ.  It will not be regulated under the Companies Act, its stock will continue to be a trustee security, and it will have no new liabilities on its capital.  I notice that Senator Johnson said that under the present constitution of the banks, laid down by the Oireachtas, any new shares that may be issued by the bank will be issued free of all liability in exactly the same way that our present stock stands. I do not know where Senator Johnson got his information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I simply read from Mr. Dickie's statement before the last Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine that the situation is that the Bank of Ireland got leave to issue fresh stock.  I do not <Col N="1367" /> think anything was said as to the conditions to be applied to that stock. If the Bank of Ireland create fresh stock they will offer it on the conditions to be prescribed when the stock is created.  There is nothing binding on them to say they can issue stock with no liability whatever.  They will be able to issue stock and put on any conditions they like&mdash;say, £5 stock with £1 paid up, or anything they choose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I quoted Mr. Dickie in these words: &ldquo;The new stock that will be issued if this Bill is passed will be under exactly the same liability in every respect as the old stock.  No difference will be made in regard to it.&rdquo; That is what I said in quoting Mr. Dickie.</P>

      <P>I was quoting Mr. Dickie's plea, and the old Bill was passed upon such statements as that. He was explaining the case of the Bank to the Committee of the Oireachtas, and those were his words.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">

    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, then, perhaps I may go on.  The Senator's argument was that the Bank of Ireland could not issue a stock which would have any liability on it and that all the stock <Col N="1368" /> they would issue in the future, if we pass this Bill, would be a limited stock. That is what I take the gist of the Senator's argument to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I may be permitted to intervene again.  My argument is that whatever was stated by Mr. Dickie was stated for the purpose of persuading the Committee of the Oireachtas to pass the 1929 Act.  If these statements were not correct, then the Act was passed without full frankness. If Senator Jameson, with his knowledge, is saying that Mr. Dickie was wrong, well, then, the Committee of the 1929 Oireachtas was misdirected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a piece of special pleading that I do not propose to deal with further.  I have definitely asked the question whether or not the Senator believes that the Bank of Ireland, under this present Bill, cannot issue stock with liability on it.  I understood that the weight of the Senator's argument was that, because of something said there, the Bank of Ireland could not issue stock that was different in any way from the present stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I said nothing on my own authority at all.  I only quoted from Mr. Dickie.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>But that is the argument the Senator drew from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Leas-Chathaoirleach Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that Senator Johnson has already spoken once, and I would call his attention to the fact that the law does not depend upon what Mr. Dickie said but upon the Act of Parliament, which is open to inspection.  Senator Jameson will proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought, Sir, that I ought to deal at length with that point, because it is of importance to know that one of the powers the Bank got in recent legislation was the issuing of stock, and I did not want the impression to go out that the Bank of Ireland could not issue stock which was similar to the stock issued by the other joint-stock banks.  As regards the Bank complying with the Companies Acts in all matters necessary to safeguard the interests of its shareholders and creditors, <Col N="1369" /> the only difference that will continue to exist is that the Bank is not required to add the word &ldquo;limited&rdquo; to its title.  I believe that that is so. I do not think that the Bank of England adds the word &ldquo;limited&rdquo; to its title, and I believe that that is the only difference that there will be in regard to that part of the matter.  As regards the differences in the safeguarding of the interests of the shareholders and the creditors, I do not think Senator Johnson seems to value very much the interests of the shareholders of the Bank.  Their liabilities are what he is mainly concerned with.  There are several things that the Bank Board have to consider.  I admit that in this instance, because of penalties which have been put upon their shareholders, they are trying to get their shareholders into a better position and into a position which will in no way influence or damage in any way the rights and prospects of the depositors and trustees.  They are interested in their shareholders, as very heavy penalties have been put upon the shareholders by the Government, and they believe that the passing of this Act will make the shares more negotiable amongst the trustees.  That is, practically, the gist of the whole matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot follow Senator Johnson into Aliens Acts, and into whether or not the statements which we make when we take office annually, that we are going to be loyal to each other, and all the rest of it, mean that we should hold up the Bill until all these things are considered.  I would ask the Seanad to consider that if it is found necessary, when we come to deal with aliens and the holdings of different people, we can modify the Bank regulations just to suit any new Acts that come up.  I have already referred to the benefit to the Bank&mdash;and I shall not refer to it again&mdash;of having the word &ldquo;limited&rdquo; applied to them as it is to all the other joint-stock banks. It is a queer thing but we know that, notwithstanding the fact that we often think that Irish banks and Irish securities are depreciated, it is a very strange thing and shows the confidence of the people in this old Bank that it <Col N="1370" /> is the only bank in the whole list of trustee securities which had unlimited liability on its shareholders and yet it has been left all this time on the trustee list.  It would be a very serious disaster, however, if for any reason like that someone should get up and say that it should be taken off the trustee list.  It has been a great proof of the trust of everybody in the Bank that in spite of that we have always been left on the trustee list.  What we are now asking the Seanad to do is to remove the anomaly and let the Bank of Ireland stock in future be of the same nature and class as every other trustee stock on the list.</P>
    <P>I think it would be interesting for the Seanad to note our position as compared with the other joint-stock banks.  Anyone connected with banking work in regard to deposits, payments, etc., will know that the bank works on averages&mdash;that is to say, that you work on the average liabilities that you have to meet at any one time.  All banks keep a certain average and must keep a certain average&mdash;an average of their ready resources to meet any such demands.  If you take the paid-up capital of the Bank of Ireland, it represents 7 per cent. of its deposit liabilities while the paid-up capital of all the other banks is 3¾ per cent. Senators will have to turn their minds to the manner in which the banks are worked.  They are worked with the object of always keeping available sufficient money to meet any possible demands and that is one of the objects we have to keep in mind.  Our paid-up capital is all invested in a security of the Bank of England, and we have to keep in the Bank of Ireland, like our Currency Commission, an enormous amount of money to meet immediate demands.  Therefore, our bank money is invested in such a way that it is always available and can always be got at.</P>
    <P>Looking through the old Acts, I found a strange thing, namely, that as long as our money is left there, all our creditors have a right of action against the British Treasury to recover the money we have in the <Col N="1371" /> British Treasury.  It is a very queer old Act, but it exists at present.  The creditors of the Bank of Ireland, if we do not pay them, can go to the British Treasury at the present moment and get their claims paid by the British Treasury.  That is an ancient Act, which I think even Senator Johnson does not know of, but it is there.  On the whole, I do not know that I can say much more about the Bill than is contained in the Bill itself.  You know the wording of it.  Section 2 is the one which limits the liability and puts us in exactly the same position as the shareholders of other joint-stock banks.  Section 3 is merely a section which maintains the full liability of the shareholders to pay on the notes.</P>
    <P>Since the Currency Commission was set up there have been a good many changes.  One of these changes is that all the consolidated bank notes which we get from the Currency Commission at present are covered by liquid securities in the hands of the Currency Commission.  Therefore, our liability, as regards all our consolidated bank notes, is practically nil.  For the legal tender notes which we get we have to supply pound for pound British legal tender, so that every note we have got at the present moment is covered completely without any liability whatever on the shareholders of the Bank.  I have told you how, in the drawing of the Bill, words were taken out of the Act of 1908 which created the conditions of the present limited joint-stock banks and with a slight alteration, which is suggested by the law officer, the conditions will be just the same as they were.  I cannot think of anything more which the Seanad might wish to know about the Bill.  It affords, I might say, some slight recompense to our shareholders for the amount of money which it seemed good to the Government we should pay under the corporation profits tax.  I have tried briefly to explain to the Seanad what the Bill is about and I hope that Second Reading will be agreed to.</P>

      <P>I do not want to say very much on this Bill but I think it is due to the <Col N="1372" /> House that I should explain that the Government are not objecting in any way to this Bill going forward to Committee. Senator Jameson has explained practically every point that I could put forward.  I can understand Senator Johnson's anxiety in many ways about a measure of this kind and I think it is reasonable that all such views should be aired and explained. I would, however, point out that the Bill will go to a Committee of the House&mdash;I take it that will be the procedure&mdash;and that any points that arise will be dealt with there.  There are very definite reasons why we might consider it wise not to object to this Bill.  Senator Jameson has already pointed these out.  The first is that the Bank of Ireland position has very considerably changed owing to the withdrawal of certain privileges&mdash; I refer to put it that way rather than to say that penalties have been imposed on the Bank.  I do not consider these were penalties, because what happened was that there was a withdrawal of special privileges which the Bank enjoyed in contrast to other banks in the country.  I think that any officer or director of the Bank of Ireland will agree that that is so.  There was a withdrawal of the privilege of exemption from the corporation profits tax which the Bank had enjoyed previously and that meant a considerable amount to the Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there was the question of the position which they occupied under the consolidated note issue.  I have a few particulars here with regard to that. The withdrawal of exemption from corporation profits tax has resulted in an increase of about £60,000 per annum in the Bank's tax assessment from 1931 onwards.  The Bank of Ireland has suffered other disabilities since the establishment of the Free State, the most important of which was that arising from the operation of the Currency Act of 1927.  Prior to that Act, the Bank had an unsecured note issue amounting to an all-Ireland figure of £3,738,000, on which duty was paid at the rate of 7/- per cent. per annum. Following the passage of that Act, the Bank's share of the secured consolidated <Col N="1373" /> note issue was £1,760,000, on which duty was payable at the rate of 30/- per cent. per annum, increased in 1932 to 60/- per cent. per annum.  The duty on its share of the consolidated note issue now amounts to £52,800 per annum compared with £6,160 on an issue of similar amount prior to the passage of the Currency Act.  In many respects the Bank of Ireland has been put on a more equitable basis as compared with the other banks than formerly existed.  That is the main consideration we have in mind when we are raising no objection, on this or any other stage, to their getting this limitation of their liability.</P>
    <P>The question of the trustee stock is also an important one from the State point of view, but I would suggest that these matters can be dealt with in Committee and that Senator Johnson should withdraw his objection to the Bill and let it go to Committee, where these matters, which are, after all, Committee matters, can be threshed out.  The other points which he raises will, no doubt, have to be dealt with legislatively either by a Private Bill of the Bank of Ireland or by a Government measure.  I presume it will be by a Private Bill.  That is the question of the oath of allegiance or the other implications in the original Charter of the Bank, and also the question of control.  The Citizenship Bill and the Aliens Bill may have certain reactions with regard to the Bank's position. These are matters that can be dealt with legislatively either by a Private Bill of the Bank or otherwise.  I quite sympathise with Senator Johnson's anxiety, and naturally, when there is a Banking Commission sitting, one would say that this is a matter that might well have been deferred until the Banking Commission had reported. However, the attitude of the Government to this measure is as I have stated, and I hope Senator Johnson will allow the Bill to go to Committee.</P>

      <P>I hope the Seanad will not follow the lead set up by Senator Jameson and Senator Johnson and go in detail into the merits or otherwise of the Bill at this stage.  The practice in this House has been to welcome rather than to discourage the <Col N="1374" /> introduction of Bills of a private character, and I do submit that that is a practice which might usefully be followed on the present occasion.  If there was any added reason why the matter should be referred to a Joint Committee without further discussion, the very matters raised by the Senators themselves should supply that added reason.  They were matters which might be usefully investigated by a Joint Committee.  I accordingly submit that the House would not be justified, without very ample reasons indeed, in withholding a second reading from this Bill, and that reading, I hope, will be given without further discussion.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether it is necessary to enter into any detailed explanation of this Bill or to give any special reasons for its introduction.  As I pointed out, when addressing the Seanad on the Nationality Bill, this Bill and the other Bill which is down for Second Reading, Constitution (Amendment No. 26) Bill, 1934, are intended to form a complete code.  It is obvious that having changed the basis of citizenship, or rather having changed the basis upon which Aliens Orders have been based&mdash;British Acts &mdash;we need in defining an alien as a non-citizen to have a Bill like this to work out the scheme in its entirety and to prevent various anomalies that would otherwise arise.  The long title indicates generally its scope.  It is to provide for the control of aliens and for other matters relating to aliens. The main point of the Bill is the definition that an alien is a non-citizen. Then we have the rights that are confered upon aliens, the principal ones being generally in regard to the ownership of property.  There are <Col N="1377" /> certain qualifications.  There are exceptions mentioned in Section 3 which might be adverted to more closely in Committee.  Any Senator who has read the Bill will easily recognise their import and significance.  Section 5 gives to the Minister for Justice power to provide by order for the control of aliens, the control to be exercised with regard to the admission of aliens, or the exclusion of aliens, and the limitation of places where they might reside. The second part of the section gives the Minister power to provide for the effective enforcement of the Order, and gives to the officers the Minister may call in, the officers of Customs and Excise and the military, power to act. There are certain classes of persons excluded from the application of these orders.  These are diplomats, the personnel of diplomatic missions and relatives, and the spouse and children in the case of a consul-general and his immediate family.  There is power also to the Minister to revoke any orders that have been made.  All such orders are to be laid before both Houses.  In Section 6, we have penalties for contravention of the Orders.  Contravention is an offence and the penalties attaching may be six months' imprisonment or a fine of £100, while the persons in question may have to enter into recognisance before the court. Section 7 gives power to procure search warrants.  An officer, not below the rank of chief superintendent of the Gárda, can apply to a magistrate for a search warrant, and any person not below the rank of inspector of the Gárda can enter premises and search. There are also powers of arrest and detention when a search is being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 8 deals with restrictions in the changing of names.  A person may not change a name from the name he had before a certain appointed time. An &ldquo;appointed day&rdquo; will be made by order and fixed not later than three months after the date of the making of the order.  Names cannot then be changed from the names persons had either at their majority or on the 6th December, 1922.  Similar provisions affect the changing of business names. Licences may be granted at the discretion <Col N="1378" /> of the Minister for such changes when he is satisfied that there are good and satisfactory reasons for granting them.  The list of licences so granted will be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> with such particulars as will-make it possible to identify the persons in question.  Section 10 is analogous to Section 23 of the Nationality Bill, and enables the Executive Council, by order, to exempt citizens of other countries, when they are satisfied in all the circumstances, that such exemptions might be granted, having particular regard to the laws in these countries with regard to immigration, and the effect these laws might have on our citizens who might possibly wish to go to them.  In connection with the orders which the Minister is empowered to make, there is by Section 5 (c) power to make provision for the exclusion or deportation of aliens.  There would be a general aliens order empowering the Minister to make an order by which an alien could be excluded.  That would have to be laid on the Tables of both Houses. The other parts of the Bill deal with regulations with regard to fees and do not call for any particular explanation. The Bill is more or less explanatory with the Nationality Bill.  It will be realised that most modern States reserve certain rights to their citizens and reserve rights for the control of citizens.  It will be seen that there is nothing extraordinary in the Bill.  In the main, it is exactly what would be expected.  There was a certain amount of criticism in the Dáil with regard to the powers of detention and arrest.  As Senators may wish to discuss that at a later stage, I do not think it is necessary to anticipate criticism on that head. If it arises I can deal with it later. That was the main basis of the criticism in the Dáil, that the Bill gave rather extensive powers to the Minister, and also, perhaps, in one connection criticism on the basis of the Minister being a judge of certain things, doing them by executive or administrative action, which might possibly be brought before the courts. But the experience of the Department <Col N="1379" /> of Justice convinces us that it is desirable that these powers should reside in the Ministry, and that there is no reason to anticipate any abuse of the powers that are granted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad if the President would explain what seems to me to be the rather curious phrasing of Section 8, which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Save if and so far as may be authorised by a licence issued under this Act, it shall not be lawful for any alien who is for the time being over the age of twenty-one years...</P>
      <P>My experience of people is that once you are over 21 there is no question of being there for the time.  It was a permanent stage, but possibly this phrase is intended for the benefit of ladies who might be affected by the section.  Perhaps the President will be able to throw some light on that.  At any rate, it seems to me to be either ridiculous phrasing or a mis-statement of the intentions of the draftsman, and I think it ought to be cleared up.  I also wish to refer to Section 10 which gives power to exempt citizens of certain countries from the application of the provisions of this Act.  Sub-section (1) of the section reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Executive Council may by order exempt from the application of any provision or provisions of this Act, or of any aliens order, the citizens of any country in respect of which the Executive Council are satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances and in particular the laws of such country in relation to immigrants, it is proper that the exemption mentioned in such order should be granted.</P>
      <P>Taking the word &ldquo;citizens&rdquo; in the section, it is important to bear in mind that there is no definition in this Bill of a citizen.  There is such a definition in the Citizenship Bill.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; when used in relation to Saorstát Eireann includes (save where precluded by the context) a person who is a citizen of Saorstát Eireann by virtue of Article 3 of the Constitution and when used in relation to a country other than <Col N="1380" /> Saorstát Eireann includes a subject or national of such country, and the word &ldquo;citizenship&rdquo; shall be construed accordingly.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the obvious reason for embodying the word &ldquo;national&rdquo; or &ldquo;subject&rdquo; was to bring within the scope of that Bill the people of Great Britain.  There is no such thing as a British citizen or a British national There is British subject.  I want to relate that fact to Section 10.  There is no definition of citizen in this Bill, and I submit that the Bill as it stands does not give the Executive Council power to make any order relating to the people of Great Britain who are neither British citizens nor nationals but British subjects.  If it is the intention to make the section applicable to the people of Great Britain, then my own impression is that the section should be amended so as to make effective what is the obvious intention, and to include a definition of &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; as in the Citizenship Bill.</P>
    <P>The President referred to certain people who, under sub-section (4) of Section 5, are immune from the application of an aliens order.  I am surprised that there is no provision for giving such immunity to trade commissioners and people of that character, although the matter was referred to in the Dáil on several occasions.  The President, speaking on the matter in the Dáil, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Possibly there could be exceptions under Section 9.  As the position is not definitely fixed, we do not want to have anything in the permanent part of the Bill.  Possibly exception may require to be given under Section 9.  I am not quite sure that it could, but it is possible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have not seen the report of the debates that took place in the Dáil on the Report Stage of the Bill, but judging by the Bill itself, as amended on Report, no such amendment as I refer to was made to the Bill. There is no provision in Section 10 to give immunity to such people.  Perhaps the matter could be more satisfactorily rectified by the addition of a paragraph to sub-section (4) of Section <Col N="1381" /> 5, which deals with the heads of diplomatic missions and so forth.</P>
    <P>I think that in the Dáil reference was made to the British and to the Canadian Trade Commissioners, but they are not the only Trade Commissioners in the Saorstát.  I think there is some one from France holding a corresponding position here.  Whether Section 10 would allow for such immunity to be afforded to the representatives of countries outside the Commonwealth is, I think, a rather moot point.  I take it that the basis upon which Section 10 rests is that the privileges accorded to our citizens in other countries will merit the application of certain reciprocal privileges here.  While that would hold good with regard to Commonwealth countries, it is extremely doubtful if, by any stretch of the imagination, it could be applied to countries outside the Commonwealth. Therefore, I think it would be more satisfactory to have this immunity for the Trade Commissioners of foreign countries provided for under Section 5 rather than under Section 10.</P>
    <P>These are the sections to which I desire to direct my main criticism.  I do not intend to speak at any length on the general principles of the Bill. I would like to know the effect of the procedure which aliens must adopt when entering the Free State.  In the Dáil Deputy Costello referred to certain aspects of this which I think merit consideration.  So far as I could find, there was no conclusive reply made to his arguments.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whether the Government intends it or not, the position will be that after the passing of this Bill persons coming down from Newry to Dundalk will have to register with the registration officer under the Aliens Order of 1925, or else subject themselves to prosecution and subsequent imprisonment.  That is the sort of thing this Bill is doing at the present moment.  Anybody who comes in from Newry or elsewhere over the Border will have to register himself. That is one of the provisions of the Aliens Order, 1925.  Similarly, anybody coming in from England will <Col N="1382" /> have, straight away, to go to the registration officer and register himself. In addition to that he will have to inform the police authority of every change of address.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not sufficiently conversant with the details of procedure to know if that is an accurate description of what might be entailed, but I do find it difficult to see how this Bill is to be operated without some form of passport, identification voucher or identity disc.  The Minister has power to restrain the incoming of aliens, and he has power to exempt others from the operation of this provision.  How are the people responsible for the control of our ports to be able to distinguish between one class and the other unless there is some identification symbol which a person travelling can produce? Though I read carefully what the President said in the Dáil, I failed to find any light thrown upon that point.  I do not say that, in the assertion of our separate national status, passports should not be resorted to.  There are very few foreign countries in which visitors have not to produce some credentials, but I wonder what will be the reaction of such a system on the North.  I cannot see that the inauguration of such a system would be exactly helpful towards establishing more cordial relations between North and South.  I do not draw attention to this matter for the purpose of deprecating the action of the Government in trying to assert certain things which are inherent in our position as a separate people.  I raise the matter so that the President, when replying, may indicate that the difficulties of which I am apprehensive are not likely to arise, that the operation of this measure is not going to tend in the direction of creating a further embarrassment or obstacle between the North and the South.</P>
    <P>I was rather glad to observe by the President's Second Reading speech in the Dáil that he is beginning to appreciate that what is called common status does denote something of value and is not merely a trick by which to seduce the militant spirit of the Gael.  The President said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1383" />&ldquo;There was common recognition that there were certain rights and privileges which were accepted and bestowed in various States of what is called the British Commonwealth. ...  What it (common status) did convey we are providing for by reciprocal action.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am glad to see an advance towards appreciation of the fact that there is something within the Commonwealth in the way of common status which is not derogatory to our national status.  If the President wished to imply that whatever that is arises from reciprocity of action between the individual members of the Commonwealth, then I think he is fundamentally and entirely wrong.  That which operates under the term &ldquo;common status&rdquo; arises from the very fact of association within the Commonwealth and is not the result of action taken by the different members.  As a matter of fact, its existence might be said to have preceded the recognition of separate State entities within the Commonwealth.  In the absence of the President at the moment, I do not think that there is much use in pursuing my argument.  There is an old saying, that the more things are changed the more they remain the same.  When all is said and done, this Bill, so far as I can judge, leaves the position precisely as it was but it enables the President of the Executive Council to say to some of his more clamorous supporters: &ldquo;You can see that I branded John Bull as an alien,&rdquo; while in another section he says to John Bull: &ldquo;I am undoing the effect of that branding and the position is practically as it was.&rdquo;  I do not think that the Bill will call for resistance from this side of the House and I think that there is no great room for amendment save in respect of one or two points to which I have drawn attention.  I dislike the atmosphere in which the Bill has been evolved and the whole spirit in which it has been brought forward.  However, any good it does will live after it, and any evil that may be associated with it will be interred with the bones of those responsible when the time comes for <Col N="1384" /> them to shuffle off this mortal coil.  It was, I think, Walter Savage Landor who said that everything is real but realities.  That is the case with the Government.  Everything is real to them except the realities of life which they have to face.  They refuse to regard the realities of life as real unless they can be tortured into some new form, taken to pieces and moulded more near to their hearts' desire.</P>

      <P>I desire to say a few words with regard to Section 5.  That section is an illustration of the way in which legislation for emergencies tends to find a permanent place on the Statute Book.  I have not had an opportunity of comparing the provisions of this section with the provisions of the Aliens Restriction Act of 1914 or the Aliens Restriction (Amendment) Act of 1890.  However, I think that most of the provisions of Section 5 were the outcome of circumstances arising out of the war.  The Ministry appear to aim at making these conditions, which were war conditions, applicable, at the discretion of the Minister, to ordinary times.  I take objection to that procedure.  I can quite understand that there may arise the necessity for having power to restrict entry into and out of the country and to restrict movements within the country of all aliens, or aliens of a particular nationality, or a particular class, or particular persons. I can understand the need for having such provisions in certain circumstances, but I object to giving these powers into the hands of a Minister who may act on his own initiative. These are very extensive powers indeed, especially having regard to the definition of an alien as a person who is not a citizen of Saorstát Eireann.  Under Section 5 the Minister may, by order, declare that John Smith may not come into the country or, if he comes into the country, that he must live in a certain place or, if he is in a certain place, that he must not leave that place, or that he may not leave the country or that he do all sorts of things.  It may be that that order will apply to persons of a particular nationality who are outside <Col N="1385" /> the country or to a particular class. It strikes me that these are powers that ought not to be exercisable without the specific authorisation of the Oireachtas.  Therefore, I urge the President to look over this section again and see whether it is not practicable and possible&mdash;it is certainly desirable&mdash;that such an order should not become operative until it has the specific sanction of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (7) provides, in the usual way, that the Order shall be laid upon the Table.  It will then be within the discretion of either House to nullify the Order but, in the meantime, the Order will have had effect and, if there is any danger in giving the powers to the Minister, the damage will have been done.  It seems to me that a great many of these powers ought not to be exercisable by the Minister except in times of war or some very grave threat to the country. Consequently, I think, that the provisions of this section&mdash;except one or two as to which there may be need for prompt action without the possibility of having the Oireachtas called into Session&mdash;should not be exercisable by the Minister and that the Order should not become operative without the sanction of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The powers that are given are very extensive indeed, and leave the Minister for the time being in complete authority for perhaps several months.  If the Oireachtas is not sitting, for instance, it is always within the option of the Executive to call the House into session or to refrain from doing so.  Therefore, the power lies with the Minister to do these very drastic things without the authority of the Oireachtas.  Senators should bear in mind that in Section 6 &mdash;the section dealing with the powers of enforcing the Order&mdash;the Minister is going to take power to enforce this Order by very drastic measures indeed. That seems to me to be going much beyond the necessities of the case and there ought not to be a general power of this kind conferred upon the Minister.  I would urge upon the House the desirability of having sub-section (7) altered in such a way as <Col N="1386" /> to make it obligatory to bring an Order, of the general kind that is proposed to be issued, before the House and get the sanction of the House before it becomes operative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to follow the line of Senator Johnson's arguments, particularly in regard to Section 5.  That section savours of an atmosphere of alarm and panic.  It is really the type of section that one would expect to be drafted if there were a war on and we had hostile aliens on both our land and sea frontiers.  The powers here given to a single Minister of the Executive Council are of a particularly drastic character which should only be exercisable by him in a state of emergency. The fact that anybody who is not a citizen of Saorstát Eireann will be defined as an alien makes these powers particularly drastic if they are not used with the greatest possible discretion.  I think it was Senator Milroy who pointed out that, no matter what treaties or arrangements we have with neighbouring States regarding citizen and alien rights and so on, there will have to be some method of identification to ascertain whether these people do come under the special arrangements or not.  One can imagine that, in order to facilitate that, the Minister will have to define certain places of entry.  Just fancy what that will mean in regard to the situation of our country at the present time!  The railways that cross the Border cross it at in or about 20 points, and aliens may be entering by any one of these 20 points.  Some method of identification will have to be adopted.  I take it that it will be within the power of the Minister to limit the places of entry to, say, two or three points in order to facilitate the operations of the Act.  Then, we have numerous seaports at which entry may be effected, and one can easily conceive influences being brought to bear on the Minister for Justice, seeking to get him to restrict entry and exit of aliens to certain ports in the interests of these ports, because there is really no limit to the extent to which commercial influences will be brought to bear upon any Government here, no matter what are the consequences to <Col N="1387" /> the people affected.  I really think that certain portions at least of this section should be limited to a state of emergency, which it would be within the power of the Executive Council to declare, rather than having them part of the ordinary Statute law of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 10 is a very important section and I should like if the President could say whether sub-section (2)  of that section operates in regard to both sub-sections (1) and (3). Sub-section (1) enables the Executive Council&rdquo; to exempt from the application of any provision or provisions of this Act, or of any aliens order, the citizens of any country in respect of which the Executive Council are satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances and in particular the laws of such country in relation to immigrants, it is proper that the exemption should be granted.&rdquo;  That is a very important provision, and one which is likely to affect many hundreds of thousands, and perhaps millions, of our people elsewhere.  Sub-section (2) causes an order making such an arrangement to be placed on the Tables of both Houses and gives either House the power to annul such order.  Sub-section (3), however, enables the Executive Council to cancel that arrangement by a subsequent order.  It is not clear to me whether that order cancelling the original order must also be laid on the Table of the House.  I contend that it should be, because an order cancelling an arrangement already made is certainly of equal importance with the original order and may have very serious consequences for our citizens elsewhere and for citizens of this State who may find it necessary to travel to and from the State or States affected.  If sub-section (2) is to apply to any order made under sub-section (3), I think it should be numbered 3 instead of 2 in order to remove any doubt in regard to it.  If it is not intended to apply, I think that is serious, because, as I said already, the cancellation of an order is just as important as the making of the original order.  I hope that that <Col N="1388" /> will be made clear on the Committee Stage because I think that both are of equal importance.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the Bill is only such as is in operation, I think, in every State maintaining its own affairs.  We, however, have particular difficulties to contend with owing to the fact that we have a sort of unnatural boundary cutting right across the country and making it more difficult to operate a Bill of this kind than it would be in the ordinary course, because of the transport and trade connections as well as the traditional and historic connections which will take many years, if not, in fact, many generations to obliterate.  In that respect, the operation of a Bill of this kind, together with a Nationality Bill, will require all the tact and statesmanship that Ministers can bring to bear on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I see quite clearly that much of this Bill must be worked by the Executive authority, and, particularly in the circumstances that exist here, when it is almost impossible to control the irregular ingress of aliens, it is desirable that the Executive authority should have powers of deportation, and very considerable powers for dealing with that matter.  In general, I should not be inclined to object to giving the Minister powers of deportation, but when we give powers under this to aliens to acquire property, it seems to me to be undesirable, when an alien has been settled here for some time and has properly entered the country and acquired property, or even has been engaged in an employment here, that by a mere Executive act he should be forcibly deported and his property left there, his way of living taken away from him, and perhaps his dependants, who might be of Saorstát nationality, left destitute.  I think that some consideration ought to be given to the question of whether it should not be necessary for an alien who has been settled for some time in the country, who has entered the country properly, and who has been of good behaviour, for him to be convicted of an offence, or at least that he should have the opportunity of <Col N="1389" /> defending himself before a court, before there would be power to deport him.  I take it, as regards the questions that have been raised about Northern Ireland, that the intention of the Executive Council is to make an Order under Section 10 exempting citizens of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and presumably other Commonwealth countries, from the application of the provisions of this Bill.  I think that, in a sense, is fundamental to this Bill. It would certainly involve very wide changes and a great departure from general policy if it were not so.  Accordingly, I would agree with Senator O'Farrell in holding that a revoking order under Section 10 should be subject to the same provisions as the actual original order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Except for the points made by Senator Johnson, I think that the matters that were raised would be more properly matters to go into in detail on the Committee Stage.  Among the points raised, I noted that, first of all, there was the question of age at the time being&mdash;21.  Well, I suppose that you have to specify some time of which you are talking, and I take it that that is what is meant.  However, if there is any point in it we shall have it looked up.  The absence of a definition of citizenship was commented upon, and the definition which appeared in the Nationality Bill was adverted to.  I take it that the word &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; here, as it occurs, has a wide general connotation and would include a British subject.  I am not a lawyer, but I think the term, as it is used here, is clearly used to define a national of any State, whether that national would be called a citizen or a subject.  I think, too, that in the Bill as it appears, these additional names, such as citizen, national, or subject, were not intended to be by way of separate categories but are just alternative names for the same thing as they would be in ordinary cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Milroy also drew attention to a point that was raised in the Dáil that there does not seem to be specifically any provision made here for High Commissioners or Trade Commissioners. I think that the answer I <Col N="1390" /> gave in the Dáil covers that point and that, under Section 10, as it now is, any High Commissioners we would be likely to have would be High Commissioners from States of the British Commonwealth, and as our citizens do get certain rights in these States, the exemption which the Executive Council can make by Order undoubtedly would be granted in that case.  In that connection there is a point as to whether the word &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; was meant deliberately to exclude &ldquo;subject.&rdquo; Of course, that is not the case, and I do not think that any lawyer would hold that it does exclude a subject. The next point is the question of the difficulties that might arise in connection with the Northern boundary. First of all, the Senator seems to forget the terms of the Nationality Bill which, at least for the present, mean that most of the people who are there will be included in the category of citizens.  Secondly, in the making of any Orders dealing with it, special provisions will be made.  For example, I can imagine that if people were coming in here for a day or two days there might be certain difficulties and it would be necessary to give instructions to the drivers of cars and so on. It may be difficult to enforce any Orders that may be given in that connection as to the period of time in which a person may stay here, but I imagine that every possible care will be taken to make the inconvenience as slight as possible.  I should like to point out, however, that the question of passports is quite independent of this matter.  We could have passports without this Bill and we can have passports with it.  It does not affect the question of passports.  That is a question of general policy and it will be dealt with quite independently of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnson had objections to the Bill on the general ground that it was following the very bad practice by which the extraordinary restrictions of war time are continued on into peace time.  He seemed to suggest that they were so continued <Col N="1391" /> unnecessarily.  As a matter of fact that continuance has existed up to the moment and this Bill is doing very little more than putting into permanent form, if you wish to have it that way, the restrictions which operated up to the moment.  We have to ask ourselves: are they unreasonable or unnecessary?  I should like to approach measures of this sort in the same spirit as Senator Johnson but looking through it, I think the Bill is reasonably necessary, from the point of view of the possibilities of war, and in view of the dangers that might exist from the presence of aliens who were not known in the country.  I think the powers that are here conferred for registration and for keeping stock of people in the country who are non-nationals, are altogether necessary. It is possible, I grant you, that if we did not have experience of the war and the legislation which arose out of that experience, we might not be tempted at this particular stage to introduce a Bill embodying these restrictions.  But experience has shown that such restrictions are necessary and as they do not appear to have borne too heavily on anybody during the past, the ordinary discretion of the Minister can be relied on.  Of course, I know that that is a principle that one may not be able to maintain in all cases.  There is a likelihood that people who are made responsible for executive action may not act precisely in the way Parliament would desire.  Therefore Parliament is naturally jealous to restrict these powers.</P>
    <P>I think, however, these powers have, in fact, been in operation and that experience over a number of years has been sufficient to satisfy us that no unfair use is likely to be made of it.  I shall look into the matter but at the moment I cannot see how we could very well avoid giving the Minister the powers we have given him here, unless we wanted to have a special war-time code as well.  Sometimes, war comes on very suddenly and Parliament and the Executive have quite a number of things to deal with at that particular moment without <Col N="1392" /> being asked to deal with things that can be dealt with in advance. It seems to me that if the Bill is examined in detail in regard to the powers that are given to the Minister, you will not see much that can be objected to.  The Senator suggested that these Orders before becoming effective should be brought to Parliament for express ratification, that is, that before they can become effective they should get the sanction and approval of both Houses.  There again there is the question of principle and practice.  In fact, we know that such Orders are laid on the Table of the House and, if the Orders are objectionable, the members of either House can immediately raise an objection.</P>

      <P>I admit that that is during the period during which the House is sitting.  The House may not be sitting and it is suggested by the Senator that it might be deliberately kept from sitting.  If a situation like that arose, I do not think that these particular Orders would be the Orders that would be worrying us most.  I know that it was suggested in the Dáil that under the powers of arrest, detention and search, all citizens, as well as foreigners, might be affected. Again, I think, they would have relief in court if it could not be shown that the detention or arrest was reasonably necessary for the enforcement of the Order and in accordance with the warrant for search given by the magistrate.</P>

      <P>I made a mistake in the section to which I referred.  I wished to refer to the powers conferred upon the Minister in paragraph (b), sub-section (2) of Section 5. These seem to me to be very terrible powers to hand over to any Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">

      <P>The paragraph says that the order may confer &ldquo;on the Minister and on officers of the Minister, officers of Customs and Excise and the military and police forces of the State, all such powers (including powers of arrest and detention) as are, in the opinion of the Minister, necessary for giving full effect to or enforcing <Col N="1393" /> compliance with such order.&rdquo;  The power of arrest, as the Senator is aware, is very common.  I think it was remarked in the Dáil that even a park constable has the power of arrest.  That does not mean that these powers cannot be exercised with impunity.</P>

      <P>When he is making this order seeking such powers they will have to be specified fully in the order.  Our legislation is really in two parts.  The first empowers the orders to be made.  Parliament has still control except in the remote contingency suggested by the Senator that Parliament would not be allowed to sit. Parliament has still control if the Minister seeks to confer powers on himself under an aliens order which Parliament thinks he should not get. The first order, I take it, will be a fairly comprehensive one and will be scrutinised very carefully.  We may then have a good deal of discussion as to whether the powers which the Minister seeks to confer on himself are necessary or not.  I think it is at that stage that there may be a conflict of opinion.  I think the Minister, at any rate, will only seek to confer upon himself such powers as are really necessary for the enforcement of the order.  It is clear that when certain orders are made you cannot allow them to be contravened with impunity.  I think these were the only matters referred to by Senator Johnson.  On the whole, I can quite understand his objection to giving the Minister more powers than are necessary for the proper execution of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a remark made by Senator O'Farrell with regard to the power of revocation: whether sub-section (3) of Section 10 was governed by sub-section (2). I asked myself whether that was so from the same point of view as that expressed by Senator O'Farrell when I saw the section drafted.  I have been informed that the wording of sub-section (2) is perfectly general&mdash;&ldquo;every order made by the Executive Council under this <Col N="1394" /> section.&rdquo;  That is the section includes every order.  There might be some difficulty about revocation, but there would be another objection possibly if you had sub-section (3) with the same wording as sub-section (2).</P>
    <P>Senator Blythe made reference to the position of aliens who might be here for a considerable period and regarding whom it might be said that it was an undue hardship to interfere with them.  While it might be desirable to have special provision for dealing with cases of that kind, it might be dangerous also.  I am afraid that all you can do there again is to depend on the discretion of the Minister.  If the point had occurred to me, I would have examined it before.  We can have it examined, perhaps, in the interval between now and Committee Stage to ascertain whether it would be possible or advisable to insert some restricting phrase so as to indicate that the special claims of those who had been here for a considerable period would be adverted to by the Minister in matters of this sort.  I take it that, without its being stated at all in the Act, the Minister in carrying out his duties would naturally advert to any cases of hardship that might arise during the operation of any of these orders in the case of people who had been here for a considerable period and who had acquired property in good faith.  I am afraid it would probably be too dangerous to put such a clause in the Bill.  That is my own feeling as a layman but I shall have the matter examined to see if there is any particular need for putting some safeguard into the Bill.  I think I can assure the Seanad that in the operation of this Bill the Minister will have due regard to the possibilities of hardship that may arise to any individual. When I mention hardship, we must have the interests of the community as a whole before our minds in the first place, particularly when it is a question of the interests of the whole community as against the interests of people who are not members of our community.  At the same time I do not think that any Party would desire to impose any unnecessary hardship from <Col N="1395" /> considerations of that kind.  The whole matter will be carefully examined.</P>

      <P>This Bill is a very short and simple one.  Its whole purpose is to delete certain restricting phrases in Article 3 of the Constitution.  It was questioned in the Dáil whether these words which it is proposed to delete did, in fact, have the limiting effect, which we wish to remove. Although the question was raised, I do not think there was anything like acceptance of that point of view.  In any case, supposing it was true that it could be held with a good deal of force that there was no such restriction or intention in the Article as a whole, nevertheless, for safety, where there is a doubt, we ought to clear it up.  My own view and that of my advisers is that limitation did exist in the phrase, and in order to make the position clear it is necessary that that limitation should be removed.  The limitation consists of the words &ldquo;within the limits of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann).&rdquo;  The point is to remove this limiting phrase and to make it quite clear that our citizenship law has a wider domain than that.</P>

      <P>In moving the amendment I should like to say that it is difficult for an amateur to draft an amendment to achieve a purpose of this kind.  It is quite possible that there may be faults in it.  The amendment as it now stands makes my object clear. The object of the Bill is to abolish the commercial register.  When that register was introduced into the Local Government (Dublin) Act some years ago, it was done very largely to get over the difficulty about representation of business in the Corporation.  The law is, I understand, that persons <Col N="1398" /> carrying on a partnership are entitled to be registered and to vote, but if they form themselves into a private company, as many of them do, they are immediately disfranchised.  We are at present extending the franchise by a Bill which has just passed through Committee Stage, so that the franchise will be the same for the Corporation as for elections to the Dáil.  It seems to me that when a vote is being given to everyone, 21 years of age and upwards, whether they pay rates or not, it is unreasonable to disfranchise a person who carries on business in a local government area and pays rates if he does not happen to reside within that area.  The amendment asks that a corporate body may be registered as a local government elector and may have one vote even though it represents a very considerable number of persons, shareholders or directors.  We are at present going in for a very considerable extension of industrial development. Inevitably, there will be complaints as to the amount of rates such bodies have to pay.  It seems to be perfectly reasonable to provide that they should not be disfranchised because they happen to be a corporate body instead of carrying on as individuals. The Council of the Federation of Irish Industries is interested in this matter and passed a resolution containing somewhat similar provisions.  This is not in any sense a party political matter.  I am putting the amendment forward as a reasonable proposition, which gives a right to companies that pay rates.  It confines it entirely to companies which are managed here, and where the majority of the directors must be Irish.  If they are manufacturers they will come under the Control of Manufactures Act.  It would be objectionable to allow French, German or English firms with offices here to have votes, but when a company is controlled by nationals.  I see no reason why there should not be one vote when there is responsibility for payment of a considerable amount of rates.  This has not any political complexion as the persons affected do not support one Party more than another. I am not putting forward the amendment <Col N="1399" /> as a substitute for the commercial register which was a different matter and gave four or five votes according to the rating.  I am simply proposing that one vote should be given to a commercial body.</P>

      <P>I intend to vote against the amendment. I gave my reasons on a previous occasion.  I am against the privilege which existed for Corporation elections in connection with the commercial register.  I believe this is another attempt at giving privileged representation. If Senator Douglas was a shareholder in a public company in Dublin, he has his private vote without having another vote in connection with a commercial undertaking.  Money will not operate a company.  It requires human beings to do that.  We have an example of it in Dublin to-day, when all the money invested in tramways and buses cannot turn a wheel.  I had to walk from the far end of the city to attend to-day's meeting of the Seanad.  I am opposed to privileged representation. If the Senator at election time goes up for election, as I have to do, and if he talks to the citizens, he will ascertain their views about such a proposal.</P>

      <P>A privileged claim is not being made.  Premises in which business is carried on have to pay a large amount of rates, and by the Bill they are going to be disqualified from having any vote in deciding the amount that may be levied.  I know that I am being charged terrific rates while my vote has precious little to do with how they are spent.  Throughout the length and breadth of Ireland the people who are paying should try somehow to have a say in the levying of rates.  The object of the amendment is to try to prevent what is really a great injustice in connection with premises managed by companies which pay a large amount of rates.  The result is that for the payment of very heavy rates on the premises of a company in the City of Dublin, no one connected with it has a vote or any voice in the levying of the <Col N="1400" /> rates raised.  It would seem to me to be a wise thing that the people who pay rates should have some voice in the levying of them.  To say that this amendment seeks to confer a privilege is, I think, going too far altogether. It seems to me to be a matter of justice and common sense that large ratepayers should have a direct voice in the management of the city, and in the utilisation of the rates.  It was to achieve that that this amendment was put down.</P>

      <P>May I explain that, as the amendment originally stood on the Order Paper, it made provision that a corporate body might be registered in the register of electors in respect of two or more premises.

      <P>In the case of the Parliamentary vote, no, because you have the whole country as the area. Therefore, as he has to reside somewhere, he gets his Parliamentary vote and he has no grievance.  In the case of a local government area, such as <Col N="1401" /> Dublin City, if he does not reside within that area then he loses his local government vote in the city, as the Corporation deals only with the city.  So far as I understand it, you could have, if you had enough premises, ten or twelve votes.  You could have a local government vote in Cork and in Dublin and in each area in which you happened to have premises. Plural voting is not prohibited under the Local Government Acts so far as I know.  If you have premises in different areas you can have a vote in each.</P>

Supposing you reside in Cork and have business premises in Dublin can you, leaving the question of a corporate body out altogether, get on the register for the City of Dublin and vote at a Corporation election?  Can you also get on the register in Cork and vote at the Corporation election in Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>The important point is this, and the law on it is well settled, that at local government elections a man has not two votes.  In the case, for instance, of a business man he can vote in the city as the occupier of business premises but he cannot also vote on the same day as a local government elector as the occupier of his private residence in another area. In fact, people in that position are frequently called upon to make a declaration in the polling booth.  The question put by the presiding officer is: &ldquo;Do you swear that you have not already voted in any other booth as a local government elector to-day?&rdquo;  It is quite clear that the amendment would deprive a private citizen of the privilege that Senator Douglas is seeking for the corporate body.  That is not fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1403" /> I am absolutely opposed to plural voting.  I believe in one man one vote.  If Senator Douglas was consistent he would extend his proposal to all business premises, whether privately owned or by a corporate body, but he is not doing that.  This is a special plea that is being made on behalf of companies.  They are to get more votes than the ordinary private citizen.  I think the Senator is quite illogical in his proposal.  I am strongly opposed to the principle of plural voting.  Members of the House are aware of how it has been, and is being, abused in connection with another authority that controls most important functions relating to this city.  They know the abuses that take place in connection with proxy voting and plural voting.  They know how an important local service, one of the most important in the country, has been managed and manoeuvred in the interests of those who control the votes&mdash;sometimes foreign combinations &mdash;and all to the detriment of the local people.  All that has come about as a result of giving these limited companies not one or two votes but in some cases 100 votes.  The principle is altogether wrong.  I am wholeheartedly with the Minister in what he proposes under this Bill.  We should put an end to all this privilege.</P>
    <P>This is a democratic country. Everyone over the age of 21, if he or she has a residence, or part of a residence, qualification, is entitled to a vote.  I may say, even if this privilege were conferred on corporate bodies, that in view of the present system of voting and of the large areas that we have in the city it would not count for very much, because you would get in one street of Dublin, in tenements more votes than all the corporate bodies of the city taken together would be able to poll.  It is not for that reason, but rather because the principle underlying the amendment is bad, that I am opposing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Farren that the number of votes involved will be very small, and that consequently it is not likely on many occasions to make much difference at <Col N="1404" /> an election.  Senator Farren talked about the principle of one man one vote, but there has been much talk in the past about the principle of no taxation without representation.  I think it would be a most undesirable thing that large ratepayers, which in this case might happen to be a corporate body in the City of Dublin, should not have any vote at elections to the Corporation.  It is all right, of course, to say that the shareholders of a company will have a vote elsewhere, in Cork or the County Dublin or wherever they happen to reside, but at the same time I think it is a bad thing that substantial ratepayers in the City of Dublin should not be entitled to vote at a Corporation election in this city.  I take it that the principle Senator Douglas is aiming at is that those who contribute to the rates of the City of Dublin should be entitled to vote at an election for the Corporation, and similarly that those who reside in the County Dublin should be entitled, if members of a corporate body which owns business premises in the city, to vote at a County Dublin election in the County Dublin if they reside and pay rates there.  I think that the principle of one man one vote is the only possible one when you are dealing with Parliamentary elections in which the whole country is concerned, but where you are dealing with a number of different exchequers and contributions to different bodies, then I think that in the case of local elections the principle of taxation without representation has also to be considered.</P>

      <P>The arguments that have been advanced in support of this amendment strike one as being very plausible.  They have been very well put before the Seanad, but on a little reflection, I suggest that they are arguments which should not commend themselves to a popular assembly.  It is quite true that, from a certain angle, the interests of property should be considered in connection with the question of the rating of an area.  When you are called upon to vote on the question whether you will give property representation within any particular area <Col N="1405" /> you have to consider other interests and these other interests operate so strongly with me that I cannot vote in favour of the amendment.  Anybody who has taken the trouble to read the annual reports of the medical officer of the City for the last 40 years is aware of a record which reflects discreditably upon the owners of property who, apparently, had control of the Corporation. Those who read these reports will realise the conditions under which people have lived and are now living in the slums.  Anybody who reflects upon the information furnished by these reports can give only one answer to the question as to how he should vote on this amendment.  The people concerned here are those who are formed into units&mdash;whether they be small companies or large companies&mdash; which hold property within the area of the City, the members of those companies living&mdash;in comfort, I hope, but perhaps in luxury&mdash;outside the City with none of the inconveniences or disadvantages that poverty, slum life or unemployment entails, and with none of the other disadvantageous conditions attaching to residence within the City.  The conditions of the poor and of the workers are obtruded upon the notice of people who live within the City every day and every night.  These are the people to be considered.  They are just as much to be considered as the people who, under the name of a company, own units of property.  It is because I think that the poor and the working class are more to be considered than these people that I shall vote against this proposed amendment.</P>

      <P>Senator Lynch told us that it would be a very bad thing for a popular assembly to pass this amendment.  As an ex-member of the Corporation, I should like to put the matter in a different way.  The Senator talked about the reports of the medical officers.  So far as these reports are concerned, the Corporation are in a cleft stick.  For many years we have been building houses for the poor and for the middle classes in Dublin, but while we were doing that, the slums remained.  The slums have not been <Col N="1406" /> pulled down as they should have been. Why?  Because the moneyed classes in this city&mdash;I worked for a limited liability company and, although I had a vote, no member of the company had a vote&mdash;did not give three straws who went into the Corporation.  I am not objecting to the people who were elected to the Corporation.  The men elected were good men, but the people with the money did not give three straws what happened to any Corporation loan or scheme.  Senator O'Neill was somewhat at sea, but I should like to point out to him that, if he wants to build a sea wall at Clontarf, he must get the money to do it.  Remember, money talks.  That is sad, but true. We all know that the Corporation loan&mdash;one of the best investments in the country&mdash;was not subscribed the other day.  I am sorry for that.  It means that building will have to be stopped and that all the other schemes we had in hands will have to be stopped.  I do not want to make capital out of that. I am sorry for it but, if we do not give the people who have money a voice in our affairs, we must put up with the consequences.  I have pleasure in supporting this amendment.</P>

These are the public-minded people who have an interest in the State.  I have dealt with that matter by the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to suggest to Senator Douglas that he should withdraw this amendment.  Times have changed.  At one time the people he represents were able so to influence the Government as <Col N="1407" /> to give them privileges and to have a commercial register for Dublin Corporation.  We were told then that we were going to see a wonderful achievement in civic administration.  I saw some of the performances of these alleged supermen the commercial register found for us, and I do not think they impressed anybody or left any record worthy of the effort made on their behalf.  Nobody regrets their passing.  This amendment would be poor consolation for the people who had that privilege in the past and who, I should say, abused it.  As to the fears of the employing class and the well to do people, that democratic representation in the City of Dublin will mean high rates, they have now a definite safeguard in the City Manager, who will ensure that their pockets are properly looked after.  In any event, this amendment could not be accepted, in my opinion, because, under its provisions, administration of civic affairs in the City of Dublin would be entirely different from that of other parts of the country.  That should weigh with Senator Douglas.  The interests for which he speaks had an opportunity and they did not engage in any great development, or teach the older people in the Corporation anything new or anything worth learning.  Consequently, even if this amendment were passed, it would be poor consolation for what they had in the past.</P>
    <P>I know that privilege dies hard and this is an effort to retain some of the privileges enjoyed by these people. If this amendment were passed, it would, in my opinion, lead to plural voting.  The next thing we would have would be an amendment to secure votes in accordance with the amount of rates paid.  We hear people say that property has rights.  So have the working people of this city and property ought not to have more rights than the workers.  Senator Staines says that money talks.  Certainly it does.  It says &ldquo;good-bye&rdquo; to me occasionally but it never does a lot without the aid of human energy.  I think that the amendment represents merely an effort to retain a certain <Col N="1408" /> amount of the privilege these interests had and it is hardly worth while holding on to it.  It is not going to accomplish much on behalf of those much robbed ratepayers.  They have a safeguard in the City Manager, who will see that Senator Healy and Senator O'Neill are not going to dip their hands too far into the ratepayers' pockets.  They are safeguarded already.</P>

If it is a privilege, then I do not want to confer any privilege on the people for whom Senator Douglas claims to speak.

It is difficult to understand the intricacies of Dublin Corporation management and the attitude of the Dublin Corporation on these franchise questions.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of the people for whom Senator Douglas is making the claim.  It seems to me, looking at the matter as it has been presented here, that it is not justifiable <Col N="1409" /> to give the man in the country a right to vote in two separate counties because he possesses property in these two counties and to deny this right to people who reside outside the City of Dublin but who possess property in the city for which they pay rates. That is an invidious position in which to place an owner of property in Dublin as compared with an owner of property elsewhere.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is claiming that right for a corporation which owns property in the City of Dublin. In a similar set of circumstances in the country, the property-owner would be conceded that right.  I think that there is force in the point stressed by Senator Blythe, that if a man has the right to own property at all and if the State is entitled to give protection to property, the owner should be given the right to vote in respect of that property.</P>
      <P>What protection can property have if the owner of the property has not some right in declaring who is going to say what tax is to be levied on that property in the particular area where the property is?  That seems to me to be quite a clear definition of the position as Senator Douglas is putting it.  In addition, it is of importance that the owner of property, whether in land or buildings or business, should have such an interest in how the local affairs of the area, in which his property is, are being conducted, and that he should have the opportunity of passing judgment on it on a particular day.  It is an extraordinary situation for a man to find himself in, that he has property in a particular area and that the law denies him the right to say who ought to be the representatives of the particular area and who are going to levy taxes on the particular property he owns.  That is how the case strikes me as an ordinary country rustic, as I might say.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that <Col N="1410" /> Senator Baxter has led himself into a trap by thinking in terms of a man who owns property.  This is not the case of a man but of a corporate body and that corporate body may be composed of 150 men or 1,500 men, and a majority may decide, conceivably, what the whole body may do in such a matter as casting a vote.  I think that the real objection to the amendment is that it is going diametrically contrary to the general spirit of the local government legislation that is being promoted; that is to say, a vote by virtue of personality as distinct from a vote by virtue of property ownership. The other Local Government Bill confers a vote on the individual and this Bill is trying to retain, merely from the point of view of principle and for no other purpose at all, as far as I can see, the right to vote by virtue of property ownership.  Once this sub-section (3) has been eliminated, for practical purposes, the proposed amendment is of no value.  When it was conceivable that a corporation might have 150 hereditaments in a particular area, its vote might be of some value as it had many votes; but if it has only one vote per company&mdash;probably a limited company whose shareholders all reside outside the city&mdash;the value of the vote for practical purposes is very little, indeed.  In fact, you might say that it is infinitesimal.</P>
      <P>With regard to sub-section (2), as throwing upon the authority responsible for compiling the register the necessity for retaining a separate register, it strikes me that there will be no machinery for such if this amendment is passed.  I mean that the authority that is going to decide who are the persons and which are the companies entitled to vote will have to go into all these questions of whether they are registered, whether their business is carried on wholly in the Saorstát, whether they have complied with the provisions of the Control of Manufactures Act, and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, and it will have to be re-inserted and the section <Col N="1411" /> makes no provision for the re-insertion of that machinery.  Presumably the intention is, once sub-section (3) is eliminated, to retain as a jumping-off ground this provision for the vote by virtue of property ownership wholly and solely and retaining this provision for a separate register so that at some future time a slight amendment may confer a number of votes.  It is because the principle is running athwart the general tendency of legislation regarding local government that I think this amendment should be defeated.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept this amendment of Senator Dougles, and I cannot see my way to recommend the House to accept it either.  As Senator Johnson has just said, it is entirely opposed in principle to the nature of the Bill that has just been passed through a certain stage in this House a few minutes ago, and is opposed in principle to the general tendency of local government legislation that we seek to bring about.  That is the main objection I have to it.  I object to it also on practical grounds, however. Senator Blythe, and I think some other Senator, mentioned that it probably would not mean the addition of many voters to the franchise.  That is true, as far as I know, but it is also true to say that when the commercial franchise was in operation, under the 1930 Act, not a very great percentage of those who were admitted to the franchise, or who were entitled to exercise the franchise, sought to get on the register or used the power to vote when they were <Col N="1412" /> on the register.  I think that in the first year there were only 337 corporate bodies; so that, therefore, if that number, or even if 500, were again put on the register in Dublin, it would not be any addition to the interests that Senator Douglas wishes to serve.  Even if that right or privilege, or whatever you wish to call it, were given by this House to corporate bodies, it would not in practice be of much value to those interests.</P>
      <P>I am opposed to it in principle.  I do not see that it would be right in principle, and I do not see that it would serve any practical purpose.  I do not see that it would be any help or addition to any of the bodies that Senator Douglas, presumably, speaks for.  There seems to be some doubt as to the qualification for electors in local government. Any elector or any person who has the franchise, and is entitled to be on the register, can vote once only for any one local authority, but an elector can vote in two or more elections for different local authorities.  For instance, an elector can vote for an election for the Dublin Corporation or the Dublin County Council, and if he is on the register in Cork City, and has the time, he can go down there and vote there also, and he can vote at any public election on the way down if he is entitled to the franchise for those areas.  That does not apply in the Parliamentary elections.  In the Parliamentary elections the elector has only one vote in the Free State, and can only exercise one vote in the Free State on the day of a general election. I do not think that there is any other point that I need refer to.  I think that the strongest argument from the point of view of what is practical is the example of the use, or rather the non-use, of the power that was given by a very large percentage of those who were enfranchised under the 1930 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat surprised by quite a number of the arguments that have been used here, but perhaps most of all by the Minister's argument, which was to the effect that even if a thing be right the fact that it only affects 350 persons means that you should not do it.  He said, in effect, <Col N="1413" /> that because the number was so negligible there is a case against it.  I say that even if only one person were affected, it ought to go in the Bill.  In moving this amendment originally, I stated that I did not think it had any great political significance of any kind. First of all, may I say that I am not claiming to represent anybody and that I have not been asked by anybody to move the amendment.  I think I mentioned that before when this matter came in about a year and a half ago.  The idea came largely out of my own experience.  Perhaps I may be permitted to give a concrete instance.  Three persons owned a fair-sized property in the City of Dublin.  They owned it jointly and they each had votes.  I think their wives also had votes, but I am not quite sure about that.  However, they themselves each had votes and they resided just outside the city boundary. They also had votes in the county.  For family reasons, they formed themselves into a limited company, and they were immediately unable to vote for the city Corporation although they paid rates in the city.  Senators Farren and Foran referred to that as a privilege.  It would seem, according to that, that what was an ordinary right when they acted as individuals becomes a privilege just because they formed themselves into a corporate body.  To my mind, that is ridiculous.  The law provides that if a person has business property in an area he can vote in that area and that if he is similarly entitled to vote in other areas he can vote in those areas.  That was very clearly stated by the Minister.  Why is it a privilege if the same persons are a corporate body?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it might apply to a very much larger number. The only argument that seemed to me at all valid in this case was that there was a danger of plural voting.  I am only arguing that there should be one instead of three, because I do not see any other feasible way.  The only valid <Col N="1414" /> argument seems to me to be that there might be a danger of these people residing inside the area and therefore that there might be plural voting.  The attitude of the Labour Party is due to the fear that there might be plural voting.  I admit that I have not dealt with that possibility in this amendment but it is not impossible to avoid it. There are several ways it could be done.  You could provide that the vote would not be given to a corporate body unless one of its directors resided outside the area.  Another way would be to provide that the person exercising the vote must not be a person who had a vote within the local government area.  Plural voting can be avoided if you once concede the principle of no taxation without representation, which is all I am standing for here.  It is a bad principle to expect persons, whether they be in a large or a small company, to pay rates for local government without having any vote or any say in the way those rates are to be spent.  I know that the Minister has the big battalions behind him.  I know that I have not much hope of putting this amendment through because the Minister has sufficient numbers in the Dáil behind him to prevent it.  It is possible that there may be a question of the drafting of this particular amendment, but if the Minister has decided to prevent the passing of the amendment he can do so.</P>

      <P>May I interrupt the Senator to say that if he needed any help in drafting we would have been very happy to provide him or any other Senator with any assistance in the way of drafting an amendment that he felt inclined to submit to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that and I may say that it has been my experience in the past.  If the principle had been accepted I would have gone to the Minister and asked the assistance of his Department in drafting an amendment for the Report Stage, and I know he would have given that assistance willingly.  What I meant to convey was that there would be no point in altering this amendment.  It would make no difference inasmuch as the Government have decided that they will not accept <Col N="1415" /> it.  At the same time I think the principle is sufficiently important to divide <Col N="1416" /> the House and I intend to ask for a division on this amendment.</P>
