      <P>When we adjourned last night I was dealing with a few specific points relating to the various sections of the Bill which had been raised by Senator Douglas and Senator Honan. I think I disposed of most of them and I will come now to consideration of the general criticisms of the Government's budgetary policy.  In general, these criticisms may be reduced to two heads, (1) that the amount of taxation is excessive; and (2) that the tax scheme has a number of features which are inequitable as between one section of the population and another. Senator MacLoughlin opened the attack by referring specifically, I think, to the Entertainments Duty which he said we had increased by 50 per cent.  I do not suggest that that was the whole burden of his speech, but the greater part of it as you, Sir, will remember, was devoted to a commentary upon the verses of Omar Khayyám.  I confess the demands on my time have not afforded me the same opportunity that Senator MacLoughlin seems to have enjoyed, of refreshing myself with Fitzgerald's quatrains.  But I do seem to remember &mdash; and I am sure the Senator will forgive me if my deficiency leads me to misquote &mdash; a couple of lines as the Senator prosed along through a desert of inconsequences and occupied the time of the Seanad in going back on matters that were buried in the remote and distant circumstances of the past. I recollect one or two lines which I think might be aptly applied to that part of the Senator's speech.  If my <Col N="592" /> memory misleads me, and if I misquote, I must crave the indulgence of the House.  I think the Senator is a mighty sniper at the Government and therefore he will recognise how apposite the lines are in connection with some of the criticisms.  Omar speaks of the mighty hunter:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;And Bahrám, that great Hunter &mdash; the wild Ass</P>
      <P>Stamps o'er his head, and he lies fast asleep.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I must say that a certain feeling of drowsiness affected me as I listened to the Senator's dissertation upon this garden by the brink of the brook, with which he occupied the attention of the Seanad.  But, leaving his budgetary quotations aside, and coming down to one or two specific points he made, there was a reference to the Entertainments Duty which he said we have increased by 50 per cent., particularly on the poorer seats.  I can only conclude that the Senator has been placed under some misapprehension by the ill-founded criticisms of this particular tax which appeared elsewhere, because, in fact, there has been no increase in the rate of tax on the cheaper seats.  So far as these seats are concerned the inclusive charge for which is less than 1/- the rate of increase has been a good deal less than 50 per cent.  It is only in the much more highly-priced seats that the full increase has been imposed, and even if we had increased the Entertainments Duty on cinematographic exhibitions by 50 per cent., I think that is quite a justifiable imposition in the circumstances in which we find ourselves.  It is an amusement and a luxury, and I think when it is remembered that live shows as they are called are completely free of tax, and that those who frequent the cinemas, if they merely want amusement, can get it elsewhere, outdoor or indoor, or at ceilidhes, there can be very real substance in the criticism that Senator MacLoughlin founded upon that fact.</P>

    <P>With regard to the tax on sugar, one would think up to this year sugar had been a commodity which had gone untaxed.  The position is that in the year 1931-32 the then Administration <Col N="593" /> derived no less than £1,426,000 from the tax on sugar and sugar preparations alone.  The amount which we hope to get this year, even after we have imposed this additional ¼d., will be only £800,000.  In order to encourage the sugar beet industry, and to afford some assistance to our farmers, we have deliberately forgone no less than £625,000 for the revenue which was formerly derived from sugar.  Even with the additional impost which we have put on in this Budget, it has to be remembered that in February, 1932, the average retail price of sugar in the Saorstát was 3.37d.  We can take it that generally the price of sugar was 3½d. per lb.  In 1935, before the present Budget was introduced, and in the same month, the price of sugar was 3.46d. on the average.  Again we may assume that it was sold generally at 3½d. per lb.  Even with the additional tax which we are putting on, and after having relinquished £625,000 of the sugar duty, sugar will be only a ¼d. a lb. dearer in 1935 than it was in February, 1932, the month before we came into office.  When we consider the magnitude of the industry which we have developed and extended, and the additional employment which has been given, not merely to farmers, agricultural labourers and people on the land, but to people in factories as well as in all the other industries, on the railways, in the quarries preparing the lime, in the sack factories, and 101 subsidiary trades that are benefiting because of the foundation of this industry, it will be admitted, even if people do have to pay a ¼d. per lb. more for sugar, and if we had to make good with this tax some part of the revenue which we have lost by reason of the encouragement which we have given to this industry, when these facts are taken into consideration it must be admitted that the extension of the industry has justified itself in every detail.</P>
    <P>It is going to be of enormous benefit to the people, particularly to farmers and farmers' sons, who are finding employment in the growing of beet and afterwards in the factories turning the beet into sugar.  I do not think any person who has any regard for the <Col N="594" /> psychological effect which the establishment of these large factories has had in the areas in which they were established will say that the price we are paying is too high.  That deals also with the criticism Senator Jameson had to make of our policy in regard to the growing of beet sugar. It has been said that I referred on one occasion in a certain way to the sugar beet factory.  Senator Miss Browne reminded me of that.  I scarcely needed to be reminded of it at this stage.  It is old music in my ears, that I referred to a certain undertaking as a white elephant.  It was a white elephant in the circumstances which existed at that time.  That was early in the year 1932 when we were subsidising that factory very heavily.  I think, speaking from memory, that since the establishment of that factory we paid in subsidies alone to the proprietors almost £3,000,000 &mdash; nearly 50 per cent. more than it has cost us to buy back that factory and to establish three additional factories.  Substantial profits were being earned by that factory &mdash; both profits directly disclosed and indirect profits which those who owned the concern derived from that ownership. Every penny of these profits was going out of this country, and the people of this country were feeding the &ldquo;white elephant&rdquo; with these profits. I am not going to say that the experiment did not, to some extent, justify itself.  It did show that sugar beet could be grown here on possibly as economic a basis as it could be grown anywhere in Europe.  I do not want to be unfair to the people who had the courage to start the factory and to show what could be done in regard to the industry, even if I must say that their courage failed them at a certain point and that they did not think the extension of the experiment would be justifiable.  At the time at which I was speaking, that factory, from the point of view of the people, was not an economic proposition.  We have changed that.  All the profits now derived from the factory are being retained in this country.  The whole share capital of this undertaking is owned by our own citizens.  With the exception of the wages received by the <Col N="595" /> technical staff, the wages paid are paid mainly to citizens of this country.  A large part of the building work has been undertaken here, and I have not the slightest doubt that, henceforth, the fact that there are openings in these factories for young people with engineering and scientific training will be a great incentive to our universities and other institutions to provide facilities for techincal study which did not exist before these factories were established. The position has changed. Instead of having a white elephant as an object of pleasure or of worship, we have now a useful beast of burden.  It is now earning its keep, at any rate, and it was not doing that previously.</P>

      <P>As soon as the demand for sugar increases, we shall proceed to meet it in the same way. No matter how closely this proposition is examined, one thing is clear&mdash;that whatever we had to pay before to foreigners for producing our sugar, we are now keeping at home.  I admit that if all our land was being fully occupied, if all our young people were fully employed on that land in some other more profitable way, then the question as to whether the sugar beet industry here would be an economic one would be a matter for very careful investigation. But so long as we find large parts of our land untilled, so long as we find that a large part of the time of the agricultural population is not absorbed in agricultural pursuits, so long as our agriculturists are idle during periods when they ought to be working, then if we can use those idle lands to make sugar and save us what we should have to pay to foreigners, I think the industry is an economic industry and that we are justified in extending it.</P>

    <P>Senator Jameson referred to the position in regard to corporation profits tax.  I am prepared to concede at once that the fact that a large number of concerns are financed with capital which has preferential claims upon the profits and that these claims must be met before the equity shareholder <Col N="596" /> gets any dividend, tends to place the whole incidence of the corporation profits tax upon the people who own the equities in the corporation. It is to some extent an inequitable tax as between one class of shareholder in an undertaking and another class of shareholder.  It is not a tax in which I have my heart and soul.  At the same time, when I have to choose between a profits tax of this sort and taxing a necessary of life, I am afraid that the person who is sufficiently prosperous to have surplus capital to invest must be the first victim.  The Senator is in error in thinking that the corporation profits tax was a war tax.  The corporation profits tax was imposed in the Finance Act of 1920&mdash;almost two years after the war.  It was repealed, I think &mdash; I am speaking from memory &mdash; in 1925 in Great Britain, but it was not a war tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not paying all our war debts even to our first cousins.  The feeling at the time, I think, was that there would be a tendency for small concerns to be amalgamated in larger undertakings and for the control to be concentrated in fewer hands.  One of the social purposes they hoped to secure by the imposition of this tax was the prevention of that aggregation of industry.  They kept that tax on until 1925, and we have kept it on since simply because there did not seem to be any less evil alternative. It has been a standing feature of our tax system since the State was established and it could only be dropped if, as I have said, some alternative source of revenue could be found.  I do not see any great prospect in the immediate future of being able to dispense with it.  At the same time, I am not entirely blind to its disadvantages.  There may be a tendency, as mentioned last night, for men to keep their business <Col N="597" /> in their own hands and not to allow others to participate in the profits. Provided they do not turn themselves into public companies, these people can escape the tax.</P>

      <P>The Minister suggests that we are in the position of the Chinaman and that we must pay somebody to come in and get his head chopped off.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that there are other means of evasion upon which I do not want to dilate.  There appears to be some misapprehension as to the exact effect of the tax. Senator Jameson mentioned that some people could not afford to advertise because they had to pay this tax.  This is a tax on profits and advertising, I take it, would be regarded by the Revenue Commissioners as a legitimate business expense.  Therefore, the cost of advertising would be deducted before the net profits of the firm were struck.  I do not think that the tax would prevent any persons from spending more money upon the advertising of their products or from spending more money in opening up markets for these products.  That would be a legitimate trading expense, which would be allowed for before the net profit upon which the tax is levied would be assessed.  While the tax is inequitable as between one class of shareholder and another, I do not think it is so detrimental to business progress and development as Senator Jameson seems to suggest.  One of the lesser justifications for Section 7 of the Bill &mdash; the section which grants the concession in regard to income tax &mdash; was as partial compensation for the burden of corporation profits tax.  We had regard to the fact that people who invested abroad had not their investments subjected to corporation profits tax, and we felt that if we wanted them to bring back their capital and invest it at home, we had to put them, more or less, on the same basis as they would be if they had continued their investment abroad.  That is one of the minor reasons why the concession in regard to income tax on new investments was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="598" /> I do not know whether the Seanad will permit me to enlarge on the question of the Guarantee Fund.  The Guarantee Fund, in the form in which we operate it now, was in existence since the State came into being and has been a normal characteristic of our land purchase legislation.  It may have disadvantages but, on the other hand, it has this advantage &mdash; it does bring home to public opinion the injustice which a man may inflict on the community if he does not meet his just obligations to the State.  So long as land purchase exists on its present basis, so long as the State has to find some solid security for the moneys which it advanced in order that farmers who were formerly tenants &mdash; most of them tenants at will &mdash; might eventually become the freehold owners of their land, so long as the State finds it necessary to have a real security, I do not think there is going to be any departure from the present system of Guarantee Fund.  It has got to be brought home to people everywhere that it is just as bad to fail in paying your land annuities as it is to fail to pay your rates.  People will have to become alive to the fact that if they refuse to pay the rates they themselves are going to be the first sufferers when the local services break down.  It will be exactly the same in regard to the central services if people fail to meet their obligations in regard to land purchase because the grants which are given to local authorities cannot be met and it is the areas &mdash; and quite equitably &mdash; in which there is a mass refusal to meet their obligations in regard to the land annuities which, in equity, ought to suffer if the State has not the necessary finances to provide the grants in relief of local taxation.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Senator Jameson would like me to embark on the question of State investments, but I think that on the whole, so far as the Industrial Credit Company and the Sugar Beet Company are concerned, the results of the current year's working will show that we are justified in taking these investments at cost: that they have not depreciated in any way, and that, in fact, both concerns have <Col N="599" /> justified their establishment even, possibly, much beyond our original expectations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I say a word with your permission, Sir, on that subject?  I would like the Minister to know that in what I said I was not quarrelling in the least with what the Government were doing, but was merely pointing to the great difficulties which must necessarily follow because of the non-payment of annuities.  I was not suggesting in the least that they should not be paid.  I was merely pointing out that if they were not paid by those who owed them, they would have to be paid by the ratepayers of the district and that a very difficult monetary situation is thereby created. I was merely drawing the Minister's attention to that point, and that is the real point for the whole country to consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite understand, Senator.  I hope I did not lead the Seanad to believe that I understood that Senator Jameson was in any way encouraging the non-payment of annuities.  Certainly, I did not gather that at all from anything he said.  I think that Senator Jameson was rather stressing the ineffectiveness of the Guarantee Fund procedure.  As I say, I cannot see anything that is likely to replace that fund, and I cannot see any of our successors in office replacing it by any other machinery, because if we are not able to deal with this problem, it is going to be a problem for those who succeed us, and it is not going to be any easier because we have found it difficult.  Senator Jameson and Senator Dowdall both referred to Section 3 of the Bill.  That is the section which proposes to increase, for the purpose of income tax assessment under Schedule A, the valuation of property by 25 per cent.  They referred to the fact that a great deal of property had been built since 1922 and, therefore, had been valued since that date; and they assumed, I think, that because it had been valued since 1922, its present valuation was a fair reflection of its actual value.  Now, it has got to be remembered what the <Col N="600" /> valuation is supposed to represent.  It is supposed to represent the fair income which a person might expect to enjoy from the property; that is, income which, in normal circumstances, he might expect to enjoy if he let to a willing and not favoured tenant &mdash; a tenant who was willing to pay the full commercial rental for the property and who, in addition, had to bear all the rates and to be liable for all the repairs.  Therefore, it is the net income which the person would derive.  What is the position?  Most dwelling-houses here in Dublin, which are valued at between £24 and £26 a year, will let for £100, clear, the landlord bearing rates and taxes and being liable for repairs.  If we allow the landlord £25 to cover rates, taxes and repairs, we find that the actual net income which the owner of the property derives from that letting is £75 per annum.  The principle of income tax is that it is assessed on the real income, no matter how it may be derived.  There are certain preferential schedules, such as that derived from profits accruing from the occupation of lands, and things like that, but, in general, income tax is supposed to be levied on the net income enjoyed by any person &mdash; either his profits in his business, or the earnings of his profession, or the salary of an employee &mdash;and there is no justification in equity for placing the person who derives income from the ownership of property &mdash; possibly the best secured of all incomes &mdash; in a more favourable position than any other person.</P>

      <P>What about the values?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The valuers are bound by this, and that is the point: that the old valuation statutes, I think, have been interpreted rather against the State and the local authority by the courts.  They have been interpreted in this way: that the courts have insisted on the principle of relativity being applied all round, and when new property has come along and been valued a person looks around to see what a more or less similar house, not so new and not erected prewar, is going to let at.  He will find <Col N="601" /> that the difference between the letting value of the old house and the new house is not very great, and he then looks at the valuation of the old house, which, again, is very much below what its true valuation is if the valuation is based on the income derived from it, and he fixes the valuation of the new house with reference to the valuation of the old house deriving a more or less similar income.  That is the principle which&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out, Sir, that in the case of old houses that come under the Rent Restrictions Act, where they have not been empty for a considerable period, there is no price approaching what the Minister quotes on a £24 valuation.  The house would have had to be empty and then would have to be relet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be the case in connection with houses under the Rent Restrictions Act, but on that the saver is that in no case can the notional assessment, to put it that way, for income tax be greater than the assessment based on the actual income to be derived.  I cited in the Dáil a considerable number of instances of houses, as I have said, in all parts of the City of Dublin, whose valuations are of the order of £24, £26 and £28, which are let at rentals of between £90 and £110, and that is the class of houses which we feel, in equity, ought to come under this.  I am sorry, Sir, if I digress, and possibly I might debate this with greater length on the section, because all these points will arise, but I am merely dealing with the general question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Johnson dealt with some of the criticisms of the present proposals which based themselves upon an assumed increase in the cost of living, and I think he dealt with it very effectively, with, possibly, certain qualifications which I may refer to later on.  He pointed out that, as between 1931 and 1935, the trend of the cost of living in the Free State had followed very closely the trend of the cost of living in Great Britain, and that, if there was any spread between the <Col N="602" /> two figures, it had been infinitesimal. In fact, notwithstanding all the charges that have been levelled against us to the effect that these protective duties have increased prices considerably, I think that, when every factor here has been taken into consideration, it will be found that there has been a slight reduction in the cost of living as between 1931 and 1935; that is, if we measure in terms of sterling.  Accordingly, I think that those who use that argument against us do not found their arguments on very sound ground, unless they go further and say that, if we consider the cost of living here in terms of world prices generally, possibly the position might not appear to be so favourable as compared with other countries.  Then, however, they find themselves in this dilemna: that the very people who argue on these lines are the people who say that we must keep ourselves linked to sterling. They cannot have it both ways.  They cannot have world prices and sterling prices at the same time.  They must have one or the other, and, as we are on a sterling basis, there has not been any increase, but on the contrary, a slight decline in the cost of living in this country as between 1931 and 1935.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnson referred to what, I agree with him, is one of the major features of the Budget, and that is that we have not felt it advisable to increase the rates of income tax here. I can assure Senator Johnson that that decision was not come to except after the fullest possible investigation of the position and of what the possible reactions might be.  I feel that, in the present circumstances, the psychological reactions of an increase in the rates of tax would be such among certain elements in the community that we should probably lose a very great deal more than we would gain and suffer a loss which, I think, we could not recoup ourselves for, for a very long time.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is one of the obligations of a Finance Minister to raise taxation in a way which will be least injurious to the community as a whole.  I do not feel that I had any option in the matter except to conform <Col N="603" /> to the policy which our predecessors found to be right in that regard, and to decline to increase the income tax rates over British rates in the present circumstances.  I do not know whether the circumstances would not change materially if we were to consider the question of maintaining income tax at present levels rather than of reducing them.  The psychological factors there might be slightly different, but in any event, I agree, as we see the position at the moment, that our rates and the British rates must, roughly, correspond in present circumstances at any rate.</P>
    <P>The Senator also asked me to indicate that our long-term policy would be: whether we proposed to widen the basis of taxation.  Well, I think that it is not possible for the Government, and, particularly, for the Minister for Finance to indicate what his long-term policy is going to be in circumstances which, I think, we all hope and anticipate are going to be temporary and passing and are not going to be a permanent feature of the country.  We certainly have changed, to some extent, our agricultural economy and that in itself created certain transitional difficulties, but, over and above that, these difficulties have been intensified by the dislocation which has taken place in the accustomed channels of trade.  I am not one of those who believe that this country and Great Britain are never going to be friendly neighbours.  I look forward with eagerness to the day upon which they will be, and, as was indicated elsewhere, if we do overcome our political differences and do find a solution for them&mdash;an <i>impasse</i> even the most drastic that any of us could contemplate &mdash; nevertheless, we need not despair that normal trade relations between this country and Great Britain will be resumed.  I think that we could only formulate a long-term policy as soon as we see what the long-term conditions are going to be.  I do not think that we are in the position of people who have to adapt themselves at the present moment to changed circumstances, and <Col N="604" /> I think I could not make any forecast in that regard.  When the position is being clarified, then I think it will be much more profitable to indicate the lines upon which, I think, we would move.</P>
    <P>But, there is one thing that I think I would be nearly bound to say, and that is that so far as I am concerned I cannot see any hope of betterment, any departure from what have come to be regarded as the canons of finance and of currency orthodoxy.  My view is that for the past 20 years almost, the world has been going through an agony of currency experimentation.  We have all sorts of panaceas, of various descriptions, tried in every country of the world and none of them has produced a solution for the domestic difficulties of any one of those States.  I think that the old canon seems to be coming more and more established in repute amongst all thinking people: that unless a man sows he cannot reap, and you cannot produce the attributes of wealth out of a printing press any more than a conjuror can create anything out of a hat.  That is my own personal view, and I think it is a view that appears to have been shared by my predecessor.  Therefore, so far as I am concerned, I cannot promise that there will be any departure from what I think is the only profitable basis for trade or industry in a country: that a man will get the equivalent, in a tangible return, of his labour and that the State need not expect to be able to discharge its obligations towards its people or towards its creditors except by taking some of the concrete produce off the people to meet its obligations, whether it be to the poorer sections of the community or whether it be to the more fortunate who have capital and the wherewithal to furnish it.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it would be strictly in order, but I think I ought to say at this stage that there is some misapprehension as to the position in which our currency is at the present moment.  We are not on the gold basis: that is to say that our unit of value does not depend upon <Col N="605" /> the value of a single commodity, in this case gold.  We have been, since 1931, enjoying a managed currency which is at present on a notional composite commodity basis.  There are certain schools of economic thought that think that this is a desirable thing.  There have been long agitations for a stabilisation in the value of money.  We have been, as the figures for the cost of living in the two countries &mdash; Great Britain and in this State &mdash; indicate, enjoying whatever benefits we might derive from a managed currency and a stabilised value, but it has not, any more in this country than in Great Britain, cured any of our social and economic problems.  We still have the question of unemployed people to be provided for as they have in Great Britain.  We still have the unpleasant duty of having to come and impose duties upon this commodity and on that commodity in order to meet our national obligations, but there is this fact that, as compared with 1931, we have had a managed currency based upon a composite commodity basis.  They are talking about bringing that into the United States, but we have had it here since 1931. Before that, we had a managed currency on a gold standard basis, and the position was not any better.  My own personal feeling is that currency does not go to the root of this matter at all: that really what is more important is the organisation of endeavour in order to utilise to the utmost whatever natural advantages we possess.  Until we have that efficient organisation with a maximum utilisation of our natural resources, we can no more increase the standard of living than a man can lift himself up by his boots.</P>
    <P>Senator Blythe suggested among a number of things that this Budget was weak in structure, and as his justification for that he instanced the fact that we are borrowing large sums for export bounties and subsidies, that our allowance for over-estimation is too large when we take into consideration the fact that we were also claiming reductions in expenditure in <Col N="606" /> respect of old age pensions, volunteer halls and unemployment assistance. He said that we were not justified in borrowing for the export bounties and subsidies unless we knew that the economic dispute was coming to an end this year.  I do not see that he is justified in saying that borrowing for some part of the export bounties and subsidies would not be allowable unless the economic war was coming to an end this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I see that the Senator is hoping that it will come to an end sometime.  In the meantime, we are doing this: we are progressively increasing the amount which we provide out of revenue for export bounties and subsidies.  I agree with the Senator to this extent: that we would not be justified in borrowing for an indefinite period.  I hope that every year is going to bring better things, but in any event, we have to face the fact, and I think it will be admitted that we have faced up to the fact, that the economic war did not end last year, and that whereas last year we only felt called upon to provide £750,000 for export bounties and subsidies out of revenue, this year we have almost doubled the amount which we are providing out of revenue by increasing it to £1,350,000.  We have faced the fact that the war had gone on for another year, and, possibly next year, if the same undesirable obligation has to be faced, we will be compelled, I believe, to find a larger proportion of the export bounties and subsidies out of revenue.  To that extent, therefore, I think that the Senator and I are in accord.  I think any person &mdash; even those who might be inclined to take a very strict view &mdash; may say we have not failed to recognise what are the requirements of fair finance in this matter.  It all comes down to this: what are we justified in bearing this year and what are we justified in trying to pass on to posterity?  I think we are shouldering a fair share of the burden, bearing in mind what posterity will enjoy as a <Col N="607" /> result of the sacrifices which we are making.  It has been said that the allowance for over-estimation is too large because we have already taken credit in the Budget for economies in old age pensions, volunteer halls, and unemployment assistance.  I think the Senator is possibly under some misapprehensionn, because he said these were not real economies.  Take the case of the volunteer halls.  There is a real economy there because we have definitely deferred the erection of 50 per cent. of the halls which we hope to erect this year.  It is money which will not be spent this year.  It is, therefore, to that extent, a very definite economy.  So far as unemployment assistance is concerned, we are satisfied, after a further investigation of the position, and bearing in mind the operation of the employment orders, and particularly the heavy increase in tillage in rural areas, that we would be justified in reducing the original position in regard to unemployment assistance by £300,000. There are a number of factors which exist now and which did not exist then.  There is, first of all, the increase in tillage.  There is, secondly, the incentive we are giving people now to look for short-term employment under the Unemployment Assistance Bill. Under the original regulations a man placed himself at an actual disadvantage if he took employment for a short period.  Consequently, there was, I believe, a great deal of evasion in regard to that.  Thirdly, the new employment investigation officers have been at work since February of this year, and I have not any doubt that they are going to detect a considerable number of people who have secured certificates and are in receipt of unemployment assistance which they will not receive when the employment orders come into operation.  Consideration of every one of these factors makes me feel quite satisfied in expecting to secure that reduction of £300,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator also stated that there was going to be a general drying up of revenue, because even though we were <Col N="608" /> placing people at work every person who had been put into a job displaced another man because of the changed economic conditions, that we were merely providing industrial employment at the expense of agricultural employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to elucidate the arguments <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i> and I do not want to mis-state anything.  Let us assume that it may be a little, and challenge the argument which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has based upon the number of unemployment insurance books now current and upon data of that kind.  I took the trouble some time ago to examine a number of industries.  The examination of the figures as disclosed in the census of production for 1931 and the census of production for 1933 in a certain number of industries.  These are figures which, I think, merit the attention of the Seanad, because I think they do show that even in 1933 there was a very favourable trend in employment conditions.  I have not any doubt that that trend has been intensified and accentuated since. Take boots and shoes, clothing and apparel, sugar and confectionery, and jam making.  In the case of boots and shoes, clothing and apparel, sugar and confectionery and jam making, the value of the output in 1931 was £2,950,000.  In 1933 the value of the output had jumped to £4,045,000 and the number of people employed in the industries had increased from 9,638 in 1931 to 14,547 in 1933.  The revenue derived from taxation of commodities of these descriptions diminished from £1,012,000 in 1931-32 to £650,000 for the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other side of the story is this: that the wages paid in these industries in 1931 amounted to £607,405, and in 1933 the amount paid in wages had risen to £841,542, an increase of £234,000 in wages.  If we add to those figures the wages paid in the bottle making and brick making industries, we have in 1931 wages amounting to £72,652, and in 1933 wages amounting <Col N="609" /> to £125,996, making a total increase in wages in all the industries I have mentioned of £287,400, against which we have a loss in revenue, I suppose, of approximately £380,000.  We have 5,500 additional workers employed, when we take into account the workers who have been employed in the bottle-making and the brick-making industries.  Here are really significant deductions which can be made from these figures.  We have 5,500 additional workers employed at an average wage of £52 per annum. The approximate cost to the Exchequer in revenue per person employed was £66 per annum.  It has been calculated &mdash; I think the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Public Works will substantiate what I am going to say &mdash; on the very minimum in a public works scheme that the average cost of providing employment per £1 wages per man per week for a year is £150 &mdash; more than twice the State had forgone in revenue in order to provide employment in industrial undertakings for those 5,500 additional workers.  It would seem from that that so far as the unemployment problem is concerned and particularly unemployment in agricultural districts, that there is going to be more hope from the policy which the Government is pursuing in establishing and fostering native industries, in solving or trenching upon that problem to a significant extent, than there is in any great scheme of public works.</P>

Mark you, that was for 1933, before the policy of industrial development had got under way. I am perfectly certain, in due course, when the figures for 1935 are published, it will be found that this trend has been, as I said, intensified.</P>

      <P>I wonder are they strictly <i>ad rem</i>, Sir?  I do not know whether the House would have patience with me if I dealt with all Senator Milroy's speech.  He also stirred my memory a little.  I remembered, during some parts of it, at any rate, another couple of lines from Omar Khayyám. They are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;And lo! the phantom caravan has reached the nothing it set out from. Oh, make haste.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what I was thinking about some time about 8.30 o'clock last night, when he was anxious, he said, to get to this point of it.  The Senator had alleged that the Government by deliberately destroying access to one of the markets which we had previously enjoyed, and which gave us capital to build up our industrial life, were crippling industrial development in this country.  We have not destroyed access to any markets. We have, as the provision which we are making for export bounties and subsidies shows, been at considerable expense and considerable pains to maintain such access as we have to these markets.  But there are other factors in the situation, and there are, I think, other authorities who have endeavoured to restrict access of external producers to those markets in <Col N="611" /> the interests of their own producers.  I do not know whether or not the Senator reads the <i>Irish Times.</i>  I presume he does.  He often expresses the point of view which finds favour in its columns. But there was a very interesting and instructive leading article&mdash;instructive to Senators who harboured the delusion under which Senator Milroy seems to have been labouring yesterday&mdash;in yesterday's <i>Irish Times.</i>  Here is just one quotation from the <i>Irish Times</i> referring to the new agricultural policy which has been developed in Great Britain:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What will happen now?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These Dominions have no dispute about land annuities with Great Britain. They have undertaken to reduce their exports to the British market.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the two Dominions keep their promise, the price of home-bred meat aided by the Government's subsidy, ought to rise; the farmers will be encouraged to breed more cattle, and less meat will be wanted from external sources.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, is it not a fact, since the Ottawa Conference, that all the Dominions have increased their exports to the British market except this country&mdash;whether we are associated as a Dominion or otherwise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That may have been so.  We are not dealing with times past.  Once again, &ldquo;the roving finger writes, and having writ&rdquo; we are looking now not at the past.  We are looking to see what the future holds in store for those who believe that all their economic life is bound up with this problem of access to the British market.  Here we are told that two Dominions have promised to reduce exports to that market, and that it is the intention of the British Government to encourage their farmers to breed more cattle, so that less will be required from external sources.  Let us go on and see what, even in the best circumstances, is the view of the <i>Irish Times.</i>  Painting that future in its rosiest terms, on the assumption that we are loyal and wholehearted components <Col N="612" /> of the Commonwealth, the leader writer goes on to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Free State has one enormous advantage over the more remote Dominions&mdash;to wit, that she can supply fresh meat, while they can only supply frozen or chilled meat; and, when prices have been so adjusted that there is no great difference between the two varieties,&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
      <P>No great difference between the prices which we will ask the British to pay for our prime fresh meat and which they will be prepared to give for chilled or frozen meat, when these two commodities, very different in quality, have been brought almost to the same level.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&ldquo;the British public almost certainly will recover its former taste for fresh meat.  If England and Northern Ireland cannot supply the demand, the Free State will be required to help them out.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When England and Northern Ireland refuse to supply the demand for fresh meat, at prices which are not greatly different from the prices demanded for chilled or frozen meat, we are going to be called in to help them to meet the demand.  But look at the future that that envisages for our farmers.</P>

I am not going to abandon this.  This is the market which we are being told is going to be the sheet anchor and the salvation of this nation in the future, a market in which our farmers are going to be compelled to meet the demand for fresh meat at chilled meat prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it is necessary to give a long explanation in regard to this Bill.  Its purpose is of a stereotyped nature.  Practically speaking, it is to give statutory effect to the Resolution of Dáil Eireann in relation to expenditure on public services.  The Seanad is aware that already under the Central Fund Act a certain sum of money, the amount of the Vote on Account, has been authorised to be issued out of the Central Fund to meet expenditure for approximately one-third of the current financial year.  The Appropriation Bill gives authority for the issue of the remaining sum necessary for the service of the year out of the Central Fund.  It also enacts that each Grant and Vote during the session shall be expended on the service to which it is thereby appropriated according to the terms described in <Col N="616" /> the Resolution in Committee on Finance.  It is usual also to bring within the scope of the Bill any Supplementary Estimate which has been passed and reported at the time of the Bill being drafted.  In the present instance, one Supplementary Estimate, that for External Affairs, Vote 67, is included for 1935-36.  The House may be interested to know what that was for.  It was a Supplementary Estimate for the establishment of a Legation in Spain.  Any further Supplementary Estimates will be covered by the next Appropriation or Central Fund Bill.  I do not know whether any explanation of the various sections is necessary but, for the purposes of the record, it might be desirable if I briefly refer to them.  Section 1 authorises the issue out of the Central Fund of £17,240,796 which, together with the sum of £10,172,000, authorised to be issued under the Central Fund Act, represents the amount of money required from the Central Fund to meet the cost of the supply services for the current year, including the Supplementary Estimate for £5,000 odd, to which I have already referred.  In connection with this section and with the figures I have mentioned, I should say that the full amount of the Local Loans Estimate, part of which was included in the Vote on Account&mdash;£1,330,000&mdash;was withdrawn in view of the provisions of the recent Local Loans Fund Act.  Accordingly, allowance has been made for that in arriving at the figure of £17,240,000 odd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 gives the Minister for Finance the necessary power to borrow for the purpose of meeting the demands on the Exchequer.  It authorises the Bank of Ireland to advance to the Minister for Finance any sums not exceeding the total of £17,240,000 odd mentioned in Section 1.  In connection with the Central Fund Bill, a difference of opinion arose as to what exactly this specific authorisation implied and I have been at some pains to have it looked up.  I find that the origin of the phrase used is, at the moment, lost in obscurity.  The specific authorisation has appeared in the <Col N="617" /> Saorstát Appropriation Acts and Central Fund Acts since the change of Government in 1922, when it was adapted from the British Acts.  It has not been possible to ascertain definitely why the Bank of Ireland and the Bank of England were mentioned by name in the British Acts.  The question was debated at some length on the Appropriation Bill of 1922 and, to a lesser extent, on the corresponding Bill of 1923.  It was stated at that time that the reason for this authorisation in favour of the Bank of Ireland was that the powers of that bank as regards lending or advancing money to the Government were restricted by the Charter under which it was founded as a private banking company and that the enabling provision in the Bill was required to put the bank on the same footing, as regards the lending of money to the Government, as the other banks.  It was then affirmed that there would be no point in mentioning the other banks since they, under the Acts governing public companies, could lend to the Government without statutory limit.  I raised a doubt as to whether this explanation was sound and as to whether the Bank of Ireland, at the time, was, in fact, restricted by law in its lending powers.  I have not been able to satisfy myself that, in fact, that was the origin of the authorisation.  In any event, if it were the origin, the Bank of Ireland Act, 1929, which gave that bank all the powers as regards the lending of money enjoyed by other banking institutions in the Saorstát, would seem to have removed any restrictions imposed by the Bank's Charter.  The history of the provision in the British and Free State Acts is not clear and I am having it further examined so as to be able to deal adequately with any questions in regard to this authorisation clause that may be sprung on me here or elsewhere. As we want to see what was the wisdom of our ancestors in regard to this question, if any Senator could give us any assistance, I should be only too glad to have it.</P>
    <P>Section 3 specifically appropriates to the various services set out in the Schedule to the Bill&mdash;Schedule B&mdash;the <Col N="618" /> total amounts granted for supply services since the passing of the Appropriation Act, 1934.  The supplementary estimates for the year 1934-35, to the total of £2,170,047, are thus brought within the ambit of the appropriation. The second paragraph of this section gives the necessary authority for the utilisation of certain departmental receipts as appropriations in aid of the specific charges mentioned in the Schedule.  This paragraph has been somewhat amended by mentioning at the end the aggregate amount of the sums authorised to be appropriated in aid.  This brings the second paragraph of the section into line with the opening paragraph, where the aggregate amount of the grants out of the Central Fund are similarly mentioned.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the making of the usual statutory declaration before a person can receive payment in respect of superannuation or other non-effective service.  This safeguard is considered necessary to prevent payment in respect of superannuation or other non-effective service being made to any person not entitled to receive such payment.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to Vote 70.  The Minister, in discussing the Finance Bill, said that the price of frozen or chilled meat in the British market was 2d. per stone.  I am sure the Minister had no intention of deceiving the House when making that statement, but the fact is that no such price obtains.  I got the loan of the Minister's <i>Irish Times</i> to look up the markets.  I find that the quotation at the Manchester meat market was from 6d. to 7d. per lb. for home-killed beef. That includes Irish cattle as well as British.  Chilled meat, hindquarters, sold at from 3d. to 4¾d. per lb&mdash;not per stone.</P>

      <P>Sometimes scrap meats are disposed of at any price <Col N="619" /> they will fetch, but you cannot take these exceptional prices as the general rule.  The price quoted at Manchester &mdash;and it is exceptionally low&mdash;is from 3d to 4¾d. per lb.  To-day, in the Dublin market, good commercial cattle sold at 18/- per live cwt., and that is less than 4d. per lb.  At present, in the British market, our first quality beef is selling at 6d. to 7d. per lb.  As a practical man, I know something about the cattle trade and the meat trades, but I have still a good deal to learn.  I am in the trade for well over 40 years and I hear a great many Senators, Ministers and others making statements about the live stock trade and quoting statements, which are believed by people who do not know the exact position, which statements are wholly inaccurate.  It is quite unfair to make these statements except after expert advice.  A responsible person like the Minister for Finance should certainly not make such statements.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The <i>Irish Times</i> speaks sensibly as well as the Senator.  A great deal has been said by the Minister about what he is doing for the farmers in regard to bounties and subsidies.  I think he said that there was £1,350,000 more for bounties and subsidies this year than last year. I may be mistaken as to the figure but it is very far from the fact, according to my reckoning, and I believe I can convince the Seanad that I am right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I made a mistake.  A great deal is made of the boon that these bounties and subsidies are to the farming community and those engaged in the cattle trade. Practically everybody on the Fianna Fáil Benches has been boasting of the great things the Government are doing for the farmers in providing these bounties and subsidies to enable them to carry on.  Last year we got a subsidy of 35/- on all cattle exported on which £6 duty had been paid.  There was a bounty of 20/- paid on all other cattle.</P>
      <P>There was 3/- a head paid on all sheep and lambs.  What are the bounties and subsidies this year?  We get 20/- on all cattle&mdash;and there is a £6 duty paid&mdash;and nothing on any other beast, and nothing for sheep or lambs, although we have to pay 10/- of a duty on all sheep and lambs exported. Together with that, under the Fresh Meat Act, the farmer is taxed to the tune of £1 per head for every beast the butcher slaughters in this country, and 5/- for every sheep or lamb.  It has been reduced in the last month to 3/- for lambs.  I appeal to the Minister to consider that matter and to discuss it with the Minister for Agriculture who, I am sure, has put the proposal up to him before now.  There are a great many small sheep that come from the Counties of Kerry, Mayo and Donegal, and the other mountainy districts such as parts of Waterford and Cork, where the tax of 5/- is practically 50 per cent. of the value of the animal in a good many cases, and it is a monstrous thing that these little mountainy sheep should be taxed at the rate of 5/-, particularly as they are produced in the poorest quarter of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to dwell on that subject. I think the economic war has been sufficiently debated already and I am afraid that I can say nothing new on the subject.  I have made all the appeals I can to the Minister and to <Col N="621" /> the Government, and I want to assure the Minister that any appeal I made was not for propaganda purposes, but to try to get the Government to see the condition of the farmers and to see what this economic policy was leading the country to&mdash;utter destruction and ruin, at least, for the farmers.  There are a few matters, however, to which I should like to refer.  Some time ago, I approached the Minister for Agriculture to give me permission to introduce a Bill to eliminate the warble fly. The Minister for Agriculture did not object to the elimination of the warble fly but I did not get permission to introduce the Bill on account of administrative expenses.  I would like the Minister for Finance to see whether it would not be possible to make some provision in this Appropriation Bill to meet the expenses of the administration of such an Act. They could not amount to very much. I think that there are sufficient inspectors already to administer the Act and I do not think it would require any more supervision than is required for the Sheep Dipping Act and other similar Acts which are compulsory on the farmers.  This warble fly is doing enormous damage to the cattle trade of this country, and I believe that, before a very short time, if we do not introduce such legislation in this country, we will be prohibited from exporting any cattle to England or the Continent or to any other part of the world.  I saw in the press the other day where a request was made to the Minister for Agriculture in England to prohibit the importation into Great Britain from this country of cattle which had indications of warble flyblows on their backs.  That was a matter which required serious attention.  Of course, the Minister for Finance is always blamed for stopping anything that would cost any money, but I am sure his back is broad enough to stand any abuse of that sort that he may get.  I think, however, that the cost in this case would be very small and I believe that, even if it does cost some money, the Minister ought to have the Act passed and put into force.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not yet, Sir, but I understand that if we introduce and pass such an Act here Northern Ireland would fall into line.  Of course, if Northern Ireland did not fall into line with us, the Act would not be quite so effective.  There is another matter which I should like to bring under the notice of the Minister, if I am in order, and that is the amount of interest charged by the Agricultural Credit Corporation on loans to farmers.  When the Agricultural Credit Corporation was established its main object was to lend money to farmers on long-term loans at a low rate of interest.  Now, the present rate of interest is 6 per cent.  When the Agricultural Credit Corporation was established, the bank rate was from 7½ per cent. to 8 per cent., and the 6 per cent. charged by the Agricultural Credit Corporation at that time bore a fair comparison.  Now, however, the bank rate is 5 per cent. and there is no question about it, but 6 per cent., charged by the Agricultural Credit Corporation, who are supposed to be very much below the bank rate and who were established for the specific purpose of helping the farmers, is a monstrous charge at the present time considering the present price of money and the state of agriculture at the moment.  I do not know very much about finance, but looking up the money market, which I occasionally do, I see that the price of money in London yesterday was 15/- per cent., and that three months' bills were something like 1½ per cent. Senator Jameson will correct me if I am wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, let us take those figures.  I think that the Agricultural Credit Corporation should be able to borrow money, if they have to borrow it, at very much less than the 6 per cent. which they are charging.  I would suggest to the Minister that, under present circumstances, he should make a recommendation to the Agricultural <Col N="623" /> Credit Corporation to reduce their rate of interest, by half, to 3 per cent., and it would be a very good job also if the term of the loans were extended for a longer period than they are at present.  Most of the loans granted by the Agricultural Credit Corporation were for ten years, and the interest and sinking fund on that, in nearly all cases, would amount to somewhere about 14½ per cent.  That is a charge which no farmer can pay under the present conditions of farming, and I think it is a matter that the Minister should look into.  I have also been asked by farmers to request the Minister, if he could do anything in the matter, to expedite the report of the Banking Commission.  Many farmers are looking forward to some recommendation from the Banking Commission with regard to their loans which were advanced by banks for the purchase of land during the war years and in previous times.  A great many of those farmers&mdash;I would say practically all of them&mdash;can never hope to meet those loans which were advanced to them for the purchase of land in those days, and there is no use in keeping that millstone around their necks.  Some way should be found of liquidating that debt.  I am sure that the banks would be very anxious if something could be done for the farmers to have these debts liquidated. At the present time, the banks are not getting either principal or interest in the majority of these cases, and if something were done to settle up I am sure the banks would be glad of it. The banks are entitled to as much as they can get from the farmers, but there is no use in trying to get the whole of what they lent in those days, because it is an impossibility.  The farmers are hoping that the Banking Commission will make a recommendation with reference to those frozen loans, and I think the sooner it is done the better, because the credit of the farmers is gone.  They have no credit from the banks or from the merchants or the shopkeepers, and it is an impossible position and they cannot carry on.  I should be glad if the Minister would look into that matter <Col N="624" /> and if he could get the Banking Commission to issue an interim report with regard to the loans made by the banks to farmers in the years I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>I just want to refer to the Vote dealing with the matter of accommodation for the Gárda Síochána.  I am not quite sure which Vote it comes under.  I realise, of course, that an awful lot has been done in the way of providing new barracks for the Gárda, but in some of the small towns in the country the barracks still remain of a type which is not at all in accord with the dignity of what is regarded as one of our most important assets in this country, the Gárda Síochána.  I think that the provision of proper accommodation should be hastened up where it is necessary.  In some of these barracks in outlying districts the accommodation is still of the very poorest type, considering the type of men who occupy that accommodation, and the conveniences are also very poor.  Then there is the question of the cells.  I know of a case in a local town where an unfortunate fellow was arrested for striking some other fellow with a turf slán, and confined in a cell.  This happened on the 9th August last year. Shortly after that, the local fair took place and two tinker women, who were arrested for fighting, were brought in and, as they could not be put anywhere else except in this particular cell, they were put in on top of this unfortunate fellow, and in the morning he was dead.  That sort of thing should not be allowed, and I suggest that there should be a careful examination into this whole matter and that things should be hastened a little bit, if it were only for the sake of the dignity of the Force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other point I should like to mention.  In the outlying stations these men have to lead very dull lives, unless there is some great excitement taking place.  I suggest that some scheme should be considered whereby they would be provided with wireless and so on.  I feel quite sure that the Guards themselves would be very glad if the Government did something <Col N="625" /> in the matter, and I am quite sure that the general public would approve of it also.  Take a station in the Blasket Islands.  A fellow has a very dull time in such an outlying place as that, particularly when he comes direct from Dublin.  I hope the Minister will look into that matter and see whether something can be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say a word in connection with the point raised by Senator Counihan, although, perhaps, it would be more apt on the Finance Bill.  Naturally, those of us in the farming line are anxious with regard to the future of the country, and especially anxious to know how our financial institutions are standing. I had the curiosity last week, on the Vote for the Minister for Agriculture, to examine into the bank balance of a bank that has its headquarters in the South of Ireland, where it showed that the profit last year was only £600 less than the profit this time 12 months. In the case of another bank, which has its headquarters in London, but which is really the National Bank of this country, their profits were only down by the sum of £1,700.  These banks have created reserve funds equivalent to, or slightly greater than, their capital, but each of these banks issued considerable sums of money to the public.  In the case of one bank, it was £15,000,000 and in the case of the other bank the figure is £10,000,000. Most of that money is advanced to farmers, and I put it to you that none of these farmers are able to pay that money.  That particular position will injure the credit of those financial institutions.  A 20 per cent. default in advances to customers would mean insolvency for one of those banks.  They are lending the depositors' money to the public, and the public through the position in which farmers now find themselves are not able to meet their repayments.  Anything that could be done to make the position of the farming community more solvent would be very desirable indeed.  It would help the State to carry on, and would make the country more prosperous.  I contend <Col N="626" /> that there is only one means by which you can bring a return of prosperity to the farmers and that is by raising the price of cattle.  I am not at all decrying the efforts of the Government in their wheat schemes, their beet schemes or their potato spirit schemes. All these schemes are good in their way but, after all, they only affect a small portion of the population.  You have 200,000 acres under wheat, 50,000 acres under beet, and about 50,000 acres under potatoes, but what is all that when you consider that you have about 12,000,000 acres of arable land in the country?  I hope the Government will take some steps to raise the price of cattle, because that is the only thing that will bring real prosperity to the country, that will be of benefit to the whole community, and that can save our financial institutions.  If the latter are not able to collect their debts, then a very serious position will have come about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I desired to speak on the Finance Bill yesterday, but as I was put in the Chair that prevented me from doing so.  We hear a great deal about the development of industry in the country.  I am all in favour of that.  It would be a good thing if we could have a balanced economy, with industry prosperous on the one hand and farming on the other.  Let us examine for a moment the position of the flour-milling industry.  At the present time the price of flour is 10/- per sack more in the Free State than in Belfast.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce admitted a difference of 8/- per sack, but for the purposes of easy calculation let us assume that the difference is 10/- per sack.  In or about 3,000,000 sacks of flour are consumed in the Free State in a year.  That means that the people here are paying £1,500,000 more for their flour because of the fact that we are milling flour here.  What do the statistics in relation to the employment given in the flour milling industry reveal?  The wages paid to all those in the Free State mills amount to about £320,000, so that the position we have is this: you could pay all these men to stay at home, or to go and play golf, and have your flour <Col N="627" /> £1,000,000 a year cheaper if you got it from outside the State.  What is the use then of talking about the poor people in the slums?  They are getting hit severely, and that is because the price of bread is so high.  I do not say that the same thing applies to all our industries.  I have got several articles manufactured in the Free State, particularly hayforks, and I have found them to be as good an article as you could get elsewhere. Some of the implements manufactured here are good, but some are not.  I hope that as things go on our manufactured articles will prove to be as good as those which, in years past, we were accustomed to using.  We do not mind if they are a little dearer.  All we ask is that they be of good quality.</P>
    <P>The question of the rates charged on loans by the Agricultural Credit Corporation was referred to by Senator Counihan.  I have had some experience of young farmers borrowing sums of £600 and £700, repayable in 10 years at 6 per cent.  As Senator Counihan pointed out, that rate of interest really works out at 14 per cent. per annum. I know that many of these young farmers have not been able to meet their obligations to the Corporation. Some of them are relatives of my own, and the position is that I am paying for them.  There must be a great number of young fellows in the country similarly circumstanced.  I have always held the opinion that the rate of interest charged is too high.  I know that the money which the Corporation is lending was raised at 5 per cent.  It takes 1 per cent. to run the business, so, therefore, I suppose, the Corporation must charge 6 per cent. on the money it lends out.  At the time the Corporation was set up, money was at 5 per cent.  We had a National Loan floated at 95 for £100 worth of stock.  Last year the Government floated a 3½ per cent. loan at 97.</P>

I do not see why the Corporation should not get some of <Col N="628" /> this cheap money to meet this particular problem that I have been dealing with.  It is a serious thing for a number of young farmers.  They get a loan when going into a farm.  They work hard and do everything possible to meet their obligations, but on account of the times we are in they are not able to meet their loan repayments. Then their property is sold and they are thrown out on the road.  I think that situation could be met by a reduction in the interest charges and by an extension of the period for repayment.</P>

      <P>I desire to have some information on Vote No. 68&mdash;Grant in Aid of the Expenses of the League of Nations and for other expenses therewith&mdash;£17,500. At the outset I want to say that I am not going to criticise that expenditure.  It is a good thing, in my opinion, that this State should be represented at the League of Nations.  We all remember the strenuous and unsuccessful efforts made in some parts of the world prior to the creation of this State to secure a recognition of our sovereignty.  We did, however, succeed in getting at the League of Nations a full and complete recognition of our sovereignty as a sovereign State, and that, I think, was a great achievement for this nation.  I think we ought to have some statement as to what exactly is our policy as a member of the League of Nations.  There is a big international and perplexing problem there at the moment between Abyssinia and Italy.  Has this State any outlook on the implications involved in that dispute?  Has it considered the possibility of any action which may tend to avert warfare, bloodshed and international conflict? I do not know, but as a member of the League of Nations I think we are entitled to have some authentic statement as to the attitude and the opinion of the Government on that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter in regard to the League of Nations which is of much more immediate concern to us. Perhaps it would be unwise to go too deeply into what the Covenant of the <Col N="629" /> League commits the member-States to in regard to the attitude to be adopted towards member-States which engage in war in disregard of their commitments under the Covenant, but I think that it is not evidence of good statesmanship for the Government of this State, which is a member, simply to ignore that; to let the thing pass without indicating that they have taken note of what is happening.  I say that because, in certain eventualities, the fate which threatens one member-State at the present time may possibly be a fate which may threaten this State, and it is desirable that we should not allow a precedent to be established without recording what our attitude is.  We should do that so as to provide some basis of a national attitude should such an undesirable contingency in the remote future ever occur here.</P>
    <P>Article 22 of the Covenant deals with the question of Mandatories: Control of colonies and territories.  Though this may seem at first glance to be irrelevant to the business of this House, I think it is not at all irrelevant in view of the circumstances that exist in the 32 Counties of Ireland to-day.  The first two paragraphs of Article 22 of the Covenant are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To those colonies and territories which as a consequence of the late war have ceased to be under the sovereignty of the States which formerly governed them and which are inhabited by peoples not yet able to stand by themselves under the strenuous conditions of the modern world, there should be applied the principle that the wellbeing and development of such peoples form a sacred trust of civilisation and that securities for the performance of this trust should be embodied in this Covenant.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The best method of giving practical effect to this principle is that the tutelage of such peoples should be entrusted to advanced nations who by reason of their resources, their experience&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I emphasise the words which follow&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;or their geographical position <Col N="630" /> can best undertake this responsibility, and who are willing to accept it, and that this tutelage should be exercised by them as Mandatories on behalf of the League.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I understand that in the near future there is to be a meeting of the League of Nations.  I think it would not be at all undesirable if our representative there were to apply for a mandate from the League of Nations to take over the tutelage and control of a certain area within the 32 Counties in which the people do not yet seem to be able to stand by themselves: where there are conditions which seem to be somewhat analogous to the conditions of barbarity alleged by Italy to exist in Abyssinia.  I do not think anyone can have any doubt as to the area to which I am referring.  I think that the question of the relations between the Twenty-Six Counties and the Six Counties&mdash;the dispute between them&mdash;is one that involves considerations that might very well be brought before the League of Nations.  Things are happening there to-day which must perturb and sadden everyone who desires to see civilised and prosperous conditions prevail there, and who at the same time desires to see in the near future a unification of the different sections in this country.</P>
    <P>I am raising this matter, not that I expect that such a mandate will be given to restore order in the Belfast area, but in order to utilise this moment to express what I think must be the abhorrence of all thinking people in this country against what is happening, and repugnance at anything that may have been responsible for initiating these appalling conditions and events.  I would not have chosen this occasion to raise this matter were it not that there seems to be evidence of the possibility of a continuation over a prolonged period of these unhappy conditions and disturbances.  If that is so, I think this State and the Government of this State cannot shut its eyes to a certain element of moral responsibility in the matter, and, in the unhappy event of these things continuing over a prolonged period, I think the matter will have to be raised again, <Col N="631" /> perhaps in the Assembly of the League of Nations, which may have more weight than could possibly be expected from a discussion here.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other matters to which I want to refer.  First I want to go back to a matter which I raised on the Finance Bill and which was referred to again to-day by the Minister in his concluding speech.  Section 72 of this Bill deals with advances to the Guarantee Fund.  I want to correct an impression which seems to have been gathered from observations both by the Minister and, I think, Senator Fitzgerald that I suggested the non-payment of annuities.  I made no such suggestion.  I quite agree that it is a common error to fall into nowadays to suggest that the people affected in this matter who are resisting the payment of the annuities to the Free State Exchequer are guilty of the non-payment of annuities.  I want to say very clearly and very definitely that I have no sympathy whatever with the idea of non-payment of the annuities.  The point that I tried to make yesterday and that I want to urge now&mdash;and it is one the Minister did not face up to yesterday and one which is being avoided, I think, generally by responsible people&mdash;is this: if the annuities which the purchasing farmers agreed to pay for the purchase of their land are collected by the British Ministry in the form of taxes&mdash;if the purchasing tenant discharges his liabilities&mdash;is it equitable for this State to extract a further 50 per cent. through the machinery of their collection here? That is the point.  That is no argument for the non-payment of annuities. Senator Fitzgerald said yesterday that that might be taken as a precedent for the non-payment of rents by town tenants.  I asked for the analogy, not with the intention of interrupting the Senator, but there seemed to me to be no analogy.  There would be an analogy in this sense: if the purchasing tenant had paid his landlord the amount which he agreed to pay in respect of the purchase of his house, and if the Government then came along and said: &ldquo;You will pay another <Col N="632" /> 50 per cent. to us.&rdquo;  This argument does not rest upon the capacity or the non-capacity of the person concerned to pay.  It is a question of whether or not, when the person concerned has already discharged his liabilities, there is any justice or equity or any basis upon which the Minister can with moral sanction demand that an additional 50 per cent. of that amount shall be paid into another Exchequer.  I am not speaking dogmatically on this matter at all.  It is not a matter that I have examined to the extent that I can state all the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons.</i>  I am raising it in order to give someone who may be more conversant with the full implications of it than myself an opportunity to answer this question.</P>
    <P>If the farmer has discharged the full amount of the obligation he entered into, if every penny of that has been collected from him by the British Exchequer, is it equitable for the State to extract a further 50 per cent., and is the man who, having paid his full liabilities and more in the form of penal taxes&mdash;and remember those penal taxes were for the express purpose of collecting these annuities&mdash; refuses to pay them again, guilty of any moral wrong?  I ask that that question be answered.  I do not want to detain the House by a repetition of this matter.  The Minister referred to this.  He just dwelt upon the question of the injustice that is inflicted upon the community by people not fulfilling their moral obligations in the matter of the land annuities.  That is exactly the point, whether or not they have fulfilled their obligations.  I see that there is a difficulty, that if a stoppage of these payments is made in an irregular fashion, and later if there is a cessation of the dispute with England, the difficulty of resuming these payments in the ordinary legal way would be very considerable.  But I think the point of view of those who are claiming that they have already paid their annuities is not one to be brushed aside or ignored.  I think the Minister himself, if he had already paid some commitment that he had entered into, would resent some one coming <Col N="633" /> along and saying: &ldquo;You have got to pay another 50 per cent.&rdquo;  I ask the Minister to give his attention definitely to this point and answer the question whether or not it is morally legitimate for this State to extract that further 50 per cent. of the annuities from people who are already paying to the full every penny that they undertook to pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Toal</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to speak briefly only on one item in which I am interested: that is local government.  I think the Minister will recognise that it is essential that nothing should be done to hamper the working of local government in the Twenty-Six Counties.  I am afraid that the reductions in the grants this year, and extra taxation, will embarrass the local authorities to a great extent.  The Agricultural Grant, for instance, will be considerably reduced.  That is a very serious matter when we take into account that most of the local bodies this year had to increase their rates for local services.  In the county that I represent the rates were considerably increased.  When we are faced, then, with a reduction in the Agricultural Grants and with increased expenditure it will be very difficult.  We know how difficult it is to collect rates at the present time.  It is more difficult in our case.  We are on the Border, and derating is in full force at the other side.  Additional expense has been incurred.  There is one item to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  I am surprised that the Government insists on it.  That is the increased rate of stamp duties for the local bodies.  For every amount over £2 we must incur the expense of a stamp.  That may look a small thing, but when it is totted up it means a very considerable amount, hundreds of pounds to each county council.  That is a tax that was never insisted on by any Government up to the present.  I hope the Minister will consider that point. I do not know if it is possible for him still to allow us the Agricultural Grant we had heretofore.  The Minister knows very well the difficulty of collecting rates, and it is very important that the Grant should not be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="634" /> It is a great encouragement to ratepayers, when they recognise that they are getting considerable grants from the Government to pay rates.  I know that this was done with the best intention. I realise that the position of medium-sized farmers with valuations over £20 is becoming very difficult.  I am sure the intention of the Government was to give a reduction to encourage farmers with small valuations and afterwards those with valuations over £20, so that they would give additional employment.  It is very hard for farmers whose valuation is £20 to increase the amount of employment they are giving to agricultural labourers.  I am certain that they would not be able to do so on the prices they are getting for agricultural produce.</P>
    <P>We have in parts of the country a great deal of what I call slave labour. That slave labour is given by farmers and their wives and, in many cases, by their daughters, but no allowance is made for their labour.  These people work very hard, yet they find it difficult to make ends meet.  They are not now allowed privileges that they had heretofore.  I calculate that in my county the increase where the valuations are £20, and where no labour is employed, represents 1/9 in the £.  That is a very serious position and it has created a great deal of anxiety.  Up to this, fortunately, we were in a position to meet our demands, and I hope that will continue.  I hope the Minister will encourage these people by ensuring that no increased expenditure will be incurred, and that the grants which were given by the Government will be maintained.  We all recognise how important it is that local government should work smoothly.  I intended to deal with many other matters but as there were so many speakers to-day I will not go into them now.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to see a changed atmosphere in the Seanad.  It is a good sign, and shows that we are beginning to realise the position the country is in.  It wants the brains not only of the Government but of all thinking men unless it is to go along the road to ruin.  Taking up the newspapers <Col N="635" /> day after day I say that the country is sick of the wrangles and disputes that are taking place in the Parliament. When people see that they think that nothing is going to be done for them.  I hope that we will forget some of the past and that men on both sides will co-operate to try to devise a policy which will save the country from ruin.  I was delighted to see the change that was here to-day.  As one who has been associated with public life for a long time and went through the different phases of our national struggle it is very sickening, now when we have a form of Government of our own&mdash;even though it may not be perfect &mdash;to see what goes on, instead of all the best brains uniting and showing that they are patriots and are out to serve and save their country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. MacEllin Mr. MacEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Toal finished with a very good sentiment.  I agree with him that, instead of having to deal with attacks and outrages, the Dáil should be in a position to discuss the useful work that could be done for the country.  As far as I know, the Ministers and the Government have at all times invited constructive criticism. At no time since the Government took office has there been constructive criticism.  The Government did not get an opportunity of governing properly, because they were violently attacked right and left.  Militant bodies were formed both by the Right and the Left in order to make government impossible. While that mentality prevails amongst those responsible for leading the people into such methods there will be nothing in the Dáil or in the country but bitterness and hatred.  The people who encourage these militant bodies are not able to control them. That is the root cause of our difficulties. The law exists for the benefit of all.  All Parties should co-operate in giving effect to that law.  I do not know how long it will take to reach that stage, but certainly the sooner the Party of which Senator Toal is a member makes an effort in that direction the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Toal's colleague, Senator Milroy, developed an argument as to <Col N="636" /> whether a man has a moral right to pay the annuities or not.  The decree of the Government elected by the majority of the people is that they should be paid.  While decrees of the Government are there they are entitled to run, and members of the Oireachtas should do everything in their power, publicly and privately, to give effect to these decrees.  I understand that 80 per cent. of the annuities have been paid and that it is the other 20 per cent. that is creating the chaos in the South of Ireland.  Because the 20 per cent. have decided not to pay their annuities they now want people who have already paid to pay their share as well, through the rates, in the coming year.  Is it morally right that these people should be allowed not to pay?  Actually Senator Milroy wants the 20 per cent. to let everyone else pay for them.  They believe they can get out of paying their debts by using violence.  If the men are not violent, then they will collect the women and send them out, probably because they are afraid to go themselves.  We are the laughing-stock of the world owing to the way this conduct is tolerated. It would not be tolerated during the régime of the last Government.</P>
    <P>Senator Milroy exploded Senator Counihan's argument that the annuities had been paid twice.  Senator Counihan stated that prime beef was selling at 4d. per lb. in the Dublin market, while the price in Manchester was 1/6.  I say that there is only a difference of 2d. in the price of beef here and in the British market.  How then can Senator Counihan contend that the annuities are being paid twice.  It would appear from the figures that the tariffs imposed by the British Government are not being paid in full by the people of this country but are being paid partly by British consumers.  There is a good deal of ground for that belief.  The main plank of the opponents of protection here is that protection would increase the cost of living and that prices would go up.  If tariffs are put on here, and if that means an increase in the price of imported articles, surely tariffs would have the same effect in <Col N="637" /> England.  Obviously British consumers must be paying portion of the duty that the British Government imposed on Irish produce.  In addition to the prices quoted by Senator Counihan that is another argument to show that the annuities have not been paid already to the British Government. That is the way it strikes me.</P>
    <P>The housing programme of the Government has been one of the most successful schemes initiated by it, and has done a great deal of good.  Going through the villages one regrets that there has been no system of town planning, and no ingenuity displayed by Irish architects in the planning of houses.  What we see are poor imitations of British architectural culture, and in some cases hideous types of German architecture are introduced. Surely we have culture of our own, and we have architects who are capable of thinking for themselves instead of being poor imitators of what is done in other countries.  It is time for the Government to intervene, and to ensure that we are not creating slum areas where some of the new houses have been erected.  I have been told that these new houses are being relet on a large scale all over the country, and that in some cases two, three and four families live in them. If that is the case, or if it is allowed, we will find that the last position will be worse than the first, and that the erection of the new houses will have had no effect by way of improvement on the housing question.  Families put into new houses should not, under any circumstances, be allowed to sublet.  A family can be reared in the new houses under proper conditions, instead of having, as in the past, to exist in congested and filthy surroundings.  Steps should be taken to see that there is no overcrowding in these new houses.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say also with regard to a question which has been raised here in the House for the last couple of years, the matter of the broadcasting, that it is considerably improved. It has been highly satisfactory indeed, since the new Director took it over and certainly, if he continues to make the same progress during the next 12 months as he has since taking over, <Col N="638" /> there is no doubt but we will have a station that we can feel proud of and to the programmes of which listeners in foreign countries can tune in.  I hope the Minister for Finance, in view of his success, will be encouraged to be more generous to the Director in order to make the programmes better in culture and outlook so that they will raise the prestige of the Irish people abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Very discordant.  I was just going to give to the House, as an example, the inference which he drew from the leading article in the <i>Irish Times</i> with regard to the future of our cattle trade in Britain.  I do not know whether in the estimation of the Minister, Mr. J.H. Thomas or the editor of the <i>Irish Times</i> stands higher as being the more acceptable from the point of view of the future policy of Britain in regard to the cattle trade of this country, but in April last in the British House of Commons, Mr. Thomas replied to a question by Major Ross of Derry who asked if the Minister would be able to make compensatory restrictions in view of the increase in the quantity of cattle exported from the Free State under the Coal-Cattle Pact.  Mr. Thomas replied: &ldquo;I do not agree,&rdquo; and he went on to say that &ldquo;the restriction with regard to the Irish Free State is a restriction due to political reasons,&rdquo; and to say that he hoped, and the Minister for Finance here has the same hope, that when a settlement is arrived at there will be an entirely different figure.  I do not accept the statement about the increase in the number of cattle from the Irish Free State under the coal-cattle agreement because I think it is a satisfactory arrangement.  That is the point of view of the Ministry in the British <Col N="639" /> House of Commons as expressed by Mr. Thomas and it represents the views even of Mr. Elliot.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult to discuss an Appropriation Bill without making reference to the Government policy and to that particular aspect of it about which, I believe, every responsible citizen is thinking, if he is frank about his thoughts.  It does not matter whether it be the Minister for Finance, the President of the Executive Council or the leaders of the Opposition in the other House or the right or left here, we are all intimately concerned as to when there will be another definition with regard to the relationship of this country with Britain which will re-establish those relations which the Minister for Finance and Mr. J.H. Thomas hope will be brought about in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Act which goes through the Oireachtas bears a particular flavour because of the relationship between this country and England, and, while it is pleasant and satisfactory to have the Minister expressing to-day the view which he expressed, I might point out that it was expressed by him not for the first time to-day, but on a few occasions in the past and that it gave a certain amount of hope to many of our people that there were to be changed conditions.  While it is encouraging to have that view, and while it is just as helpful to have the British Ministry state their views, what we and the common people of the country want to know is when are these hopes and desires going to be translated into action?  When?  Who is going to take the next step?  What is the next step going to be?  The Minister, in his Budget statement, referred to what other countries were doing&mdash;the strife and the war and all that sort of thing.  Strife and war and conflict can be waged in different forms, and you can have a war of attrition carried on that need not necessarily spill blood on the streets, highways, or fields, but it can leave men and women and children with wan, pale faces and bloodless cheeks. <Col N="640" /> Such a war is even more disastrous for a nation's future than the short, sharp conflict that will mean death and the grave for perhaps a few, but will leave something to the others when it is over whereby they can carry on.</P>
    <P>It would be more satisfactory if the country could be told by the Minister to-day or by some other responsible Minister, that positive, definite steps were being taken on his behalf to change the situation and to alter the relationship between this country and England.  If we are to assume that both countries are to stand pat, this situation may continue for goodness knows how long.  How long?  How many years?  At the end of that time, economically, politically, and even socially there will be changes&mdash;altered conditions here, anyhow, whatever about England&mdash;and, eventually, terms will be arrived at.  To-day, we cannot even visualise what they might be under changed conditions, but no one here, certainly no one on this side, certainly not I, nor, I am sure, any member of our Party, wants an arrangement made with England that would have the slightest tinge of surrender of the nation's rights and in the spirit and atmosphere of this House and in the manner in which the Minister has addressed himself to the points raised, he is not going to make any allegation to the contrary. I realise he can be human, like all of us, when he is not stirred up by some of the feelings which all mortals display at times.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House desire to see peace made between this country and England by means only that would not mean a surrender of the nation's rights, but we are concerned when it is going to be made.  We believe it can be made, and, at the same time, we see no action, no visible action at least, being taken here or in England to bring it to a conclusion. It may be that our people feel that they cannot make an arrangement that will not be a surrender.  I wonder what are Britain's feelings?  To me it seems that there never was a Treaty made between two peoples, unless <Col N="641" /> between victor and vanquished, that did not mean some surrender on both sides.  A treaty made between two nations means that each party has to yield up something of what they regarded as their just claims, and no arrangement can be made without surrender of something which will be regarded by this country or by England as a share of its just rights.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that if our Government and this State do not see a way out of the present <i>impasse</i>, if all efforts up to the present have yielded only the dried fruits which we see, other action ought to be taken by them.  Senator Milroy has referred to the international situation with regard to Italy and Abyssinia.  We are members of the League of Nations and if we cannot settle this dispute with England, which is, from the point of view of our Government, an international dispute, I cannot see why we cannot do as other nations have done&mdash; present our note to the League of Nations and invoke the intervention of the League to bring the present situation to an end.  There is not going to be any surrender of our rights in doing that and if there is justice in our case as we claim, it can be put to the test.  Our people at the end will at least know the worst.</P>
    <P>Certainly, it does seem that some action other than along the present lines ought to be taken.  The present line that is being pursued, the desire of the Ministry and the hope that the present dispute is going to end sometime, and that this is only a temporary phase through which we will pass, is not satisfactory.  It is creating an unhappy condition throughout the country and the disquieting circumstances to which it is giving rise, particularly among the farming community, are something which I believe the Ministry ought to take more cognisance of than I believe they are doing.  Whatever they do, whatever efforts they make, internationally or otherwise, to seek to define future relationship between Ireland and England, every peace effort they make will have the wholehearted support and backing of every rightminded citizen in the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="642" /> Senator MacEllin in his more reasonable moments will agree with me, I think, that farming in this country is passing through a very trying period. The truth is that the seriousness of the situation for the farmer is not being exaggerated and could not be exaggerated.  It is all very fine to say there are substitutes for the production of beef and cattle.  There is no substitute at all in this country in the way of another line of pursuit for farmers comparable to what they got from the production of beef and cattle. Wheat and beet have been spoken of. Beet has been made possible under the present circumstances, because the predecessors of the present Government experimented, and experimented at very great cost to the taxpayers. Senator Johnson referred to the fact that the Minister's policy and idea were aimed at prosperity for the very great majority of farmers who live on the smaller farms.  I could not agree with the truth of that suggestion. Senator Johnson used to be better informed as to the condition of the farmer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the aim.  It may be the intention, but their methods are not bringing it about. The people best off to-day are the people on the best land, but it would be the greatest possible mistake, and it is an error into which members of the Government should not fall, to say that farmers are going to make money by growing wheat or beet. I have figures here from a member of the Oireachtas who is a farmer himself and a beet grower, and his costs show that for an acre of beet supplied to the factory last year, taking the average of ten tons to the acre, which was the factory's own figure, at the price of 37/6 per ton, that farmer would get £18 15s. for his acre, and it would cost £18 10s. to produce it.  That takes into account artificial manures, at £4, thinning and singling, at £2 10/-, raising and pulling, at £2 10/-, delivery to the factory, at £4, ploughing, <Col N="643" /> tilling, rent, rates and farmyard manure.  We have the report by a committee of agriculture that, in an experiment of wheat growing, an acre of wheat yielded £9 9/6, while the cost of production was £7 17/-.  That experiment took place on average land and it gave a profit of £1 12/-.  There was never much money in agriculture in this country except for a limited number of farmers who had good land, who were keen businessmen and were near good markets.  Whatever you may say about beet and wheat, there is not a farmstead in Ireland where there is not a cow and a calf.  The farmer-Senators on the Government benches know that.  We shall never see the day when we shall be able to say that there is wheat and beet on every farm in the country.  We ought to remember that the cattle trade was the big trade and that this was a country of flocks and herds away back in the fifth and sixth centuries. I believe that the cattle trade will come back to a position in which there will be a reasonable profit left for the producer.</P>

I do not think that there is any political value to be got out of anything that Senators may say in this House.  We try to look at the problems <Col N="644" /> with which we have to deal from a different angle from that from which a member of a political party would ordinarily look at them.  That is my attitude, and I think it is the attitude generally of Senators on these benches. Senator Wilson and the other Senators on these benches who spoke on the Appropriation Bill did not deal with matters from a political angle.  I am trying to look at this question as one that confronts the country as a whole. I appeal to the Minister to try to stand away from the situation which has developed out of the past&mdash;out of the civil war and the aftermath of the civil war.  Farmers were producing against a falling market over a period of years and that market has continued to fall.  Before the advent of the present Government, some of us spoke very loudly and strongly about that position.  Senator MacEllin says that the farmers are not paying anything which they are not bound to pay.  It is true that the law of the State demands that the farmers pay half their annuities to the Irish Government. What is the real situation? Up to the second or third month of this year, Britain had collected from us in penal tariffs £11,757,000.  At the same time, the farmers were expected to pay to their own Government £2,000,000 a year for three years&mdash; approximately £6,000,000.  I do not think that the Government got all that but that is the figure.  If there had been no change in the position after the advent of the Government and if we had continued transmitting our annuities to England, the total which we would have sent in the same period would have been £8,877,000.  The President himself admits that the British Government have collected from us £11,757,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>We pay our share of the taxes which go to make up the £6,000,000 for bounties.  The Exchequer is trying to get from the farmers half the annuities for the same period, which amounts to £6,000,000.  In addition, the British Government collects £11,000,000.  If we had continued to send the annuities, we should only have paid £8,000,000.  Let us assume that we paid £6,000,000 in bounties and that the farmers will not pay a penny in tax towards that £6,000,000.  Surely it must be accepted that there is justice in the case of a farmer who says he is paying much more than he ought to pay&mdash;that he is paying twice.  I do not grow beet but I grow some wheat, though not much.  It is my experience and the experience of my neighbours, every one of whom is an intelligent, industrious farmer, that, after paying annuities and rates, we are unable to maintain the standard of comfort that we maintained up to a few years ago. There are farmers who have other means, farmers who put money by in the past and are drawing on that money.  I am speaking of the average <Col N="646" /> farmer.  I am not speaking of farmers like Senator Wilson, who is able to turn his hand from one thing to another.  He can go into dairying and get a much better price for his milk than I can get.  He can get from 1/6 to 10d. a gallon for his milk, whereas I can get only 3½d.  I am the ordinary farmer of the country.  My farm could not do what I say other farms are failing to do.  It could not pay rates and rent and keep the people who are living on it up to the standard of decency they maintained before the economic war, and I am getting as much off my farm as is being got off any farm of equal size not only in that county but in the country.  I would not make statements like that in this House or elsewhere if they were not based on personal experience.  These things are written down against one. Senators, like Senator Johnson, will turn them up six or seven years hence and point to what one said in certain circumstances.  Of course, they are perfectly entitled to do that.  If the situation be as I say, then it ought to be considered by the Minister.  The Minister should forget for the moment that certain unhappy things are taking place in some parts of the country and realise that, in counties like my own county, people are striving hard on poor land to meet difficulties that they did not expect to experience at the present time.  If the problem were approached in that way, I believe the situation would be different from what it is.  The Minister and his Party should put aside the view that the non-payment of annuities is allied with what they consider a political campaign and try to see the situation as it presents itself to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quirke may say that I am misrepresenting the position.  Only a week ago, when I was in the hay-field at 9 o'clock, a girl of about 30 years of age came to me with a process for £8 for annuities.  She was to appear in the court to-day.  The feelings of that girl were really indescribable. She wanted to know what she could do or what advice I could give her.  I advised her to go to the sheriff and say she was not able to pay.  She has produce which is hardly fit for the <Col N="647" /> market.  If the value of that were realised, it would not meet the demand.  A problem like that requires something other than an argument based on political prejudice.  I have enough confidence in the Minister's sense of justice to believe that he would be prepared to look at this situation from an angle different from that from which he has regarded it up to the present.  It can be argued that, if the annuities are not paid, a serious position will be created for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I realise the difficulties that may have to be faced, if men cease paying their annuities, when the effort is made to collect them again.  I think that could be overcome. I think that a united effort on the part of good citizens could overcome that situation. I believe myself that a united effort on the part of good citizens is required to-day to overcome this present situation, and if the Minister has difficulties because of the lack of security which non-payment of annuities might create for him, it ought not to be beyond the power of the Oireachtas to get itself away from that situation.  If it were essential that we should have a secret session of the whole Oireachtas, both Dáil and Seanad combined, to discuss this whole matter and thrash it out with a view to seeing in what way the situation could be met other than the way the Minister proposes, I believe that great good would come from such action as that.  The spirit displayed by the leaders of the Government would go a very long way in altering the spirit and outlook of the people in this country.  After all, they are the people who have the power.  They have power over life and death.  They can make property valuable or valueless. All that is taking place.</P>
    <P>I am not unsympathetic with the Minister in his difficulties.  I appreciate the fact that no Minister in a country like this, and under present conditions, can carry on if there is not sympathy and understanding; but the Minister also, in his way, feels called upon to present his side of the <Col N="648" /> case and ask for that same understanding. In his Budget speech, he pointed to the fact that, later on this year, he was going to ask the support of the people for a conversion scheme, which he will attempt to carry through on the 1st December.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have control of sufficient resources to enable us to undertake the operation with every prospect of success, provided we are sure of the co-operation, which I am sure will not be withheld, of all sections of the people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I urge very strongly that the action the Minister would take on a problem like this, which is much more deep-seated and more serious than, possibly, he can apprehend, would have considerable influence on the success of the Minister's efforts in his conversion scheme later on.  I believe it would do a great deal to re-establish that peace which is absolutely essential for the success of any financial undertaking of any Minister for Finance in any country.  It would do much more, however.  It would re-create another spirit that the country very badly needs and no one, I believe, has more power, or is in a stronger position to play a part or give a lead, than the Minister for Finance himself.  In view of the spirit displayed in the discussions here, and, indeed, the spirit displayed generally, I think that the Minister ought to put his best foot foremost and indicate to the House and to the country that, whatever be the rights or wrongs of the matter, or whatever may be thought of the actions which some people have taken&mdash;actions for which no responsible person would like to stand&mdash;he realises that there is a bigger problem to be faced, and, recognising that the solution of that bigger problem may pave a way to the solution of other problems, he should indicate that he is going to give a lead that the country wants very badly.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 2, sub-section (1).  To delete all from the word &ldquo;fourteen&rdquo; in line 48 down to the end of line 53, inclusive, and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;sixteen years except in the case of a child over fourteen years of age employed as a wage-earner under any contract of service or apprenticeship either expressed or implied when the expression means the age (not under fourteen years) at which such child becomes so employed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It looks as though it would be advisable to have this meeting of the Seanad on the Commitee Stage of this Bill in a small ante-room.  We might be able to deal with the Minister more effectively if we had a small room with this size of an audience to discuss the matter over a table.  The definition section of the Bill includes a definition <Col N="652" /> of the expression &ldquo;the appointed age,&rdquo; and the appointed age, when used in relation to a child, means the age of 14 years, except in the case of a child who goes to school after that age for full-time instruction in a day school, in which case the appointed age is 16 years.  The amendment seeks to make the appointed age 16 years except in the case of a child who is sent out to work.  The amendment is in conformity with the recommendations of the Committee on which the insurance side of this Bill is founded, and it seems to fit in much more reasonably with the requirements.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to bear in mind the point that I made on the Second Reading of the Bill, that this Bill has two separate parts; that is to say, an insurance part and a State assistance part.  This definition, I would point out, will apply, not merely to the State assistance side, but to the insurance side; that is to say, that when the transitory period is passed the appointed age of 14 will continue even when insurance proper is in effect.  If we allow the expression &ldquo;fourteen years&rdquo; to remain in the Bill, that certainly will add to the assumption that the policy behind the Bill is to continue the practice of sending children out to work at that age. Now the policy of the Government, in other aspects, tends towards raising the age at which children will be sent out to work, and if we are to assume that the intention of the Government in this matter, in dealing with children, is to raise the age at which they will be sent out to work, then the definition in the Bill presupposes an interregnum during which there would be no allowance payable in respect of a child.  I think it would be in accordance with every idea that the Government have given expression to, to provide that where the child is not at work 16 years should be the age.</P>
    <P>The proposition in the Bill is that if a child is attending full-time instruction in a day school the allowance will be payable for such a child up to the age of 16.  But we have the problem in the mass of cases of how to keep children at school up <Col N="653" /> to 16 years when there is no provision in the education scheme for doing so due to the fact that the schools are not capable of taking them. There are many difficulties in maintaining the position if we want to insist upon children being at school up to 16.  One is that there will have to be a great many administrative changes.</P>
    <P>The point that I want to insist upon is that we ought not to let it go out under the cover of his Bill that the Oireachtas, following the lead of the Ministry, assumes that the normal course of a child's life will be to leave school at 14 and to go out and earn. If that is not the intention of the Oireachtas, then we should say that the child who is not at work will be deemed to be a child for the purposes of this Act until he or she reaches the age of 16.  That is the case that I have to make in favour of the amendment. Again, I would point out that this definition applies, not only to those children who come under the provisions of the non-contributory part, but also to those who come within the provisions of the contributory part and that, I submit, is an important point when considering the definition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Seán T. O Ceallaigh) Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Seán T. O Ceallaigh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Seán T. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important, as Senator Johnson says, to bear in mind that this definition takes into account the insurance side of this Bill as well as the non-contributory side.  It was on the actuary's figures that were given to us when drafting the Bill that the finances of the measure, as presented, were arranged.  If the change which the Senator proposes in his amendment were accepted it would alter the financial structure of the Bill.  It would alter both the insurance side and the non-contributory side.  It would radically affect the Bill, and it would add, I am sure, a considerable amount to the cost.  Provision for that additional cost has not been made in this year's Budget.  The school-leaving age at present is 14.  The law of the land is that children must go to school until they are 14 years of age.  This Bill only takes into account the actual state of the law.  It does not seek to alter <Col N="654" /> it.  There will be no new declaration by the Oireachtas in so far as this Bill is concerned.  If the Bill, as it stands at present, is passed, it simply adopts the law as it is, and directs the House to enact this legislation in accordance with that law.  What Senator Johnson says about the school-leaving age and the difficulty of changing it is, of course, quite true.  I know that the present Government has given consideration and is giving consideration to having the question of raising the school-leaving age examined.  It is not alone from the economic but from other points of view that many people &mdash;some of them sound educationists&mdash; think that it would be better to have the school-leaving age raised to 16.  I suggest that until there has been a decision to change the law we ought not to change it in the indirect way suggested here.  It is an indirect way to change the law or, at any rate, to a certain extent the principle behind it.  It would also have the effect of upsetting the basis of the finances of the Bill which have been arranged on an actuarial basis in so far as the insurance portion of this Bill in particular is concerned.</P>

      <P>Section 2, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;attainment&rdquo; in line 51 to insert the words &ldquo;or who on attaining that age is precluded from receiving such full-time instruction because of physical or mental infirmity.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will agree to accept this amendment which I consider is a very reasonable one.  The Bill provides that pensions shall be paid in respect of children up to 14 years or if a child is in full-time attendance at school up to the age of 16. This amendment provides that if a child because of physical or mental infirmity is unable to attend full-time at school between 14 and 16 years of age the mother will not be deprived of the pension.  I am sure that on consideration the Minister will accept it.  If a child between 14 and 16 years <Col N="655" /> of age is unable to attend school because of illness surely the allowance in respect of the child will not be taken away.  I think the amendment is reasonable and that the Minister will accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not easy for me to combat every amendment on the Order Paper that appears reasonable. There are some that strike a sympathetic chord in my heart and that I should like to accept.  There are others which I do not regard with the same amount of sympathy.  If there is one that I should like to include in the Bill it would be an amendment of this kind.  But again the Bill is very largely an Insurance Bill and it has been drafted on insurance principles.  It has not been drafted with regard to disability or infliction.  It is a Pensions Bill and the benefits determined for widowhood and orphanhood, if I may use the word, have not any relation to afflicted children.  There are other ways of dealing with children who are afflicted. Provision is made by the State in various ways for such children, some may say not all the provision that there should be made, but some is made, and the probability is that in time better provision will be made for such afflicted children.  There are children who at the age of 15 or 16, though suffering from disabilities, are in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While, as I say, I view this with sympathy, I find difficulty in accepting anything that would add to the cost, at any rate so far as this year is concerned, of this Bill.  As I said on the Second Reading, I do not take the same view as some do, that we ought to have waited and brought in a Bill with more generous financial provision in various ways.  I fought for this Bill and got it through, even in times of financial stress, on the plea that we could work it, at any rate for some time, within a certain amount.  Having got sanction so far for it and for the various commitments contained in it, I am loth to go back even for a case that I have sympathy with and demand <Col N="656" /> more money that I doubt would be forthcoming this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's emphasis upon provision for this year, I wonder if he would accept this amendment dated from next year. If he would not, then that particular defence against this amendment falls. Frankly, I thought that this was merely filling up a gap which, inadvertently, had crept into the definition. I did not imagine it possible that the Minister would decline to accept the amendment, which brings within the definition of children those from 14 to 16 years who are not able to go to school because of mental infirmity.  Let us leave out physical infirmity for the moment and argue it on the basis of mental infirmity.</P>
      <P>One knows that there are not very large numbers who are going to be brought in by this amendment but there will be some and it is in regard to those few that the unjust and unreasonable feature of the definition as drafted would show itself.  The parent would like to send the child to school; possibly it is done in a country town.  Possibly the mental affliction did not show sufficiently to ensure that the child should be sent to a home, but as soon as that child becomes 14 years of age the 3/6 a week is to be stopped from the mother. I am not speaking of the preliminary conditions alone but of insurance conditions. The widow has been receiving, say, 3/6 per week in respect of the child.  It arrives at 14 years of age, and if she could arrange with the school teachers to take the child then she would continue to get her allowance in respect of that child, but if that is not possible and she has to keep the child she is going to lose the allowance which is paid to her in respect of that child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the House to take the responsibility from the Minister.  Let us appreciate the Minister's position and say to the Dáil: &ldquo;This at least we ask you to do to remedy a defect in the Bill.&rdquo;  I think it is a most reasonable amendment, that it would cost very little and would prevent happening a great deal of injustice. <Col N="657" /> I must say that I think the Minister would be glad to be overborne on this point by the House.</P>

      <P>On the definition of this full-time instruction in a day school, I wonder has the Minister examined the efficacy of this definition. It seems to me to be a little unsatisfactory. A day school is not defined but I dare say in the education code what it means is understood.  We are developing trade preparatory schools and technical schools, some of which are conducted during the day time. I am wondering whether within this definition a boy or girl who goes to such an educational institution or school would be deemed to be undergoing full-time instruction in a day school.  I raise that point with the Minister to draw his attention to it. If he has not examined it closely I wish he would do so with the intention that it will include all children who attend full time schools of any kind provided it includes tuition at school and their study after school; that is to say, that they are not sent out to work.  I take it to be the intention here that tuition at a vocational school, a trade preparatory school or such like, will be treated as instruction in a day school.</P>

      <P>I desire to draw the attention of the Minister to cases of great hardship that are not dealt with in the Bill.  I refer to cases where the mother is dead and where the father is a worthless type, with whom nothing can be done except to put him into jail.  The children in such cases are often worse off than children whose father is dead but whose mother is alive.  The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, with which I am connected in a small way, is in touch with many cases where there is terrible destitution and poverty amongst poor children whose mothers are dead.  It seems hard to exclude such cases from a Bill of this kind.  The father of these children is generally a worthless scoundrel, for whom there is no treatment except to keep him in jail, because the children are worse off when he is not there.  Another type of case is one where the mother is dead and the father is a bankrupt and is going to be kept an undischarged bankrupt.  A case of that kind was brought to my notice concerning respectable children who were brought up in refined circumstances while the mother was alive, and who have nothing before them now but to be sent to industrial schools.  If a little help was given to their relations perhaps it would save the children from the fate of having to be sent to industrial schools.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 5, sub-section (2).  To insert before the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="659" /> (2)  For the purpose of this Act an employed contributor shall be deemed to be an insured person for a period of thirty months after the last date on which contributions under this Act are paid in respect of his insurable employment.</P>
    <P>The case I want to make is this: that a man might have been insured from 25 to 30 years, and during that period may have paid contributions for national health insurance purposes, and may have been fortunate enough not to have suffered any illness and never to have received one penny for all these contributions.  It may happen that he was then unfortunate enough to have lost his employment and not to secure other employment. He would then go out of insurance after a certain period, and if he died his widow and orphans would be deprived of the full benefits of the contributory scheme.  That seems to me to be a great hardship on the dependents of a man who was in employment during the best part of his life, and who then lost it through no fault of his own.  There should be some period of grace given from the last date on which national health insurance has been paid.  There is a tremendous difference for the widow and orphans in the benefits to be obtained under the contributory scheme and the non-contributory scheme, as to whether or not at the time of death he was what was known as an insured contributor under national health insurance.</P>
    <P>I referred to this matter on the Second Reading and also to the payment of arrears.  Under present conditions if a person had one or two stamps on a card at the beginning of the contribution year he would be entitled at the end of that year to pay the arrears of contributions at a reduced rate, and therefore would be entitled in the next benefit year to be in full benefit for national health insurance purposes.  Some consideration must be given to this important point, because, for all practical purposes, in a case of that type the man was in insurable employment practically all <Col N="660" /> his life and continued to pay national health insurance contribution.  A fair period of grace should be allowed during which time that person would be considered a national health insurance contributor, so that, in the event of death, his widow and orphans would be treated as if he had remained an insured contributor.  I know that a limit must be drawn.  I think we ought to be able to arrive at what would be a fair limit.  The Minister knows that a tremendous hardship will be entailed by the administration of this Bill on the widow and orphans of a man who a year or two prior to his death may have lost his employment. If the Minister is not prepared to accept this suggestion of 30 months, perhaps he would consider the matter before the Report Stage.  Regulations will have to be made defining the arrears. The Bill provides that during three years prior to the death of the contributor 26 stamps will have to be paid, but it does not say if that person would be entitled to pay up the arrears of contributions in order to have the required number of stamps. I have been a trade union official for a great number of years, and I was one of the first secretaries of a National Health Insurance Society. As such I administered the Act, and from my experience of the difficulties that arise some consideration must be given to the question of arrears, and as to whether an insured contributor would be entitled to pay off some of these arrears.  As this is very important I am asking the Minister to agree to consider it, or to give an opportunity for consultation.  The National Health Insurance regulations with regard to arrears of contributions will have to be altered in order to comply with the provisions of this Bill.  I urge the Minister to give the question earnest consideration.  If he is prepared to do so, the amendment could be left over until the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>There is something to be said for the point of view put forward by Senator Farren, but one would imagine from his speech that no provision is made to give some time to <Col N="661" /> people who fall out of employment.  A period of 12 months' grace is already given in the National Health Insurance Act, and that applies to the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill, which is based on the national health insurance law as it stands.  No matter what period of grace is given, even at the end of five years, you might find that some cases of hardship could be brought up.  The question of arrears does not come under this section. It comes on later.  It is a question about which difficulties have arisen under national health insurance.  The question of the free period of a year arises.  The Senator suggests 30 months.  I think 12 months is a reasonable amount of time.  Of course there are ways in which the difficulties suggested by Senator Farren might be got over, and a person who is out of employment might possibly become a voluntary contributor.  Apart from this, under the national health insurance scheme, it will be necessary in the next 12 months to revise and recast the regulations, when the question of arrears will be one of the big questions that will have to be gone into.  Whatever affects national health insurance in the free year will affect widows' and orphans' pensions.  Perhaps the Senator would agree to leave the matter over.  I will certainly agree to consult with the different organisations concerned when the question of the arrears period in national health insurance is being revised and reconsidered.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 7.</P>
      <P>(2)  In this Act the expression &ldquo;urban area&rdquo; means any urban district (not being a county borough), the population of which (as shown by the census of population which is for the time being the latest such census) exceeds seven thousand.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7, sub-section (2).  To <Col N="662" /> delete the words &ldquo;urban district&rdquo; in lines 41-42 and to substitute therefor the word &ldquo;town&rdquo; and to delete the word &ldquo;seven&rdquo; in line 44 and to substitute therefor the word &ldquo;two.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with the classification of towns.  It is another definition section, if I might say so. For the purpose of this Bill a rural area would include Dungarvan, Enniscorthy, Killarney, Nenagh, New Ross, Thurles, Ballinasloe, Ballina and a dozen other towns.  It does not seem to mean very much, saying it that way, but it means a good deal in the administration of the non-contributory scheme.  I am sure the answer the Minister will make will be that, because it means a good deal, it is so classified.  We are asked to assume in passing this section as it stands that a widow in one of the towns I have mentioned is in a better position to provide for herself and her children, on a lower weekly allowance, than a widow in towns like Clonmel, Carlow and Athlone.  I cannot see that that kind of definition or classification has any justification at all and I would very much rather see that towns over 7,000 in population but which are not county boroughs, would be classified with the smaller towns up to 2,000, and the smaller towns get the benefit of the funds that would be available for the larger towns, that is to say, funds should be pooled, and whatever sum is now allocated to the larger towns should be spread over the whole. This classification for the purposes of the Act runs counter to the general scheme of local government administration and I cannot see that there is any justification for it at all.</P>
    <P>I again draw attention to the fact that if one takes the number of widows in the country, whether necessitous or not, according to the census returns, these rural areas including the towns I have spoken of, really comprise 76 per cent. of the country as a whole.  That may be subject to some modification if one takes only necessitous widows, but one may speak in terms of three-fourths of this Bill having effect on the scale applicable to the rural areas.  I am asking the <Col N="663" /> Minister and the House to agree that the rural areas shall comprise only purely rural areas and towns of 2,000 and less.  It would seem to be a more logical kind of classification inasmuch as it approximates to the local government scheme as a whole, not perhaps precisely so, but nevertheless, much nearer the facts than the scheme of this Bill.  I move the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not like to be harping always on the basis upon which the Bill is drafted, but, unfortunately, I have to do that.  The Bill as it stands brings in 12 urban areas with a population of roughly about 124,000 people.  The amendment suggested by Senator Johnson will bring in an additional 61 urban areas with a population of 214,000, and that would be a serious upset to the financial arrangement we have proposed in the Bill.  I cannot give anything like an accurate estimate of what the additional cost would be, but it would be very considerable on the basis of the amendment of Senator Johnson, and I do suggest that in these small towns&mdash; take Enniscorthy, one of the towns that Senator Johnson suggested, a town that I happen to know a little of; I do not happen to know the other towns he mentioned so well&mdash;that the life there and the scale of living does approximate to a rural area pretty well.  I think that on the basis of the Bill as it stands it is not doing an injustice to these people.  It is possible that there might be a greater injustice done in the other way.  I am afraid I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 9 and in Part I of the Bill to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>9.&mdash;Sections six, ten and twelve <Col N="664" /> of this Act shall be construed and have effect subject to the provisions that</P>
    <P>(a)  any person aggrieved by the decision of the Minister in any matter decided by him under the said sections may appeal from that decision in the High Court, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the Minister may, if he thinks fit, instead of himself deciding any such question, refer the question for decision to the High Court.</P>
    <P>This, I think, raises a matter of principle.  There are certain sections, Nos. 6, 10, and 12, which deal with the possibility that there may be disputes as to whether a person is in agricultural employment or not.  But bear in mind that the scheme of the Bill provides a differential in the rate of contribution of a person in agricultural employment and the rate of pension applicable to such person in the case of widows and children.  Section 6, for instance, defines agricultural employment, but if any question arises as to whether any particular employment is agricultural, then the Minister shall decide.</P>
    <P>This question applies to insurance, not merely to the non-contributory part of this Bill.  There is a definite rate of contribution towards the insurance side, and there is a definite rate of pension as between the applicant and the fund.  It is provided that when a dispute arises as to what category a person shall be in, the Minister shall decide.  The proposition is that if the person aggrieved by the decision of the Minister wishes, he may appeal to the High Court or if the Minister has any qualms as to what the true interpretation is, he may, if he wishes, refer the matter to the High Court for decision.  I think the amendment is in accord with the Health Insurance Acts and as this Bill is going to be administered by the health insurance people very largely, and is part of a general code of insurance, it is desirable there should be some harmony between the different insurance schemes as to the relations of the insured persons and the paying authority; who is to decide the category in which the <Col N="665" /> person shall be placed, in the first case, what he shall contribute and in the second case, what pension shall be paid.</P>
    <P>In Section 10 a somewhat similar point arises as to whether employment is normally agricultural, and that is one of the cases that would probably be more difficult to decide. I do not know how this is going to be administered, if I may say so, incidentally. When is the decision to be made as to what kind of employment the person is engaged in if there is any difference of opinion?  Is it at the time he is paying his contribution or is it when the matter of pensions is under discussion?  If the person has been paying a contribution of 4d. on the understanding that he is in agricultural employment, or&mdash;shall I put it the other way?&mdash;if he is paying 8d. of a contribution on the understanding that he is not in agricultural employment and when the question of pension arises, may the Minister decide that he was engaged in agricultural employment and is so only entitled to the agricultural pension?</P>
    <P>There is plenty of room there for conflict and as between the paying-out authority, which, we will say, is the Minister, and the applicant, surely it is not reasonable to say that the last word should rest with the Minister and that it should not be possible for the applicant, if he feels aggrieved as to the Minister's decision, to have recourse to the High Court.  That is the amendment that is down and it seems to be reasonable.  It is in conformity with the Health Insurance and Unemployment Insurance laws and, I think, should be incorporated in this particular Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will be agreed that on Sections 6, 10 and 12, to which this amendment of Senator Johnson's refers, the questions likely to arise under one of these sections are not questions of law, but questions of fact&mdash;is the person in agricultural employment, or is he not?  It would be better in the interests of the person concerned to leave the determination of this question of fact to the official in the Department.  The Minister, of <Col N="666" /> course, is in the Bill, but it very rarely happens under the Old Age Pensions Acts that any question is referred to him.  It would have to be out of the ordinary, and very unusual before it would come to me.  The same type of decision has to be made in the old age pensions section every week of their lives by the officials who decide old age pension questions.  They have to decide questions of fact.  They do not regard them from a strictly legal viewpoint, as would happen if the questions went to the courts, for the courts are bound by the law in a strictly legal sense.</P>
      <P>It is my experience, and it was before I became a Minister, that the decisions of the officials dealing with old age pensions are humanitarian decisions.  They are not bound around with red tape.  We know they are civil servants, but they are experienced and are not hide-bound in these matters.  They meet people who go in to discuss these questions with them. There is not a day in the year when there is not some Deputy or Senator in discussing these matters of pensions with the Appeals Board.  The same would apply here, and I think a decision would be given more in the interest of the individual, and not on very strict legal lines, bound as the judges in the courts naturally are.  For the benefit of all concerned, I think it would be wiser to leave the legal High Court decision out of it and to leave it to the officials to administer with the spirit of liberality and a humanitarian outlook.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that is perfectly true in regard to the bulk of individual cases, but I have in mind the kind of case that will be taken as a test case in respect of a group of types or classes.  Assuming that everything the Minister says about the breadth of view and the generous treatment of the applicants in these cases is correct, and I am not for a moment inclined to dispute it, the probability in some cases and the possibility in many cases is that the Minister's advisers will be inclined to say that this particular class or group is agricultural employment or is not agricultural <Col N="667" /> employment, as the case may be. We are not speaking entirely without some precedent in mind.  Under some of the Acts there have been disputes, and there are disputes pending, as to whether employment is agricultural employment, is exempted employment, or is not exempted employment.  The Minister has decided against the applicant, and appeals are being made to the courts for the purpose of getting their decisions.  As a matter of fact, the appeal to the Minister has been ineffective.  That is to say, what the applicants believed to be provided for by the law is contradicted by the Minister.  In this case, it was not the Minister for Local Government who was concerned; it was another Minister. There are other instances where, knowing there is a possibility of appeal, the Minister's view undergoes some modification.  That, again, is a factor that will weigh with the people concerned, especially where typical cases are being taken.  I should hope that there would never be occasion for appeal to the High Court.  The fact that provision was made for the possibility of appeal to the court in case of dispute between the paying authority and the insured person would be a certain protection and would give confidence.  Confidence is a big factor in these cases, and it is not always desirable, even from the point of view of the Minister, that he should be administrator of the law and the judge of what was legislatively intended. That, of course, is a vexed question on a much wider field than this.  I think we ought to keep in line, so far as we can, with the other sections of the social, ameliorative code of which this Bill will form part.  I have no confidence that the inclusion of this particular section will be of great benefit, but there is a certain principle involved which I think is desirable&mdash;that if there is dispute between the paying and the receiving authority, the claimant and the Minister, as to what class the individual is a member of, then the Minister, as the paying authority, should not be the person to make the final and irrevocable decision.</P>

      <P>A point raised by Senator Johnson is of some importance. That is the point as to the payments to be made and the stamps to be put on the cards.  Will some indication be given by the Department, on general lines, as to what is agricultural employment?  It is not at all clear from Section 6.  Take the case of a gardener who works three-quarter time in the garden and one-quarter time in the house.  Is he a domestic servant or is he in agricultural employment under this section?  There is a class of people employed by many householders&mdash;a class who work in the garden for the greater part of the week and who are used for domestic employment during the remainder of the week.  These and kindred cases may create difficulty.  Will it be possible to find out, from some general instruction issued by the Department, what stamps are to be put on in these cases? If people have to wait until the question of pension arises, it will be too late.  In the event of a misunderstanding and the wrong stamps being affixed, what will the position be?  If the payments are too small and the person is dead, will it mean that the pension cannot be paid to the widow? In the case where the pension is on the smaller scale, though the larger stamps were affixed, will the difference in the value of the stamps be made good to the widow, or will there be any other way of dealing with the matter?</P>

These regulations will be issued through the usual channels&mdash; the Post Office, Gardá stations, and the National Health Insurance Society. Every person insured for health purposes will get a copy of the leaflet. The issue mentioned by Deputy Douglas will have to be raised and there will have to be a method found to determine, at the outset, the classes of people who will be regarded as employed in agriculture or other occupations. There is another way at present of determining whether a <Col N="669" /> person is in agricultural employment or not&mdash;that is, whether or not the person is insurable under the Unemployment Insurance Act.  If a person is insurable under that Act, he is not engaged in agricultural employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have a point made clear on this section. The Minister has dealt with the question raised by Senator Douglas.  He says that regulations will give a general or precise indication as to what class of employment shall be deemed to be agricultural employment. I presume that persons engaged in other employments will have to pay contributions on the higher scale.  I do not see how justice will be done when the Minister on being applied to for a pension on the basis of nonagricultural contributions decides that the employment was agricultural employment&mdash;that is to say, 8d. has been paid, but only 4d. worth is to be given.  The Minister is to be asked to say that the widow of a person who, following a general direction in good faith, pays 8d. per week for years is to be paid her allowance on the basis of a 4d. contribution.  It seems to me that that problem ought to receive further consideration by the Minister and that some alteration in the Bill should be made before it leaves the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another problem on which the Minister may be able to throw some light.  &ldquo;Relevant period&rdquo; means in relation to a person who died on or after the date on which he <Col N="670" /> attained the age of 70 years, &ldquo;the period of three years immediately preceding the said date, but in calculating the said period of three years no account shall be taken of any unbroken period ending on the said date during which such person was incapable of work by reason of some specific disease or mental or bodily infirmity.&rdquo; I do not understand the position in the case of a person who was infirm for a year before death.  Is the broken period three years preceding that year or three years preceding the date of death?  On paragraph (b), the same question arises in relation to persons who died before attaining the age of 70.  Does the definition refer to three years immediately before the date of death or three years prior to the incapacity?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter which should be made clear.  I ask the Minister to look into it and to make clear that it is the three years before the date of incapacity which is to count.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not sufficiently clear, I shall look into the wording and have the matter clarified before Report Stage.  The intention is that the period should be three years prior to the date of incapacity.  With regard to the other point raised by Senator Johnson, I think that the interpretation by any Minister would be that if a person paid the higher rate of contribution&mdash;8d.&mdash;morally as well as legally his widow should be entitled to the full rate of pension. That would be my interpretation.</P>

      <P>Examination does not take place under the national health scheme until something happens.  In many cases there is not an inquiry except on the question of age or if the stamp is outside the normal category.  Taking the Minister's statement, any man whose stamp would be only 4d. because he was legally an agricultural labourer, could, nevertheless, by the operation of doubt or, possibly, by agreement with his employer, by putting on the higher stamps, get the benefit of the higher pension for his dependents if the occasion arose.  In that case, he would be endeavouring, by agreement, to get the larger benefit. From the point of view of strict insurance, that might not be unfair, but it might be held to be unfair in this case, as the State makes a contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>That could be done, but we have got to take into account the intention to defraud.  If it was clear that there was an intention to defraud the State, the larger benefit would not, I take it, be paid. It is correct, as Senator Douglas says, that these matters might not be decided until something had happened.  But the proportion of persons at present who are in national health insurance and who get benefit some time or another is very great.  The proportion of people who send in their cards claiming benefit and whose cases are examined is pretty high.  I cannot recall what the percentage of cases is, but in that way the numbers of people who, over a year, will claim benefit and whose cases will be examined by the officials of the National Health Insurance, who call and inquire into these cases&mdash;they inquire practically into every case of that kind&mdash;is pretty high.  Therefore, the number who would intentionally try to defraud and who would escape detection would not be very great.  Some cases, of course, would go through, but they would be a very small proportion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not speaking of an attempt to defraud, but of the problem of the agricultural labourer who, having been employed by a <Col N="672" /> farmer, and having his card stamped on a 4d. basis, then goes to work for a few weeks for a non-agriculturist and gets his card stamped with the 8d. stamp.  It is in that kind of in-and-out employment that I see the difficulty, and I should like to know whether it is intended that there shall be a different type of stamp, as I suppose there must be, and that the card will be stamped with, say, 15 nonagricultural stamps and 15 agricultural stamps, or some other number, and that, at the time of the application, the stamps for the relevant period will be examined and judgement come to on the basis of the stamps on the card.  That would seem to me to make the problem a very simple one, if the card, stamped in that way, were to be the evidence.  But if other factors are going to be brought into consideration, then the difference in the amount of the stamps, and the number of stamps of one valuation compared with the number of stamps of another valuation, that raises complications that I cannot see through at all.  I hope that the Minister will go into that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest that the Minister could really get over this difficulty by putting a small section in the Bill to provide that, in the event of it being found that claims were being made on stamps that had been put on over what need have been put on, a refund could be given to the widow. There would be no grievance there, and if it had been paid over a certain time, then the widow would have a small sum repaid to her and the employer would not be under a heavy loss either. I think that that would get over the difficulty.</P>

      <P>I can see great difficulties arising with regard to this particular matter.  Take County Dublin as an example.  Quite a number of men in County Dublin work for a certain period of the year on the roads, and during the period of work on the roads, being employed by the County Council, their cards would be stamped at the full rate of the additional 8d. These men, at certain periods of the <Col N="673" /> year, go around to the various farmers and work at threshings.  I think that is correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>They go from farmer to farmer and are engaged for a period of from two to three months going around from one place to the other, working at threshings and such work, and during these periods their stamps would be put on at the agricultural rate.  I can see great difficulty arising in determining how you are going to arrive at the proper value that should be placed on these stamps in the event of this man dying and his widow claiming a pension.  There is a real difficulty there.  I am speaking from practical experience, because, as some members here know, I had a good deal to do with the County Dublin labourers for a number of years.  I know the conditions of employment there and I know that for certain periods of the year men are engaged on agricultural work and, at other periods of the year, they are engaged on road work and other work of that kind.  I do not think that this can be settled by a discussion here now, but I suggest that some steps will have to be taken to deal with that situation, because it covers a tremendous number of men.  I am sure that Senator Wilson and Senator Counihan will bear me out when I say that great numbers of men will be concerned in this and that it involves very careful consideration.  Some steps will have to be taken to deal with that matter.</P>

If he had, say, 30 weeks in industrial employment at the higher rate, and 20 weeks at the other rate, his widow would get the benefit of the higher rate.</P>

      <P>Section 18, sub-section (1).  To delete the word &ldquo;eight&rdquo;, line 27 and to substitute therefor the word &ldquo;twelve&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The House will remember that Senator Dillon, when discussing the Second Stage of this Bill, argued very strongly for the valuation to be raised to £20. A number of farmers' representatives objected to that valuation, but, in discussing the matter, a couple of cases of very great hardship were pointed out.  In further discussion on the subject, we agreed that £12 would be a reasonable compromise.  We have come to the conclusion, in looking carefully into the matter, that a widow with a small farm is in a very helpless position. In many cases, those widows, through their upbringing and training, are absolutely unfitted for outdoor work, and very often are much worse off than widows in towns and cities, or the widows of agricultural labourers or artisans.  Senator Jameson's plea had a great effect on us and, I am sure, on the House, and we have come to the conclusion that it would be worth a considerable amount of money to keep the family and the home together, as stated by Senator Jameson.  Even if it should cost a little more money, I think that the Minister should agree to the amendment in the name of Senator Dillon.</P>

      <P>I would like to see every possible case of likely hardship in the farming community, or in any other community, brought within the ambit of the Bill.  That would be my own personal wish, but even if we fix £10 or £12, whatever limit you fix, you would certainly have hard cases on the border line.  That is the case with all legislation of this kind.  You are just as likely to meet a person with a £10 valuation whose circumstances are such &mdash;perhaps through the man's own fault, or perhaps through no fault of his own &mdash;that when the breadwinner dies the <Col N="676" /> family are left in a deplorable condition. No matter what limit you fix, any Senator here might be able to find cases which should have been brought within the scope of the Bill.  When drafting this Bill, we were looking for figures on which we could base a fair estimate, and we have statistics relating to farms up to the valuation of £7 10s.  We have not such accurate figures with regard to other valuations of holdings, say, £8, or £15 or £16. Reliable figures are not there.  That was one reason why, when we had reliable figures with regard to the £7 10s. valuation, we put on another 10/- to make certain all cases would be covered, and make it £8.  It certainly would mean, at a low estimate, an addition of close on £30,000 to put in what the Senator suggests, and I am afraid that that would be beyond what we could hope to do, at the present time at any rate.  I should like to do it, and I know that, probably, the House would like to do it, but I do not think it is possible.  I would only be misleading the Seanad if I said that I would look into this between now and the Report Stage.  I would like to do it, but in view of the additional cost that it would involve, I am afraid it is not possible to do anything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to see Senator Counihan taking an interest in the small farmers.  I desire to support him in the line that he is taking although, in 1929, when we had a Housing Bill before the Seanad, and when I brought forward an amendment the object of which was to secure special facilities for farmers with small valuations, Senator Counihan voted <Col N="677" /> against it.  It is only right to add that Senator Dillon voted for my amendment. The Minister referred to statistics in the case&mdash;of farms with valuations up to £7 10s. 0d.  I think if he makes inquiries he will find that the Land Commission have decided that an economic farm is one with a valuation of £10, and that any farm with a valuation below £10 is considered uneconomic. That is so in the West of Ireland.  A widow on a farm with a valuation under £10 finds it rather difficult to carry on.  If she has a farm with a valuation over £10, it would appear that there is not the same difficulty. The Minister is to be congratulated on bringing in farmers who have low valuations.  Senator Counihan knows that throughout the country&mdash; it is certainly the case in the West of Ireland&mdash;it is the general practice that when a farmer who has a holding with a small valuation dies, his neighbours always assist his widow and children, particularly if the children are very young, in doing the spring's work and in reaping the harvest.  There is no doubt that up to the present such people have been very well cared for by their neighbours.  In spite of all that, a widow on a holding with such a small valuation is not in a position to make full use of her farm in the sense of being able to go to the fairs to sell her live stock.  She is not as well able to transact business at the fairs as her husband was.</P>

Can we take it that the Minister and the Senator are ready to call it a deal?

      <P>Senator Counihan, like a lot of other people, is always ready to criticise the Government for its extravagance when it is a question of giving any money to the farmers.  I had forgotten for the moment that the Senator is a farmers' representative. At any rate, when he thinks that the Government are inclined to dish out money, according to him, too freely, then he says that they are spendthrifts, extravagant and all the rest. I do not think it is right for him, therefore, to be urging further extravagance on the part of the Government. Senator MacEllin, I think, was not correct in stating that the Land Commission had decided that any holding under a £10 valuation is uneconomic, and that holdings over £10 valuation are economic.  It is possible that that may be the case in the West of Ireland, but it is not the case in various other counties, and this Bill, when it becomes an Act, will apply to the east, north and south as well as to the west.</P>

      <P>Would it be possible to have something in the nature of a sliding scale?  It would certainly be a terrible hardship on a great number of deserving people if, because their valuations happened to be a fraction over the amount laid down in the Bill, they should be deprived of the benefits of this measure.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Senator misunderstands the position.  This is the question of the definition of a small holder as one whose valuation does not exceed £8.  I would like to stress the point that even though you do include people with valuations up to £12, the pension is not going to become payable to them.  It will be subject to the means test.  If a holding with a £12 valuation is going to allow a livelihood to a widow, that will preclude her from getting the pension, or even if a holding with an £8 valuation is held to provide a widow with a livelihood, that also will preclude her from getting the pension. This is the non-contributory side of the Bill, and Senators should bear in mind that the question whether holdings have a valuation of £8, £10 or £12 is not so material as has been suggested. If a widow has a holding nominally valued at £10 or £12, and that it should only be valued at £8, the same justice would be done to the widow.</P>
      <P>We had an intimation from the Minister for Finance this afternoon about the faults and the failings of the valuation authorities in respect of housing, and, presumably, they are equally liable to faults and failings in regard to the valuation of land and of houses on land.  When the means test is in operation, justice will be done under the scheme of the Bill even though the amendment is accepted and the £12 valuation is inserted in place of the £8 valuation.  Therefore, there is not so much at stake as has been suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">

      <P>I suggest if that argument <Col N="680" /> were to be pursued to its logical conclusion that we would find people on the opposite benches standing up to prove that the man who had a holding with a valuation of £125 or £145 was also an uneconomic holder.  If it does not make any difference, as Senator Johnson has suggested, when the means test is applied, I suggest that it would involve a considerable amount of time in investigating all the cases, and that the same argument would hold for including all valuations under £125.  I imagine that very few such holdings would be in such dire need that they would require to be provided for under this measure, but at any rate certain people would proceed to apply under it and would get considerable help in trying to prove that they were not able to carry on.  Because of that a great deal of investigation would have to be carried out, and the difficulties in administration would be very great.</P>

The Minister holds that the acceptance of the amendment would involve an additional expenditure of £30,000 a year. Supposing the amendment were accepted, there is no doubt that when it went to the Dáil the Minister for Finance would be able to get it rejected. The Minister in charge of the Bill has told us that he could not recommend the acceptance of the amendment.  If we pass the amendment it will do no harm, but when it is rejected by the Dáil and comes back to us I do not think that we can raise any row about it, and I should expect that that would be the end of it.</P>

      <P>I think that this is an amendment that ought to be moved. I would like to have some expression of opinion from the House as to the desirability of amending this sub-section. The figure in the Bill is surely too small: that the widow of a farmer, on a farm with a valuation of £8, is only going to receive a pension of five shillings.</P>
      <P>The figure in the urban areas is 6/- and I do not think it is reasonable to make the distinction between the rural area widow and the urban area widow in this way.  This is a question not merely of a small farmer, though I mentioned that and the fact that it appears in the name of Senator Dillon would suggest that it only has reference to the farmer.  It applies, however, to the rural areas which include all those towns I spoke of at an earlier stage.  While I am not impressed with all that Senator Jameson said with regard to the <i>non possumus</i> attitude of the Minister because of the finance restrictions I would like the House to express the view itself that 5/- is quite inadequate and that the amendment raising it to 6/- ought not be allowed to be withdrawn but should, in fact, be inserted.

      <P>The subject matter of this amendment I referred to on the Second Reading of the Bill.  It raises another very important point.  The section provides that a widow shall be granted a pension when she attains the age of 60 years provided she has no child under the age limit fixed in the Bill.  My amendment seeks to change the age limit from 60 to 55.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I pointed out in the Second Reading debate that the Committee which considered this whole question of widows' and orphans' pensions and which made exhaustive enquiries into similar schemes in every other country in the world and examined it from every aspect made a recommendation that the age limit should be 55 and not 60, though the Minister says that this would mean an increase of £62,000.  Might I remind the Minister that he has the best possible argument to meet the Minister for Finance on this.  He can tell him truthfully that in last year's Budget provision was made for £250,000 for widows' and orphans' pensions and that he got away with the whole of it and owes in all equity <Col N="683" /> to the widows and orphans of this country £250,000.  That £250,000 should have been paid to the widows and orphans when it was voted in the Budget last year.  If it was invested it would easily bring in £62,000 to pay the additional amount that would be incurred by changing the age for pensions for widows from 60 years to 55.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that we did expect that the age would have been fixed at 55. We are sadly disappointed it was not. I think it is unfair to a woman who has been married and away from employment for a considerable number of years to say that she has got to reach 60 years before she can get a widow's pension, especially a woman who may have been in receipt of a widow's pension because she had children under the age limit and who no longer gets the pension when the children go over the age.  She may be 55 years of age, and because of that she is deprived of the pension for another five years.  I ask you, in the name of Providence, how can a woman of that kind be expected to find employment; the thing is impossible. The Committee recommended it and it is in the British Bill.  Why should a widow in Northern Ireland at the age of 55 be getting a pension, while in the Free State a widow has got to wait until 60?  I could talk for hours on this particular matter, but I do not want to take up the time of the House.  I say, however, in all fairness that this £250,000 was included in last year's Budget and it should have been spent on the widows for whom it was provided.  If this is done now it will only be paying back to the widows what they have been deprived of because this Bill has been too long held up.  I am not saying it was the fault of the Minister. Nevertheless, I make this statement that the money was provided in last year's Budget to be spent during the financial year and it was not spent. The Minister for Finance has got the benefit of it, and surely it is not too much to ask that the pension should be paid to widows at 55 years, even if <Col N="684" /> it costs £62,000 additional.  The age limit recommended in the report should be adopted.</P>

      <P>As a matter of correction, it was not recommended in the report.  There is a definite recommendation against it on page 26 of the report and again in the penultimate paragraph.  Paragraph 33 states: &ldquo;These reasons are considered sufficient to justify the exclusion of widows without dependent children from the scope of a non-contributory scheme.  The fact that the condition of many elderly widows without dependent children in urban areas is precarious and deserving of sympathy has not however been overlooked,&rdquo; and so on.  Later it is stated: &ldquo;It is regrettable, for instance, that we have found it necessary to confine the scheme to widows having dependent children, and that no provision is included for widows whose children have ceased to be dependent upon them or for elderly, childless widows.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I desire to say, from the point of view of sympathy, that it is very difficult to debate some of these questions, particularly in a case where the widow had children and was in receipt of a pension and ceased to be entitled to it.  Senator Johnson says that he would like to have an expression of opinion.  No amendments have been put down to this Bill from this side of the House. That is entirely due to the fact that we accepted the statement made by the Minister at the outset that provision was made for a specific sum <Col N="685" /> and that that could not be increased. What I am saying now applies almost to every amendment which one would have natural sympathy with and which one could not argue against.  We are not supporting these amendments for that reason.  The only thing we can do is to make some suggestions as regards administration.  I mention that because Senator Johnson said he would like to have an expression of opinion.  This is a non-Party measure; it has been accepted by all Parties and the only thing that can be achieved by making expressions of opinion is a certain amount of Party capital.  I am not accusing the Labour Party of doing that, but from our point of view it would have been so regarded.  We do not want to create difficulties for this Bill; we want it to be a success and we are not expressing an opinion that the 5/- should be raised to 6/- because we have accepted the statement of the Minister.</P>

      <P>(1)  A widow's (non-contributory) pension payable to a widow shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, continue to be payable until she attains the age of seventy years and shall then cease, unless she previously remarries, in which case the said pension shall cease as on and from such remarriage.</P>

      <P>Section 22, sub-section (2).  To delete the words &ldquo;six months&rdquo; in lines 1-2 and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;two years&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is on a different basis.  This amendment is one which I think the House should approve of, and I think the Minister should approve of it, it is so palpably unjust and unreasonable to deprive a widow of a pension when her youngest child reaches the age of 14.  Take the instance I gave on the last occasion.  A widow in Dublin with two children.  She is without means, and she will receive a pension of 12/6.  She is aged, say, 58. The eldest child is 13, and the second child 12.  When the eldest <Col N="687" /> child becomes 14 the allowance in respect of that child ceases, and the widow's income drops from 12/6 to 11/-. Another year passes and the second child is then 14 years of age and, according to the scheme of the Bill, the allowance in respect of the second child also ceases.  As the Bill is drafted, not only would that allowance cease, but the widow's pension ceases.  Accordingly, when the second child is 14 her income drops from 11/- to nothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The six month's period is merely for administrative purposes. The amendment would leave the widow with her pension, even though she has lost the children's allowances.  It is heartless to suggest that after bringing up children to the age that they would be expected by the scheme of the Bill to be leaving school, the widow should not only lose their allowances but her pension, at a time when their requirements are greatest, and when the cost of maintaining and caring them throws the greatest possible burden on the mother.  As soon as the children are aware of their position in life the widow is to be thrown on the poor law <i>holus-bolus.</i>  I think that is most unreasonable and undesirable.  The whole mentality of the children is going to be affected.  Up to that age the widow has got the pension as a right.  That is the great value of the Bill.  But, when the children reach the age of 14 they are informed that no longer is the mother's income due to her as a right; that she has to go to the poor law authorities to get relief. I suggest to the Minister that he should press for the additional cost involved by the amendment, and press very hard with the backing of this House.  The scheme in the Bill I suggest was not sufficiently appreciated when the drafting was left as it is in Section 22.  I ask the Minister very seriously to examine this proposition, to see if he cannot agree to making this change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to take the same view, even if we had to take something else out in other parts of the Bill.  In any case we might go further than six months, because the widow would not be able to support the children within six months if she is to look out and to make other provision for them.  The position will lead to a real grievance which will operate against the State generally.  Some reasonable time should be given to widows to look for work.  In most cases the children cannot take employment until they reach 14 years.  All the payments stopping suddenly will create hardship and a bad situation. I would like to see something else in the Bill cut in order to stretch a point and to make the period at any rate 18 months.</P>

      <P>That explains my difficulty as far as the Department is concerned, but my proposition here is a matter of drafting.  I do not think there is any division of opinion as to deciding the matter of the claim.  The claimant has his or her pension allowed and he or she receives a paying order on a certain date, and for some reason or other, sickness or otherwise, it is not presented until two months, three weeks and six days have elapsed.  She brings it to the Post Office for payment and something has occurred there and she does not get paid on the last day.  Now, the Comptroller and Auditor - General would come down and say that that pension could not be paid legally.</P>

    <P>This is really intended to provide against the possibility of pensions being lost, owing to sickness or ill-health or for some reason which satisfied the Minister, over and above the three months' period.  Its aim is to enable the Minister to order the payment of such sum retrospectively as he may consider proper where a period of over three months has elapsed owing to illness or inadvertence recognised by the Minister.

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 39, sub-section (2).  To insert before the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Section 70 of the National Insurance Act, 1911, and Section 40 of the National Health Insurance Act, 1918, shall be construed and have effect as if the contributions there mentioned included contributions payable under this Act and as if the right conferred on an employed contributor to take proceedings against his employer extended to the survivors of such employed contributor and as if every reference to membership of an approved society in that section were deleted therefrom.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is an important amendment. Under other Acts, like the National Health Insurance Act, where the employer has neglected to stamp the cards and the insured person suffers a loss by virtue of that, he has a claim against the employer for loss sustained through the default.  Under this Bill, the employer may not stamp the card, and when the person dies the widow cannot claim against the employer in respect of any loss she may suffer through the default.  The amendment is designed to give the widow the rights against the employer that the insured person would have under the Health Insurance Acts.  The case is simple in so far as the intentions are concerned, and it seems to be obvious that if there is going to be an obligation on employers to stamp cards under this Act as under the Health Insurance Acts, as it is to be a similar stamp, the law which protects an insured person should also protect the widow where she is to suffer by reason of that default. The amendment is intended to remedy what I think is a defect in drafting in those circumstances.  Perhaps the Minister would give his views on that point.</P>

      <P>Going into this matter after Senator Johnson's amendment was put down, we examined it again, and in view of the definite intention which he had expressed in the amendment and which was also our intention, to provide for that matter in the Bill, we found that it was doubtful if the amendment drafted by Senator Johnson would cover the point.  It would have to be re-drafted, I think, and it is no discredit to Senator Johnson, that his amendment has not covered the point either.  I am told by a most reliable authority on drafting that it would require one of the mose difficult sections that has been drafted, or is likely to be drafted, to cover it satisfactorily.  It is unlikely that we would be able to get a section drafted in time for the Report Stage of this Bill.  If it would meet Senator Johnson and the view of the House, I would say that I know that legislation will have to be brought in soon to amend certain sections of the National Health Insurance Act, and I will bring in a section there and make it applicable to the widows' and orphans' pensions, as this, being based on National Health Insurance, is a somewhat similar Bill.  We will endeavour to have the point that Senator Johnson has in mind&mdash;a very good point and the same thing as we had in mind ourselves&mdash;met by amending legislation, but I would not like to risk having the Bill delayed in the Report Stage and consequently delayed in coming into operation, on account of the failure to bring up a revised section, as I am advised that that most likely would happen.</P>

It will not be nearly so satisfactory to deal with the matter under another new Bill.  I suppose from the point of view of the employer I should be opposed to this, but I take Senator Johnson's view that there should be a claim against an employer for negligence, and it is better that he should know it in the beginning.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I could not guarantee that the Bill would pass.  In order to get the Bill into operation by the 1st January, we are taking chances, even now, in getting the administrative machinery put into order.  An enormous amount of printing has to be done, including the printing of new cards and other things which have to be done in connection with national health insurance.  We are providing for these but we cannot give an order for certain printing until the Bill is actually through the Oireachtas.  Every day counts with us now if we are to get the Act into operation by the 1st January.  If there is a delay of even a few weeks now, we could not put the Act into operation even on the 1st February or the 1st March; we should have to wait until the 1st July.  A delay of a week now might mean a delay of six months in getting the Act into operation. Therefore, I should like to get the Bill through the Oireachtas as soon as possible and have it in operation on the 1st January.</P>

    <P>The Minister, in his proposed legislation, may intend to deal with this point.  Possibly the drafting difficulty would not arise in this case and the Minister may agree to the incorporation of this amendment in the present Bill.  The proposition is that where an employer is prosecuted for failure to comply and the court deals with the offender under the Probation of Offenders Act, it shall be an obligation on the employer so dealt with to stamp the cards and pay what is due.

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 54 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>54.&mdash;In granting outdoor relief to a person in receipt of or entitled to receive a pension under this Act, a public assistance authority shall not take into consideration any such pension, except so far as such pension exceeds five shillings a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="699" /> This is a very important amendment and it will not throw any increased charge upon the Exchequer.  It is intended to provide that, in granting outdoor relief to a person who is in receipt of a pension under this Bill the public assistance authority shall not take into consideration any such pension except in so far as it may exceed 5/- per week.  I take it that this Bill is not a rates relief Bill.  I want to make sure that the intentions of the legislature shall have effect and that it will not be merely a case of transferring from the poor law to the State a certain sum which the pensioner at present receives.  There is a real danger that there will not be any financial benefit to many people by the passing of this Bill.  It is, I think, the intention of the legislature that there should be a financial benefit to widows and orphans&mdash;that they should be in a better position to maintain themselves after the passing of this Bill than they were heretofore.  If, after the passing of the Bill, a widow receives 10/- in pension and the poor law authorities come along and say they will deduct 10/- from their allowance, then there is no change save the transfer of the authority whence the income is derived.  I want to make sure that, so far as the first 5/- of pension is concerned, this Bill will not affect the position of persons in receipt of assistance.  I ask the House to agree to the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept in principle the amendment moved by Senator Johnson but I think it would require re-drafting.  From the strictly legal point of view, a few words might require to be changed.  Even if such an amendment were not passed, there would be nothing to prevent a local authority from giving any relief it felt inclined to give.  On the other hand, the insertion of the amendment will not compel the local authority to give additional assistance.  There is an indication in the amendment that the local authority should not take into consideration the pension under this Bill, up to a certain amount, but the <Col N="700" /> local authority, through its officers, are the arbiters as to what relief will be given.  There is no law to compel them to give any definite sum.  They are obliged to give relief to indigent persons but they get out of that by saying that they will give only so much and that if the applicant is not satisfied he must come into the institution. The passing of this amendment will not alter the situation.</P>

They take into account the extent of need and, in taking into account the extent of need, they take into account the means.  Unless such an amendment as this is passed, in taking into account the means, they will take into account the pension.  I want to ensure that they will not take into account the first 5/- of the pension.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:&mdash;</P>
      <P>First Schedule, Rule 1, sub-rule (1), paragraph (b).  To delete in lines 3-4 the words &ldquo;or from a friendly society or trade union&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This arises from the means test.  The section says that in the calculation of the annual means of a person certain things shall be deemed to constitute the means of such person, and they include any moneys received by way of sickness or disablement benefit under the National Health Insurance Acts or from a friendly society or a trade union.  This raises the very same issue that we have repeatedly raised with regard to old age pensions. Some trades unions do make provision that, when their members have been benefit members for a considerable number of years, when they reach the age of 70 or are incapacitated for further work, they make them a small donation from the funds of the trade union.  We argued this case on several occasions in connection with the Old Age Pensions Act, and the same principle applies here; and that is that the thrifty person who has been contributing to friendly societies for a lifetime&mdash;and some of them have been contributing to these friendly societies long before there was any State Insurance of any kind&mdash;and that, having contributed in that way for a lifetime, <Col N="702" /> when they would be entitled to these small benefits in their old age, what has happened is that in the Old Age Pensions Act, in the calculation of means, the trades unions found that if they paid the money, the State refused to pay, with the result that the trades unions refused to pay. That has been the actual practice, and I suggest that, if the trade union has been giving a few shillings a week to an old or incapacitated member, those few shillings a week ought not to be set off against the widow's pension. It may be argued that you must take into account all the means that a person has, but under the Old Age Pensions Act people have been able to get around that.  For example, the trade union need not pay a man so much a week; it can make him a present of the equivalent.  There are ways and means, as Senators are aware, I am sure, of getting around these things.</P>

When the Parliamentary Secretary, Dr. Ward, was dealing with this matter before, I raised this point then and Dr. Ward said to me: &ldquo;I need not tell you how to get around it.&rdquo;  That is quite true, but the point is that if the State insists on carrying out these regulations the benefits of the friendly societies will not be voted.  And actually it does not make a farthing's difference to the State whatever.  My amendment will not mean a farthing's difference to the State because, if the State insists on carrying out these regulations, the result is that the friendly societies will not pay these benefits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the benefit <Col N="703" /> societies take the view that, if there is 5/- to be saved they will save it and leave the State to pay it.  That is well understood.  In some cases the difficulty is got around in other ways.  For instance, they will not make a weekly allowance but they will pay the rent. They are entitled to do that under the law, and that does not debar the person concerned from getting the 10/- a week old age pension.  We argue that people who have been thrifty and who have paid for these little benefits should not be deprived of them when they are entitled to receive them.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:&mdash;</P>
      <P>First Schedule, Rule 1, sub-rule (2).  Before the sub-rule to insert a new sub-rule as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  In the calculation of the annual <Col N="704" /> means of a person for the purpose of paragraph (a) or paragraph (d) of the immediately preceding sub-rule it shall be presumed that the yearly value of any advantage accruing to such person from the ownership of a dwelling house, the poor law valuation of which</P>
    <P>(a)  if situated in a County Borough does not exceed £20,</P>
    <P>(b)  if situated elsewhere than in a County Borough does not exceed £15,</P>
    <P>and in which such person resides is nil.</P>
    <P>In moving this amendment, I have in mind, mainly, those persons in the cities particularly in the City of Dublin, who have bought their houses or are in course of buying their houses and are legally the owners of their houses.  Take people who bought their houses from 1923 onwards.  The Corporation built a number of these houses.  The Minister for Finance this afternoon told us, in defence of a certain proposition, that houses that were valued at around about £25 a year in Dublin had a letting value of up to £100, and that, in fact, for valuation purposes, they showed a profit of about £75.  If that is a correct statement, or if it is approaching correctness, there is a real danger that, in assessing a person's means, the value of that house which is being paid for by instalments will be set against the applicant and will deprive her of any benefit.</P>
    <P>I am not quite satisfied with the drafting of this amendment, but what I desire to ensure against is that a widow will not be debarred from benefit who is living in a house which was bought by her husband when he was alive and which was his property although he was paying for it in instalments. The widow continues to live in the house and treats it, not as property that belongs to her but as a home. I am trying to provide against the State regarding it as property that she could let at £12 or £20 a year over and above what she is paying by instalments. I want to ensure that that house, which is her home, should not be assessed in such a way as to be means set against her claim for pension. <Col N="705" /> As I say, I am not quite satisfied with the drafting of the amendment, but I think the intention is clear and I would earnestly ask the Minister to agree to the insertion of a clause of this kind, if not now, at least on the Report Stage, so that the fact of her living in a house which was in course of being purchased should not be set against her claim.  She is not letting the house for profit or letting to lodgers.  It is not being set out as a piece of property.  It is her home that she is in process of purchasing, but, in-as-much as it has a letting value in the market, which may be as high as the Minister for Finance suggested this afternoon, if that were the case, it would deprive her of any claim for pension even though she was not deriving an actual rent from it.  I want the Minister to guard against that and to provide for it.  I think it is perfectly reasonable and, if the contrary were allowed to happen it would be a real injustice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I could take any other view than that a house, the owner of which had fully paid for it or was paying by instalments, would have to be considered property.  I cannot see any other way that you could treat any person claiming, say, an old age pension.  The house is certainly valuable property and would have to be assessed in the same way as any other property a person might possess.  There might be equally hard cases, such as that of a dying man who had amassed £400 or £500 in the expectation of buying a house and that £500 would be assessed against his widow; but the person who actually bought a house a few years before his death would not have that set against him, according to this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister speaks of property but he overlooks this: suppose there are two widows, one living in a house and paying rent to the Corporation and the other paying instalments.  Now, the instalments, so far as the widow and her late husband were concerned, were merely another form of rent and it made no difference <Col N="706" /> to them whether it was rent or an instalment payment.  In the one case, the widow living in the Corporation house and paying a weekly rent has nothing set against her in respect of the house, but in the other case it is alleged to be her property although, in fact, she is merely paying rent.</P>
