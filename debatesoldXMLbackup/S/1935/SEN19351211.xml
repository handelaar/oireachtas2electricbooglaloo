      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 21 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  No occupier of a slaughterhouse shall permit a young person under the age of 14 years to enter or remain in a slaughterhouse during the process of slaughtering any animal.</P>
      <P>(2)  Every occupier of a slaughterhouse who contravenes the provisions of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section, and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £10.</P>
      <P>On the last day the matter was before the House there seemed to be a feeling that if the wording were altered it would be acceptable to the House. I need not take up any time recommending the amendment as I think it will appeal to everyone here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to second the amendment.  I should like to draw attention to the changes that have taken place as compared with the proposal that was made last week. The reference to the words &ldquo;adjacent to a slaughterhouse' has been deleted, <Col N="1323" /> and the age of 15 has been reduced to 14 years.  The amendment now reads that &ldquo;no occupier of a slaughterhouse shall permit a young person under the age of 14 years to enter or remain in a slaughterhouse during the process of slaughtering any animal.&rdquo; That is a considerable modification of the amendment discussed on the last day.  I think that the general sense of the House was opposed to the rather drastic propositions set out in the last amendment, but I imagine the House would be agreeable to prohibiting a person under 14 years of age being present during the slaughtering, leaving out the question of adjacency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see much sense in this amendment or that it can ever be carried out.  The amendment speaks of the process of slaughtering. According to the Bill, that only takes a second &mdash; the firing of a pistol shot. That is the process of slaughtering. How is a Civic Guard to prove that a person under 14 years of age was present in the slaughterhouse during that second?  I am afraid that this amendment, if accepted, would lead to a lot of unnecessary worry and trouble in the case of those who would have to carry out the law.  In my opinion, they could never prove that an offence had been committed.  The slaughter of cattle is quite different from the slaughter of pigs, which cause a lot of noise &mdash; squealing and so on.  It is quite different in the case of the slaughter of a beast.  A trigger is pulled and the slaughtering process is over in a second.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LaurenceONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the motives which have prompted Senator Foran to bring forward this matter.  I was reared in the neighbourhood of this city, and in my youth was often in slaughterhouses.  Although I am not often in agreement with Senator Gogarty, I do agree with the statement he made on the last day about animals being half slaughtered and then running amok through the city. I have seen many shocking sights of that kind.  It is not very long ago since I saw animals half slaughtered break from their shackles, run through the city and die in the streets.  In my <Col N="1324" /> younger days there was what was known as &ldquo;killing day.&rdquo;  It was a great day for the youths of that time. They came from all directions to see the beasts slaughtered.  They mitched from school and spent the day hanging around the doors of slaughterhouses, keenly enjoying the sufferings of the animals that were being killed and paddling in their blood.  Senator Foran will bear me out in this, that, as a result of that, you had gangs of youths marching out with knives and hatchets playing the game of, what was called in those days, slaughter. They acted like a lot of wild Indians, so much so that in that district the police dare not go around except in groups.  If they were to do otherwise, those young bloodhounds would descend on them, and in my own memory policemen were killed.  I do not mean to convey to the Seanad that that practice exists to-day, but I mention those facts so as to bring home to members of this House the demoralising effect which their presence at the slaughter of animals is likely to have on young people.  It is likely to warp their better nature, to kill any refinement that may be in them and make them cruel.  In my opinion, Senator Foran's amendment is well-timed and should be adopted by the House.  It will save the youngsters in those districts in which you have slaughterhouses from that demoralisation to which I have referred. As I have said, I have seen youngsters take a delightful interest in the killing of cattle and actually paddling in their blood.  We should do all in our power to prevent that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is not to be judged by what happened in the past. Under this Bill, animals are to be slaughtered by the firing of a pistol shot.  In my opinion, it would be just as logical to prevent a child seeing a farmer shoot a crow as to prevent a child being present when a man was pulling a trigger and shooting a beast.  Both shootings take place in an instant of time.  If it is to be made a crime for a young person under 14 to see a man pull a trigger and kill a beast, it also ought to be made a crime for children to go out and watch <Col N="1325" /> the gentry shooting grouse, because it is the same instrument that is used in each case.  Everyone knows that if you go into a butcher's shop you will see blood there as well as the choppers and other instruments that are used for cutting up the meat.  I do not think that anyone is upset at the idea of seeing these things, and therefore I think this amendment ought not to be adopted.</P>

      <P>Níl mórán agam le rá ar an leas-rún so. I notice that in the Official Report of the last day's meeting I am reported as having referred to &ldquo;the meat market.&rdquo;  What I was referring to was, of course, the Meath market &mdash; that is, the market in Meath Street.  I do not blame the reporter for that because, of course, it was easy to mix up the two when we were discussing the slaughter of animals.  I am very seldom in disagreement with my old friend, Senator O'Neill, but in this matter &mdash; the killing of animals &mdash; I totally disagree with him.  In anything that I say on this I have in mind youngsters reared in the country. Most Senators will know that young people reared in the country feed and attend young animals of one kind or another.  As a result of the attention they give them, they become very fond of the animals and, when they hear that they are about to be killed, it causes them great annoyance and grief.  My experience of youngsters in the country, therefore, is that the killing of animals creates a feeling of horror in them.  For that reason I disagree with the views expressed by Senator O'Neill.</P>

      <P>No. I understood the Senator to say that young people in the city gloated over the killing of animals, and that one of their great days was what he called &ldquo;killing day.&rdquo;  If that was his point, I disagree with him as far as young people reared in the country are concerned. I know that the killing of animals creates a feeling of horror in them, and that they do not like killing of any sort.</P>

      <P>The arguments which have been put forward in support of this amendment remind me of the wise saying that hard cases make bad law, and extreme arguments are very likely to make bad law in this case.  The public slaughterhouse in Meath Street, and the general slaughter of a lot of animals with blood flowing and all that sort of thing, is an extreme case; it is unusual and unique.  Let us take the average case of the slaughter of a beast by a butcher in the country.  If you pass this amendment people will find themselves prosecuted without knowing that they were committing any offence.  It is really a thing that ought not to be legislated for.  I said on the last occasion the Seanad met that we were carrying regulations and restrictions and penalties to an extreme.  I suggest to the Seanad that they ought not to pass this amendment, and that the arguments put forward in support of it do not apply to the general case at all.  If there is anything to be said in relation to the public slaughterhouse at Meath Street, that is a matter for individual consideration, and should not be made the basis for a public general statute governing matters of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was fully debated on the Committee Stage, and I do not suppose we can throw any additional light on it now. I had hoped that Senator Foran was convinced by the arguments advanced against the amendment and that we would not have to deal with it to-day in a modified form.  I am personally opposed to the amendment, but, as I stated on the Committee Stage, if there is a majority in this House in favour of the principle incorporated in it, I am not prepared to carry my opposition to any extreme extent.  I am strongly of opinion that the amendment is foolish.  Senator O'Neill told us about the shocking sights he observed in slaughterhouses, the terrible cruelty inflicted on animals, and of animals running amok in a half slaughtered condition.  I accept Senator O'Neill's word that that is true, <Col N="1327" /> but the aim and intention of this Bill is to ensure that animals will not be slaughtered under such shocking conditions in future.  It appears to me that it is undesirable we should develop the mentality that there is something extremely wrong, inhuman or depraving in slaughtering animals.  Animals have to be slaughtered in the ordinary course of everyday economy in order to provide food.  I would much prefer if we set out to develop a mentality in our youth that the slaughter of animals was an ordinary normal process and that there was nothing horrifying or degrading about it.  If we prohibit children from being present in a slaughterhouse we are going to concentrate the child mind on the fact that there is behind closed doors something shocking going on, that the ordinary normal child could not look at.  I do not think that is desirable at all.  The ordinary normal child will find nothing revolting or shocking in being present at the slaughter of animals under conditions that I hope the animals will be slaughtered in future.</P>
      <P>I am in full agreement with the point of view expressed by Senator Wilson, that it is more shocking, more revolting, and more calculated to influence the youthful mind to be present at the slaughter of game by people who call themselves sportsmen.  There is not a shadow of doubt about it, that the punishment inflicted by inaccurate shots is certainly much more extreme than the punishment or suffering caused by humane slaughter.  The same line of argument applies to another class of men, fishermen.  I certainly think that the unfortunate fish which is drawn out of the water, and which has to die from starvation or for want of natural sustenance, suffers.  It is suggested that a child should not be present when an animal is being slaughtered, you must attempt to follow that idea to some logical conclusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Neill tells us that children who have been in the vicinity of slaughterhouses have learned a game called &ldquo;slaughter.&rdquo; I suppose it is inferred that they develop some kind of warped outlook, that this game of &ldquo;slaughter&rdquo; has a special appeal for them, and perhaps appeals to them in after life when they might be in a position to do more damage.  Honestly, I do not think there is much substance in that suggestion. During a time of war &mdash; and I suppose in this country because we are a war-like people &mdash; children play at soldiers.  At the present time in any village or country town children can be seen marching up and down, calling themselves the Abyssinians and the Italians, but I do not think that is doing the children a bit of harm or warping their outlook.  I do not think it will make them blood-thirsty citizens.  This whole question boils down to a study of the psychology of the child-mind.  On that, of course, we will have different opinions.  We are approaching the question from a completely opposite angle, and the weight of informed opinion would be against this amendment.  Consequently, I am opposed to it and I hope the House will reject it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has given us a perfect exhibition of the child-mind by telling us that we should not prohibit children witnessing normal happenings.  Just imagine a man or a woman going into licensed premises and having a normal drink.  That would be a normal proceeding, yet we prohibit children going in to see it.  We licence betting houses but we prohibit children going into these places where the business carried on is perfectly legal.  Why did we do so?  To protect the child-mind.  I am afraid the Minister has given an exhibition that his mind wants looking after.  I will read a section of the Bill that will convince the Minister and the House of the wisdom of the amendment.  Section 13 (1) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>No person shall slaughter any animal in a slaughterhouse in such place, position, or other circumstances that such slaughter can be seen by any other animal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1329" /> Yet, we think it is a good thing to allow a child to go in and see it.  That is what the Parliamentary Secretary and a number of members of this House stand for.  The Bill prohibits the slaughtering of an animal in the presence of another animal, while a child is to be permitted to go in and witness the slaughtering operation.  If the House stands for that sort of thing, then it is going back on everything for which it stood in the past.  At one time, we used to have public hangings. <Col N="1330" /> The sense and feeling of the people were against that and, now, we have not these public executions.</P>

      <P>Section 27, sub-section (4).  To delete the sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill as it stands provides for an appeal to the District Court if a butcher is deprived of his licence by the sanitary authority.  The appeal ends there.  I cannot see any reason why, if the person affected thinks that the judgment of the District Court is wrong, he should not have an opportunity of going to the Circuit Court. It is a serious matter to an individual to be deprived of his licence.  It means depriving him of his livelihood and, in every case in which a man is deprived of his livelihood, he should get the full benefit of the law.  He should be allowed to appeal to the Circuit Court. We all know of recent cases where local authorities have refused certain licences and where that refusal has been confirmed by the District Court, but, on appeal to the Circuit Court, the decision was reversed.  The sanitary authority and the District Court judge could be obsessed with a certain, idea of what butchers should do, which might not be the law at all, and they might deprive a man of his licence and, consequently, of his livelihood.  That is a very serious matter for the individual, and I think the House should agree to allow him the full benefit of the proposal <Col N="1331" /> in the amendment.  I should have imagined that this amendment would have been put forward by the Labour Party, as it concerns them more than the farmers, but as they did not do so, I felt it my duty to try to rectify this clause which would inflict such an injustice on an individual.</P>

      <P>As this Bill proposes. Licences were formerly granted by the justice and there was no appeal.  In the City of Dublin even publicans' licences were granted by the Recorder as a justice.  Until this Bill, the licensing authority is the local sanitary authority.  The Bill gives an appeal to the district justice.  Do you want a second appeal to the Circuit Court judge with all the uncertainty and all the litigation which that involves?  If the old system of law were followed, there would be no appeal at all from the sanitary authority, but this Bill proposes to give an appeal.  I think Senator Counihan, in moving this amendment, was not quite clear about the functions of the district justice and the functions of the circuit judge.  The meaning of this is that if a man has premises and applies to the sanitary authority, say, in Kilmallock, for a licence, and if the sanitary authority refuses that licence, he goes to the district justice who sits in the same town.  If the district justice and the Sanitary authority agree, I think the public can be fairly well satisfied that the premises or the person is unsuitable.</P>

      <P>I entirely agree with the Senator who has last spoken.  The District Court, in my opinion, is a better court for this kind of case than the Circuit Court.  They will get absolute <Col N="1332" /> justice there.  The district justice knows the local conditions, and his court is a better court for the purpose of an appeal than the higher court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this amendment and I think the case has been completely put against it by Senator Comyn.  Under Section 12 of the Bill, a sanitary authority must issue a slaughter licence if a person is over 18 years of age, if he resides, carries on business or is employed in the area of the sanitary authority, and if he is considered to be a fit and proper person to hold such a licence.  It seems to me that the only question that would be likely to arise on appeal would be the question of whether he was a fit and proper person to whom a licence should issue, and it is conceivable that a sanitary authority, for various reasons, political or otherwise, might inflict hardship on an individual and declare that he was not a fit and proper person and refuse him a licence; but so long as the Bill makes provision for an appeal to the District Court, I think the applicant is completely safeguarded.</P>

The appeal lies to the District Court in that case and there is no further appeal to the Circuit Court.  When the Milk and Dairies Bill was before the House, the House agreed that the appeal from the local authority should be to the Minister and that he should be the ultimate and final court of appeal.  We want to avoid, if possible, expensive litigation on what will be a comparatively small matter.  The licence fee will probably be only about 5/-.  Many of the people who will hold slaughter licences will not be men of means at all.  If they proceeded to the Circuit Court and, logically, if they could go to the Circuit Court, they should be free to go to the Supreme Court&mdash; ultimately, the sanitary authority might win the case, and, in many instances, would not be able to recover their expenses, with the result that the rates would have to bear the burden of all the expensive litigation.  I do not think that under the Bill as it stands, <Col N="1333" /> there is any danger that hardship or injustice will be inflicted on anybody, and there are strong reasons for opposing the expensive litigation that might be incurred under the amendment.</P>

If the feeling of the House is that this amendment is unnecessary, I am satisfied to withdraw it, although I think it is a great injustice.  In other Bills which have come before us, an appeal to the Minister has been provided.  I think that if there was an appeal to the Minister provided for in this Bill, it would be some guarantee that injustice would not be done.  You might possibly have a sanitary authority and a district justice with a particular bias which would cause them to refuse a man a licence.  It is that type of case I have in mind, but Senator Comyn's argument has nothing whatever to do with the suitability of premises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill, A Chathaoirleach, is to confirm a number of Orders which were made during the past six months under the <Col N="1334" /> Emergency Imposition of Duties Act. These Orders are set out in the Schedule of the Bill and there is also an indication of the general subject matter of each.  Nos. 1 and 10 both relate to cheese and the result is that a duty of 4d. per lb. is imposed on imported cheese, which corresponds to the levy on home-produced cheese.  No. 2 imposes a duty upon almonds which have been subject to any process of shelling or on any preparation which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, consists mainly or wholly of almonds.  A factory had been established at Dublin for the purpose of carrying out the processes of shelling, cleaning, drying, cutting and grinding almonds.  It is not an important industry, but there is no reason why that work should not be done here, nor is there any increase in price of the prepared almonds in consequence of the making of the Order. No. 3 imposes a duty on enamelled hollow-ware.  A factory has been constructed at Tralee and is now coming into production for the manufacture of enamelled hollow-ware.  The employment which will be given in the industry is not inconsiderable and will probably prove of considerable benefit to the town of Tralee.  The industry also creates prospects for development in other directions.  The price of the enamelled hollow-ware produced there will be slightly, but only slightly, in excess of that charged for corresponding hollow-ware produced and sold in Great Britain.</P>
      <P>Reference No. 4 imposes a duty on certain floor coverings and paper felt. A factory for the production of felt-base floor coverings and the printing and finishing of linoleum is being erected at Tipperary and no inconsiderable employment will be given there.  The industry is one which we are glad to have established and it is being launched by a local company which has the support of a Belgian company of very high reputation.  The price at which the products of the factory will be sold will be approximately the same as the price of corresponding products produced and sold in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference No. 5 effects an amendment in the existing duty on grassseed, <Col N="1335" /> and No. 6 increases the existing duty on cotton thread and cotton ply yarns from 40 per cent. to 100 per cent. as it was considered necessary to have the higher duty in operation because of circumstances which had arisen affecting the industry which had been established in Westport.  The purpose of the higher duty is to prevent imports taking place except to the extent to which licences may be issued for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Reference No. 7 imposes a duty on certain sports requisites.  A factory for the manufacture of these sports goods is at present being constructed at Portarlington and quite considerable employment will be given therein. The factory is being built by a local company with which a British company of very high reputation in the manufacture of these goods is associated on the technical side.</P>
    <P>Reference No. 8 imposes a minimum duty on leather.  Certain classes of leather are subject to an <i>ad valorem</i> duty but, in consequence of the completion of plans for the manufacture of all classes of leather, a minimum duty becomes necessary.  Such might not be necessary on all classes of leather, but for purposes of administrative convenience it is felt desirable that the same duty should apply to all classes of leather, because sometimes it is not easy to distinguish between one class of leather and another. New tanneries have been opened and others have been planned which will, it is hoped, produce all the leather of all classes other than those excluded from the scope of this Order required here.  When these tanneries have been established and are in full production the price of leather available from them will not be higher than the present price ex British factories.</P>
    <P>No. 9 imposes a duty on springs, axles and wind screens.  A factory will be established at Wexford for the production of laminated springs for use in vehicles and for axles, axle boxes, axle arms and also wind screens for vehicles.  A public company has been formed for that purpose.  The industry is one which gives considerable employment, and it is expected <Col N="1336" /> that when these articles I have mentioned are being successfully made, it will be capable of development to include other articles of a corresponding nature.  Reference No. 10 I have already mentioned in connection with No. 1.  It relates to cheese.</P>
    <P>The Orders which have been confirmed by this Bill were made between the period from the beginning of September to the end of October and in accordance with the provisions of the Emergency Imposition of Duties Acts; the earlier Orders on the list are due for confirmation by the Oireachtas. If such confirmation by statute is not made, they cease to be operative. There is still a considerable period to run in respect of the later Orders, but it was considered desirable to incorporate them so that a similar measure will not be necessary until the Finance Bill, 1935, is being introduced.  The Orders were all made in pursuance of the general policy of stimulating industrial production by affording reasonable protection, and the new industries created in consequence of them will be of assistance in reducing unemployment and increasing the production of industrial goods within the country.  It will be noted, I am sure, with satisfaction by Senators that these new industries are being established in various parts of the country where employment will be particularly beneficial.</P>

      <P>I and, I am sure, other Senators were glad to hear from the Minister's statement that these new industries are being distributed throughout the country.  I was very glad to see that a new industry for hollow-ware was being established in Tralee, and also that industries are being established in Tipperary, Roscrea, Westport and other towns.  I would suggest to the Minister that in this industrial development, which is so necessary for this country, the Minister should keep before him in his office a map of the Free State and that he should put marks upon that map for every place in which he has a factory.  In that way, he would see certain areas which are blank.  One of these areas is the county of Clare.  If <Col N="1337" /> he did as I suggest, it would constantly bring before his mind the fact that in that county we are bearing the burden&mdash;a burden which I do not say is an undue burden having regard to the advantages&mdash;of this new industrial development.  I think the Minister would see, if he looked at that map that there would be a great white patch there, and I suggest that he should fill it in and put a mark on the county of Clare for a factory or two.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister about the imposition of a duty on almonds.  I understand that there was a duty of £40 to the ton on ground almonds and, in addition to that, a further £18 per ton added.  If the £40 were added for a protection, the people producing within the country ought to be able to produce them with that £40 protection without adding a further £18.  I want to know if my information is correct because, if it is correct, the Minister should not permit that £18 to be put on.</P>

      <P>I am interested in Reference No. 6.  When Reference No. 6 was being discussed in the Dáil, the Minister stated that the only complaint he had in regard to the increase in the price of thread was from me. He suggested that my complaint was based upon a misunderstanding and that my statements were incorrect.  I should like to know from the Minister what was the misunderstanding and in what way my statements were incorrect. The Minister also stated that I had heard from his Department&mdash;I presume communicating the result of the Minister's investigation into the prices which I stated were being charged by the Westport firm.  I have never heard from either the Department or the Minister since in reference to the matter.  In fact, I did not even receive back the letter containing the quotations which I handed to the Minister here in the Seanad.  I was not aware that my statements were either based upon a misunderstanding or were incorrect until I read it in the Official Report of the proceedings in the Dáil.  Since I learned that my statements as to the price were challenged, I took the trouble of checking <Col N="1338" /> them and making some inquiries myself, and I find there is no misunderstanding whatever.  The prices quoted by me were quite correct both in regard to prices charged by the Westport factory and the prices charged to manufacturers in Derry by other firms making thread.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion, I stated that the Westport factory was charging 67/- per gross for cops of 2,000 yards. No. 50&mdash;three cord; and 147/- per gross for No. 40&mdash;six cord.  These were the prices quoted in July last and these are the prices quoted to-day. No. 50 three cord thread, for which Westport want 67/-, is being sold to-day to Derry manufacturers, who are our competitors in the British market, at from 46/- to 48/- per gross. I have here a letter from one of the largest factories in Derry, in reply to my inquiries as to what they were paying for their thread.  They say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dear Sir,</P>
      <P>In reply to yours of the 9th instant re price of thread, we are at present paying for 50/3/2,000, 45/- per gross; and for 40/6/2,000, 106/- per gross.  We only use the best thread, and we find it cheaper in the end having no waste through breakage, etc.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what better documentary evidence you want than the statement of a reputable firm as to what they are paying. I have no intention to deceive the <Col N="1339" /> Senator.  He can find the facts out for himself.  I challenge investigation from the Minister's own Department in this matter.  There are many factories in Derry and it can easily be ascertained that what I am saying is correct.  I do not know what the explanation is.  The Minister says he has received no complaints from manufacturers: that the only complaint he has received was from myself.  I can quite understand the Minister receiving no complaints from other manufacturers, because manufacturers do not want to complain &mdash; especially manufacturers making exclusively for the home market.  They have the remedy in their own hands and can pass the increased price of thread on to their customers; but it is a serious handicap for manufacturers who have an export trade to have to pay 67/- and 147/- as against 45/- and 106/- paid by their competitors.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave an assurance here that once the Westport factory got into production its prices would not be higher than the British price.  In fact he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This is not a matter of promise; it is the matter of our undertaking that it will be imposed on this firm as a condition of its licence. If they do not comply with these conditions they will find themselves subject to a penalty which may amount to £50 a day, and also to the revocation of their licence.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, if Westport are not in production, the Minister cannot enforce these penalties, and I do not think they are producing the thread they are offering to-day.  What I suspect they are doing is importing thread under licence and charging manufacturers 40 per cent. profit on it.  This is most unfair and inequitable, and contrary to what the Minister said here on the last occasion &mdash; that if Westport were not in a position to supply, licences would be given to manufacturers to import free of duty.  My experience of how that assurance of the Minister worked out was this: About three weeks afterwards, my firm applied for licence to <Col N="1340" /> import thread for a special machine &mdash; thread which we explained was not being made at Westport &mdash; and also for a licence to import ordinary thread.  Our application was refused for both threads.  We then sent the following letter to the Department:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Sirs,</P>
    <P>With reference to yours of 23rd inst. refusing our application to import</P>
    <P>(a)  6 gross 2000/50 thread.</P>
    <P>(b)  2 gross 10,000 special left-hand twist for Feldlock machines,</P>
    <P>and referring us for supplies to the Irish Sewing Cotton Company, Westport, we beg to point out that the company referred to do not manufacture the special thread required for the Feldlock machine and that their price for 2000/50 thread is 67/-, as against 54/-, the price which we at present pay for similar thread.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I may say that while English firms, not in the combine, were selling thread to manufacturers in Derry at 45/-, the central agency were charging 54/-.  The letter goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we cannot obtain the special thread required for the Feldlock machine we shall have to scrap the machine, which cost us close on £100.  And if we cannot buy thread at a similar price to our Derry competitors it will have the inevitable result of losing the portion of our export trade which we have retained with very great difficulty.  We are very much surprised that our application for licence should be refused, especially as the Minister stated in the Seanad on the 25th July &lsquo;that the hold-up in licences is in respect to persons engaged in the sale of thread.&rsquo;  On the same occasion the Minister also stated that where the Westport factory was not in a position to supply thread of a particular class &lsquo;manufacturers will be allowed to import free of duty&rsquo; and that good care would be taken &rsquo;that clothing and similar factories where thread was used as raw material would not be adversely affected to any extent which would interfere with their development.&rsquo;  In view <Col N="1341" /> of these statements we would respectfully request the reconsideration of our application.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Well, our application was reconsidered, and about ten days afterwards we had an answer refusing a licence for ordinary thread but giving us a licence for the special thread.  Senators will note that that occurred only three weeks after the Minister stated here that Westport was producing for stock and not for sale, and that licences were to be given to manufacturers to import free of duty.  But, although we were refused a licence to import £13 or £14 worth of thread, I am aware that about a fortnight afterwards another firm obtained a licence to import £136 worth of thread.  It is but fair to state that the other firm was able to put up the case to the Department that they had ordered thread from Westport nine weeks previously and had not been able to get any delivery.  But this should have been known to the Department at the time that I applied for the licence&mdash; that Westport was not in the position to produce &mdash; and I do not think it was fair to refuse my application.</P>
    <P>Licences were refused to my firm as far back as November, 1934.  As I told the Minister in the Seanad on the last occasion, when we applied for a licence to import thread we were referred to the Irish Linen Thread Company, Thomas Street, Dublin.  The Minister said that was a mistake on the part of his officials.  No doubt it was, but what remedy have manufacturers for these officials' mistakes?  Manufacturers are hampered and hindered by this system of licences and by this policy of giving monopolies to firms for the manufacture of commodities which are essential raw materials.  I may say that I am not one bit concerned whether the monopolists are Messrs. Coats or the British Thread Mill of Leicester.  All that I am concerned with is to get thread promptly and at a price which will not handicap me with other competitors. I feel that in this matter of thread, with its infinite varieties, manufacturers should not be left at the mercy of any one firm, nor should they be left at the mercy of an official who may refuse a licence without any <Col N="1342" /> investigation whatever, and without any regard to the effect that his refusal may have on the business of an applicant.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about attempts to sabotage newly-established Irish industries, but nothing about the old-established Irish industries which are being sabotaged by Governmental regulations and restrictions, especially by the imposition of duties on raw materials essential for production &mdash; materials that are not being made in this country at all.</P>
    <P>I apologise to Senators for thrusting my own business affairs on the notice of the Seanad.  I should have much preferred to discuss the matter with the Minister privately.  I attempted to do that through the good offices of one of the Fianna Fáil T. Ds. for Donegal, but as the Minister was engaged at the time with the Insurance Bill I could not see him, and I am obliged, therefore, to take this opportunity of bringing the matter before the House.</P>
    <P>I want to give the Minister an instance of how my business is hampered, especially my export trade. About two months ago, a Glasgow firm sent us a fairly large order for shirts which had to be made from material called white repp.  The material required for that order is not made in the Saorstát, and being over 4½ ounces to the square yard is dutiable. The firm's order was sent to the Minister's Department with an explanation that the repp was not procurable here and that we would require a licence to import, free of duty, the material necessary in order to fulfil this export order.  We had to write twice before we got an answer, and, finally, we got an answer refusing our application.  We then had to write, three or four weeks afterwards, to our customer in Glasgow explaining that we could not fulfil the order.  That is not a very nice way of encouraging an export trade.  We lost that order.  The same is happening in regard to webbing for collars.  There is a certain class of shirts made of high-class poplin and the customer requires the collars to be lined with webbing.  We have had to refuse English orders because we could not <Col N="1343" /> get the webbing required for the collars of this particular class of shirt.  There are no mills in this country making this webbing.  When you speak to any of the managers they tell you that they have no intention whatever of making this material which is, in fact, made by very few mills in Lancashire.  Yet, a duty is put on it though it cannot be to protect Irish industry.  It looks to me as if it was just to get revenue, and to hamper our export trade.</P>
    <P>It is the same in regard to interlining for dress shirts.  There is a duty put on that also.  The result is that as the duties that have to be paid on the raw materials are almost as heavy as the duties on the finished article, dress shirts and white collars are now being imported with consequent loss of orders and loss of employment to the workers with firms which could engage in the manufacture of these articles. It may be that the number of firms engaged in the export trade, or in the manufacture of dress shirts and white collars is too small for the Minister's Department to be seriously concerned about it.  But, one would think that firms that have been giving employment in this country for generations should, at least, have the same consideration from the Minister's Department as newly-established firms.  I do not want to be offensive, but I certainly think that native firms should have the same consideration as British-controlled firms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know if we could have an assurance from the Minister that the quality of the grass-seeds produced in the Saorstát will be quite as good and available at as reasonable a price as those which we have been accustomed to get.  Will he say if the amount produced in the Saorstát will be sufficient to meet the needs of the farmers of the country? The grass-seeds are to be produced in the Ulster counties and, of course, farmers in other parts of Ireland would be only too willing to help that industry amongst their fellow-farmers in another part of the country if they could get an assurance that both quality and price will be satisfactory, and that a sufficient quantity will be <Col N="1344" /> produced to meet our needs in the Saorstát.</P>
      <P>I should like to make a remark about what the Minister said about industries in general.  We all agree with him that it is very desirable indeed to have industrial development. We would all like to help in that development.  We have never done otherwise.  No one has ever hampered in any way the development of industries. However, I must say this, that if the Minister was to put a new industry into every village it will not cure unemployment.  We know from the figures that industrial development is not curing unemployment; that unemployment is increasing to an alarming extent.  There is only one way in which unemployment can be cured, and the country put into a prosperous condition and that is by the Government removing the terrible restrictions that have been placed on the agricultural industry.  Until that is done the Minister's hope of curing unemployment is vain and futile. Until the agricultural industry is put on its feet there will be an increase in unemployment.</P>
      <P>With regard to the duties imposed on certain articles used in sport, many people consider that it is scarcely fair to discriminate between different forms of sport.  Articles used in certain sports are taxed while articles used in other forms of sport are not taxed.  I have heard a great deal of comment that it is unfair to discriminate. People should be allowed to buy the articles they require for sport without any discrimination being made in the way of taxation.</P>

With regard to Senator MacLoughlin's statement, I cannot presume to answer his remarks about thread.  The Minister is here for that purpose.  I must say that there has not been so much hulla-balloo about any factory established in this country, more slanderous statements made or more meetings held about it in the City of Dublin by the Wholesale Merchant Drapers' Association&mdash;who are anything but national&mdash; as the attempts that have been made to sabotage the Westport factory, ably assisted by Messrs.

      <P>A hullabulloo was created about this factory in Westport. It is the only factory of its kind established since the recent development of industry on the western seaboard. It is the only one there to which some little assistance and facilities were given, because the people behind it went down there to establish it.  I wish Deputies in the other House and Senators who are kicking up all the hullabulloo, and who object to the facilities that were given as an inducement to have the factory started in Westport went to Lad Lane in Dublin where a store is crammed with thread.  Anyone who knows anything about the thread business knows that. It has not been repudiated.  Who is responsible for that?  The Merchant Drapers' Association of this city ably assisted by the thread combine in England, primarily Coats.  The thread combine in England paid half if not all the tariff on that thread.  At least, some of us know that they paid half of it.  What was all that for but to sabotage an Irish industry?  Yet members of the Oireachtas got up and, assisted by propaganda, and used the privileges of the House in order to justify what was done.  An Irish industry would never be started were it not for tariffs.  Once it is admitted that tariffs are necessary, why should people go and assist those who try to keep outside the tariffs?  A famous combine in England succeeded in doing that.  The whole thing is mean, and the worst meanness was the suggestion that British thread mills were above criticism.  The thread made in Westport has stood the test of competition of the British industry, but because the factory was established in Westport we have had a hullabulloo. Why did not these people have something to say about Dunlops, or rubber shares, or about the price of tyres being increased?</P>

There could be a lot in what Senator MacLoughlin says and I have sympathy with his point of view.  As a manufacturer, he is undoubtedly entitled to his licence.  He has admitted that other people got any amount of licences, but obviously they got them because they were entitled to them. There must be some snag in his case or he would have got his licence too.</P>

      <P>I hold no brief at all for officials, and probably the Senator is right.  Officials are not infallible and my own personal opinion is that there is too much damned officialism, if you like.  It cannot be got over, but instead of whining about not getting what he is entitled to, the Senator should go after it until he gets it.  Officials make mistakes often, one would think, purposely, but that is the curse of the present day system. There is too much officialism in every Department and too much interference with the individual.  I have always had that view, but you cannot get away from it if you are to have proper conditions in and development of your country.  Consequent on that interference, there are bound to be mistakes and the Senator happens to be one of the victims.  However, it is good to have arguments of this kind which give some of us an opportunity to give off what we have at the backs of our minds.  I am quite satisfied that <Col N="1348" /> the Minister when replying will make a much better case against the Senator than the Senator made in what he said.</P>

      <P>So far as almonds are concerned, there is not a duty of £40 per ton on almonds.  There is a duty of 33? per cent. <i>ad valorem.</i>  The price of almonds was not increased in consequence of the Order, but the price of dressed almonds has been increased recently because the price of the raw materials has been going up all over the world for various causes which it is not necessary to enter into now. There has been no increase because of the Order and these dressed almonds are available here at the same price as that at which they are available elsewhere.  So far as grass seeds are concerned, the Minister for Agriculture has full control over the quality of grass seeds offered for sale by seed merchants and is particular to see that only seeds of suitable quality are in fact sold.  I think there has been no complaint on the ground of the price at which the clean seed has been available, and this year, at any rate, there will be no difficulty in the matter of quantity.  Therefore, on the points made by Senator Miss Browne, particularly as to quantity and quality of grass seeds, I think she will find that, circumstances will be satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to sports goods, we are not of course discriminating between forms of sport nor are we preventing people from getting any implements that are used in sport. Certain sports goods &mdash; hockey sticks, tennis rackets, cricket bats and articles of that kind &mdash; are made liable to a protective duty because they are being manufactured here, just as football covers are made liable to a protective duty because they are manufactured here, and just as possibly in the future other sports requisites will be made here and then be made liable to duty.  It does not follow that people who engage in these forms of sport are in any way discriminated against.  The implements necessary for the sports will be available from Irish factories, and, in this particular case, they will be manufactured by a firm that has associated with it <Col N="1349" /> another firm of first class technical reputation in these matters and at prices which will, I think, be found satisfactory in comparison with the prices at which the goods have been available previously.</P>
    <P>With regard to thread, I recollect the complaint made by Senator MacLoughlin when the matter was here before which he substantiated by supplying to me certain figures representing, he purported, the prices at which certain classes of thread were procurable from Westport and procurable from outside the country.  I had that complaint investigated and I came to the conclusion that the prices were not comparable because the qualities were not the same.  I was under the impression that I had communicated the result of that inquiry to Senator MacLoughlin.  If he states that he did not receive the letter, some mistake must have occurred.  I am speaking entirely from recollection, but I will look into the matter and see if I can send him the explanation even now, although it is somewhat belated.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to Westport is that the licence which has been issued to that company is subject to a condition that the price ex-factory at Westport of the thread produced by them will not be greater than the price charged by the British Thread Mills Ltd. for the same thread produced at Leicester.  That is a condition of their licence.  If they depart from that condition, the licence can be revoked, and it is therefore a matter of concern for the Department of Industry and Commerce to keep the position under review in order to enforce that condition.  So far as household thread is concerned, I think there can be no question that that condition is being fulfilled.  In fact, the price of Westport household thread is definitely cheaper than the British thread.  So far as the manufacturers' prices are concerned, I had no complaints until recently, but, as I stated in the Dáil last week, some complaints were received recently, arising out of which a conference was held this morning in the Department between representatives of the Westport <Col N="1350" /> firm and of the manufacturers who made the complaints.  What the result of that conference is I cannot say, because I do not know.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that letters were actually sent from Westport stating that their price was higher?  I have actually seen such a letter and I can send a copy to the Minister if he wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of that.  The point I want to make is that the Department would be glad to get any complaints of that kind and to investigate them because it has a duty <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Westport company &mdash; the duty of enforcing the condition which is in their licence and which, if departed from consistently, would necessitate revocation of the licence.  There may have been, and possibly are, certain difficulties which the firm are experiencing at this stage of the development which will not arise later.  As I explained before, the industry is being established in stages. One stage is being completed and the next stage, which involves the dyeing of the thread, is being undertaken now.  The extension to the works is at present being made and the new buildings being constructed and possibly will be ready for operation somewhere early next year.  Then there will be the third and final stage to be taken after that, on the completion of which every process of thread manufacture will be undertaken at Westport.  The firm has been making very good progress.  I said in the Dáil last week that they were employing 50 hands.  I find that I understated the position very considerably because there are in fact over 75 hands employed at present on the first stage of the development. That number will increase considerably as the other processes of manufacture are undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as licences are concerned, I think Senator MacEllin was unfair to the wholesale drapers.  So far as I, am aware, the wholesale drapers have given the Department every assistance in getting over the difficulties associated with the establishment of this industry.  At the Drapers' Chamber <Col N="1351" /> of Trade it was pressed strongly that the temporary regulation of the imports of household thread should be effected by issuing one licence only, namely, to the Westport company.  We adopted that arrangement as a temporary device.  It is not a suitable arrangement, from our point of view, although it met the difficulties of the wholesale drapers.  The Drapers' Chamber of Trade has, at all times, shown goodwill to the enterprise and a desire to co-operate with the Department in assisting it along.  Difficulties have, no doubt, been occasionally experienced by manufacturers.  I am anxious to avoid the possibility of these complaints arising.  I cannot, of course, deal now with the circumstances of individual licences but I should like to assure Senator MacLoughlin and other members of the House that the policy of the Department is to see that licences are issued for the importation free of duty of thread where it is clear that similar thread cannot be procured from Westport within a reasonable time.  These are the instructions which the officers of the Department who are dealing with the matter have received. Senator MacLoughlin went, perhaps, somewhat beyond the scope of this measure by dealing with the question of certain classes of cloths.  There are difficulties &mdash; quite considerable difficulties &mdash; in administering the duties on certain classes of cotton cloths.  So far as repp cloth, to which the Senator referred, is concerned, it is not possible to issue licences when that cloth is being imported for the manufacture of shirts for the home trade.  I am not sure that the Department appreciated that Senator MacLoughlin, in the case he referred to, required the cloth for his export business.  Where the goods produced from the cloth are to be exported, it should be possible to issue licences for its importation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMacLoughlin" hpid="Mr. MacLoughlin Mr. MacLoughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I sent the Department the original order from the Glasgow firm, so that they knew the cloth was to be used for export purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall look into the matter.  I am merely stating what the position is so far as that cloth is concerned. <Col N="1352" /> Although full quantities of it are not being produced yet, it is not possible to issue licences for its importation. There has been more successful evasion of that particular duty than of most duties and, at the present time, the operation of it is being examined with a view to seeing what changes may be necessary to make it effective. Where cloth of that kind is required for export, I think we shall be able to meet the firms concerned, although I say that without having first examined the administrative difficulties that may arise.  On principle, I should be quite sympathetic to the idea and if possible I shall arrange to have it given effect.</P>
      <P>These were the principal points mentioned arising out of the actual provisions of the Orders that are being confirmed by this measure.  I do not think I need at this stage deal with questions of general industrial policy and their effect on employment.  These matters are generally debated in another place.  They have been debated for a long time and will, no doubt, be debated for a long time to come.  The sole purpose of this measure is to deal with the particular matters mentioned in the Schedule.  So far as they are concerned, I think a good case can be made for every one of them, irrespective of what general policy may be at any time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Minister for the promise of sympathetic consideration of applications for licences for import of material required for export orders.  As regards the quality of the thread, I want to explain to him that it was tested by experts.  The quality of the Westport three-cord thread was equal to that of Coats or the combine at 54/- and slightly better than the thread in Derry at 45/-.  The six-cord 40 thread, for which they wanted 147/-, was much inferior to the six-cord 40 thread used in Derry.  That is the truth.</P>

      <P>Section 1, sub-section (2).  After the word &ldquo;day&rdquo; in line 18 to insert the words &ldquo;or days&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The object of the first two amendments is the same.  I should not press the amendment strongly on the Minister if he definitely prefers the Bill as it stands, but I should like to give him my reasons why I think some such amendment desirable.  A number of sections of the Bill might quite properly come into force immediately. In respect of other portions of the Bill, a considerable amount of care would have to be exercised and time given perhaps for licensing.  Special provision may have to be made in certain cases after consultation with employers and employed.  If the section stands as it is the Minister will have to do either of two things&mdash; bring the Act into force with grave risk of a certain amount of dislocation because particular matters have not been dealt with or delay the operation of the Bill until these matters are dealt with.  My suggestion is that the Minister should adopt the practice adopted by the Government in other Acts, notably the Road Traffic Act, and take power to bring specific sections into force on different dates.  It is entirely a matter of administrative convenience, and my object is to make the Act work as smoothly as possible and not to delay the bringing into operation of sections which do not require adjustment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I should like to see any section of the Bill brought into force until organisation has been created in the Department to deal with its implementation and examine any question which may arise <Col N="1354" /> affecting any particular industry.  I stated here on Second Reading that two months at least would be required from the passing before the bringing into operation of the Act.  During that period of two months we shall be able to make the necessary arrangements to bring the whole of the Act into operation.  We have already taken steps to deal with certain work necessary to make the Act effective, and a staff has been put on that work.  I expect that we shall be in a position two months after the passing of the Bill to bring it generally into operation.  Consequently, I do not think that the Senator's amendment is necessary.  If possible, I should rather see the whole Bill come into operation simultaneously. Otherwise certain difficulties might arise.  I can assure the Senator that we shall not make an Order bringing the Act into operation until we are satisfied that the possibility of difficulties arising in a particular industry has been eliminated by regulations or orders, to be given effect simultaneously with the operation of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I may point out first to the Minister that this would not prevent him bringing it before us at once.  It is entirely to provide him with the power which he will require in case the period will be much longer than he expects it will be. I might be able to point out to him in several sections difficulties which he may not be able to overcome in two months.  If the Minister does not want to have the power and assures us that he will be ready, it is not for me to press him.  I am suggesting that if he is wise he will take it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  In this Act the expression &ldquo;industrial work&rdquo; does not include agricultural, commercial, nor <Col N="1355" /> domestic work nor mining nor the transport of persons or goods, but subject to that limitation the said expression includes all forms of industrial work and in particular industrial work done for or in connection with any of the following activities, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  manufacturing, altering, cleaning, repairing, ornamenting, finishing, adapting for sale, testing, grading, packing, breaking up, demolishing or transforming any article.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">

      <P>I move amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 3, sub-section (1).  To delete in line 26 the word &ldquo;altering.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 3, sub-section (1).  To delete in line 26 the word &ldquo;repairing.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 3, sub-section (1).  To delete in line 27 the words &ldquo;adapting for sale.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it will save the time of the House if I discuss amendments Nos. 3, 4, and 5 together.  Perhaps I should say first that on the Second Stage I criticised the rather unsatisfactory definition of &ldquo;industrial.&rdquo;  The Minister replied that it was taken from the Washington Hours Convention and they did not seem to be able to do it any better.  I am afraid I am not able to do any better either.  I do not like negative definitions, but I assume that it cannot be greatly improved upon.  It is probably assumed that every one knows what industrial work is.  It may be that these amendments are not necessary, but my object was to draw attention to a contradiction in the definitions of industrial work which you will find from (a) to (n) in the section and to suggest that some of those are definitely contradictory to the expression &ldquo;commercial work.&rdquo;  It may be that if you can prove it is &ldquo;commercial work&rdquo; then it will be excluded from it under Section 3 (1), because industrial work does not exclude commercial work.  I am not satisfied that that is the case and I want to suggest to the Minister that he might be able to improve it. <Col N="1356" /> I am in the position of having to confess that as far as Nos. 3 and 4 are concerned, simple deletion might not entirely meet the case.  This does not purport to be a complete dictionary of every kind of industrial work, but you find that the definition of commercial work is &ldquo;work done for or in connection with the sale, wholesale or retail, of any article.&rdquo;  We have &ldquo;altering and adapting&rdquo; in conjunction with every kind of sale in the drapery business as well as in some other businesses, and if it be held that altering, repairing or adapting for sale, particularly the first of the three, may be industrial work, then you will have every drapery establishment in the Saorstát applying under Section 4 to be exempted from the Bill on the ground that it is only a very small portion of industrial work which, undoubtedly, it is.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I am not going against the workers' point of view.  In the greater part of the trade, generally speaking, there are better conditions than those provided for by this Bill.  I understand this is part of the Government's plan and that there will be a Bill dealing with the distributive trades later on, and I suggest that incidental work, such as altering work, should not be industrial work within this Bill.  It might be better &mdash; here I am arguing against my own amendment &mdash; to leave the words &ldquo;altering&rdquo; and &ldquo;repairing&rdquo; and put in a paragraph at the end providing for cases &ldquo;other than in connection with sale.&rdquo;  That might get over the difficulty.  When you come to No. 5, &ldquo;adapting for sale,&rdquo; it might not be put down as one of the specific things to which you draw attention in commercial work when you have a definition of commercial work.  When you put an amendment down and think over it later you sometimes see a better way in which you might have put it.</P>
    <P>I suggest that something might be done to get over this possible difficulty between commercial and industrial work, and if it was put in, &ldquo;in regard to altering and repairing, except in connection with sale,&rdquo; and the words <Col N="1357" />&ldquo;adapting for sale&rdquo; taken out, it would probably help the situation considerably. What I have in mind, and what the Minister has in mind, I think, is this: He wants to get all this work done in the factory and if it goes back to the manufacturer for repair he wants it covered and quite properly.  But there is no danger, even in the case of a manufacturer, of claiming exemption, as it would never pay to take one assistant and say: &ldquo;This is an assistant for repairing&mdash; therefore, it does not come under the heading of industrial work.&rdquo;  In the case of the retailer this work is of a small character which must often be done for a customer, but when you connect it with Section 55 you will get a peculiar situation in connection with retail trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the amendments ought not to be passed because they aim at removing from the definition section, which affects the whole Bill, these classes of operation which are at present covered in almost identical terms by the existing law. So far as they concern night work, young persons in industry, women employed in industry and the minimum age for admission of children to industrial employment these three items are covered by the Act of 1920.  The definition which is referred to speaks of industrial undertakings, &ldquo;including particularly the industries in which articles are manufactured, altered, cleaned, repaired, ornamented, finished or adapted for sale.&rdquo;  So far as this inclusion is concerned, they are practically identical with the Bill.  If, in this definition section, we remove these three terms, &ldquo;altering,&rdquo;&ldquo;repairing&rdquo; and &ldquo;adapting for sale,&rdquo; it is removing those operations and excluding them from the value of the Act concerning employment of young persons, employment of children and night work for women.  Whatever may be said in favour of the argument that the Senator has put forward it is covered, as I see it, by the power given to the Minister in Section 29 to make regulations declaring any specified form of industrial work to be excluded industrial <Col N="1358" /> work.  If a case can be made for any special exemption the power is there in that section in respect of particular operations and covering particular parts of the Act.  I am sure, however, that the Seanad does not want to exclude the provision prohibiting the employment of young persons, even in adapting or repairing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to exclude that at all from industrial work, but the difference in the Bill is that, as Senator Johnson points out, it says, &ldquo;Industries which include the following.&rdquo;  If it were only that I would not have one word to say, but unfortunately we have here a definition of industrial work.  I do not want to exclude anything whatever from what is generally known as industrial work, but I want the distributing trade and the things incidental to it dealt with under another Bill, and I suggest that the Minister obviously means that when you come to sub-section (2) of Section 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out that there is a great danger in removing these terms from this definition and that, in the interregnum between the passing of this Bill and the passing of the promised Bill touching commercial work, the protection for which Senator Douglas is pleading can be provided by the use of this Section 29 and the granting of exclusion regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Senator Johnson is quite right in what he said in reference to the three amendments. It seems to me that, although these amendments might meet the case stated by Senator Douglas, they do not meet every case.  Take, for example, the case of providing flowers for funerals and things like that.  Is that an industrial occupation?  Is it agricultural?  Is it horticultural?  Or is it industrial?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, which is it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, now, that is just the difficulty.  I have in my mind the case of horticulturists &mdash; people who sell flowers for crosses and wreaths, and things like that.  They get an order for the flowers at 7 o'clock in the evening <Col N="1359" /> and these flowers must be delivered immediately.  The cutting up of the flowers, working them up, and mounting them on wires &mdash; all that must be done immediately the order is received. They are usually required promptly for either a funeral, a wedding, or some other function.  I think the difficulty arising in such a case would not be met by Senator Douglas's amendment, but, with Senator Johnson, I think that it could be met by the Minister exercising to the full the powers which he has under Section 29, sub-section (1); that is, the Minister may make regulations declaring any specified form of industrial work to be excluded, industrial work for the purpose of all or any of the sections of this part of the Act.</P>

      <P>No, but he could exclude them for the purpose of some sections of the Act and not for the purposes of other sections.  I think it might be better, instead of passing these amendments, to rely on the power given to the Minister under sub-section (1) of Section 29.  At the same time, I am glad to have the opportunity of bringing to the Minister's mind the case of florists and people like that who have business in this city and whose position is rather undefined &mdash; whether they are agricultural, horticultural or industrial. In any case, I think they are people who are entitled to an exemption under Section 29, sub-section (1).</P>

      <P>I am going to suggest to Senator Douglas that his amendments should not be pressed, but for somewhat different reasons than those advanced by Senator Johnson or Senator Comyn.  Senator Douglas started off by saying that we have here a definition of industrial work.  That is precisely what we have not got.  I could not tell him what is the exact significance of the phrase &ldquo;adapting <Col N="1360" /> for sale,&rdquo; or, for that matter, the phrase &ldquo;repairing or altering&rdquo;; no more, I think, than the Senator himself could tell me.  The phrases and words are in there because they are in the Washington Hours Convention and because they have been used in connection with similar legislation.  The point, however, which, I take it, Senator Douglas wants to deal with, is the possibility of a worker, who is engaged in work in connection with a commercial establishment, being held as coming within the scope of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator will look again at the section he will see that we are not defining industrial work but that we are saying that the Bill covers industrial work done for or in connection with these particular activities and, therefore, we are, in a sense, begging the question.  Whether particular work is industrial work or not will have to be determined otherwise; but whether or not it is done in connection with such activities as adapting for sale or repairing or altering, nevertheless, it comes within the scope of the Bill, and therefore we say that when industrial work is done in connection with adapting for sale or repairing or altering, the worker involved comes within the scope of the Bill; but if commercial work comes in he does not, and we attempt to define what the work is.  I agree that it is not a 100 per cent. satisfactory arrangement, but it is the only arrangement based upon the form which was adopted in the Convention to which I have referred, the terms of which we are taking and putting into this Bill. The question of what constitutes industrial work in the abstract is one which I think will be impossible to answer. If the amount of industrial work done in connection with any establishment is so small that the Act could not be conveniently applied, then, under Section 4, we have power to exclude the workers concerned from the scope of the measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>That, of course, is my real difficulty.  I think that there are somewhere about 10,000 or 11,000 <Col N="1361" /> drapers in the Free State &mdash; possibly more.  Take the case of adapting for sale, shall we say, a lady's frock, which practically always has to be adapted before its sale because we have not got the uniform woman yet and there is practically always some small alteration to be made.  Unless the Bill can be made quite clear &mdash; I am not saying for a moment that it will be so decided under the Bill &mdash; that that work, done in an ordinary shop, does not come under the Bill, the Minister will have an application for exemption under Section 4 from about 10,000 persons.  I want to avoid that if I possibly can, because I do not think it is intended. I know that I more or less gave my case away at the beginning by saying that I was not going to press the amendments because I was not sure that they would achieve the object they intended.  I realise that there are difficulties.  Of course, I had seen the Minister's point with regard to industrial work, and whether it is industrial work in connection with other things. But when you come to sub-section (2) it is by no means so simple, because you find that work is work done for or in connection with sale.  Now, I have no doubt that if there were a case of some considerable importance in that connection, my friend, Senator Comyn, could show at very considerable length that there is no work done in connection with the manufacture of ordinary goods that is not for the sale of the goods.  I do not know of any manufacturers who do work on goods except for the sale of them.  I suggest to the Minister that between this and Report Stage he should consider whether he could not help in this matter by introducing either in sub-section (1) of Section 3 or in sub-section (2) of Section 3 something that would make clear what I believe is the intention; that is to avoid industrial work which is done on the premises where the main purpose is the sale of goods, whether wholesale or retail.  I think it is necessary to exempt work in which the main purpose is the sale.  Let all work in industry mentioned by Senator Johnson come under this Bill.  We do not want anything in industry that does not come under the Bill.  Certainly, as <Col N="1362" /> far as I am concerned, I do not, except office work, which is to come in under another Bill and which can easily be defined as ordinary clerical work.</P>

      <P>I just want to say this, that Section 29 does give power of excluding any form of work.  It is mainly, however, in relation to Part III of the Bill that any difficulties may arise.  A general exclusion can be applied if it is found necessary to do so rather than dealing with a large number of individual applications under Section 4.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that the Minister has sufficient power in the Bill to exclude, but I have grave doubts as to whether he will be able to do that under Section 29 where he has to make a definition.  I doubt if he will be able to succeed with his Order under Section 29 if he fails here to get a definition to deal with the specific kind of work that I want defined.  I do not want to deal with this matter so far as it concerns myself personally.  I want to point out to the Seanad that there is general uneasiness about it.  Quite a large number of traders have come to me within the last fortnight pointing out their uneasiness about different points. There is uneasiness in the trade.  I am most anxious to avoid a situation in which it would be necessary to make a large number of applications with all the trouble, delay and uneasiness that that would involve.  I think the Minister will find it difficult to do under Section 29 what I am seeking by means of a general order because there again he has to define the particular kind of work.  Could the Minister not consider making it commercial work done in connection with sale on premises: that is, on premises where the main work is sale.  I think if the Minister could put that into a suitable form of words that it would probably get over the difficulty.</P>

      <P>The object of this amendment is to ensure that the Minister will have power, when issuing a licence under sub-section (2) of Section 4, to insert conditions.  If a licence is to be given exempting the licence holder from the conditions of the Bill in any respect, then the position of the worker employed in the industry concerned will be worsened unless conditions, at least as restrictive, as these at present in operation under the Factory and Workshops Act, are imposed in the licence.  This Bill does repeal certain sections of the Factory Acts and these sections will not apply after this Bill is passed.  If a licence is given to carry on any operations without conditions being imposed in the licence, then the effect will be that the present law regarding employment will have been abrogated.  What I am asking in this amendment is that the Minister shall have power to insert in the licence certain conditions. I would hope that the conditions will, at least, ensure that there will not be any loosening of the regulations governing the conditions of employment.</P>

What the <Col N="1365" /> amendment seeks is that if permission is given the conditions that would normally apply under the Acts that are being repealed should continue, and that these should be inserted in the licence.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to clear up a matter that may have caused some anxiety to the House owing to the observations of Senator Comyn.  As Senator Farren said, it is perfectly obvious to anyone who reads the amendment that the object is to give the Minister power to place conditions upon the licences he is to grant under the section, and not to give a licence to a person without any restrictions or limitations.  That is all the Senator wants.  Instead of being an enabling section for the Minister it is one limiting his powers, and obviously is as construed in other Acts of Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to point out something like what Senator Comyn has pointed out.  It seems to me that this amendment as it now stands is definitely objectionable.  The <Col N="1366" /> object of the section is to deal with trades not dealt with by the Bill, trades that do an infinitesimal amount of industrial work.  If the Minister carries out the intention, as I have no doubt he will, he would only give exemptions where for all practical purposes the amount of work is very small.  Senator Farren's argument forgets that the most that can happen is the giving of a licence affecting a small number of workers.  The other workers in that industry do not come under the Bill; if a substantial number of workers are affected the Minister has no right to give a licence under these provisions.  As the amendment stands, to a firm employing 200 people, only four of whom are doing industrial work, the Minister could say: &ldquo;You are only getting a licence for the four.&rdquo;  I do not want the Minister to exempt firms doing industrial work generally.  The provision as it stands is reasonable.  It would be ridiculous to give the Minister autocratic powers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Douglas objects to giving the Minister power, but in opposing the amendment he does not object to the employer being left free to do what he likes with the workers.  He said that very few firms would be affected by this amendment. A few moments ago he assured the Minister that if he did not do something to exclude portion of another class, he would have 10,000 applications to do so.  I suggest that that is a contradictory attitude.  The basis of the amendment is to leave the workers exempt under the Bill in no worse position than they were.  When this Bill comes into operation certain sections of the Factory Acts go by the board, and employees might have no regular meal hours.  For instance, in repair work, there might be no regulations to deal with the position.  Notwithstanding the advice of Senator Comyn, we think it better to give power to the Minister, rather than give unlimited, power to the employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion appears to be wide of the mark.  The occasion <Col N="1367" /> for this amendment arose out of the existing Factory Acts.  Senator Johnston and Senator Farren suggest that their purpose is to ensure that where an exclusion permit is given under Section 4, the workers will be subject to the existing Factory Acts.  It is because experience has shown that it is not possible or convenient to apply the existing Acts that this amendment is necessary.  The class of case is one I mentioned in the Dáil: Woolworths, where a machine was put on the counter which produced visiting cards. One of the assistants turned a handle to produce the cards.  Woolworths then became a factory under the existing Acts, and were required to display notices as required by existing law and by the factory inspectors.  Possibly there are other cases where the amount of industrial work is so insignificant, in relation to the business carried on by a firm, or so small absolutely without relation to anything that the provisions of the existing factory and workshop code cannot be conveniently applied.  Then we take power to issue a permit which means that the workers concerned will not be regarded as industrial workers in the ordinary sense, but will be subject to whatever statutory provisions that may be adopted later to regulate the employment of commercial workers.  It is not possible to issue that permit subject to conditions.  The difficulty is that once a place was regarded as a factory, just as Woolworths became a factory in the circumstances mentioned, the provisions about inspection apply.  You do not avoid that position if you give an exclusion permit, subject to conditions, because if you make conditions they will be enforced, whereas the essence of the case you want to deal with is that of a firm where the amount of industrial work is so small that you cannot effectively enforce any conditions of an industrial kind, whatever conditions may subsequently be adopted to regulate the employment of commercial workers.  The workers concerned in the type of case in which permits will be given are properly commercial workers, and not industrial workers, and that is why this power <Col N="1368" /> of exclusion is retained.  It is not possible to exclude them from the provisions of this Bill, and to say that they are still subject to the factory and workshops code.  It is not possible to apply that code in the peculiar cases I have in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that if there is any machinery he can make it apply to the conditions of the licence.  There is no assurance that this undertaking is to be confined to so small a range as originally contemplated unless we have the perfect faith that all Ministers for Industry and Commerce that will follow the present Minister.  This provision in the section, as it stands, will mean that if he once gives a licence it is an open licence without any conditions whatever.  I suggest that the Minister ought to be placed in a position to require that a licence holder shall confine the exempted undertaking to that small degree of development that he contemplates at the beginning.  The position at present is that it is practically an invitation to the Minister either to refuse to give any licence, or to give an open licence to the licence holder, to progress and develop his undertaking so that he will come into competition and rivalry with every other undertaking carrying on similar business on a larger scale. But the persons employed in these small undertakings, as Senator Douglas has pointed out, in the aggregate, will be a very large number, and I think the Minister himself indicated that Senator Douglas's desires might be met under the provisions of Section 4.  If that is going to be the course there is going to be a very large number of people exempted from any protection under this Bill.  They may be scattered very widely over the countery&mdash;three here, four there and half-a-dozen elsewhere <Col N="1369" />&mdash;but they are going to be exempted and there are not going to be any conditions of employment covering them, because they have got an open licence without any condition at all.</P>

      <P>Having regard to what the Labour Party members have said, I speak with considerable diffidence on this matter, but it seems to me that this amendment as it stands is definitely against the interests of the workers for the reason that if you authorise the Minister to grant a licence without any conditions whatever it is perfectly clear that his granting of licences will be watched, and closely watched, and that they will be granted only in a very limited number of cases.  If you give the Minister power to make regulations, or if you give him power to grant a licence with such regulations as he might consider proper, he will proceed at first to make regulations for the benefit of the worker &mdash; little regulations here and little regulations there &mdash; and the thing will become easy, and finally he will grant a greater number of these particular licences, and ultimately supersede the beneficial provisions of this Bill altogether.  I do not say that the present Minister will do it, but you are opening the door now for a Minister easily, quietly and gradually to supersede this Bill altogether. These are the arguments I submit and I think they ought to carry some weight with the members of the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>I should point out to Senator Johnson that a licence is not issued for an indefinite period.  Under Section 2, it must be issued for a stated period and expire at the end of that stated period.  In any event, it can be revoked forthwith if it is found that the amount of industrial work in any establishment has so increased that such a permit should not have been given.  I think the meaning of sub-section (4) is quite clear from the wording:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the amount of any form of industrial work done in the carrying on of any undertaking is so small that in the opinion of the Minister the provisions of this Act cannot be <Col N="1370" /> conveniently applied to the employment of workers to do such form of industrial work in such undertaking.</P>
    <P>Then a permit may be granted.  The type of case intended to be met there is quite clear.  That type of case is one in respect of which it is not possible to apply the provisions of the existing Acts any more than the provisions of this Bill, because the workers concerned are properly commercial workers and should be made subject to the legislation that will be enacted, I hope, next year to regulate the conditions of employment of such workers.  The regulation of these conditions will probably be done by a separate organisation from the organisation which enforces the factories and workshops code and can consequently be more conveniently done by that organisation.</P>

I am speaking of a trade I know a great deal of and similar things occur in other trades. Many firms print their own window tickets and that is industrial work under the Bill, unless it is done for and in connection with sale, whatever that means.  It will, I think, possibly not be included, but, assuming that it is, there will be perhaps two people employed once a week for an hour or two on this work.  The Minister withdraws the licence on one day's notice and immediately the whole of the establishment are liable to have their meals at the one hour, which would be quite impracticable in the retail trade.  They will get a permit in seven or 14 days to exempt them from that: from the necessity to have meals at the one hour.  I am instancing, if you like, an absurdity, but it is the small points which we want to avoid having difficulty with.</P>

Fourteen days is a considerable period of time and it gives the idea that he has a vested right in the licence and the carrying on of the business provided for in the licence. The argument put forward by Senator Douglas in his last remarks was, I think, an extreme statement of the case.  I do not suppose that the present Minister, or any future Minister, will be so unreasonable as to withdraw a licence suddenly and without any cause whatever which would have the result of making all the people take their dinner at the same time. That, of course, would be a terrible thing.  The workers take their dinner at 1 o'clock and the employers at 7 o'clock.</P>

      <P>I would think that it is much better to leave the section as it <Col N="1373" /> is.  The Minister has discretion to issue licences and he should have discretion to revoke a licence, whether instantly or within 14 days.  The firm that was mentioned which had one person turning out a card might take in 1,000 people to do the same type of work.  Are they to be allowed to <Col N="1374" /> continue on 14 days' notice flagrantly to defy the Act of Parliament?  If anything ought to be left to the discretion of the Minister, it is the date on which a licence, if it is to be revoked, should be revoked.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 7.</P>
    <P>(1)  Subject to the provisions of this section, the following days and no other days shall be public holidays within the meaning and for the purposes of this Act, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Christmas Day, and</P>
    <P>(b)  St. Patrick's Day when it falls on a weekday or, when it falls on a Sunday, the next following Monday, and</P>
    <P>(c)  Easter Monday, Whit Monday, the first Monday in August, and also (if it falls on a weekday) St. Stephen's Day.</P>
    <P>(2)  Whenever in any year a day is appointed under the Public Holidays Act, 1924 (No. 56 of 1924), to be a bank holiday instead of a day mentioned in the next preceding sub-section of this section, the day so appointed shall in that year be deemed to be substituted in the said next preceding sub-section for the day so mentioned and that sub-section shall be construed and have effect accordingly.</P>
    <P>(3)  Any employer may, on giving not less than one month's previous notice to all persons in his employment, substitute in any year any of the following days for any of the days mentioned or deemed to be mentioned in paragraph (c) of sub-section (1)  of this section, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the 1st day of January,</P>
    <P>(b)  the 6th day of January,</P>
    <P>(c)  Ascension Thursday.</P>

    <P>(a)  the notice mentioned in the said sub-section shall be in writing and may be given to any person by handing a copy thereof to him personally or by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous position in the place in which such person is employed;</P>
    <P>(b)  no day mentioned in the said sub-section shall be substituted under that sub-section in a year in which such day falls on a Sunday;</P>
    <P>(c)  when a day mentioned in the said sub-section is substituted under that sub-section by an employer in respect of any year, the day so substituted shall, in that year and in respect of all persons employed by such employer, be a public holiday within the meaning and for the purposes of this Act instead of the day for which it is so substituted.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 7, sub-section (4).  Before paragraph (b) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b)  the day substituted for any day mentioned or deemed to be mentioned in paragraph (c) of sub-section (1) of this section shall be the day mentioned in the next preceding sub-section of this section which is immediately following the day for which it is so substituted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Bill as it stands, the bank holidays mentioned in sub-section (1), that is Easter Monday, Whit Monday, the first Monday in August and St. Stephen's Day, can be disallowed and the other days mentioned in sub-section (3) substituted for them.  As the Bill now stands, it will therefore be possible for an employer when giving a month's notice to his employees to substitute winter holidays for summer holidays by, say, selecting instead of Whit Monday and the first Monday in August two holidays in the winter months.  We feel that that was never <Col N="1376" /> intended in the Bill and that is why we move an amendment so that if there is any alteration it will be to the next succeeding holiday&mdash;in other words, to whichever of the holidays follows the one which he wants changed, so that the change will be in no way detrimental to the interests of the workers concerned.  I think the sense of the amendment ought to commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Bill was introduced only the public holidays mentioned in sub-section (1) were included and it was provided that these holidays would have to be given.  Subsequently representations were made by employers and others in various parts of the country to the effect that outside the cities and some of the large towns the practice was to observe Church holidays and not public holidays and that there should be power given to substitute in these parts of the country Church holidays for the public holidays.  These representations were so reasonable that the Bill was amended to provide for them.  There is a larger number of Church holidays than public holidays, and we do not think we ought to provide for more than six public holidays.  Therefore, a certain element of discretion must be used as to which Church holidays will be selected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand in some parts of the country different practices operate. Certain Church holidays are more generally observed than others in different parts of the country and on that account it is, perhaps, undesirable that we should specify the holidays that must be given under the Bill where the substitution is affected in the manner which the amendment proposes. Senator Duffy stated that as the Bill stands an employer is empowered to substitute winter holidays for summer holidays.  It is also true that he may substitute summer holidays for winter holidays and the effect of the amendment would be to prevent him doing that, but generally speaking, the effect of it will be to preserve the holidays more generally recognised and established by local practice.  The cases where employers <Col N="1377" /> will try to ring the changes on the workers will be very few indeed.</P>
    <P>In the majority of cases there will be full agreement between the two because they will be the holidays observed locally, whatever they may be, and no difficulty will arise, but in any event, we feel that as these holidays are to be observed the selection of them must be done by the person responsible for the direction of the business in so far as important considerations may arise in connection with seasonal work&mdash; where there may be a great rush of work at one period of the year and a slackness at another period.  Consequently, it is desirable that while securing adoption of the principle there should be allowed a certain element of discretion so that business will not be unduly interfered with, and therefore it is proposed to give employers discretion as to which of the Church holidays may be substituted for any of the four public holidays mentioned in sub section (1).</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in sympathy with the view expressed by the Minister to a large extent on the question of these Church holidays being substituted for public holidays in this sub-section of Section 7.  In large industrial centres the Church holidays are not kept, but in rural areas they are kept.  Bank holidays are not generally recognised in rural areas. We have no objection to the Church holidays being substituted for these bank holidays.  In rural areas the community usually works on Whit Monday, but on the 29th of June there is a Church holiday.  If Whit Monday is not kept we want to see that the holiday will be kept on June 29th. Similarly with the first Monday in August &mdash; if it is not desirable to keep the first Monday in August then the holiday to be observed would be that on the 15th August.  We have no objection to the substitution of Church holidays for these bank holidays that are being named, but we want to prevent holidays which fall in the summer being observed in November and December.  We think that the amendment put down by Senator Duffy is a reasonable one and ought to be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to supplement what has been said by pointing out that there is no suggestion in the section that an employer shall consult the desire of the workers in his employment in selecting the holiday to be observed.  One would hope that if the substitution takes place all the employers in the town would adopt the same alternative, but this makes provision for employer A making one arrangement and employer B making a different arrangement.  By that fact there is going to be a certain amount of dissatisfaction and probably discord unless there is some kind of restriction.</P>

      <P>I was very much impressed with the apprehension on the part of the mover of this amendment that there might be abuses of this power by employers.  I was very much impressed by the apprehension of my friend Senator Duffy, and those who are associated with him in this matter, but I was also impressed with another matter, which is this: It may be in the power of employers, either a number of them or perhaps not a great number of them, to do what is apprehended by the Senator who moves the amendment.  It may be in their power to do so if this amendment is not accepted, but I would venture to suggest that, if any employer abuses that power, or if numbers of employers abuse the power that they may have under the section as it stands, there is a way of dealing with them other than that provided by the amendment.  I do respectfully suggest that the way proposed by the amendment is unpractical and, I would almost venture to say, unprecedented. We must trust to the good sense and sense of fair play on the part of employers that they will not do any of these things that are apprehended by the movers of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the position at present is that in the parts of the country where the Church holidays are observed work is not done on these days.  This section provides that in future for six days they are to be paid as Senator Johnson points out. <Col N="1379" /> Similarly, in parts of the country where public holidays are observed they will continue to be observed, but in future the workers will have to be paid for these days instead of as in most industries up to the present.  It is true that the power of substitution might be used in an undesirable way, but I think it is so improbable that it is not worth while providing against it, particularly having regard to the fact that a certain amount of freedom of action is desirable when legislating for all classes of industries, seasonal industries as well as others, and where we cannot provide for the circumstances of them all.  This matter was discussed at considerable length in the Dáil and I was left at the end of the discussion as convinced as I had been at the beginning that the Bill is better as it stands than it would be if it were amended in the way that was proposed, and that is how I feel about this.  I do not think there will be .01 of 1 per cent. of employers who will try to abuse this power or who will try to break away from whatever is the established practice, and I think it is fair to allow them to take into account the special exigencies of their own businesses, particularly where the industry concerned is a seasonal industry. I think it will be found that in the majority of seasonal industries the rush of work comes in the winter and it will be in the winter period for that reason that most employers will prefer not to give holidays and to substitute summer holidays instead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand the Minister's attitude at all, because the Act provides that &ldquo;any employer may, on giving not less than one month's previous notice to all persons in his employment,&rdquo; substitute one of the Church holidays mentioned for one of the bank holidays.  The holidays we are concerned with all happen to fall on a Monday &mdash; Easter Monday, Whit Monday, and the first Monday in August.  Of course, St. Stephen's Day is the other one, but it is immediately after Christmas and joins up with Christmas Day to make a short holiday period.  The changing of a holiday from a Monday to a holiday <Col N="1380" /> which may fall on any day of the week is not as beneficial to the worker.  The workers generally have the week-end as well as the Monday. They have from mid-day on Saturday, Sunday and also Monday, perhaps to travel some distance and bring their families to visit friends, and they can enjoy themselves to a greater extent than they possibly could on a holiday which would take place, say, in the middle of the week.  That is one of the reasons for this amendment. The employer is vested by this section with power, of his own volition, to change any of these days and substitute another, and that is what we object to.  If it were laid down that the employer, should consult with his workers, or if it said &ldquo;after consultation with his workers&rdquo; or, &ldquo;the Minister after consulting with both parties,&rdquo; we could understand it; but it places the absolute power in the hands of the employer to change the holiday from an existing and well-recognised holiday, such as the Mondays I have referred to, and substitute a holiday such as the 1st November or the 8th December, or the 6th January, or any of the other Church holidays mentioned.  I think the amendment is a very reasonable one and I would ask the House to adopt it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it does, but we have whittled down our demands as far as possible so as to fall in with the ideas of the Minister in the matter, and with what we believe is the certainty of getting the amendment adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised at the Minister's statement in reply to Senator Duffy.  When Senator <Col N="1381" /> Duffy pointed out that the section as it stands means that an employer could substitute for three summer holidays three winter holidays, the Minister said that he could do the reverse also and give the worker the benefit of three summer holidays in lieu of three winter holidays.  I noticed that that statement was made in the other House and I should like to know from the Minister how it would be done.  As far as I know, there are only four holidays in paragraph (c), and only one of them that might be considered a winter holiday &mdash;St. Stephen's Day&mdash;while, on the other hand, the employer is given the opportunity of substituting from five holidays that are not in the summer holiday period.  The Minister also went on to say that in his opinion employers would do the decent thing regarding the changing of the public holiday to the Church holiday. Undoubtedly, the great bulk of employers will, but as the position is at present, it leaves it to the employer, who is permitted to take advantage of the position, to use that position to his own personal advantage. I think that the Minister knows industrialists in this country sufficiently well to know that they will miss no advantage that they can possibly get, and I think that for that reason the House should adopt this amendment.  It places every employer in exactly the same position. If an employer wants to open up his premises on the first Monday in August, which is undoubtedly a better holiday for the workers than the 15th August, he has got to give the holiday on the 15th August.  Surely there is nothing unfair in that.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach asked whether Senator Duffy's amendment means that the employer and worker will be prevented from agreeing on the particular day.  As it stands it prevents an employee from agreeing because it gives the employer the absolute right to fix the day.  This right to substitute a public holiday for a Church holiday is going to put the worker in a worse position than he is at present, because under the Factory Acts an employer has to give an employee at least three public holidays between <Col N="1382" /> the 16th March and the 1st of October. Instead of that, the employer is now going to be put in the position of choosing for himself any of those holidays which he thinks will suit his interests best, and which, in many cases, will be used to the detriment of his competitors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Johnson made a statement which impressed me very much, and that was that some employers, particularly in towns, may choose a day for the holiday which, with other employers, may be a working day.  The Minister should make some provision to guard against that, because if that kind of thing were to be done it would be very disagreeable. It would be resented, I think, by a great many workers if they had to work when other people were on holidays.  I suggest to Senator Duffy that he should withdraw the amendment and have a consultation with the Minister with a view to bringing in an amendment that would guard against a possibility of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelStaines" hpid="Mr. Staines Mr. Staines">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree either with the amendment or with the section in the Bill.  Candidly, I am in favour of the Monday holiday.  I disagree with the proposal which has been put forward that we should substitute Church holidays for the bank holidays.  My reason for that is this: I have been in Dublin now for 30 years, and while I have had to attend to my business during that time, I have managed to cycle Ireland during week-ends.  I always appreciated the week-ends.  The holiday on a Monday was much better for me, and for every worker behind a counter, than a holiday in the middle of the week. If Senators look at this from the point of view of the health of shop workers, it is much better that they should get off at 1 o'clock on Saturday and return to work on Tuesday than that they should get off at 1 o'clock on Saturday, return on Monday morning, and then have a holiday on Wednesday.  From the Church point of view, there has been a lot of talk about certain parts of Ireland which keep Church holidays.  The diocese of Ferns is the only one in <Col N="1383" /> Ireland that I know of that observes the Church holidays, and so far as the workers in Dublin are concerned, that arrangement did not work out well for them.  You always had excursions from Wexford on those days.  Cheap fares were given by the railway company which Wicklow people also availed of.  The result was that if a shop assistant in Dublin did not get Mass on a Catholic holiday before he went into work, he could not assist at it later in the day, due to the influx to Dublin of people from Wexford and Wicklow.  A holiday on a Saturday or a Monday would, in my opinion, be preferable to a holiday in the middle of the week.</P>

      <P>I want to correct the statement that has been made by Senator Staines, that there is only one diocese that observes Church holidays. I can state that all the dioceses in the North observe the Church holidays, and that, no matter what decision may be come to on this amendment, they will continue to do so.  I think there is a good deal in what has been said by Senator Duffy, that if the Monday is substituted it would be much more convenient and a better arrangement for the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement made by Senator Kennedy about the provision in the existing Factory Acts is quite misleading.  The holiday provision in those Acts only applies to women and children.  I have a great deal of sympathy with the idea that all factories in a town should fix on the one day, but that may be completely impossible.  There are certain factories that may never close even under this Bill, and that will not be required to close because of the fact that they are factories in which continuous process industries are being carried on.  Such factories are mentioned in the relevant sections of the Bill.  Furthermore, the conditions in various industries may be quite different. They may be different, for instance, in respect of the period during which they are working at highest pressure.  It is impossible, I think, to get uniformity in the matter of opening <Col N="1384" /> and closing hours, or even of days, although that has been done, to a great extent, in most cities and towns through the adoption of the public holidays.  But, even in some cities and towns some of those industries will have to work on the public holidays because of the nature of the work carried on in them, and provision is made for that in the relevant sections of the Bill.  Therefore, I should not like that the desirability of having that arrangement should weigh unduly with Senators.</P>

      <P>What we are proposing to do is to leave it to the employer. We think, now that we are imposing on an employer for the first time a statutory obligation to give to his workers six public holidays with pay, that it is not unreasonable, within the narrow limits of selection given to him, to allow him to select the days upon which he is going to give them pay.  Again, remember it is not a question of deciding on what days work will not be done, but rather the days on which the employer will be required to pay them, even though work is not done.</P>

Surely, there should be some provision made against a possibility of that kind.  We all know, and the Minister better than anyone else, that if one employer takes an advantage of the provisions in the Bill, that will be an inducement to many others, and that certain abuses will develop.  We are trying to anticipate that by pointing out to the Minister a way in which the very valuable efforts of the Government to ensure that workers will get holidays when they are most advantageous, will be maintained.  If the wording of the Bill is left in such a way that employers could use them as they wished, the efforts of the Government would be nullified.  Consequently, I suggest that the Minister should take power to safeguard the workers, and not to leave it to the employing class to decide when holidays will be given.</P>

      <P>(a)  three months after the date on which it is certified in writing sealed with the official seal of the Minister that evidence sufficient to justify the institution of such prosecution came into the possession or procurement of the Minister, or</P>

      <P>The object of this amendment is to provide some ultimate time limit within which there might be a prosecution. It applies to both worker and employer and it seems to me that a year after the offence is a reasonable period.

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Senator is aware, this section is taken from the unemployment insurance code and it is our experience under that code that very frequently we do not learn of the commission of an offence until a long time after it happens.  Take the case of a worker in regular employment for ten years who then loses his employment and goes to claim unemployment <Col N="1387" /> benefit; it may be found that his employer never stamped his card.  It is only when the claim was made that the offence was discovered.  That may go back for a number of years. Similar circumstances might arise here.  It is extraordinary how ignorant people are sometimes of their rights in legislation.  A worker in a place might not realise that he was entitled to a week's holidays in the year, and it might be only after three or four years that he realised that he was not allowed holidays.  If the usual provisions applied it would not be possible to go back and penalise the employer for having defaulted in the provisions of the Act.  Perhaps a worker might be an offender under other sections, and it would not be possible to penalise him except some such provision as this was in the Bill.  The existing procedure under the unemployment insurance code is working quite regularly.  As soon as evidence of the commission of an offence is forthcoming the Minister gives a certificate and on the basis of that certificate proceedings are taken.  It is proposed to institute the same procedure here.  The circumstances would be different if there was an overriding period of 12 months.  I think if there was to be a limitation it should be longer than 12 months, as certain evidence might not be forthcoming within the 12 months.</P>

I do not think the effect of the amendment would be to prevent a person getting back payment, because he could still sue for it.  I am dealing with prosecutions which are comparatively rare.  In the case of unemployment insurance the question of paying up and putting <Col N="1388" /> right bona fide arrears is common. There was nothing in my mind except with regard to making up anything done in error.</P>

      <P>Every regulation made by the Minister under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and if a resolution is passed by either House of the Oireachtas within the next subsequent 21 days on which that House has sat annulling such regulation, such regulation shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under such regulation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 10.  To delete in line 37 the words &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;within seven days.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the usual provision requiring that regulations made by the Minister shall be laid upon the Table of the House.  It is in the usual form, that is to say, providing that the regulations shall be laid &ldquo;as soon as may be.&rdquo;  I used to think these words &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; meant immediately and without any delay.  They have not been so interpreted by the authorities here, and I want more precision.  I suggest in the amendment that there should be a change, and that instead of &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; (which might be three months) it should be within a very short time. <Col N="1389" /> Under the Unemployment Assistance Act there is a provision of this kind. It is very important, because the habit is growing of giving power to the Minister to make regulations which have the force of law unless and until they are annulled by the Oireachtas.  Under the Unemployment Assistance Act we had a regulation which had to be laid on the Table and might be annulled by the House within a period of 21 days subsequent on which the House sat. Order No. 84 provided for the employment period beginning on the 17th day of April and ending on the 21st day of May.  That was signed and became effective on the 28th of March but was not laid on the Table until 4th June.  A second Order, dealing with the second employment period covering 17th of July to October 1st, was made on the 29th June and was not laid on the Table until 9th August. I have selected these two Orders out of a number of others because they concern the present Minister.  I have only mentioned these two cases because the Minister might know about them.  It is also not an infrequent happening for Orders of a similar kind to be made by other Departments, but not tabled for a considerable time after being made. It might well be that the value of the provision giving power to the House to annul an Order is lost utterly, because in the case of the two Orders I have quoted, the period concerned had practically lapsed before they were tabled.  That is a matter of considerable importance unless we are to have an understanding of what the phrase &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; means.  If it is insisted upon and thoroughly well understood that &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; means immediately, and without any interval of delay, it will certainly be within seven days, because before an Order is made it has at least to be typed, and a copy or two copies could be made of the typescript and the Order lodged with the officers of the House immediately.  There is no need to delay even seven days, but when we have delays of two, three and four months before Orders are tabled, it <Col N="1390" /> shows that there is no understanding of this phrase in the minds of the officials concerned.  It is an important matter and if there is going to be looseness in the observance of these regulations regarding the laying of Orders, it means that the authority of the Oireachtas is undermined and that the powers of the Oireachtas to check administrative faults is completely annulled.  Therefore, it is a very serious matter and I have taken this method of bringing it before the Minister.  I hope for all concerned that there will be a clear understanding of what the phrase means.  I am not sure whether it would not be desirable to put a very definite period as a headline for clauses of this nature in future Bills, but I should like to hear from the Minister how he interprets this phrase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The phrase &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; has been interpreted as &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; and has been always understood to have the same significance as &ldquo;forthwith.&rdquo;  I agree that it is very undesirable that there should be any delay in tabling Orders which have been made so that the power of either House of the Oireachtas to annual these Orders by resolution should not be impaired, but delays frequently occur when Orders have to be printed and translated into Irish before printing.  However, I think that difficulty could be overcome by arranging to table provisional typewritten copies of the Orders and furnishing printed copies later.  It is a matter I should like to look into.  I do not think, however, that Senator Johnson gets over the difficulty by suggesting that the Orders must be laid on the Table within seven days unless he also provides what is to happen if they are not so laid.  Even if that provision were in the Bill, and, through some mistake or otherwise, an Order was not tabled in seven days, it would be difficult to say what the position would be unless there were consequential provisions as well.  The best procedure, in my opinion, is to use the term &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; and to say that it means &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; in practice.  While I cannot say at the <Col N="1391" /> moment off-hand the reason for the delay in tabling the particular Orders to which the Senator referred, I agree that that delay should not have happened.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister realises the seriousness of this.  I put it to him especially because what seems to me to have led to this fault is the assumption that an Order that is made must be translated and printed before it is laid on the Table, while, as a matter of practice, in certain other sections of the Minister's Department, it is customary to lay the Orders on the Table in typescript.  In the cases in question we have Orders made in June and, according to the printers' superscription, printed in September.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I have made particular inquiry on that point.  While I am speaking of the Minister's Department, I could quote a number of other cases of other Departments. The Bacon and Pigs Quota Order &mdash; I think that is the Department of Agriculture &mdash; was made on 25th October and tabled on 4th December.  The Bacon and Pigs Quota (No. 2) Order is dated 31st October and laid on the Table on 4th December, and the Beef Voucher (Amendment) Order was made in August and tabled in December.  I think I could say the same about the Department of Local Government, so that there is a screw loose somewhere, and I hope the Minister will take whatever steps are necessary to direct the attention of the responsible people, at least in his own Department, to it. I expect that when he finds out the fault in his own Department he will find the fault in all the other Departments.</P>

      <P>I am afraid Senator Johnson will have to wait until somebody wealthy enough takes the case to the Supreme Court to find out the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; and what exactly happens <Col N="1392" /> when an Order is not put on the Table. It cannot invalidate anything done in the meantime, but if it was never put on, whether it is still valid is an important matter.  In view of the Minister's remarks, I have come to the conclusion that it does not mean anything at all.  It is merely an indication of what the House would like done, and I doubt very much if there is anything whatever to force the Minister to lay it on the Table at any time.  I doubt if the proposed seven days would force him.  It raises a very interesting constitutional point which I do not think was raised before, but I am inclined to think it does not mean anything.</P>

      <P>Section 15, sub-section (2).  To add at the end of the sub-section the words &ldquo;Provided that it shall not be obligatory on any employer to cease to employ a young person or young persons if the proportion fixed by such regulations is altered because of the temporary absence of any adult worker or workers in his employment&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not know that this is a perfectly satisfactory amendment, but it is designed to deal with a possible difficulty. It is not an uncommon thing to have agreements between employers and trade unions with regard to the number of workers and the number of young persons, and, where that is done, there is, of course, a certain amount of elasticity.  Where there is illness or anything of the kind, it is always arranged amicably.  I am assured of that by both sides.  When you come up against the law, it becomes necessary to have some little elasticity, and I think, whether this is the best way or not, it should be agreed that if you have proportions of, say, 25 per cent. young persons to 75 per cent. adults, you should not have to dismiss a young person because the absence of an adult sets the proportions wrong, at any rate, for a reasonable time.  That would not be done so far as any agreements are concerned, but we know now that an offence might be discovered ten years afterwards.  Departments and inspectors have to be rigid because there are, admittedly, people who will try to abuse these provisions, but I think there should be some elasticity provided in the Bill.</P>

That would be quite right if dealing with the person concerned, but where it is a question, possibly, of dismissing a young person because of the absence of another worker with whom he or she has nothing to do, the question of illness does not arise.  &ldquo;Temporary&rdquo; might be defined as four or five days.

      <P>Section 15, sub-section (4).  After the word &ldquo;who&rdquo; in line 47 to insert the words &ldquo;at the commencement of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (4) takes away from the Minister the power set out in sub-section (1) to prohibit the employment of young persons in certain forms of industrial work and to fix the proportion which the number of young persons may bear in certain industries to the number of other workers so employed.  We contend that in sub-section (4) the Minister is leaving it to the employer to decide how many young persons he shall have in his employment, irrespective of what order the Minister makes.  Assuming the Minister fixed the percentage of young workers at ten in a particular industry and there were 25 per cent. of young persons employed, there would be nothing to stop that employer from getting the additional 15 per cent. of young people indentured and, thereby, defeat the Minister's Order.  On the last occasion on which the matter was raised, the Minister had some doubt as to whether or not I understood the power given in this section.  I should like the Minister to understand the power he is giving to the industrialist to defeat, if he so desires, sub-section (1) of this <Col N="1395" /> section.  I know industries in which there is at present a very high percentage of young persons employed. I know that these industrialists will do everything they possibly can, when this Bill becomes law, to continue to employ the same number of young people.  If the Minister leaves sub-section (4) as it is, he will discover that the industrialists will take full advantage of it.  I do not say that there are not many industrialist who have regard for decent conditions in industry, but it is against the people who will not have that regard we have to legislate.  I know that while this Bill was being discussed in the other House, certain firms in Dublin were considering this section so as to defeat any restriction on the employment of juvenile labour that the Minister might impose.  If my amendment were adopted, it would prevent an employer from using sub-section (4) so as to defeat the object which the Minister has in view.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the matter is of very great importance. If the practice of evading the regulations made under this section were generally resorted to, it would be possible to deal with the position either by fresh regulations, made under the section, or by action under the Apprenticeship Act.  I agree that we have not many apprenticeship committees established under the Apprenticeship Act.  Bringing them into existence is rather a slow business, because the procedure to be followed is rather elaborate.  It is clear that if an employer in a particular industry sought to continue to employ an undue proportion of young persons by the practice of <Col N="1396" /> indenturing them as apprentices, he could be got at by the process of bringing that industry under the Apprenticeship Act and setting up an apprenticeship committee with power to settle, by regulation, the proportion of apprentices to be employed to adult trained workers.  On the other hand, there is not much of a case to be made against the Senator's amendment. I do not think that the amendment is of any great importance, and if the Senator desires to press it, I should be disposed to accept it. I think that the position will be much the same in either event.  If the Senator thinks that there are dangers which the acceptance of his amendment will obviate, that is an argument in favour of putting it in, but I do not think it will make a lot of difference.</P>

      <P>To delete the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the House will support me in my effort to have the section deleted. The arguments used on the Second Stage against my objection to this section were rather unfair.  Senator Foran said my opposition was &ldquo;feminism gone mad.&rdquo;  I should like to assure the Senator that I was never associated with the feminist movement. I was always in sympathy and, where I could do so, I helped it if it did not clash with the work in which I was always engaged &mdash; work for the freedom of my country.  That work is not yet completed and I have <Col N="1398" /> always felt that I required all my mind, heart and energy for that work. Therefore, though sympathetic to the feminist movement, I never associated myself with it, publicly or privately, and it was unfair to claim that it was a feminist objection on my part. When, if it occurs in my lifetime, we have obtained the full freedom of our country it is quite possible I will then join the feminists, but until then I am a Nationalist first.  I hope I will always be a Nationalist.  I think it was unfair for him to use that expression and in using it, I believe he knew my objection because, to some persons the feminist &mdash; particularly to men &mdash; is a horror.  My objection to this is on national grounds&mdash; not on the grounds of feminism.  I base it on the fundamental objects laid down in the 1916 Proclamation. That proclamation gave to every citizen equal rights and equal opportunities, and it seems to me that if you legislate against one section of the community, if you are going to curtail them in the way they are to earn their living, where are the equal opportunities provided for in that proclamation? I cannot see where they are.</P>
    <P>Another argument which Senator Farren used was that if this legislation was not passed we would have men minding the babies and keeping the house while the women went out to work.  My answer to that is that if men could do that job as well and as successfully as women, I do not see why they should not do it.  It is most important work for the nation, though rather sneered at by men, because on that work depends what the individuals who will comprise the future nation are going to be.  I do not think it would detract from their dignity in any way if they will do it as well as women.  Senator Farren said that Section 16 had to be put in the Bill to try to preserve some little employment for male workers &mdash; that the section only gave the Minister power to say that the proportion of women to men should not be greater than that laid down.  Why does the Minister not name the particular industries which he is aiming at?  A lot of my objection would be met if the particular industries were named.  I might probably <Col N="1399" /> be in sympathy with them.  The present Minister may have the most holy, the most idealistic and the most beautiful ideas about what he is going to do with the women, but he is only here for to-day or to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The next Minister may not have the same kindly feelings towards women that the present Minister has, and it is putting a weapon into his successor's hands which he may use ruthlessly against the opposite sex.  It is unfair to put such a weapon into the hands of those who come after us.  Senator Farren is smiling at me.  He thinks it is all moonshine, but really you are legislating to-day for the future.  As I said, the thing I am afraid of may not come within the time of the present Minister. It may be in the time of someone else and it is that somebody else that I am afraid of.  Senator Johnson had none of the arguments of Senator Foran, but he is often so much above all our heads that I would not care to tackle many of his arguments.  He asked to whom else would the power be given but to the Minister.  I agree, but in giving the Minister the power I would give it to him in a very limited fashion.  The limitation I would put on it is that I would ask him to specify the industries out of which he is aiming to put women.  I would be perfectly in agreement &mdash; I will put that up to the Minister &mdash; if he said &ldquo;I am going to prevent women from ever scrubbing floors and I will make men do it instead.&rdquo;  With that aim, I would be in absolute agreement, because scrubbing floors is an ugly, hard and badly paid job, and men do not want it.  If he brings in a clause that will prevent women from scrubbing floors, I will be with him.</P>

      <P>This Section 16 of the Bill is directed in the main against the daughters of the very poorest class of the community.  I think that statement is sustainable.  Children over 14 years work in factories.  To my own knowledge I know several families whose daughters are in factories, and they earn for the first period of their employment 8/2 per week &mdash; that is the <Col N="1400" /> wage for the child.  I know a family where the man earns 25/- a week and he has two daughters each earning 8/2 per week, which makes 16/4.  That 16/4 goes to the lifting of a burden on a very poor home.  There is one thing in connection with the earnings of girls.  I think we may be sure&mdash;in fact we can guarantee &mdash; that what they earn goes directly into the home.  They do not drink it or play &ldquo;house&rdquo; with it &mdash; they bring it home.  It is to that very poor class this section will apply. During the discussion on the Bill there was no effort to prove that by putting out the girls the men would get employment at a sufficient amount of money to keep not only themselves but the girls who are put out of work. In fact, it is our knowledge that that will not be the case.  Really, what the section means is putting boy against girl, or woman against man.</P>
      <P>Last night I heard over the wireless the protagonist of this section advocate his principles, but there are many thousands more females than males in this country, and if you are going to lessen employment of these redundant females as they are called, what is going to be the position?  This protagonist said that after 25 years of age no woman should be allowed to work&mdash; she should be married and in a home. But where are the homes?  Certainly the home is the place, but the men are not able to keep the home and the women must help.  In another grade of society, men with £300 and £400 a year have to send their daughters out to work because they are not able to provide for them and they must be trained to do something for themselves. If you are going to put women out of employment you are going to take out of the homes these few shillings a week which are now a blessing to them. That will be acknowledged, I think, even by the Labour Party.  The Senator who spoke held forth about the glories of the home and said the home was the place for women.  Well, I hope he will set up a bureau to supply women with husbands and homes.  That is his place.</P>
