      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 7 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where agricultural land is situate in the rating area of the council of a county and is held in fee simple, such council shall make to the person who is rated for the service of the current financial year in respect of such land an allowance equal to one-half of the rates for which such land is assessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is any necessity to argue the justice of this proposal. As I pointed out yesterday on the Second Reading, most of the land in this country is held from the Land Commission by the tenants, and the annuities were reduced under the 1933 Land Act by 50 per cent.  As the Minister stated at the time, the reduction was given to try to compensate farmers in the period of depression through which they were passing.  In short, the reduction was given by way of relief owing to the effects of the economic war, and was given in perpetuity. Previous to the passing of the 1933 Land Act, the annuities amounted in most cases to the same sum per acre as the rates.  I discussed this matter on various occasions since the passing of the Land Act that reduced the annuities.  I discussed it with the Minister more than once, and he was always very sympathetic, but I did not succeed in getting him to go any farther with the project.  Sympathy is all right up to a certain point, but the farmers <Col N="1016" /> are in such a state at present that they want some financial relief.  As sympathy is no good to them, in all equity the amendments should be accepted by the House and by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I am totally opposed to any such proposal.  I do not know on what grounds it could be founded. Some of these people got the land without paying anything for it.  This amendment proposes to reduce the rates to be paid by one section of the community, namely, those who own land in fee-simple.  It refers to those who pay nothing for the right to occupy land, and who are therefore in a better position than those who pay annuities. I oppose this because it is inequitable and because the money is not available. The money can only be obtained from the Exchequer or from the Land Fund or other ratepayers.  The land annuities are built up from the contributions of those who paid them and are in the long run derived from the old rents&mdash;somewhat reduced, no doubt. I believe the land annuitants own this fund and that it cannot be taken from them.  They are at present in a worse position than those who have land in fee-simple.  Every owner of land is hard hit at present, but those who own in fee-simple less than others.  I do not see on what grounds the claim is proposed.  Why should they be given money taken either from the community or the other tenant farmers?  They have had free land for generations and I do not see why they should be specially considered now.</P>

      <P>I am convinced that Senator Colonel Moore is wrong.  He must be thinking of a few isolated cases of the old landlord class&mdash;his own class in whom he now has his knife.  He does want to give these few landlords relief.  The class in which I am mostly interested are the farmers who bought their fee-simple at a big price during the War, the farmers who purchased the fee-simple by redemption of the annuities and the farmers who would not get an advance from the bank and <Col N="1017" /> had to purchase their fee-simple. These fee-simple owners are excluded from the benefits conferred by the 1933 Act on all other farmers.  I know the country better, perhaps, than Senator Colonel Moore.  In the majority of cases, where people hold land in fee-simple, they are paying a rate of interest very much more than any land annuity or rent charged to farmers who hold land under a different tenure.  Even though a few of a class to whom Senator Colonel Moore objects might get benefit under this amendment, he should consider the other large class of farmers who would get redress under the amendment.</P>

There is another section of the farming community to which Senator Counihan did not refer.  A number of tenants were farseeing enough to take advantagé of the Ashbourne Act and purchase their tenancies many years ago.  I happen to know something about this matter because, when I was a mere boy, my father purchased his farm under the Ashbourne Act.  My nephew is at present in the old place and has had it free of rent for the past couple of years.  If some people were farseeing enough to take advantage of legislation in this way, one would be inclined to think that, in equity and reason, their successors should benefit <Col N="1018" /> in some small way through their industry.</P>

      <P>This amendment raises a question that ought not to be decided in a hurry.  It is a question that deserves very close examination. A number of classes would be affected. In the first place, there would be affected the people who purchased under the Church Act of '70&mdash;all the glebes throughout the country.  In some of those cases, the tenants of the glebes paid one-fourth of the money in cash and, in many cases, the whole of it, and they are a body of small farmers who are fee-simple owners.  Then, as my friend Senator Healy says, there is the class who purchased under the sections of the Act of '81, and, again, the tenants who purchased under the Ashbourne Act.  They were tenants on water-logged estates in the poorest parts of the country.  They are now fee-simple owners.  These are two classes whose case ought to be inquired into.  There is another class&mdash;the class represented by the man who had 30 or 40 acres, held in fee, around his house, and who had an outside farm held under a tenancy.  The tenancy was purchased under the Land Purchase Acts.  That man had, say, two sons. He left the home farm&mdash;the fee-simple farm &mdash; to one son.  He left the other farm, which was subject to an annuity, to the other son. When he was making his will, he recalled that one son had not to pay any annuity, and he put £500 on him as a charge for a daughter.  That has happened in hundreds of cases.  In order to equalise matters between the two sons, the father took into account, in the settlement of his assets, the fact that one son had the land free from annuity.  One son was, therefore, paying the annuity, and the other son was paying interest on a mortgage.  The son who was forgiven half the annuity is in a fairly good position at present because the Government has in every <Col N="1019" /> possible way, within the limits of its power, helped all farmers.  Notwithstanding what Senator Miss Browne is bursting to say, the farmer who is paying the annuity got a remission of half of it.  The farmer who is paying interest on the mortgage has got no remission.  This case of owners in fee-simple&mdash;particularly small owners in fee simple&mdash;ought to be considered, but it is too complicated to be dealt with by an amendment of this kind, and, therefore, I shall vote against it at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>This subject is an important and rather complicated one.  As Senator Comyn said, it is one that would require a good deal of consideration and, probably, of discussion.  One question that occurred to the minds of most people when they saw this amendment for the first time was the question put by Senator Dowdall: What is the amount of fee-simple land in the country?  That I do not know.  I have asked recently for information on that point, and, up to the present, I have not been able to get it.  I understand that it would take a considerable time and a large staff to go through all the holdings recorded, say, in the Land Commission to find what percentage of the land in each county could be regarded as land held in fee-simple. Then there may be land that never came under the purview of the Land Commission, that might not be recorded there in any way, and that would have to be taken into consideration also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment, therefore, is not one that any Minister would, on such short notice, be inclined to accept; certainly <Col N="1020" /> not without having the matter investigated for his own information and the information of Senators who might require it, and also in order to be able to give the local authorities information on which they would base their calculations, because, as is clear from the amendment, it is intended that the other ratepayers should pay for any concession of this kind given to holders of land in fee-simple.  The amount of the Agricultural Grant is fixed.  It is not suggested that any further sum should be put into that fund to meet whatever liability might be put upon the fund as the result of this concession to the holders in fee.  Therefore it is the other ratepayers in each county, to whom the amount would normally go under the Bill as it stands, who would be expected to lose a share of the grant for the benefit of the holders of land in fee-simple.</P>
    <P>Another question likely to arise and come into the minds of people considering this matter is this: Is it to be taken for granted that, for every concession made to a tenant purchaser, a similar concession must be made to the holder of land in fee-simple?  Concession of various kinds have been made to tenant purchasers in the last 50 years or so, but no case, on the ground of justice or equity, so far has been made for similar concessions from the Government or from the local authorities to the holders of land in fee-simple.  The holders of land in fee-simple, however the land came into their possession, are regarded as people who are very well placed and as very lucky people generally.  That would be probably true of those who have been in the possession of land for a considerable period of time. There is, however, the class that Senator Counihan has particularly in mind who bought land during the period when prices were at their peak and who are paying heavy interest to banks or other mortgagees on the money lent to them to buy the land.  It is possible that these people feel themselves hit pretty hard and, of course, it is natural that they should look for concessions anywhere they think they can get them.  I take it, however, that <Col N="1021" /> it is not that class alone that Senator Counihan wishes his amendment, if it were passed, to apply.  It would have to apply to all holders of land in fee-simple, whether the land came down to them through heredity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; or whether it came to them by purchase in the manner Senator Healy and Senator Comyn mentioned, or however it came into their hands.  If we had figures to show the number of people who are now absolute holders in fee, or who might be regarded, as the result of having paid off their mortgages, as holders in fee, we might discover that in some counties there would be a considerable number of such people and that the amount to be taken out of the fund available by way of the agricultural grant might in some areas be considerable and might mean a considerable reduction in the amount going to the ordinary holders of agricultural land.  As I said to Senator Counihan earlier, I personally have sympathy with those people he had in mind who bought land when everybody thought the going was good, that the profits were going to be large and were going to last, because it did not turn out to be so and a lot of them are badly hit.  I should like to see them getting any concession they could, but I do not know that it can be given in the way that the Senator suggests.  I am afraid there would be a considerable amount of opposition in every county from the other landholders. As the Senator said, however, sympathy is not of much value. But as long as there is no extra money provided I am afraid the opposition will be all the greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as I said to Senator Counihan already, I have not had an opportunity of investigating this matter as thoroughly as I should like; in fact I might say of investigating it at all in the way it ought to be investigated. I should like to go into the matter further and see if I can get any kind of approximate figure from the sources open to the Government as to what this would cost as a whole and <Col N="1022" /> in each county.  If there seems to be an equitable case for doing it, and it would not be too costly, or too much of a drag on the funds provided, personally I may say I would be sympathetic without in any way binding myself to it, as I do not know the facts.  I do not want to make any promise that I would find it impossible to carry out.  I certainly will ask, however, that all the information that can be got on the subject will be obtained for us.  Then when a similar Bill to this comes up, as it must come up before another year is over, we might have further information and an opportunity of having longer notice of the amendment and discussing it at greater length.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Senator Counihan is pleased at the sympathetic statement of the Minister in regard to this matter, but really I think the Minister is approaching the matter altogether from the wrong angle.  It is well known that the promise was made at one time that when the land annuities were retained and not paid to Great Britain derating would take place in this country.  A change of policy took place, however.  I am not objecting to that change, but by reason of that change of policy on the part of the Government in reducing the land annuities by half, instead of giving derating, they deprived this class of land-holder of the benefits he would have obtained from derating. Therefore, it is not a question of the other ratepayers having to bear the brunt of this, but of the Exchequer making up the difference.  It is not the fault of these people that the Government changed their minds.  I am not blaming the Government for changing their minds.  I think they made a good deal out of this because the rates are increasing every year, while half the land annuities is a fixed figure.  Paying a fixed sum yearly is much better than paying a sum which is always increasing.  It is because of the Government's change of policy in that respect that these people did not get the benefit of the reduction which was to be given on account of not paying the land annuities to Great Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to say very much the same thing as Senator Wilson has said.  It would be totally unfair to put whatever relief is given to these people on to the other ratepayers.  I do not think that Senator Counihan ever intended anything like that.  Personally, I know of cases of great hardship where people redeemed their annuities, thinking that they would be free then to put by whatever little savings they might have for some other purpose.  In many cases they borrowed the money to do that, thinking that they would be safe, and not dreaming for a moment that such a catastrophe as has overtaken the country at present would ever come about.  There is no doubt that the people were left clearly under the impression by Government spokesmen throughout the country that they were going to get derating when the land annuities were kept at home. Nevertheless, I know of very few farmers&mdash;to their honour be it said&mdash; who approved of that policy of retaining the land annuities even though they were going to get derating.  I want for the honour of the class I represent to say that.  They were always honest and they never wanted to be relieved of any burdens by an act such as the Government accomplished when they decided to withhold the interest on the land bonds as they did.  I know of cases of very great hardship which will be affected by Senator Counihan's amendment. The Minister for Lands is here now and I believe that the proper time to relieve these cases was when the Land Act was going through.  Senator Counihan tried his best then and many of us supported him, in trying to get some justice for this class.  I am very doubtful that this is the proper place to deal with it, but I think the Minister was very fair in promising to investigate the matter.</P>

      <P>It is very unfortunate that in dealing with an amendment of this kind, Senator Miss Browne should try to make a political speech or that she should refer to honesty and straight dealing when a question of this sort is being discussed.  She professes to speak for a certain type of farmer in this country.  I believe, on the other hand, that she represents a very small section of the farmers of this country. She might represent the grazier type, the type who hold 300 or 400 acres each. The question of the land annuities has been dragged in here on every possible occasion, but when that question was put to the people at two successive general elections they voted for retaining these moneys in Ireland because they believed that they were the property of the Irish people.</P>

      <P>If these moneys were given away at a former time, and if a mistake were made, that does not prove that the people were in any way dishonest when they insisted on having their rights respected subsequently. In regard to the amendment, there are, no doubt, some people who purchased fee-simple land during the years of peak prices, but if these people who redeemed their annuities during that period, when public funds were available for the purpose at 4½ per cent., and who paid 6 or 7 per cent. to the banks for the money, made a mistake, they have only themselves to blame for it.  A lot of the tenant purchasers throughout the country have always felt that those tenants who were fortunate enough to purchase under the Ashbourne Act were, undoubtedly, in a favoured position as against those who purchased under the subsequent Acts because they got far better terms. The number who hold lands in fee-simple is very small, and it is a very difficult thing to bring in special legislation <Col N="1025" /> to deal with a small number. The bulk of the tenant purchasers feel that the small number who hold land in fee-simple and the equally fortunate number who purchased under the Ashbourne Act, are in a far better position and are far better able to bear the shocks of the economic war than the people who purchased land under the more recent Land Purchase Acts.  We all know that the annuities were far higher under the more recent Acts and that the people who have to pay them are bearing a bigger burden than those who purchased under the Ashbourne Act.  We know, too, that the bulk of the farming community have suffered a good deal owing to the economic war but, in the present position, the big graziers who are able to buy large droves of cattle are likely to make far better profits than the people who are struggling on small holdings of land. They are not nearly so badly hit by the economic war as the small holders. The small holder is suffering more than the people who can buy in cheap stores and sell them at a good profit, bad though prices are.</P>

      <P>A man who has more cattle than you have.  This amendment deals with a very definite thing, and, while I do not want to make a political speech, I should like to point out that all the trouble arises out of the economic war.  In order to calm down the farmers who were paying annuities, half the annuities were remitted.  Then you have farmers who, for one reason or another, under one Land Act or another, or because they bought out their annuities, hold their land in fee-simple. They have been hit by the economic war in the same way as every other farmer.  They are paying annuities to England or rather England is collecting the annuities from them just as she is collecting from the people <Col N="1026" /> who owed annuities.  This amendment would put farmers who hold in fee-simple on the same level as others. Like Senator Colonel Moore, I have no sympathy with the old landlord class but there is a big number of people who redeemed their annuities&mdash; call them annuities or rents, it does not matter&mdash;for one reason or another. I think it would be a very simple thing for the Government to remit half their rates.  I do not want the local authorities to make up the deficiency.  It would be a very simple thing for the Government to increase the Agricultural Grant by an amount sufficient to meet the cost of remitting half the rates to these people.  I think that is what the amendment means, and it is only just and reasonable that that should be done.</P>

      <P>This amendment will apply to a very small percentage of landholders and it should be passed.  I am afraid that Senator O Máillie knows very little about the circumstances.  Listening to him here one would imagine that he was speaking at some cross-roads &mdash; at Maam Cross at the recent by-election.  His speech had no connection with the amendment under discussion.  It is surprising.  I moved this amendment with the object of having a calm and cool debate on the justice or equity of what I put forward.  I am glad to say that it was favourably received by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, but Senator Colonel Moore was the first to jump to his legs and oppose it. There is one thing that I agree with Senator O Máille on, and that is that <Col N="1027" /> the people I am pleading for form a very small percentage.  I can assure Senators that I am not pleading for myself.  The amount of fee-simple land that I possess is very small.  A lot of irrelevancies have been introduced.  As a matter of fact Senator Wilson's speech was the only relevant speech that was made.  I admit that he touched on the economic war, but only so far as it was relevant, and I am sorry to say that neither Senator Miss Browne nor Senator O Máille did that.  Both their speeches were quite irrelevant to the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point out to Senator Colonel Moore and Senator Staines that, in many cases, those landlords, to whom they seem to have such antipathy, purchased their land from the Land Commissioners and bought their demesnes and came in for the remission of annuities under the 1933 Act, with the result that the amount remaining now would be a very small percentage. I also wish to point out that the people who would benefit under this are the hardest working class in the community.  They are people who saved up money by hard work and industry in previous years and who were unfortunate enough to invest it in fee-simple land, thinking that they were getting a very good bargain and that they were getting something which, as Senator Comyn pointed out, would be a very valuable asset.  Now they have found out that having it in fee-simple land was more of a disadvantage than anything else.  In nine cases out of ten this land is land that has been bought by the people.  It it not a case of the land being hereditary.  It has not been handed down to them. It has been bought with the savings of a hard working class of the community, and I say that they deserve as much consideration as any other section of the farming community.  I shall not discriminate between any section of the community holding fee-simple agricultural land and another <Col N="1028" /> section, and I should not like to accept an amendment which would not include everybody.  I am very glad that the Minister has received the amendment sympathetically and has promised to give it sympathetic consideration. I shall not ask to have it considered in this Bill.  I think the Minister is right in refusing to have it considered in this Bill, but I would ask him to try to have it considered in time to allow the local authorities an opportunity of considering it when they are budgeting for their next rates.  If he would do that, it would give the Dáil and Seanad an opportunity of accepting the proposal.</P>

      <P>It seems to me now that anybody who has not got a sop already must get a sop now.  That seems to be the whole tenour of the remarks that have been passed.  Why should these people get a sop now, and where will they get it from?  Who is to pay it?  It seems to me that the whole thing is ridiculous.  Certainly, I do not see why I should be accused of being hostile to a certain class.  In the circumstances, it seems rather ridiculous to accuse me of that.  However, people, evidently, will say anything once they get on their legs.  However, I should be very glad if anybody could get a sop of some kind or another, but it is not practicable, and I think that those who deserve it should get it.  I think that it can only be got out of the annuities and the annuities belong to the people who paid them.</P>

      <P>I think that from the time the Principal Act was passed, it has been practically a dead letter and that this measure is largely continuing it beyond the period of time for which it was passed in the first instance, and that it is rather important now that this measure should be put into operation. I think that, possibly, one of the reasons why it has not been so operative or active as it might be, is that the Chairman of the Advisory Committee, who is also the Chairman of the Currency Commission, and has acted on certain other Commissions, has been really kept too busy to put this Act into operation as much as it should be. I notice that one of my friends shakes his head, but I fancy that that is so.  I would submit, in view of the very few securities in this country that are trustee securities, that Mr. Justice Johnston, who is also on this Committee, and the Chairman of the Currency Commission, should not have so many extraneous duties put upon them, so as to enable those who wish to have a chance of investing the funds at their disposal to invest in those approved securities, particularly in view of the scheme of conversion foreshadowed by the Minister for Finance, which will compel a great many people who have funds in trustee securities to seek other outlets for the investment of these funds.  I think this is a very good measure, but I mention this so that it may be utilised to a fuller extent than heretofore.</P>

      <P>I explained several of the causes of delay in the operation of the original Act.  The drawing up of the regulations and the conditions of operation of the Committee itself was the main cause of the delay.  As a matter of fact, all the meetings with <Col N="1031" /> the exception of the meeting for this month have been held when called, and it is true that the Chairman of the Currency Commission, who is Chairman of this Committee, has been very busy; but it is only this month it has not been possible to hold any particular meeting of this Committee that has been called.  I will, however, bring to the attention of the Minister for Finance, who is responsible for this measure, the remarks made by Senator Dowdall.  I may mention also that the Committee will be meeting in the beginning of September.  I gave the relevant dates, which the Senator will find in the Official Report, of the setting up of the various Committees, the introduction of the regulations, the passing of the regulations and so on, and I think that in them he will find adequate explanation of the points he has raised here to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing this section.  In view of the reproof that was so tactfully administered to me yesterday by Senator Lynch, I want to guard against saying anything that might jeopardise the existence of this House, the preservation of which is, I am sure, as dear to Senator Lynch's heart as it is to my own.  In any criticism I have to put forward of this section, I want to guard against anything that might be construed as political attack on Government policy.  I think this section might, with advantage to the self-respect of the Oireachtas and to the prestige of the Government, be eliminated from this Bill.  I listened carefully to what the Minister said yesterday in reply to the few comments <Col N="1032" /> I made on this and I have reflected overnight on his observations. That reflection has not, to my mind, brought me any nearer to seeing wisdom, justification or necessity for the proposal to reduce uncalculated means from 2/- to 1/-.</P>
      <P>I said yesterday that it was a mean and paltry proposal, and to me it is something very like robbing the poor-box. I believe that if the Minister had embodied a definite proposal to rob the poor-box in this Bill instead of this proposal, it would be a preferable proposition. What is it?  The stark reality of this proposal is that the destitute element of this country shall be asked to contribute anything from £150,000 to £180,000 to help the Minister for Finance to balance his Budget.  That is the exact reality of this proposal. The Minister yesterday mentioned the figure of £180,000 in reply to a query of mine as to the saving which this section might result in, that is to say, that by cutting from 2/- to 1/- people whose means are 2/- per week, the Minister can get £180,000 from that class of people.  It seems to me an inhuman proposal, and I am certainly amazed that when such a proposal comes before this House, directed against this particular class, not a single member of the Party in this House which claims to represent and speak for that section is here to voice objection to it.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the angels weep. As I say, there is no justification and <Col N="1033" /> no necessity for this.  The Minister is a very resourceful person and he may say&mdash;and I have no doubt that he has in mind already the idea of replying in these words: &ldquo;Where is the money to come from&mdash;this £180,000&mdash; which we require to finance this Bill?&rdquo; When the tax revenue of this country was something like £2,000,000 less than at present, the Minister said that taxation could be reduced by £3,000,000, without injuring the efficiency of the Government machine.  If a revenue £2,000,000 less than the present revenue was susceptible, in 1932, of £3,000,000 economies, surely, on the Minister's reasoning, the present expenditure is capable of an economy of £5,000,000, so that he should have no difficulty in getting the necessary funds to finance this measure, without asking the poor, unfortunate, destitute people to contribute anything from £150,000 to £180,000 to put it through.  I do not like to use strong language.  I prefer to express myself in a mild and restrained manner.  But this seems to me a species of mean, petty, mercenary action that the Minister should be ashamed to sponsor.  It is something that I should not like to be associated with, and I hope I shall not come to be a voice crying in the wilderness protesting against Section 11 of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we might leave it to the Minister to answer Senator Milroy who has entirely missed the point of this section.  It is a surprise to me that there ever should have been in the Principal Act such a clause as sub-section (2) of Section 17.  What was that section?  It was a section which provided that in calculating the means of a person, no account was to be taken of the first 2/-.  It is a remarkable sort of section to put into an Act of Parliament, that in making your calculation, you should have a margin for error of 2/-.  The Minister understood the reason: There was so much work that things had to be done in a rough and ready sort of way so that we were to allow a margin of 2/-. That is wrong accountancy and wrong finance.  If you want to give a benefit to people give it in the ordinary way. Increase the benefit if you like.  The <Col N="1034" /> meaning of Section 11 is that what I think was wrong in the ordinary Act, that is allowing a sum of 2/- as a margin of error, is now reduced to 1/-.  I suppose in the process of time that section will be cut out altogether and that the calculation will be much more accurate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>It is not correct to say that the destitute element of the population are being asked to contribute anything towards the balancing of the Budget.  Persons who are destitute are not interested in this section, and are not affected by the section.  The rates of assistance which are payable to such persons, in accordance with their circumstances, are set out in the schedule to the principal Act, and these rates are not being changed.  Any person who is unemployed, in the sense in which we usually interpret that word&mdash;that is any person who is ordinarily dependent for his livelihood upon the wages he earns, and who, through no fault of his own, is unable to obtain his livelihood, or to get an opportunity of work, will not be one ½d. the worse for this section.  The purpose of the amendment is to remedy, to some extent, an anomaly which resulted from the principal Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1035" /> As the law stands at present, a person who has property calculated in accordance with the methods laid down under the principal Act, equal in value to 2/- a week is, when unemployed, better off than the person who has no property at all.  The alteration of that position, not entirely, but to some extent, while undoubtedly it makes possible a saving to the Exchequer, also makes possible the utilisation of that saving for the benefit of the section of the people who require assistance more urgently than those persons who possess property.</P>
    <P>This Bill contains a number of sections. Under every other section of the Bill except Section 11 increased charges will arise.  The scheme of assistance is improved so as to operate more generously on behalf of the unemployed, and those who through no reason of their own are not in a position to earn their livelihood.  These improvements, and others which may be enacted in the future, would not be possible unless the total cost of the entire scheme could be kept as low as possible.  We are helping to keep down that total cost by the elimination of unnecessary provisions of this kind.  These provisions are unnecessary because the amount of assistance, which the Oireachtas decided to be made available for unemployed persons, is set out in the schedule of the principal Act, and is available and will continue to be available for such persons.  It is untrue to say that the unemployed persons are being asked to contribute £150,000.  Yesterday I impressed upon the Senator that it was not possible to take one section of this Bill and to calculate the financial effects of it while ignoring all other sections.  The Bill, as a whole, is going to effect certain changes in the finance of the scheme.  But whatever saving may be effected, under this head, the changes under other heads are going to involve increased expenditure; and the State is not going to secure £150,000 as the result of this measure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1036" /> It is rather peculiar that we should have a member of the Fine Gael Party that sought by other methods, even by the methods of obstruction, to prevent any money being voted for the unemployed, now endeavouring to increase the amount.  It is another indication, of many we have already had, of the inconsistency of the action of members of that Party.  The unemployed assistance scheme is new; it came into operation for the first time last year. It involves a charge of one kind or another upon public funds&mdash;the Central Fund, the funds of local authorities or the Unemployment Insurance Fund, amounting approximately to £1,300,000. It is a generous provision to make in addition to the other measures adopted for the relief of hardships arising from unemployment.  I might point out that it was provided last year for the first time, and it ill becomes a member of the Party that held office for ten years, and made no such provision for the relief of the destitute, now to appear in the role of the advocate of more and more expenditure for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of this Bill removes an anomaly in the principal Act.  Logically, we could wipe out entirely the provision for uncalculated means.  We are not doing that, because there is still some necessity for allowing what has been described as a margin for error in the calculation of means.  It is not that the system of calculation is unsound, but there are difficulties in determining the weekly value derived from a holding of land, from the ownership of certain farm stock or other property of that kind.  With the best will in the world, or the best system of calculation in the world, there will be certain errors in calculation and a certain amount of discrepancy between the determinations of one officer engaged on that work and another officer, and in order to ensure that undue hardship will not arise from such causes this margin is allowed; but the margin need not be as high as in the principal Act.</P>
    <P>If we had originally made a margin of 1/- nobody would have questioned it. While the principal Act was before the Oireachtas nobody proposed to increase <Col N="1037" /> or decrease the margin set out there. It was put in because we felt a wide margin was required during the first year of the operation of the Act. Having regard to the experience we have gained and the efficacy of the machinery now available, following the appointment of a number of investigation officers at the beginning of the year to exercise a close supervision over the administration of the Act, and particularly having regard to the other provisions of the Bill, the change now proposed is in every way desirable, but it inflicts no hardship on the class of people whom it was primarily desired to aid by the enactment of the unemployment assistance scheme.</P>

      <P>I want to raise one point in connection with this Bill.  I think in the discussion on the Second Reading yesterday the Minister said that it was not possible to give an estimate of the approximate cost of this measure. Another Minister in connection with another Bill referred to the difficulty of estimating the cost of administration. I do not know whether that is an inevitable phase of this class of thing, but it seems to me that it is undesirable that legislative proposals should be brought before the House and launched on the country before the Minister is able to give even a tentative or approximate estimate of what the cost is going to be.  Surely it is not beyond the resources of the Government to ascertain what these things are likely to inflict on the community <Col N="1038" /> in the way of additional burdens. The point strikes me as of great importance.  I am referring particularly to this Bill, but it seems not to be an isolated case.  It appears to me that Ministers are taking steps without counting the cost, taking leaps in the dark so far as finance is concerned, and that is an undesirable trait in legislative tactics or Government policy.  It is undesirable that proposals should be passed here without the responsible Ministers being in a position to give at least an approximate figure of the cost of such proposals to the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what difficulties may have arisen in estimating the cost of other measures, but in the case of this Bill it is clear that an accurate estimation is impossible.  We are not dealing here with commodities or cattle, saleable goods or articles, the number and value of which can easily be ascertained.  We are dealing with human beings and it is impossible to foretell how human factors are going to operate.  We are altering the definition of continuous employment in order to induce people and make it easier for them to accept short periods of employment when they offer, or even to look for such employment knowing it is not going to involve any interruption of their claim to unemployment assistance or involve them in loss of any kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That particular change would cost, say, £25,000 if it had no effect on the actions of the persons drawing unemployment assistance; but we believe it is going to have effect on their actions, though to what extent we are not able to say.  We believe the number of claims will be reduced by reason of the fact that a number of these persons will get more work for short periods than would be the case if this measure were not enacted.  Nobody can say to what extent that will operate.  We know the maximum cost will be £25,000, but we believe it will be considerably less.  The same applies to every other section.  As regards the question of means, the financial effects on the basis of last year can be easily <Col N="1039" /> calculated.  The figure given is based on the assumption that the circumstances this year will be precisely the same as the circumstances last year and that assumption, we know, will not be borne out; but what the circumstances will be, nobody can foretell with any certainty.  We are not in a position to produce any estimate other than an approximate figure, which may or may not be reliable.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 5 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>5.  Section 4 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion therein of a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  The Minister shall not make any regulation prescribing a greater levy than 2/6 a head on any horned sheep or any sheep weighing less than 40 lb. dead weight.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This levy of 5/- per head on little mountain sheep is, to say the least of it, a monstrous charge.  It means a tax on the farmers in some cases of at <Col N="1041" /> least 50 per cent.  This is a tax which is directly paid out of the farmers' pockets because the sheep to which I am referring are sheep for which, I am sure, the Minister will admit there is no such thing as export competition. There is no competition except the local trade.  The Minister will, I am sure, say that the home market is the best market, and I cannot complain about that, but I want to say that there is no competition.  In many cases these sheep are sold at present at 10/-, 12/- or 15/- a head.  I know of cases where they are sold at less than 10/- a head.  The payment of a levy of 5/- per head on this class of sheep is a monstrous charge.  It is very hard to understand how the Minister can justify it.  The producers of these sheep are mountain farmers in Kerry, Donegal, Mayo, Waterford and parts of Cork.  These sheep are reared in the mountainy districts.  Their value in practically every case is less than £1 and the average price is about 12/-. On such a figure, a levy of 5/- is very hard to justify.  I should like to see how the Minister can justify that.  I have raised the question on many occasions but I have got no satisfaction from the Minister.  The Minister does not seem to think that any injustice is being done to mountain farmers in asking them to pay this 5/- levy.  The Minister's excuse in regard to the 5/- levy is that all sheep were bought in competition for the export and the home trade and that the price for export always regulated the home price.  He said he understands that is so.  It is so for lambs and for cattle and other sheep, but there is no export trade in old ewes nor is there for these mountainy sheep.  These latter sheep are produced for home consumption&mdash; for the market which the Minister said is the best market in the world.  It is well to have the home market, but it is not well for the Minister to tax the farmer out of the home market in the same way as the British are taxing him out of the British market.  I move my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say that this amendment is not in order, for that is your function, Cathaoirleach, but it <Col N="1042" /> would be unworkable in the section to which Senator Counihan moved it. That is only one point.  It might be moved to Section 9 but, leaving that aside, I do not like to dispute this matter with Senator Counihan because he knows more about the export trade than I do.  But I heard quite recently that there was rather good trade in the export of these small sheep.  That may not be true.  Whether it is or not.  I think the export price must have an influence on the price of sheep all round and, therefore, it cannot be claimed that this tax is coming out of the farmers' pocket.  I would perhaps be inclined to agree that it is more difficult for the farmers in counties like Kerry, Donegal and Mayo to sell their sheep to the home butchers than it was before the levy came into operation, because the butcher has to pay a 5/- levy whether the sheep weighs 40 lb. or 60 lb. and naturally he is more inclined to kill a bigger sheep and in that way have more meat for the levy he pays.  On several occasions during the last 12 months, in order to remedy this grievance, I endeavoured to have the system changed to a levy on the weight rather than on the animal.  That was impossible, but there are certain sections in this amending Bill that will make it possible.  For instance, the weighing facilities sections in this Bill will make it possible for us to go on a weight basis in future, and the intention is to change over to a weight basis as soon as we possibly can.  I think that if we were on a weight basis Senator Counihan would have no grievance.  It is possible that a 1d. per lb. would give us about the same income from sheep as the present flat rate of 5/- a head.  If, say, we had a rate of 1d. per lb. dead weight, then the small mountainy sheep to which the Senator referred would be at no disadvantage compared to the big Roscommon ewes or any other breed of sheep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment could not, I think, be made effective in this Bill.  Its insertion might, in fact, make it very difficult for us to work the Principal Act in other directions.  Perhaps <Col N="1043" /> Senator Counihan would be agreeable to accept the undertaking which I have given, that we intend, in the shortest possible time, to make this change over experimentally for a period.  I hope the Senator will believe that I am as genuinely in favour of the change over as he is.  I do not know if, in view of that undertaking, the Senator is going to insist on his amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In this section, I wish to bring to the Minister's notice that all the arguments advanced as regards the incidence of this levy in the case of sheep apply with equal force in the case of light cattle.  The position is that the flat rate makes it very difficult for farmers to sell these cattle locally.  These light fat cattle have been in favour with people for a number of years.  Farmers have been trying to produce them, but due to the operation of this flat rate, the local butchers will not purchase light cattle.  They will not buy them in any circumstances.  They are the cattle that are most suitable for export and that fetch the greatest price, but due to this flat rate levy they have lost their market at home. If time had permitted it was my intention to move an amendment proposing the deletion of this section.  It imposes a very serious restraint on the sale of these cattle, and takes from their value.  We see cattle sold for export without any levy at all. The levy applies in the case of cattle sold at home, and that, I suggest, has created an intolerable, or artificial, position.  I think it would be a good thing if some change were <Col N="1044" /> made.  I do not want to press the Minister, but I think it would be well if, in the case of those light cattle, he would give an assurance such as he has already given in the case of sheep.  I think that the same system should operate in both cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the appeal that has been made by Senator Dillon for the abolition of the flat rate levy in the case of light cattle.  I think the Minister should take that appeal into consideration when framing his regulations on the dead weight cases.  The present position makes it impossible for farmers to sell their small cattle.  It is not possible to export small fat cattle of 6 or 7 cwt. with the operation of a tariff of £6 per head.  I would also ask the Minister to consider the question of the levy per lb. on cows.  What I said in the case of horned sheep applies in the case of cows.  It is a fact that there are many cows being sold at the present time for £1 and 30/-.  I am speaking now of good fat cows, and if the Minister doubts my statement he can, I think, have it verified by his inspectors.  These fat cows would make good wholesome food for certain classes of people who have not a great deal of money to spend.  Because of the levy, butchers are not buying these beasts.  They prefer to buy the big heavy beasts, because the levy is the same on all classes of cattle.  The result is that there is a loss to producers, and also to consumers because of the fact that these cattle are not being bought and slaughtered.  If that quality of meat were available at a reasonable price, there are certain classes in the community who would be glad to buy it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with Senator Dillon that it would be desirable to have the smaller cattle killed, if possible.  It would be of benefit to the farmers who produce those small cattle, particularly in Kerry, Connemara and other places.  It would be good also from the general economic standpoint.  We would not have the same trouble with regard to surplus <Col N="1045" /> cattle if we had the smaller cattle slaughtered and a bigger number of them consumed.  It would also do away with the inducement that appears to be there at present for butchers to buy the big cattle.  As Senator Counihan has pointed out the tariffs and so on are moving in the same direction. I do not think that there would be as much trouble in changing over to a weight basis in the case of cattle as in the case of sheep, but the position is that the case with regard to sheep appears to be the more urgent.  We do intend to change over in the case of cattle also, but as the case of the sheep appears to be more urgent we are taking that first.  This change over will mean a good deal more work for certain staffs in the Department. We could not make a complete change over in both cases without getting extra staff.  We hope to avoid the necessity of doing that by having a gradual change over to a weight basis, first in the case of sheep, and later in the case of cattle.  I hope the Senator will be satisfied with that assurance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 14 seems to me to be retrospective, and I would like to have some assurance from the Minister that it will not apply in the case of a farmer who killed one sheep or lamb per week for his own consumption during the time the Principal Act was in force.  The wording of the section seems to leave it open to a different interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator looks at the first sub-section he will see that it was amended in the Dáil in order to meet the point he raised: It reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every person who, after the commencement of Part II of the Principal Act and either before or after the passing of this Act, slaughters in any premises which, at the time of such slaughter, were or are not registered in the register of slaughtering premises, any cattle or sheep for human consumption in Saorstát Eireann, shall, if the said non-registration of the said premises was or is a contravention of the said Part II, be liable to pay to the <Col N="1046" /> Minister on demand made by the Minister a levy on all cattle and sheep as slaughtered.</P>
    <P>That means that unless a person was contravening the Principal Act by not being registered, it does not apply.  It does not apply where a farmer killed for his own use.  I referred to this matter on the Second Reading.  This section will not affect many people.  A number of people who slaughtered cattle before they were technically registered thought that they were all right. Under the Principal Act we are not entitled to collect the levies but should prosecute.  We do not want to prosecute because we know that these people acted in good faith.  All we want is power to take the levies and to let them carry on.</P>
    <P>Sections 14 to 19 agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 20 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>As and from the appointed day the word &ldquo;recipient&rdquo; shall, in addition to the meaning provided in Section 43 of the Principal Act, include any person whose weekly wage does not exceed twenty shillings per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dealt with this matter on the Second Reading, and I contend that it would be very hard to argue against what is proposed, that a man with a wife and family, earning 20/- per week or less, is more entitled to get cheap beef than the man who is doing nothing &mdash;perhaps a single man who can lie in bed all day or loll about.  Men who are working hard&mdash;agricultural labourers and that class&mdash;from an early hour in the morning, sometimes in wet and cold weather, and who have to support a wife and family perhaps on 14/- or 15/- a week, are more entitled to get cheap beef than people who contribute nothing to the wealth of the country. I understand that the Minister has power to make such provision as I suggest under Section 43 (2) of the Principal Act.  If the Minister gives an assurance that the amendment will <Col N="1047" /> receive sympathetic consideration I will not press it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support this amendment.  I expressed the wish when the House was dealing with this Bill yesterday that something should be done for the unfortunate agricultural labourer whose wages have been considerably reduced.  I do not think there is a single agricultural labourer in Wexford getting more than 18/- a week, and very few of them are getting that amount.  As a rule, wages would be from 15/- to 16/- a week, while those who get food from their employers earn as little as 7/- or 8/- a week.  I realise that the amendment does not apply to that class.  The taxation in the present Budget has had a terrible bearing on labouring people.  Take the case of a man working at the sugar beet crop. That work is exceedingly difficult and entails great hardship.  I have seen men working at that crop from 8 o'clock in the morning until 7 o'clock in the evening up to their knees in mud. When they go home to what is called a dinner they are lucky if they get an egg and a cup of tea.  Men in that position are certainly more deserving, and require more nourishment and more free beef than men who are doing nothing.  The latter class may have a spark of fire and may be drawing a dole of 6/- weekly, but poor working men out in the cold under present circumstances are not fed properly. Everyone deplores this return to the conditions of the Famine of '47 when the people had to look for Indian meal to keep body and soul together.  We protested against this procedure all the time.  As it was introduced by the Government it is the duty of the Minister to accept the amendment.  I hope Senator Counihan will not be satisfied unless he gets a very definite assurance from the Minister that something will be done in the way he suggests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a certain amount of confusion between Senator Counihan and Senator Miss Browne, as they do not appear to appreciate the difference in money values between urban and rural areas. <Col N="1048" /> As Senator Counihan knows, the value of £1 in his native county is much greater than it is in the heart of Dublin. In the first place, rents are very much cheaper.  In the rural areas many agricultural labourers have cottages that were built by the district councils, for which very low rents are charged.  Plots of land are attached to these cottages on which the tenants can grow vegetables and keep hens and ducks.  The position in the City of Dublin is altogether different, where the people are living in top back rooms, for which they have to pay exorbitant rents to unscrupulous landlords.  When dealing with this question Senators should appreciate the difference in the value of money in rural districts and in a city like Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does Senator Healy realise that the recent Budget is responsible for taking about 4/- weekly off the wages of agricultural labourers? That means that his wages of 18/- are worth only 14/- now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister or Senator Counihan made any estimate of rural and urban incomes. In all the statistics we have, I have never seen rural and urban incomes compared.  We all know, as well as Senator Healy, that there is a very big difference in costings between towns and cities and rural areas.  So far as I can gather from statistics&mdash;I confess that they always confuse me&mdash;the rural income would be about £30 and the income in the cities £95.  In the cities, they had that £95 to use for all these high costings to which the Senator referred, but, in the rural areas, they had only this £30, and that amount has been halved since the statistics to which I refer were issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not look up the wages of city workers, but I have heard people state that the wages of people sweeping the streets in the city are from 50/- to £3 per week.  Perhaps Senator Healy will tell us if that is correct.  Does the Senator compare a man earning 50/- or £3 per week with the man in the country, with seven or eight children, who is earning 12/- to 18/- per week.  Does the Senator suggest that the man in the city earning <Col N="1049" /> the wages I have mentioned is as much entitled to cheap beef as the man in the country whose circumstances I have described?  If the worker in the country has a labourer's cottage, built since the war, he is paying 3/6 or 4/- per week for it.  That is not a very comfortable position in which to be. I would not move to have decent workers in the country included in the free beef scheme, because I always believed that was demoralising, but, when it comes to a question of cheap beef, I say that they are entitled to it and that they can accept it without any tinge of charity.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on changing the scheme from free beef to cheap beef and, I am sure, the country will approve of the change.  I cannot see what objection there is to the amendment, unless the Minister urges the question of cost.  On that principle, if the unemployed man is going to get this cheap beef, I say the workman in the country is entitled to it and, if the workman in the country is to be excluded, you should exclude the man on the dole.  The Minister may have power to make an order giving effect to the proposal in the amendment without the necessity for the amendment.  If he will favourably consider that matter, I am satisfied to withdraw the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to look at this question from the point of view of the consumption of beef.  Senator Counihan has been considering it from the human point of view.  The object of the Bill is to get beef consumed which, otherwise, would not be consumed.  If the agricultural labourers will consume a lot more beef, it is all in favour of the Minister's Bill that this provision should be made.  The only point that would arise would be the question of cost.  The agricultural labourers are probably a hefty body of men who would eat beef if they could get it cheaply.  I think that Senator Counihan's amendment is all in favour of the Bill, and the only check upon it is that it might be very costly.  It would be a great advantage if, at reasonable cost, we could get a much larger amount of <Col N="1050" /> beef consumed under this Bill than we did previously.  Would the Minister help us along the road of consumption of beef by accepting Senator Counihan's amendment or would the cost be such as to render that course impracticable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Counihan was quite right in saying that this could be done under the Bill as it stands.  It could be done under sub-section (2) of Section 43, but I cannot give an undertaking that it will be done.  This amendment refers to a new class&mdash;those in receipt of wages under 20/- per week. That is a very loose definition and would lead to all sorts of trouble. Included in that definition, you would have apprentices in factories and several other people earning less than 20/- per week.  We might even have included people living on their incomes and receiving less than 20/- per week. I am not objecting to the amendment so much on that score because Senator Counihan could ask me to supply a better definition.  To define this class in the way that Senator Counihan would like would be very difficult.  In dealing with the original Act, we, in the Department of Agriculture, took classes which were already defined, so that we would have no difficulty in saying who was entitled to free beef.  We took those in receipt of unemployment assistance and those in receipt of home assistance and, in that way, we had two organisations already in existence. The claims of unemployed people had been already heard and it had been decided that they were entitled to unemployment assistance. We acted upon that and did not question their right to free beef. Similarly, in the case of home assistance.  We did not inquire into the means of recipients but gave them a voucher.  In this case, we should have to set up an organisation to deal with the class mentioned by Senator Counihan.  For that purpose, we should probably require as big an organisation as is in existence for dealing with the Unemployment Assistance Act.  We should require a big internal staff and a large number of inspectors to ascertain whether or not a person <Col N="1051" /> was an agricultural labourer and whether he was earning more than £1 a week or not.  Then, these men would be going in and out of that class from week to week, so that we should require a very big organisation to give effect to the amendment.  I do not think that the Department of Agriculture could do this work.  The Department has no staff working on these lines.  It is only the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Local Government which have staffs for purposes like this.  If I were to ask one of these Departments to do this work for us, they would, I think, have to increase their staffs.  It would be extremely difficult to define the class intended to be covered by the amendment.</P>
      <P>From that point of view, I would answer Senator Jameson by saying that the cost of administration would be more than the proposal would be worth.  Senator Jameson was right in saying that the whole object of the Principal Act was to get rid of a surplus of beef.  We adopted the principle last year of getting rid of that surplus of beef to people who could not afford to buy it rather than the principle of destruction adopted in other countries.  Although the Principal Act is very expensive to administer, I still think that we ought not to increase that administration, but if at all possible take anything we have in the way of cash for the benefit of the cattle trade.  On the whole I think this would not be worth the cost of administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised at the figures produced by Senator Miss Browne.  If it is true that the agricultural labourer is contributing 4/- per week in extra taxation, as a result of the Budget, on a quick calculation I make out that we are going to get £900,000 from the agricultural labourers this year.  That is more than we expected to get in extra taxation from the whole community. So that if we are going to collect a little off the other sections of the community as well as off the <Col N="1052" /> agricultural labourers, we shall have some millions of a surplus to spare at the end of the year.  I do not think that will work out.</P>

I do not want to leave him under any misapprehension and, therefore, I must say I cannot even undertake to consider bringing in that class by regulation.  If Senator Counihan, therefore, is insisting on his amendment, I am afraid he will have to put it to the House, because I cannot give any undertaking.</P>

      <P>It has occurred to me during the discussion, particularly during the reply of the Minister, that the objection to this amendment is the cost of administration, which is a thing we must all think of and appreciate. The Minister apprehends the necessity of establishing machinery that will be expensive for the purpose of ascertaining who are entitled to get this gift or who are not.  It has occurred to me, although possibly it would not commend itself to the Minister, that there is a very simple way of ascertaining this class.  I heard a good deal of discussion yesterday on the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill and on reading through that Bill I see that certain people are entitled to get relief from rates if they have agricultural labourers in their employment for a period of 12 months. If people are getting relief from rates by reason of the fact that they have one or two agricultural labourers in their employment for a period of 12 months, a person who is getting that relief would not be doing too much, either for the State or for the local rating authority, if he gave a certificate to the worker who is working for <Col N="1053" /> him for the 12 months that he was so working.  Would not that solve the difficulty of ascertaining the people who come within this class of workers? It has occurred to me that possibly that is a view of the question that has not been adumbrated by Senator Counihan and, possibly, if he put it in some better shape he would win over the sympathy of the Minister and get some means of dealing with this situation.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the Minister's explanation of the various difficulties arising out of this amendment, I feel sure that Senator Counihan will not press his amendment. It must be obvious to anybody that any such amendment as this would bring a practically unlimited number of people under the Bill and, in my opinion, the question is not so much the difficulty with regard to financing the proposition as the difficulty of administration. Anybody who has been in touch with the administration of various measures such as the Unemployment Assistance Act and others must know the difficulty there is in ascertaining the wages of workers, and the same thing would apply to an even greater extent if such an amendment as this were adopted.  It is only natural to expect that some people would make use of such a Bill as this to drag in political propaganda and spread it around the country.  It has been suggested that it is a terrible thing that the workers of the country should be offered or should accept any such thing as free beef or cheap beef.  But it is a very peculiar thing that the people who deplore the fact that the Government should descend to such depths are the very people who are on their hind legs jumping to exploit the bounty on the beef that is exported out of the country.  I believe myself it is six of one and half a dozen of another, and that if we were prepared to extend this Bill, and provide for the supply of free beef to farmers under £100 valuation we would have the people who are deploring the fact that workers are <Col N="1054" /> accepting or receiving free beef jumping to receive that free beef themselves.</P>
      <P>What I would like to know, however, is if the Minister would give me a definite denial of something which is freely circulated, for political purposes, in my opinion, in County Tipperary at present and that is, that during the passage of this Bill through the Dáil the Minister for Agriculture made some statement to the effect that in future it was intended to supply canned beef instead of fresh beef to the people entitled to receive it under the Bill. It has been suggested that the canned meat so supplied will be the product of the Roscrea factory. People in Tipperary are pretty closely in touch with the conditions in the Roscrea factory and they know that the cows intended to be dealt with in that factory are cows which are finished with as far as dairying purposes are concerned and which are suffering from udder troubles or something of that kind.  They know, if it were a fact that the Government intended to supply that beef to the poor people of the country, that it would be an outrage.  Senator Douglas laughs at the idea, but I can assure him that a genuine supporter of the United Ireland Party came to me the other day and asked me if it were not a fact.  This man honestly believed that it was so, because he had been told it was a fact.  Incidentally, I may say that this man had read Upton Sinclair's book on the Chicago stockyards and he was convinced that there was in fact a definite probability that the Government were going to dish him out cows' tails in cans.  I should like the Minister definitely to contradict that statement and hand it back to whomsoever was busy enough to circulate any such lying propaganda, thereby creating a terrible feeling of unrest amongst the people of the country.</P>

      <P>I think it is necessary to say a few words in connection with the matter the last speaker referred <Col N="1055" /> to.  I never heard any suggestion about canned meat of the kind referred to by Senator Quirke.  As it happens, I know a little about it myself, because I was interested in the establishment of the factory in Waterford.  I want to tell the Senator that nothing will be used in the production of canned beef except first class cattle not exceeding four years old.  I state this because first of all it is the truth and, secondly, because I do not think the board of which I am a member would be very pleased with me if I stood by and heard a statement like that made without using the knowledge I have to contradict it.  Before the Minister rises&mdash; he also will be in a position to contradict it&mdash;I certainly take the opportunity of denying the truth of any such rumour as the Senator gave expression to, on behalf of my board and on behalf of those who are interested in the establishment of the factory.</P>

      <P>I hope this amendment will not be adopted because it is an amendment which would be absolutely impossible to carry into effect. You might as well give a general subsidy on the consumption of beef as to pass this amendment.  The best way to examine a thing like this is to put yourself in the position of the agricultural labourer, the farmer who employs him and the farmer's wife who runs the household.  The agricultural labourer has to get cheap beef if his wages are less than 20/-.  I wonder how many pounds of cheap beef he is to get in the week?  I can very well imagine the farmer's wife saying: &ldquo;Johnny, go down to the butcher and bring up five pounds of beef.&rdquo;  Johnny, who is an agricultural labourer getting less than 20/- per week, would go down, get the beef and bring it back to his mistress.  You know the thing cannot be done.  It is a thing that cannot be carried into effect.  I am surprised that Senator Counihan, a man who knows the conditions in the country, north, south, east and west, should introduce an amendment of this sort.</P>

      <P>The difficulty about the scheme suggested by Senator Lynch is that the farmer does, of course, certify that he kept two or three men in order to get relief of rates, but it is at the <Col N="1057" /> end of the year that he sends in that certificate.  That would be no use as far as the distribution of beef is concerned because we would require to have such a certificate every week.  I think Senator Lynch will agree with me that it would be extremely difficult for farmers to issue certificates of that kind every week.  They do not like that sort of clerical work, and I suppose our officers would hardly be satisfied unless these documents were verified.  That would make the matter very difficult. I am glad that Senator Quirke raised the question of the Roscrea factory.  If there was any doubt about it, I think Senator Dillon has made it right.  The Roscrea factory is taking old cows for conversion into meat meal principally, and part of the agreement which the proprietors of the factory have signed with me is that they must sell no edible product inside Saorstát Eireann, so that nobody in this country need be afraid that he will get any part of an old cow from that factory.</P>

With regard to the canned beef, canned beef is being produced, as Senator Dillon has told you, by the Waterford factory, and again there are certain clauses in the agreement with that factory that they must use prime cattle and only prime cattle, for the production of canned beef.  Therefore nobody need have any fear that the canned beef will not be produced from the best cattle in the country.</P>

He poses here occasionally as a representative of the farming community when it suits his purpose and that of his political party and when the Minister brings in something with which he wants the farmers to agree.  He made a most painful statement.  I do not believe that there is much use in pressing the amendment unless the Minister would agree to <Col N="1058" /> consider it.  I would suggest to him that if he thinks the scheme proposed in the amendment can be worked, he should adopt it.  The whole objection to it is the cost, and there is no use in the Minister speaking of administrative difficulties.  If he wants to administer it so that agricultural labourers or any other labourer receiving less than 20/- may get beef, that can be got over.  I intend to withdraw the amendment, but the Minister may still press the scheme forward and consult the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Department of Local Government.  They might well find a way out.  If he thinks the cost is too much, he can raise the price of the cheap beef by ½d. or 1d. per lb. and still leave it within the reach of the people who I consider are entitled to get it.  I withdraw the amendment and I hope that the Minister will consider my suggestion and consult the other Departments concerned.</P>

That part of the Principal <Col N="1059" /> Act deals with licences that may be issued when the Minister in this country prohibits the export of cattle, and only then.  It only refers to where the Minister here prohibits the export of cattle.  When the Minister here prohibits the export of cattle, he then gives out licences for export under that part of the Act, but it has nothing to do with the question of the British Government prohibiting importation into Britain from this country.  This Act does not deal at all with licences issued by the British Government.  It only deals with licences issued by the Minister here after he has prohibited export.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended to say a word or two on the Second Reading of the Bill but had not the opportunity of doing so, and I should like, Sir, to have an opportunity of saying a few words now.  I do not intend to say very much, but I would not like the Bill to pass without entering some sort of protest, or having it go on record <Col N="1060" /> in some way that, I think, the officialism that this Bill seems to enshrine is most objectionable to every farmer and, probably, most objectionable to everybody in the State, because it seems to me to perpetuate every sort of officialism and State control, as well as regulation, restriction, and all that sort of thing, and especially because it seems to do away with any personal liberty in the sale or purchase of cattle.  It imposes levies on cattle and sheep that are being sold and all that sort of thing, and I believe that the results that will be achieved from the Bill by way of increased consumption of beef, or by way of an increased price, will hardly be commensurate with the amount of liberty that people will lose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether it has occurred to anybody to consider the number of cattle or sheep that will be slaughtered for home consumption as compared with the numbers that are being exported.  This Bill has nothing at all to do with the regulation of prices for export or with levies with regard to the export of cattle or sheep. It means that we will have on one side numbers of men who will have to buy cattle at the supposed minimum price. I say &ldquo;supposed&rdquo; advisedly because, as we all know, the last Bill that purported to enforce a minimum price failed absolutely to do so, and I think that this Bill must also fail because conditions under this Bill will be, if anything, worse than under the previous Bill, because we will have, on one side, all these men who will be absolutely conscripted as to the method of buying their supplies.  They cannot say to the Minister, from whom they are getting their supplies, that they want heavy or big or well-finished cattle.  Naturally, they will all want the heavy cattle because, money for weight, these cattle will give them the best results from the point of view of the levy.  So that the whole thing seems to me to be a sort of artificial method that is being introduced into the country, and I think it is the duty, at all events of farmers who are intimate with these conditions, like myself, to enter our protest and have <Col N="1061" /> it on record that we, at all events, are absolutely opposed to this thing. Every tradition that we know of with regard to free sale and free dealing&mdash; and there is not any greater tradition&mdash; is being broken up here and there. There is no such thing now as free sale.  There is no such thing as personal liberty.  All that is being done away with.  We know that about £300,000 and more is being levied off the cattle and sheep.  The Minister and many others say that that money will come out of the consumer's pocket. Anybody, who knows anything at all about the matter, knows well that, even if it does come out of the consumer's pocket, which I question very much, it will come, in the long run, out of the producer's pocket, and it will not be a very long run either, but, on the contrary, it will be a very short run.</P>
    <P>Then, let us take this question of differentiation between the two classes of traders.  To my mind, that is an important part of the whole Bill. I mentioned this matter before, but I think that this is a suitable time again to put the question to the Minister as to why there is any differentiation between the two classes of traders &mdash;the home traders and the export traders.  The two classes will go side by side and I think there will be nothing but evasion of the Act; and, I think, naturally, evasion, because everybody will go in for a sort of self-protection and everybody will try to save themselves from being annihilated economically, and that is what it looks like.  We know that the cattle have been annihilated with the hammer or the knife, but now the old training and tradition, as we knew it, has gone, or at least is going.  It must be faced that this is not a temporary measure.  It looks as if the live stock industry of this country is in the last throes.  For instance, there is a crisis arising now.  This may not be quite relevant, Sir, but it would be relevant in the matter of the pig-producing business.  I refer to the levy of 10/- on pigs for export in an effort to maintain the quota.  That quota was lost before the levy was ever instituted.  It was lost for many <Col N="1062" /> reasons, but I say that, for all of these reasons, I, at all events, want to protest against the passage of this Bill.  I am rather sorry that the Bill has been rushed through the House in the manner in which it has been rushed.  I have no doubt that the Minister can give reasons for rushing it, but there are certain amendments that I think could be usefully introduced which, bad and all as the Bill is, might serve to improve it.  The Bill is taking away personal liberty and breaking up old traditions and I feel that it will by no means give results commensurate with the harm it will do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">

      <P>I wish to say a very few words before this Bill passes.  The Minister announced in the beginning, and on several occasions since, that the Bill was to provide an alternative market for live stock.  I want to ask the Minister how many cattle have been absorbed through the working of the Principal Act?  How many cattle have been accounted for?  The Minister made an extraordinary statement here.  It is absolutely staggering when we think of what has happened.  He said that he brought in this Bill to get rid of the cattle rather than to go in for a policy of destruction such as people did in other countries; whereas the facts are that some 281,000 calves have been slaughtered by the direct order of the Minister.  That is a thing which has shocked the sensibilities of everyone in this country and which has held this country up to ignominy in countries outside.  It is in this country, which God has specially selected for the raising of live stock, where every facility is given by Providence and where the finest natural feeding in the whole world is produced, that this criminal destruction is being carried on.  Yet, the Minister says here to-day that he introduced this Bill rather than go in for destruction. It is a shameful statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to protest, too, before this Bill goes through, against the statements made here during the debate as to so much being done for the farmer and as to his being compensated for the loss <Col N="1063" /> of his market.  We have heard this <i>ad nauseam</i> and it is an insult to our intelligence.  Everybody knows the figures of the losses, but, in face of such statements, it is no harm to repeat them.  In 1931, the value of the exports of live cattle was £18,327,669; and last year, 1934, it was £6,115,462.  The total value of animals and food products exported in 1931 was £23,348,670, and in 1934, £10,363,000.  Does the Minister or anybody else say that any compensation worth mentioning has been made to the people for that terrible loss? The fact of the matter is that there is actually going to be a scarcity of cattle. The Minister for Agriculture, and, I think, the Minister for Industry and Commerce boasted not long ago in this House about the great accomplishment of the Government in creating a position in which there would be no surplus cattle.  I wish to protest, like Deputy Dillon, against the whole business&mdash; this taking away of the liberty of the people and making beggars and slaves of all classes of the people who were independent before.</P>
    <P>We have come to a position now in which we have actually not enough cattle to fill the British quota.  We have not got enough stores, but, to my mind, the great mischief that has been done is the destruction of the fat cattle industry.  The farm which I was familiar with, which grew practically all the feeding stuffs, produced all the raw material for its factory with a great amount of tillage&mdash;more than the Minister is ever going to bring about &mdash;and fed it to the fat cattle and turned out the finished article, was the ideal factory and all the factories that would be put up, if there was one in every parish in Ireland, will not compensate this country for the loss of it. In the Minister's own county, the fattening of cattle and not the producing of stores was our business.  I well remember in the days of the old Department of Agriculture how the Scottish experts who came over here always deplored the selling of stores from Ireland instead of selling the fat cattle.  The custom was to sell a <Col N="1064" /> certain number of stores for fattening in Scotland.  They were produced at great cost here and sent over to Scotland, and the Scottish farmer reaped the benefit by putting the fat on them, which is the process which costs least. All the efforts of the old Department were directed towards changing that and towards encouraging the farmers of this country to sell their cattle fat, for which product there was an unlimited market, and still is, in England, in spite of what anyone says, because nobody in his senses believes that if it had not been for the action of the Government, neither tariffs nor quotas would have been put on against us in England.  That is all I have to say.  I hope we will hear no more about all that is being done for the farmer in the shape of the halving of his land annuities and bounties and subsidies as compensation for the loss of that market represented in these figures.  It is no compensation at all, and the fact is that the live-stock industry of the country is in its death throes through the action of the Government and particularly through the action of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Senator Dillon has refreshed our memories on the speech made yesterday by Senator Bagwell.  In his speech yesterday, and in Senator Dillon's speech to-day, we had the same reference to the effect of this Bill on the personal liberty of the individual. One would imagine that it was some terrible penal law we were passing here to insist on everybody being in bed by nightfall or something like that.  What I should like to know is who are the people whose personal liberty is being interfered with in the slightest degree by this measure.  I do not know what Senator Dillon knows about the meat trade in the country, but, so far as the butchers are concerned, he probably knows more about individual butchers than Senator Bagwell, because I should imagine he would be more in touch with them, but I know that, so far as I can find out from people in the trade, as the Minister explained yesterday, there is a very small percentage of butchers in the <Col N="1065" /> country who have had any difficulty in the past with regard to the Principal Bill.  I think we will all agree that the percentage of butchers in the country who have been dishonest is, as the Minister explained, very small, so that we have Senator Bagwell and Senator Dillon standing up to protest against the liberty of that very small section being interfered with as it is proposed to interfere with it in this Bill.  The extent to which their liberty is being interfered with is so far as I can see that the liberty to rob not alone the farmers of the country who are the producers, but, at the same time, the consumers, is being taken from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the principal difficulties that have arisen is that those butchers are not prepared to pay the minimum price.  The second difficulty is that butchers who are supposed to supply prime beef have, instead of buying prime beef, purchased old cows, some of which in the ordinary course of events would have found their way to Roscrea factory, and have sold that meat to the consumer as prime beef. If it is any harm to interfere with the liberty of people who are guilty of that kind of conduct, I, for one, am prepared to accept any responsibility that may attach to my attitude in regard to this Bill.  The original Bill was introduced very definitely for the purpose of increasing the price of meat in the country and we should at least have the unanimous support of any person in this House or out of it who poses as a farmer and a farmer's representative.  On the contrary, we have people here, and elsewhere, doing their best to set up difficulties and to put obstacles in the way of this measure, and it is extraordinary to find people protesting, at this eleventh hour, against the Bill being introduced and amendments taking the place of the support that should have been unanimously forthcoming from every section.  If it were not for the fact that the Minister did not get the support to which he was entitled from the farmers, and from people generally in the country, in respect of this measure, for obvious reasons it would not have been necessary to introduce many of these amendments at all.  These amendments <Col N="1066" /> were introduced because it was found absolutely necessary in the interest of the people to introduce them.  I see no valid reason why anybody should object to these particular amendments which seemed to be a stumbling block to most of the defenders of liberty on the benches opposite.  Senator Dillon went further and made a statement, which sounded rather poetical, that free trade, free sale and personal liberty were destroyed.  That is an admission to my mind that some of the Fianna Fáil policy has been a success, and that a policy in the opposite direction to free trade is taking place.  Some people may have benefited from free trade in the past; but we have only to read history to find out what we got out of that policy.  We got nothing but famine and starvation and the emigrant ship for our people.  Now, despite the fact that we are suffering from the tail end of world economic depression, we have our people better fed than those of any other country. Senator Dillon also deplored the fact that this is not a temporary measure. The particular bee in his bonnet is that cattle are to be bought for certain people who are unable or unwilling to do their business on right lines. Instead of deploring this new position, Senator Dillon, or anyone else posing as a representative of the farmers of this country, should agree with a general policy along these lines.  If it were a practical proposition for the Government to take the export and marketing of cattle into their own hands, it would react to the benefit of the farmers in this country.</P>
    <P>In yesterday's debate the Minister volunteered some information as to exports of cattle to Belgium and Germany.  He pointed out, that not alone were the Government able to pay the minimum price for the cattle exported to these countries but that up to the present there is a margin of profit.  I think Senator Dillon and Senator Counihan will agree that if our exporters were shipping cattle to those markets we would hear more complaints about the loss they were suffering than when they were making £4 or £5 a head on the British <Col N="1067" /> market.  It is not necessary, at this stage, to go into the question of the economic war.  It is a ridiculous argument to put up that it is not right for our Minister for Agriculture to control prices at home when he does not control prices on the British market.  If Senator Dillon has any plan whereby our Minister could control prices on the British market, I am sure our Minister would be very glad to know it, and I am sure the Minister for Agriculture would be still further pleased if he, also, could find out Senator Dillon's plan.</P>

I am entitled to give my opinion upon these measures, and I say, without hesitation, that after three years the Minister has been surprisingly successful in his administration.  If necessary.  I would be prepared to debate that question. He has to meet difficulties from abroad and serious difficulties.  So far as I can see, he has planned wisely and well in meeting these difficulties.  But in addition to the difficulties from abroad, he has had to meet difficulties, opposition and abuse from people at home who, instead of abusing and continuing their abuse, should have been ready to help the Minister.</P>

    <P>Reference has been made to the slaughter of calves.  That was necessary, and I would remind Miss Browne that it is not only within the last three years that calves have been slaughtered.  We have heard of veal <Col N="1068" /> before now.  The slaughter of calves has had the effect of improving the breeding of cattle and, particularly, store cattle.  In the County Clare, we were very glad to see that people in other parts of the country &mdash; in West Cork and Wexford where they may have bad cattle &mdash; slaughtered their calves.  We, in Clare, did not slaughter any calves, and now we are getting a fairly good price for our store cattle.  The price has improved and gone up by 30/- in the last six weeks.  It is necessary in all wars and differences between States, and in conferences between States, that certain interference with the ordinary arrangements of the people should take place.  Under the Acts that we are discussing, there has been interference with farmers.  I deplore that, but it was necessary interference.  When Senator Dillon says he does not like these regulations, I thoroughly sympathise with him.  As a person brought up on a farm, I do not like any regulations, but they are absolutely essential in the modern world, and also for the purpose of carrying to a successful issue the conflict in which we are engaged, and for the purpose of the change over to the new system whereby an increasing population has to be provided for in this country.</P>

      <P>We, on this side of the House, have had some lectures from Senators on the benches opposite as to how we should conduct ourselves. This debate has ranged over a wide field.  I do not want to go into all the questions that have been raised but I would say this that I think no good can come out of always harping on, and reminding the Government of, their mistakes.  They have made mistakes.  We all make mistakes, but we would be far better employed if we devoted ourselves to finding out what is the right thing to do in the present and for the future.  I ask permission to raise the question of the distribution of cattle export licences.  The Minister has delegated his duty in the matter of the distribution of fat cattle export licences to <Col N="1069" /> the county committees of agriculture. I do not want to be hard on the Minister, but I must accuse him of shirking his duty in doing that.  It is not so much what he has done but what he is doing.</P>
      <P>I want people seriously to consider the result of giving the distribution of fat cattle licences to the county committees of agriculture.  The county committees, in practically all cases, have been elected on political tickets and it is only to be expected from human nature that those people who are elected on political tickets will be anxious to grant favours to their own friends and supporters.  I would like the Minister to tell the House on what basis were the fat cattle export licences distributed amongst the county committees. I think there was a very unfair distribution.  That contention is borne out by the fact that, if we take the County Carlow, they got licences in the proportion of one to every three or three and a half beasts for which applications were made.  That was in the month of July.  In County Dublin, the proportion of licences given was one to every ten or 12 fat cattle for which applications for licences were made.  I know a great many farmers in County Dublin who had fat cattle ready for sale in July, but they got no licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the distribution of licences by the county committees, did the Minister set out any policy or prescribe any regulations which the county committees might follow?  Did he merely give them <i>carte blanche</i> to do what they wished with the licences and give them to whom they liked?  If he issued the licences without any definite instructions, he did not act in the way a Minister for Agriculture should act. This is a very serious matter, and the farmers who have fat cattle are very concerned.  In Kildare the county committee of agriculture said they would select the small men when giving fat cattle licences in July.  A number of people who applied for licences had as many as 30, 40 and 60 fat cattle for disposal, but they got no licences. Other people got as many as six, seven <Col N="1070" /> and ten licences.  I got no licence, although I have 200 Irish acres in Kildare. There is in Kildare a committee of agriculture&mdash;well, I will not say any more about it.  I do not want to accuse any county committee of agriculture of doing a dishonest act.  I do not want to say anything wrong about county committees.</P>

      <P>The object of the Bill&mdash; Senators seem to have missed it&mdash;is to try to obtain for the farmers some kind of a reasonable price.  The minimum price is 22/-.  In certain circumstances, brought about by other circumstances, the Minister has to attempt to get a price for the farmers and I can hardly understand the mentality which would oppose any such effort on the part of the Minister, whose job it is to see after agriculture. It is well known that the last measure, however well-intentioned, failed to achieve what was aimed at and the present Bill is simply an amending measure.  I am hoping that as we go <Col N="1071" /> on, if the present conditions continue, more stringent regulations still will have to be brought in so that, as in the butter business, a reasonable price will be obtained by those who have to produce cattle in the ordinary course of their business. Could the Minister give us any idea how many fat cattle licences will be issued for this current half year, from the 1st July to 31st December?  Have we exported above our quota in the past six months?  If we had figures in those respects it would give an idea to an owner of cattle as to what prospects he would have of getting rid of his stocks.  That might be some guide in the difficult circumstances that exist.</P>

      <P>If you are called upon to pay rates on a holding you pay according to the valuation.  That is generally understood by everybody.  I think if there are licences to be granted it would not be an unreasonable thing if they were granted according to the valuation of holdings.  You pay the rate on the valuation; it is so much in the £.  I know people, myself included, who cannot get a licence at all, even though they pay high rates on a high valuation.  I wonder would it be out of place for me to suggest that if the Minister is granting licences for fat cattle&mdash;fortunately at present they want no licences for store cattle &mdash;it would not be unreasonable to take the valuation of the holding into account instead of handing the distribution over to other authorities. I think it would not be unreasonable if the valuation is taken into consideration when distributing licences for fat cattle.</P>

      <P>There is very little doubt that the quota for stores in the year will not be exceeded so that there is no danger of keeping the cattle over. With regard to the issue of licences to the county committees of agriculture I want to say that a circular was sent from my Department to the committees of agriculture saying that we would have to adopt some basis and then stick to it.  We feared to a certain extent that there might be some favouritism and we did not want to insist on the basis we had been pursuing because certain county committees claimed they could do it better than we did because they had better opportunities.  Then we left it to them but we said: &ldquo;You will have to adopt a basis and stick to that basis,&rdquo; and I reserved the right to see that they kept to the basis that they adopted.  One county has adopted the valuation basis.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be an experiment and it will be interesting to see how it works.  Most of the counties have adopted a percentage basis.  They take the number of cattle that are fit for sale and give a proportion as far as the licences will go.  That was the basis we adopted ourselves.  In order to get a fair distribution of licences we took a census of the cattle for 1934. <Col N="1073" /> The census for 1935 is not yet out.  We took the number of cattle for two years and on that basis we distributed the fat licences to the various counties. I think it is rather strange if Senator Counihan is right in saying that there is one licence for three and a half cattle in Carlow and only one for 12 in Dublin.  It may be as Deputy Belton stated in the Dáil that the cattle in the County Dublin are as a rule more forward than the cattle in the other counties and therefore in proportion, there would be more applications in July than in October. It may be that the position will be reversed by next October and that there will be one licence for every three and a half cattle in Dublin and only one for 12 cattle in Carlow.  It will be well if we can get that position right.  We tried to do so by taking a certain percentage of cattle two years old and upwards in each county as being the percentage that would be fat.  The whole basis is available for inspection, and in the report published to-day in the Official Debates for last week in answer to a question put to me in the Dáil I am giving the figures.  I am looking forward to a more pleasant time in the future in the Seanad in view of Senator Counihan's promise that he will not find fault with me any more.</P>
      <P>There are considerable numbers of sheep and cattle slaughtered in this country for home consumption.  In fact the home consumption of sheep is higher than the number exported, but the home consumption of cattle is not higher.  It is true that more fat cattle are slaughtered at home than exported. The question of free sale was referred to by Senator Dillon and also by Senator Quirke.  That is a matter of opinion and also a matter of necessity. We would all like freedom of sale if it does not work out in the way of doing us no harm, but the freedom was being worked by certain people in the cattle trade to their own advantage and against the advantage of the farmer. There was nothing left for us if we wanted to protect the farmer but to do what we are doing.  In this matter we want to benefit the farmer if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1074" /> The difference between the home and the export trade is, of course, the fundamental point in this legislation.  The Principal Act was brought in, in order to try to keep the home prices at the same level as the export prices.  We wanted to have the export price regulate conditions.  In giving the farmer a licence the idea was to bring the home price up to the export price.  Last year when we brought in the Principal Act we were getting 25/- a cwt. for export, while the home butcher was paying 16/- or 17/- a cwt.  The object of that Act was to secure a minimum price and try to get the butcher to pay that minimum price in the home market, in the same way as the shippers paid for the cattle exported.  The point is that we are trying to bring the home traders to pay a price up to the export price.  We want them to pay the minimum price.  The big idea behind the Principal Act was to get rid of the cattle surplus.</P>
    <P>I have been asked to give figures as to what is being used as a result of the Principal Act.  We have been using cattle for free beef at the rate of 1,000 cattle per week.  There is no doubt that if that 1,000 cattle were accumulating here we would have a very bad position with regard to the fat cattle because we would have a very huge surplus left over.  As Senator Dillon has mentioned here, we arranged to have a canned meat factory in Waterford. When that canned meat factory is complete it is estimated that it will take from 10,000 cattle to 20,000 cattle per year.  The Roscrea factory is taking old cows for meat meal, and it will absorb from 60,000 to 70,000 old cows per year.  As to these agreements mentioned by some Senators, we got permission to export cattle to the Continent, and we are getting rid of from 20,000 to 30,000 cattle per year to Germany and Belgium.  One Senator said that 881,000 calves were slaughtered this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Not 881,000.  The figure is 281,000 calves slaughtered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not 281,000.  The figure I have is 225,000, and I do not <Col N="1075" /> think it will be more than 230,000 calves for this year.  I can never see that the slaughtering of a calf is a great immoral act.  When did it become a sin to slaughter a calf?  We brought in that scheme of bounties on calf skins in order to encourage the consumption of veal in this country.  There is no doubt if we could get veal consumed there would be an end of the cattle surplus.  If two or three veal cattle could be consumed by the same people who consume one beef beast, you would have an easing off of the surplus, because in this country we would then be consuming two or three cattle instead of one.  If we could get the people to turn to the consumption of veal it would largely solve this surplus. That appears to be the way in which the continental countries get rid of their surplus cattle.  In France and Belgium they only produce enough cattle for their own requirements.  We require 800,000 milch cows here to supply all the butter, milk and cheese we want.  If we had 800,000 calves reared into adult cattle from these cows we could not possibly use all these.  The continental countries are in the same position as ours, but they do not allow their young cattle to grow to beef. They use veal largely.  These countries are self-contained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister knows that those countries have not the facilities for fattening cattle that we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They have no cattle to export.  They are practically self-contained and they do not export. That is the position.  In order to  the surplus here we want to get the veal consumed and I think it was a good idea to give a bounty on calf skins.  That bounty extends to calves three or four months old. A person killing calves could afford to sell veal cheaply in order to make veal popular, and recoup himself whatever slight loss there might be in doing that by getting an enhanced price for the skin of the calf.  That has not worked out very successfully <Col N="1076" /> because the consumption of veal does not appear to be on the increase. Now, if it had worked successfully, and this is the question that I want to get Senators to think over, and if we had got calves slaughtered at ten weeks old, would it be immoral, or if we had got them slaughtered even at seven days old and got the people to eat veal, would it be immoral?  Where does the immorality come in?  I do not see How can the country be disgraced? It has been said that the country is disgraced by having calves slaughtered, but some people hold that it is disgraceful to kill cattle at all.  We do not all hold that.  Senator Miss Browne asked what was the compensation for all those huge losses, but she afterwards appealed to Senators on this side not to talk any more about compensation.  I think I will take the latter advice. The Senator also said that there would be a scarcity of cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that the Minister said it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, the statement from whichever side it came, was that there may be a scarcity of cattle.  I think Senators will agree that I would be in a fine position on the 1st of next January if I was able to say to Great Britain that we do not want the Coal-Cattle Pact any more, the Coal-Cattle Pact which, undoubtedly, is very unpopular with Senators on the other side. If I am in that position on the 1st of next January, I hope Senators on the other side will congratulate me. Senator Quirke said that the people here are better off now because they are getting more to eat.  If that be the criterion, there is no doubt that we are better off, because we are consuming much more beef than we did in 1931 &mdash; practically twice as much; we are consuming something like 60 per cent. more mutton, we are consuming more butter and eggs, and even our people are going more to the pictures.  They are enjoying themselves better than they did in 1931.  We are getting more to eat <Col N="1077" /> and we are enjoying ourselves better, so, therefore, we must be better off.</P>

      <P>That the Committee on Procedure and Privileges be requested to consider and report as to whether it is necessary or desirable that there should be an amendment of the Standing Orders to permit of amendments providing for the use or knowledge of the Irish language being moved to Bills in any cases other than those in which such amendments are now admissible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have put this motion down for the purpose of getting formal consideration given to a matter which, I think, is of considerable importance from the national point of view.  Our Standing Orders, our rules of procedure and our standard of relevancy are, with certain adaptations, those that are in force in Great Britain.  I do not think that any objection can be taken to that because there is a long history of successful Parliamentary Government and of Parliamentary institutions behind it.  I am not suggesting that we should depart, to any great extent, from that.  I would not suggest even to this Committee if it were of that view that we should depart, to any great extent, from that, but I do think that certain modifications are desirable <Col N="1079" /> in this country because of the fact that we have in our Constitution a provision which states that the Irish language is the national language and that English shall also be the official language.  That position does not exist in Great Britain, and the sort of problems which, I think, arise here cannot arise in Great Britain where they have only one official language&mdash; English.</P>
    <P>I do not want to occupy a great deal of time in discussing this motion, but I would point out that we have the provision, for example, that all our laws are to be made out in the two languages.  We have even a provision here in the Seanad that all official orders and documents shall be printed in the two languages.  It seems to me that that being so, it is desirable that there should be power, in Bills not dealing specifically with the Irish language, to propose suitable amendments to provide for its use and for a certain knowledge of it.  In my view, an amendment that would be perfectly correct with relation to the Irish language would, of course, be out of order if it had reference, say, to French, German, or Italian, or to some other language which had no place in our Constitution.  I do not want to go over the question of the Galway Bill, but it ought be possible, for instance, in this House to move an amendment that by-laws made under a statute of the Oireachtas should be got out in the two languages in the same way as the statute of the Oireachtas itself and the documents of this House are got out.  To take this one case, I think it is desirable that the Committee of Procedure and Privileges should look into this matter.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is desirable that we should simply take the same attitude in regard to an amendment relating to the Irish language as would be taken if it was offered in the British Parliament, because of its special position in the State.  Some Senators may hold that if anything is to be done for or in relation to the Irish language it should be done only by a special Bill.  I do not think that way.  The situation of <Col N="1080" /> the Irish language here is that such work for it has to be done piecemeal. Conditions differ in every area in the country.  A thing that might be possible in one place would not be possible in another place.  Something that is possible in relation to one type of business would not be possible in relation to another type of business.  In one place you have a great number of people who know Irish, and, in other places, they know no Irish; so that any attempt to make them use the Irish language only would be a hardship. In some businesses it might be reasonable to require that the Irish language should be officially used, but in relation to another type of business that would be unreasonable.  It is necessary to deal with the language in a piecemeal way, and not actually to deal with its position in statutes.  I think the Oireachtas should take power on suitable occasions to insert such provisions.</P>
    <P>While I am suggesting that this question be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, I would not suggest any extreme steps.  I am never in favour of extreme steps, because I recognise that extreme measures of any sort produce reactions and generally do more harm than good.  I do not want to introduce American standards of relevancy.  I understand that in some American legislature, when there is a Bill before the House, dealing, perhaps with fisheries, it is possible for someone to move that dental treatment be given children in a particular State. I am not suggesting that anything of that nature should be done, but rather that we should so arrange that when something is ordered to be done by statute, if the Seanad thinks it suitable, it should be able to insert amendments providing that use should be made of the Irish language in the doing of that thing.  The Oireachtas has resolved that the Irish language is the national language and two successive Governments have definitely adopted the policy of trying to revive the language.  Nothing could be more futile than for us to give time and energy to a task like that, and yet not to take the necessary steps to make the work successful.  A great many of the things that are necessary <Col N="1081" /> to make the work that is being done successful and fruitful, are matters of detail, to provide a way forward for the language here and there, according as it is possible to make an advance. I suggest that there is a matter here that deserves formal consideration, and I urge the House to allow the motion to go to the Committee of Procedure and Privileges so that they may consider it and make whatever recommendations are necessary.  I remind the House that if it becomes possible to move amendments, in cases where it is not possible at present, in view of rulings that have been given, it does not follow that the Seanad need adopt any amendment that is offered.  The Seanad will always be free to reject anything that is put before it.  I only ask the House to consider whether it is not right that it should put itself in the position of being able to consider amendments in such cases.</P>

      <P>This is clearly a matter that should be gone into by the Committee of Procedure and Privileges, and I am prepared to support the motion.  Apart from the specific matter dealt with in the motion, more elasticity ought to be given to the Second Chamber with regard to Standing Orders than to a Chamber which is governed by the Executive Council, and where there is a great deal more urgent business. Bills introduced in the Dáil are Bills sponsored in almost every case by the Government of the day. The Dáil, of necessity, must have rigid rules with regard to the scope of Bills.  If a Ministry wishes to extend the scope of any Bill, they can withdraw it and bring in another one.  Bills that come here are Bills we cannot re-introduce.  They come from the other House and it is proper for this House to suggest that they would pass them on certain conditions, and without too rigid an interpretation of their scope. I do not want to be taken as questioning rulings, but perhaps there has been a tendency in the Dáil and in <Col N="1082" /> the Seanad somewhat to narrow the Standing Orders, certainly as compared with the practice in earlier years.  On the specific point raised by Senator Blythe, I think that during the first three years of the existence of the Seanad there were two or three amendments such as were indicated, one being in regard to the use of the Irish language on railway tickets.  That was introduced into a Bill that came to this House from the Dáil.  I have not looked up the case, but I think this is clearly one where the Committee might look into the matter.  If the motion is passed there will be no necessity for the Committee dealing with Standing Orders to meet until the Seanad reassembles.</P>

      <P>I am absolutely in accord with Senator Blythe.  I shall not attempt to prejudge the action of the Committee appointed to deal with the matter, but I agree with what Senator Blythe said, that this is a very proper case for the Committee to try if they can invent Standing Orders to meet the Senator's wishes.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the motion.  I thoroughly agree with what Senator Blythe said regarding the Irish language.  I do not think it is sufficient for the Government to say that Irish is the national language.  The fight to restore that language as the spoken language of this country should be continued on every front.  Senator Blythe is to be congratulated for pushing the matter so steadfastly in that direction.</P>

      <P>Ní dó liom go bhfuil aon Seanadóir i gcoinne an ruin seo.  This motion does not ask for anything revolutionary.  In fact it is a very modest proposal, and is only what could be expected, having regard to the long and sincere interest that Senator Blythe has taken in the language movement.  I would have preferred, <Col N="1083" /> however, if the Senator had spoken in Irish when introducing his motion.  Since I came to this House Senator O Maille and myself are the only members who speak in Irish from this side of the House, and, of course, the Clerk of the Seanad when he reads the prayers.  There is an old Irish proverb: &ldquo;Beatha teanga i do labhairt.&rdquo;  If we are sincere about the language question, Senators who are able to speak Irish should do so on all possible occasions.  I hope Senator Blythe visualises the day when the business of both Houses of the Oireachtas will be transacted in the language of the country.  Further, I hope that Senator Blythe's Party when putting forward candidates for public positions in future will see that they will endeavour to advance the language movement.</P>

      <P>With reference to the speaking of Irish, I speak Irish in my own house probably as much as English. I have a boy of ten years of age to whom I never speak a word of English. In my private correspondence <Col N="1084" /> with friends, I probably write as many letters in Irish as in English.  I have frequently addressed meetings in Irish, but I do not make a habit of speaking in Irish to assemblies in which the majority do not know Irish.  I do not find fault with anybody who does otherwise, but it is not a practice on which I am keen and, therefore, I do not follow it.  If other people choose to do so, I do not quarrel with their action; it takes all sorts of endeavours to make the advance we want.</P>

      <P>The Dáil has adjourned to the 30th October.  Therefore, this House must stand adjourned <i>sine die.</i>  It is probable that we shall not be called together again until the middle of November.  We have had a long and strenuous session; we did our best, and I am sure we all acted in the best interests of the country.  I wish you all an enjoyable, hard-earned holiday.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned <i>sine die</i> at 6.35 p.m.</P>
