      <P>It is suggested that the Committee Stages of Pounds (Maintenance and Provision) Bill and Milk and Dairies Bill on the Order Paper to-day be fixed for Wednesday, 1st May.  We ought, I think, to take the Fifth Stage to-day of the Agricultural Products (Regulation of Export) (Amendment) Bill because the Government requires that Bill for, they say, administrative reasons.  Is the House agreed?</P>
      <P>Ordered accordingly.</P>

      <P>It may be regarded as certain that we shall receive from the Dáil this week the Local Loans and Funds Bill, and also, for the second time the Constitution (Amendment No. 19) Bill.  We may possibly get the Courthouses (Provision and Maintenance) Bill.  This will be all.  The Government desire for administrative reasons that the Local Loans and Funds Bill shall be passed into law before Easter.  As next week is Holy Week, I suggest that we should follow precedent by meeting on Tuesday instead of Wednesday.  We can then take the Second Stage of this Bill and there will be a motion on the Order Paper to enable the remaining stages to be taken.  If we receive the Courthouses Bill this can go on the Order Paper for a Second Stage and we can fix the Committee Stage for the 1st May.  As the Constitution (Amendment No. 19) Bill may give rise to a considerable debate, it is strongly urged that even though we receive it this week the House takes a decision to-day that it shall not be placed on the Order Paper for next Tuesday, but that the Second Stage shall be taken on the 1st May. That will give us an opportunity of <Col N="1598" /> giving the Bill more consideration. Does the House agree with that course?</P>

      <P>The Local Loans question in this country is quite a serious matter and this is one of the things that I doubt it is wise to let go through at one sitting and after a casual debate.  I have not read the Bill but I only know that it is connected with matters which have to do with the credit of this State and with accounts which probably want looking into.  The Local Loans Fund Bill deals with a very intricate question, a question which has been undefined in this country ever since we started.  It mixes up the account so far as I have heard about it between moneys advanced with the securities behind them from people to whom the money is lent and certain amounts advanced for the State on the credit of the State.  Yet they are all included in one account.  It is a matter that will want a bit of looking into.  I am talking from conversations which I have heard. It seems it is not a thing that we should hurry through.  I wonder why it is that the Government want it in such a hurry and why they are only giving it to us one week before they want it this year?  If the Minister tells us of any solid or pressing reasons it may alter our view.</P>

      <P>Of course when one hears the words Local Loans one is inclined to think that there is something very mysterious about the matter.  When I saw the Title of the Bill I thought it was a rather complicated measure.  Senator Jameson has admitted that he has not read the measure though it was circulated here weeks ago.  I read the Bill very carefully and it provides for a guarantee by the Local Loans and it preserves the existing rights and liabilities including the liability in respect of the Guarantee Fund.  So far as the Local Loans Bill is concerned my impression of it was that it was merely an administrative measure for the purpose of clarifying and co-ordinating these Local Loans.  My impression of it was that it was a very good, necessary and useful measure, and that it does not do anything to which I am sure a sound financial expert like Senator Jameson could possibly take exception.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge) Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed in this Bill to re-state in modern language the duty of local authorities in respect to the provision and maintenance of pounds.  I think it will be conceded that the existing law as set out in the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1851, is antiquated and unsuitable to present conditions.  As an example, the local authority such as the county council or such body has no powers as the law stands under that Act of 1851 to vote more than £10 for the provision of a pound.  The result has been that in some counties there are no pounds. In other counties there are places that may be called pounds but which are really unsuitable plots of ground imperfectly fenced, undrained and badly sheltered, with the result that the stock that is impounded in them suffers hardship and, consequently, deteriorates in value.  In this Bill power is being taken for the local authorities or, in default of the local authorities, the Minister concerned, to provide at greater cost suitable pounds.  These conditions came to the notice of the then Government some seven years ago.  The Bill drafted then was not introduced until recently.  It is now before the Seanad.  I take it that it was through pressure of other legislation that the Bill was not introduced at the time.  I do not know, except on the ground of pressure, any reason why it was not then introduced because the conditions existing were somewhat akin to the conditions existing to-day, except that the conditions may be more accentuated to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the other House it was suggested that the purpose of this Bill was very different from what I have outlined; <Col N="1601" /> that it has something to do with the seizures in relation to land annuities, and so on.  That is not so and I want to make that perfectly clear now. Under the existing law, the Enforcement of Courts Orders Act, 1926, the sheriff has absolute power to impound and sell all seized stock anywhere he likes, whether there is a pound or not. That is provided in the Act of 1926. From that point of view there is no necessity to introduce this Bill.  The position is this: Every user of the country roads knows that there are a good many straying animals on the roads and the Gárda find it difficult to get the owners.  They have no power to place those cattle anywhere except in the local pounds.  The result is that in some cases they have to drive these animals a considerable distance to one of these local pounds.  In some counties, as I have stated, there are no pounds.  Senators can appreciate the difficulties that obtain in such places. Modern traffic, as we know it nowadays, does require the roads to be regulated in certain ways and if cattle are allowed to stray and the Gárda are unable to find their owners, there is the difficulty of exercising that control over traffic.  That is the purpose of this Bill and it has no other purpose but this desirable purpose.  To try to suggest that it has anything to do with seizures owing to the non-payment of annuities is absurd.  The law as it stands is adequate for that purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is right that some few words should be expressed with regard to the introduction of this Bill.  Notwithstanding what the Minister has said, I think we cannot separate from our minds the fact that conditions at the present moment make a demand for increased accommodation in regard to pounds.  It seems strange that the Minister has allowed all these years to pass by before introducing this measure.  The fact that this measure has not been introduced before is a matter that deserves notice.  I know it from my own knowledge that the accommodation that is provided at the present time for impounded stock is not sufficient. It is neither sufficient from the <Col N="1602" /> point of view of dimensions nor from the point of view of the maintenance provided for farmers' stock.  The reasons are plain for everybody to understand.  I think it is quite bona fide to mention that the economic war and economic conditions generally have made it quite impossible for farmers to meet their liabilities at present.  Consequently, their cattle are being thrown into these pounds much more frequently than was ever so in the lives of anybody living at present.  Even in what we considered the evil days of landlordism, such seizures were never more frequent and it was never so necessary to take so many cattle.  I think that a much more suitable thing for the Government to do would be to try to revise conditions and to try to put it within the power of farmers to meet their commitments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot go that far.  As long as you keep to the necessity, or otherwise, for pounds, I will allow you to proceed, but I cannot allow you to develop an argument on the economic war and the land annuities position.  This is an administrative Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that the costs in respect of the seizures which are being made would be a legitimate subject for discussion and I respectfully suggest to you, Sir, that it would be a reasonable matter for public consideration as to whether these conditions could be revised or improved so that the necessity for pounds, either as at present or under the new conditions, will not arise so frequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another very important aspect of the matter, in addition to the points I have already mentioned. It is that it seems to be part and parcel of Government policy that local authorities must pay for the increasing of the accommodation in the local pounds.  I agree with the Government that the pounds are not by any means sufficient and that they will continue in their insufficiency in greater measure, but I suggest that to compel local authorities to provide this increased accommodation is altogether <Col N="1603" /> unfair.  It is unfair to ask local authorities to impose these charges on the local rates.  They are only part of the charges which are being imposed as mandatory charges on local ratepayers at present.  Such charges are imposed in many measures which I might not be at liberty to mention at present and they are being imposed in an increasing manner on local rates. There is an even greater grievance than that&mdash;a grievance which, to my mind, is intolerable.  In counties like my own, in which a Commissioner is in charge, all that is necessary is for the Government to send down a requisition to him to extend the accommodation at the cost of the local ratepayers. I think that is an intolerable state of affairs, and instead of imposing these charges and allowing these conditions to continue, the Government and this House would be much better occupied in considering whether these things could be rectified and whether, in fact, instead of having our earning power and ability to meet our commitments, taken away, we could be put in the position of being able to hold our cattle and stock.  These are matters which, I think, are relevant for consideration under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the general principles of this Bill and I agree that pounds are necessary.  The so-called pounds in the country are, in many cases, a disgrace and it is a good job, if cattle are going to be seized or distrained or taken up when straying, that they should be housed under humane conditions.  The introduction of the Bill, however, at this particular time was very disquieting in its effect on the farmers and I am glad the Minister has assured the House, in his statement to-day, that its introduction at this particular time was in no way due to the fact that there were going to be wholesale seizures by the Government.  It is very satisfactory that the Minister has given the House that assurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Dillon has pointed out, there are provisions in the Bill which will impose a good deal of expense on local authorities.  In many cases <Col N="1604" /> existing pounds would meet requirements because very often only a stray ass is impounded and there is no necessity for going to a great deal of expense and paying the salary of a pound-keeper for the impounding of a stray donkey.  The taking away of power, to a great extent, from the local authority will lead to a great deal more expense in the upkeep of these pounds.  The Minister takes power to fix a salary for a pound keeper and for an assistant who may be paid in fees or in fees and salary.  I should like the Minister to give us some assurance that there will not be any great departure from the old system with regard to the payment of pound keepers either in fees or salary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The law, as it stands at the moment, is that the 1851 Act set out that where a requisition was made to a local authority by three justices of the peace&mdash;subsequently, that was interpreted as meaning district justices&mdash;such local authority should provide the pound, but the expenditure was limited to £10.  There is practically no change in this Bill, except that, as I said, it is re-stated in modern language and except in so far as we are forced by experience to the conclusion that £10 in modern times is absolutely inadequate to provide any sort of pound.  Some reference, as I have already said, was made to the purposes for which these pounds were to be used.  I want to quote the section of the 1926 Enforcement of Court Orders Act to show that there is no necessity for the Bill so far as seizures for the one particular purpose referred to here are concerned.  Section 9, subsection (2) of the 1926 Act sets out:</P>
      <P>All goods, animals and other chattels, taken in execution by an under-sheriff under any execution order may pending the sale thereof be impounded, stored and kept by the under-sheriff in such place or places as he shall think fit, and notwithstanding that such place or places is or are not appointed or authorised by law to be used as pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That gave absolute authority in regard to the collection of annuities or in any <Col N="1605" /> abnormal situation that might be created.  There is no purpose in this Bill of trying to force local authorities to go into any wild expenditure.  It is only when it is brought to our notice by authorities that certain things have to be provided for, that steps may have to be taken by the Minister to ask them to provide the necessary accommodation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this legislation is to improve the methods of production and distribution of the milk supply intended for sale for human consumption in the form of milk and to safeguard it from infection and contamination.  As members of the Seanad are all aware, milk derived from healthy cows and handled in a hygienic manner is a most valuable food for aiding the physical development of the human body.  It contains a great assortment of nutritive substances, is readily assimilated and, therefore, constitutes a foundation upon which an adequate diet can most safely and most easily be constructed. It is very valuable as a food for infants and young children, who derive from its protein the necessary material for the healthy growth of their bodies. It is also beneficial to adults because of the supply of ash constituents and vitamins which it contains.  The investigations of research workers in recent years have clearly demonstrated the benefits to be derived from the consumption of a daily ration of milk. It has furthermore, the advantage of being a cheap form of food and a native product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1606" /> Having regard to the extent and importance of our dairying industry, it is a matter for surprise to find that in spite of its excellence as a food the consumption of milk in this country in its liquid form is substantially below the proportion consumed in other lands, and only 15.1 per cent. of the total milk production in the Saorstát is used for human consumption in the form of milk.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, clear from my foregoing remarks that there is a strong argument in favour of the increased consumption of milk as food in this country and that the quantity of milk available is sufficient to meet any probable increase in the demand.  The question accordingly arises, why have the medical profession not urged the organisation of a campaign for the increased consumption of milk as a food.  The reason is that of all foods milk is probably the one which is most easily contaminated by pathogenic organisms, seeing that it forms a most suitable medium for the propagation of bacteria.  It may be infected from being derived from a cow suffering from tuberculosis or other disease, or it may be contaminated by uncleanly methods of milking or storage in dirty vessels. What would otherwise be an excellent food may, therefore, become a source of infection, and the use of contaminated milk as a beverage may give rise to a widespread outbreak of serious illness, especially in infants and young children, in whose dietary milk plays so large a part.  It is, unfortunately, true that in many parts of this country milk producers have not yet learned the importance of ensuring that only cows which are proved to be free from tuberculosis should be utilised for the production of milk, and that the most scrupulous precautions in regard to cleanliness of the cows, of the milkers, and of the milk vessels are necessary if the milk is to be protected from contamination.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that it would be unwise to advocate a general increase in the consumption of milk as a beverage until every effort is made to ensure that milk producers and the public at large are educated as regards the absolute necessity for cleanliness in connection <Col N="1607" /> with the production and handling of milk.  It is also necessary that suitable penalties should be prescribed by law for offences in respect of the sale for human consumption of milk which is infected, contaminated or dirty.</P>
    <P>In framing this Bill for the purpose of improving the standards of purity and wholesomeness of milk intended for sale for human consumption, it has been deemed advisable to incorporate therein previous measures conferring powers for the same purpose so as to ensure that this enactment when passed may contain in suitable form all the powers dealing with the protection of the purity of milk intended for sale for human consumption in the form of milk.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill contains preliminary and general provisions and definitions. It authorises the fixing of appointed days for the coming into operation of various provisions of the Bill.  It provides that, except in Part IV of the Bill, the word &ldquo;milk&rdquo; is to cover whole-milk, cream, buttermilk and separated or skimmed milk, and is to apply only to milk intended for sale for human consumption in the form of milk.  The Bill does not, therefore, purport to affect the sale of milk intended for manufacture into butter, cheese, etc., powers in regard to which have already been obtained by the Minister for Agriculture under the Dairy Produce Acts.  Having regard to the scope of the expressions &ldquo;dairy&rdquo; and &ldquo;dairyman&rdquo; as contained in the Bill, it has been deemed desirable to exclude from these definitions farmers who during the period when milk is abundant occasionally sell portion of the surplus milk produced on their farms to their labourers or their poor neighbours, provided that the selling of such milk does not form part of the ordinary business of such farmers. Exemption is also provided in regard to a farmer who supplies milk to an employee as part of the remuneration of such employee under his contract of service.  The duty of enforcing the provisions of the Bill is imposed on sanitary authorities who are authorised to appoint officers for the purpose. <Col N="1608" /> Such officers are granted right of entry on premises for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of the Bill.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health and the Minister for Justice are empowered to make regulations prescribing certain matters in connection with the provisions of the Bill, such regulations to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas in the usual way.  Enactments at present in force in regard to matters incorporated in this Bill are to be repealed.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill prescribes that each sanitary authority shall keep registers of dairymen and dairies, and that no dairyman shall sell milk unless registered, nor on unregistered premises. The sanitary authority are empowered to refuse registration on sufficient grounds but the dairyman in case of such refusal has right of appeal to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, who may either confirm such refusal or direct the sanitary authority to register the dairyman. In certain cases the sanitary authority may cancel registration of a dairyman or of any dairy but provision is made for appeal by the dairyman to the Minister, who may either confirm the cancellation with such modifications as he may deem fit or revoke the cancellation.  Where a dairyman has been repeatedly convicted of an offence under the Bill or under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts in relation to the sale of milk, the sanitary authority are required to cancel his registration and cannot without the consent of the Minister re-register such dairyman within a period of one year from the date of his last conviction.  Certain other provisions are included in regard to keeping the registers of dairymen and dairies up to date, submitting evidence in legal proceedings as to the contents of such registers and allowing for an interim period for the carrying on of business without fresh registration after the death of a registered dairyman. It has been deemed desirable to exclude from the provisions of this Part of the Bill suppliers to creameries which sell milk of special designation for human consumption, provided such suppliers do not sell milk to other persons. <Col N="1609" /> The reason for this exemption is that suppliers to creameries have for the past ten years been subject to the provisions of the Dairy Produce Acts, which prohibit the supply of dirty or contaminated milk to creameries.  The standard of production of these suppliers is therefore higher than the general standard of milk production in most parts of the country.  The exemption is purely temporary and will be withdrawn in due course on the improvement of the general standard of milk production.  Arrangements are also made for excluding from this Part of the Bill persons who sell milk only for consumption on the premises, such as restaurant-keepers, etc.  This will obviate needless registration work.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill empowers the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, with the concurrence of the Minister for Agriculture, to make regulations in regard to various matters dealing with the construction and cleanliness of dairies and dairy equipment, precautions for protection of milk against contamination or infection, and the inspection of dairies, dairy equipment and dairy employees.  Such regulations may be either special or general and may apply to the whole of Saorstát Eireann or to any specified district. The Minister for Local Government and Public Health may also make regulations in regard to the inspection of animals in dairies by veterinary officers and may authorise such officers to take samples of milk from any such animal for examination.  The exemption of certain creamery suppliers from this Part of the Bill is also prescribed.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill provides for the sale of milk under special designations. At present, as members of the Seanad know, milk is being offered for sale under different descriptions implying certain superior qualities in the milk, but under the existing law there is no redress for a purchaser if the milk sold to him is not up to the standard of purity for which he has paid.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health is empowered <Col N="1610" /> under this Part of the Bill to make regulations prescribing special designations which may be used in connection with milk sold or offered for sale and providing for the granting of licences for the sale of milk of any such special designation on payment of the prescribed fee.  It is intended to follow the recommendation of the Inter-Departmental Committee on the milk supply and to classify the superior qualities of milk under three special designations, including pasteurised milk.  It is contemplated that at first the Minister will keep control to a large extent of the issue of such licences until the standards of purity and cleanliness become fairly established, and local authorities are educated to realise the importance of maintaining these standards.  It may be possible, however, at an early date to devolve such duties on the municipal authorities of the county boroughs who appreciate the necessity for strict enforcement of the necessary precautions in the matter.  When these provisions of the Act come into force, the sale of milk under special designations by unlicensed persons will be prohibited.  Power is also granted to the Minister to make regulations prescribing the general designations which may be used by dairymen in regard to milk offered for sale without obtaining a special designation licence.  General designations may be in the nature of &ldquo;fresh milk&rdquo; or &ldquo;new milk&rdquo; or such other title as will not imply any special degree of purity or cleanliness, in such milk. For instance, the terms &ldquo;pure milk&rdquo; or &ldquo;best milk&rdquo; would not be permitted to be used as a general designation. It will not be lawful for any person to use in connection with milk offered for sale, any words or signs which are neither a special designation nor a general designation and which are intended to indicate that the milk is of a particular quality or prepared in a particular manner or suitable for a particular purpose. Sanitary authorities may be required by the Minister to ascertain whether holders of special designation licences in their districts are conforming to the <Col N="1611" /> conditions on which these licences have been granted.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill deals with the prevention of disease likely to be caused by milk infected by persons suffering from, or carriers of, certain forms of disease likely to be readily conveyed by milk.  Power is granted to medical officers to carry out investigations in regard to the origin of outbreaks of diseases suspected to be milk-borne and to prohibit the sale of milk suspected to carry such infection. Every prohibition order for that purpose made by a medical officer shall come into force immediately on being served on the dairyman concerned, who may, however, appeal against the order to the district court. Provision is made for compensation of the dairyman for any loss or damage sustained by reason of such prohibition order, unless the order resulted from his own default or neglect.  Penalties are included for the sale of milk infected with any disease to which this Part of the Bill applies, and for neglect of a dairy employee to inform his employer that milk has, within the knowledge of such employee, become infected with a disease to which the Bill applies.  Persons infected with such diseases or exposed to infection from such diseases are prohibited from having access to milk in dairies, and the sale of milk to which such persons have had access is prohibited under penalty.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill is designed to prevent the sale of milk derived from animals suffering from certain diseases likely to render their milk unsuitable or dangerous for human consumption.</P>
    <P>Part VII of the Bill provides for the bacteriological examination of samples of milk and empowers the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to appoint duly qualified persons as bacteriological examiners, to fix fees to be paid for bacteriological examination and testing of samples of milk, and to prescribe the methods to be used in the examination and testing of such samples.</P>
    <P>Part VIII of the Bill deals with the appointment of milk-sampling officers <Col N="1612" /> and the procedure to be observed in sampling milk supplies.  It is to be noted that the milk-sampling officers will be persons whose professional or special training enables them to appreciate the necessity for the observance of suitable precautions to avoid the risk of introduction of any external contamination in the course of taking the samples.  The procedure for taking and dealing with samples of milk is also set out and differentiation is made as between the sampling of loose milk contained in churns, cans or other vessels, and milk which is intended for sale in closed receptacles such as bottles.</P>
    <P>Part IX of the Bill contains miscellaneous provisions.  It provides for the submission as evidence in legal proceedings of certificates from bacteriological examiners on the results of the examination of samples of milk.  Moreover, it is to be noted that, under the existing law, it is possible to sell with impunity milk which is contaminated or dirty, and the Bill contains a provision making the sale of such milk an offence punishable in the case of a first conviction by a fine not exceeding £5 and in the case of any subsequent conviction by a fine not exceeding £50, or imprisonment.  This portion of the Bill also requires vehicles, cans or other receptacles from which milk is being delivered to a purchaser in any highway or public place to be conspicuously inscribed with the words &ldquo;Bainne ar díol, &ldquo;Uachtar ar díol,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Blathach ar díol.&rdquo;  For the benefit of members of the Seanad who are not familiar with these terms, I may explain that they represent in Irish the English inscriptions &ldquo;Milk for sale,&rdquo;&ldquo;Cream for sale&rdquo; and &ldquo;Buttermilk for sale,&rdquo; respectively.  These inscriptions are mainly intended for the information of sampling officers and there is no doubt that they will present little difficulty to these officers on account of being in the Irish language. Power is also given to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, to make regulations dealing with the labelling of tins or other receptacles in which separated or skimmed milk is being offered for sale. <Col N="1613" /> Sanitary authorities are authorised, with the approval of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, to establish depots for the sale of milk which has been specially prepared for the nourishment of infants.  Medical officers are authorised to obtain from dairymen particulars of the sources from which such dairymen have derived their milk supplies.  Procedure is set out for the service on dairymen of notices or other documents required by this Bill.  Finally, a penalty is prescribed for obstruction of officers exercising their powers under the Bill.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to point out that the production of clean milk does not involve any very elaborate equipment or necessarily entail any considerable expense on building elaborate cow-byres or dairies.  It demands closer attention to the conditions under which dairy cattle are kept, to the grooming of the cattle before milking, and calls for greater care and cleanliness on the part of the milkers and distributors, together with the provision of suitable facilities for cleansing and sterilising milk vessels and utensils.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the experience gained in connection with the schemes for the provision of free milk for necessitous children at the cost of the State which have now been in operation for the last two years has demonstrated that there are many milk producers in this country ready and willing to adopt progressive methods by submitting their cattle to the tuberculin test, and improving the conditions of milk production if they are given some encouragement by receiving reasonable preference for milk so produced over the milk handled in the ordinary way.  Such preference was given for milk from tuberculin-tested herds in connection with contracts under the free milk supply schemes, and in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford County Boroughs and in a considerable number of urban districts and portions of rural areas tuberculin-tested milk has been supplied under these schemes.  The testing of the dairy herd in each case was certified by a veterinary surgeon.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that, as a result of this <Col N="1614" /> legislation, the cleanliness and wholesomeness of the general milk supply will be improved to such an extent that the medical profession will be enabled without reserve to encourage the more general use of milk as a valuable food. It would then be possible to undertake an intensive campaign to educate public opinion in regard to the wonderful food properties of pure milk and it may be practicable, in due course, to make this native product the popular beverage in this country instead of imported tea the excessive use of which has been detrimental to the physical development of many of our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say I welcome this Bill because it is now nearly nine years since the Inter-Departmental Committee made recommendations on which this Bill is based, and nine years is a long time to have to wait for legislation to carry on what was considered necessary so long ago. Everyone agrees with the object of the Bill and the objects are to be carried out by the method of closer inspection at the source of production. That is what the Bill aims to do, to have closer inspection at the source of production and by that means to have clean milk.  Certain exemptions are given and with two of these I do not disagree.  The first of these mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary was where a farmer may sell surplus milk at special times locally but who is not engaged in supplying milk regularly&mdash;a man who does not make a business of selling milk.  Secondly, there is exemption for milk given by a man to his servants.  I do not disagree with these but I see there is exemption given to farmers supplying creameries under Sections 20 and 30 to which I take great exception.  The creamery purports to make butter from milk supplied to it.  At present milk is sold to the creamery for 3½d. a gallon but these creameries seem to have entered the raw milk trade and that milk is sent into the cities in competition with the milk supplied by people who are producing it according to the regulations of the Ministry. They are producing a standard product <Col N="1615" /> and yet they are up against the unfair competition of the creameries.  I have no objection to the creameries sending milk to Dublin or Cork but I say it is a wrong thing to admit milk in a kind of back-door way&mdash;to a city like Dublin, for example&mdash;milk which is not inspected at the source of production and the only test to ensure that it is suitable for use is that it is to be pasteurised.  I am not going to enter into a discussion on the merits or demerits of pasteurisation, but there is this about it: milk should not be allowed to come into Dublin by rail in a back-door way and be allowed enter into competition with producers working under the extremes of cleanliness which the Minister is insisting upon in the County and City of Dublin.  If that particular type of production is sufficient for the milk coming in on the railways there is no reason why these very serious regulations should be insisted upon for local dairymen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary says it is not very expensive to produce clean milk.  Of course I do not think he is a dairyman himself, but if he understood the production of clean milk he would know that there is a difference of 4d. or 5d. a gallon in the production of clean milk as against ordinary production. The sanitary authority or the Ministry of Health insist upon the sterilisation of the utensils by steam, the cleaning out of the dairies and the byre two feet under the cow bed, two water supplies, one for the men to wash their hands after each cow and one for the man to wash the cow before it is milked.  All this is not for the high grade milk, but for the ordinary standard milk; and how is milk produced under standards like these to compete with milk sold to the creameries at 3½d. a gallon?  It is a wrong provision to have in a Bill where the whole principle is inspection at the source to admit milk by a back door method and to have it entering in unfair competition with the local producer. There is another provision also in the Bill, forcing pasteurised milk to be sold as pasteurised milk.  For example, <Col N="1616" /> there is the sale of milk under special designations.  I suppose that is all right, but there is no provision which says that milk must be sold as pasteurised milk when it comes into Dublin as fresh milk.  Pasteurised milk is often four days old when it comes into Dublin by rail.  That milk is supplied in competition with milk produced under the regulations of the Department, although it may be four days old when it is sold in Dublin.  That milk may be contracted for to the hospitals, for the poor and for the children&mdash;milk sold as low as 8¼d. a gallon.  A good deal will depend upon the method in which the officials will carry out this Act. They can make it very difficult for a farmer to carry on at all.  I would like to draw attention to paragraph (b) of clause 26 regarding the cancellation of registration of dairymen.  The Minister says that the licence will be cancelled where a man is repeatedly fined for offences under the Act, but what this Bill says is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Where a sanitary authority are satisfied that any premises in respect of which any person is registered in the register of dairymen kept by them are no longer suitable for use as a dairy such sanitary authority may by order (in this section also referred to as a cancellation order), in case such person is registered in such register in respect of other premises cancel the entry of such first-mentioned premises in such register or, in any other case, cancel the registration of such person in such register.</P>
    <P>It is not so long ago since we had the Sale of Food and Drugs Act and there was objection to some of its drastic provisions.  There was no alternative to a fine, in the case of a milkman selling milk below the standard prescribed by the Minister for Agriculture. That Bill is now an Act and it provides penalties if milk falls short of butter-fat content, and in addition to that this Bill will make it another crime&mdash;the dairyman's licence can be cancelled for the same offence.  I think that is too drastic.  No sanitary authority should have such powers. There is no question here of repeated offences.  If the dairyman is convicted <Col N="1617" /> he is liable to lose his registration. You heard all the arguments there were about the Liquor Act, but under the Liquor Act there were three chances. In this case the dairyman gets only one chance and he has no appeal.  Of course he has an appeal to the Minister but that would be like an appeal from &mdash;I will not say&mdash;but I think if he did appeal, it would find very little favour. There is no doubt that the administration of this Act will mean cleaner milk but it should be administered in a reasonable manner and should not be too drastic, and I hope that on the Committee Stage the Parliamentary Secretary will eliminate that particular paragraph of the clause.  It was introduced originally by the Deputy representing Trinity College and the Parliamentary Secretary seized upon the representations of a Trinity man to make the Bill even more drastic than it was.  I do not think he got it in the recommendations of the Inter-Departmental Committee.  There are other things I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to deal with: will the giving of that special designation licence entail that the milk vendor must sell the milk under that particular designation?  For example, suppose I get a Grade A licence, I would be entitled to sell that milk as milk.  But I would object to a man selling pasteurised milk being allowed to sell his milk as milk.  He would have to sell it as pasteurised milk.  Let the people understand the nature of what they are buying.  That is a very serious matter and it should be provided for in the Bill or somewhere in the regulations.  There are many diseases of animals mentioned here which the Minister for Agriculture says should be enough reason to revoke a licence.  I do not believe that a cow suffering from chronic mastitis gives injurious milk but there are differences of opinion in regard to what affects milk from cows with is wrong to sell milk from cows with chronic mastitis but here it is a crime to sell it.  However, it is here and I am not going to object to it.  There are many differences of opinion about <Col N="1618" /> pasteurised milk; some medical authorities hold that the pasteurisation of milk does not impair its food qualities at all.  Others say it is unsuitable for children.  My own opinion generally is that the people should know what they are buying, whether the milk is pasteurised or not let the public know it.  That was the object of the Inter-Departmental Committee's report.  These are the main objections I have to this Bill.</P>

      <P>This milk and Dairies Bill is one of the most important public health Bills that has come before this House for a long time.  When it becomes an Act, and provided it is suitably amended, it will have very far-reaching effects both on the health and lives of a very large section of the people, especially of the residents in the urban districts.  I hope it will increase enormously the consumption of milk, but it will not do that unless the public are assured that the milk sold is not a carrier of illness or disease in any form.  I fear that the Bill, without amendment, would not give this complete satisfaction.  This is one of the best milk-producing countries in the world.  We produce more milk than any other commodity, but we do not consume anything like the quantity of milk that we should. Milk is almost a complete food, and it is a fairly cheap food.  It will support human life for months and, possibly, for years without any other food.  It is commonly thought that milk is only a food for children and infants.  That is not so.  Everyone, from infancy to old age, can consume milk with great benefit to their health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is rather long-delayed.  A Bill carrying out the same purpose was introduced in the British Houses of Commons 12 or 13 years ago, and in the Northern Parliament eight years ago.  We have this Bill now. The question of a clean, and free from disease, milk supply has been pressed on the Government for the last eight or nine years and, as Senator Wilson has already mentioned, while the <Col N="1619" /> Government have done nothing the dairymen have done a great deal.  I think they deserve great credit for what they have done.  Eight years ago you had, perhaps, one or two dairymen who produced clean milk, free from disease.  Now, you have something like 30.  Some of those dairymen are very large producers. They have very large herds, some as many as 150 or 160 cows.  Naturally, they thought that they should be protected, but instead they were left to compete against men in the same trade who were using the designations &ldquo;tuberculin free&rdquo; and &ldquo;Grade A.&rdquo; milk on their carts.  There was no notice taken of that.  If any of these dairymen had added a little clean water to their milk they would have been prosecuted, but because others used a dishonest designation there was no notice taken of them.  We see on hoardings all over the city and elsewhere slogans such as &ldquo;Guinness is Good for You,&rdquo;&ldquo;Eat More Bread,&rdquo;&ldquo;Eat More Fruit,&rdquo; but we never see anything such as &ldquo;Use More Milk&rdquo; although it is one of the things of which we produce most.  I hope that we shall soon see such a placard and that we can say definitely that the milk that is sold is perfectly free from any risk of communicating disease.  I hope, too, that amendments will be introduced on the Committee Stage to improve the Bill so that the public can be assured that they are getting pure and safe milk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with those who have welcomed this Bill.  Everyone will be pleased if conditions are brought about so that the milk sold in this country, especially in the large towns and urban districts, can be guaranteed to be absolutely free from disease.  I think, however, that some of its provisions are too drastic so far as the rural area are concerned.  In the ordinary country village and the district around it those who sell milk have a very small number of customers. Very often the people who keep cows in such an area are small farmers.  It would be impossible for them to undertake <Col N="1620" /> all the expense which this Bill visualises.  I am not now referring to the methods of clean milking, the cleaning out of byres and that kind of thing. If such people were required to carry out big alterations to buildings they simply would not be able to bear the expense.  The exemptions given under Section 7 will also affect them.  Take the case of the man with ten cows.  He has, perhaps, 20 customers.  He has to employ a man to take the milk around to his customers in the village.  They are mostly poor people who cannot afford to pay a very big price for milk, certainly not anything like what is paid in the City of Dublin.  Large suppliers like Senator Wilson can scarcely be taken as speaking for the rural supplier who, under this Bill, will be put in this position: that a great number of farmers around him, who will be able to get exemptions, will be enabled to compete against him especially in the summer months when milk is plentiful. That is not fair to him.  Having been granted an exemption, they will not be required to register.  They will be under no obligation to comply with the regulations made under the Bill.  They can get exemption on the score that the selling of milk is not their ordinary business, but when they have plenty of it in the summer months they will sell it.  Therefore, they will be in competition with the man in the rural areas who has had to incur a great deal of expense in order to become qualified to sell milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I contend that some of the provisions in the Bill are altogether too drastic.  Take my own county.  It is not a dairy county.  What I have said will apply there.  We have very few creameries, only two or three, I think, in the whole county.  With the permission of the Cathaoirleach I would like to read a few extracts from a discussion that took place at a meeting of the County Wexford Board of Health with regard to the free milk scheme. These extracts will illustrate better than any words of mine what is likely to happen under this Bill.  I may say in passing that all the persons who took part in the discussion are all very strong supporters of the present Government, so that it cannot be <Col N="1621" /> argued that anything they said was said in opposition to the Government. In any event, of course this is not a political matter and could not be considered as such by anybody.  Before the discussion took place, a letter was read from the Department of Local Government and Public Health acknowledging the list of suppliers under the free milk scheme.  The report reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The general circular in regard to the scheme dated February, 1923, stated that the scheme in respect of year ended 31st March was only to apply to necessitous children under five years of age.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Secretary stated that the conditions set out by the Department would make the scheme unworkable next year.  The Department did not seem to realise that in some rural areas there might be only two or three people entitled to free milk, and that there was a farmer living near them who had milk, but he would not be prepared to tender for a supply to two or three people. In regard to the tuberculin test, it will be a fairly costly thing in the case of a farmer who had ten or twelve cows.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I may mention that in Scotland the cost of this test is borne by the Government.  Therefore I hold that the carrying out of the test here should be free of all charge to the owners of cows.  The report goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Chairman said that you could not apply those conditions in the rural areas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is to say, the conditions that are to be insisted on by the Minister under this Bill.  Another member said: &ldquo;If owners of cows were to be involved in considerable bother they would not be prepared to supply milk.&rdquo;  The report goes on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Secretary: The farmers who are not in the habit of selling milk will not supply it now.</P>
    <P>Mr. D. Allen, Chairman of the County Council, said that the Board would be up against great difficulties when the Clean Milk Bill went through, as anyone supplying milk <Col N="1622" /> would be obliged to have his cows tuberculin-tested or bacteriologically tested.  The scheme would be all right in towns where a farmer would be supplying milk to large numbers.</P>
    <P>Another member said: When we brought on the scheme they objected to the scale we have.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is to say, the Department objected.  The Secretary said: &ldquo;They are agreeing to it for this year but will not agree to it for next year.&rdquo;  A member said: &ldquo;Then they are going to kill the scheme.&rdquo; The report continues:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Allen remarked that provision of that kind should have been made in the Clean Milk Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another member remarked that &ldquo;the tuberculin test should be free to the owners of cows.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Allen suggested that the difficulty might be got over by requesting the Department to put the veterinary inspectors on an adequate salary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The remainder of the discussion is not relevant to this Bill.</P>
    <P>These extracts show that the free milk scheme will be very seriously affected in the rural areas by this Bill, and that the free milk will not be available for poor children.  There ought to be some line drawn with regard to the people who are to be exempted.  Anyone, almost, can claim exemption and sell milk under the Bill when it becomes an Act without being subject to the obligation of registration or inspection.  I am not objecting to the Bill.  Everybody knows that the condition to which producers have been reduced is such that they will be unable to incur the expense necessary to enable them to sell milk under the Bill.  Many of them have already been reduced to a state of poverty. Some Senators smile, but I suggest smiles are not suitable to the occasion at all.  Very often we see sarcastic smiles here when no other argument is available.  What I have said about the condition of many of those people is true.  Many people will be deprived of milk if insistence is made on the carrying out of the drastic provisions in this Bill.</P>
    <Col N="1623" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that Senator Miss Browne is against the application of this Bill to anybody.  Presumably, if it is so drastic that it will deprive people in the small towns of milk of a clean and wholesome quality, then it will be equally drastic as regards people in the larger towns.  I have the opinion that the Bill, if it is properly administered by the sanitary authority, will be more beneficial to the health of the small towns than even to the larger cities.  My own experience has been that dirty milk is more frequently bought, sold and consumed in the small towns than in the larger cities.  Whatever may be the case now, my experience a few years ago was that the byres and methods of production of milk in and around small towns were very bad indeed, and one hopes that one of the immediate effects of the administration of this Bill would be to improve the processes of production there.  Senator Miss Browne spoke of the stringency of some of the provisions of the Bill, especially when she referred to the competition which she said would follow from non-registered suppliers of creameries, who, in the summer time, when there is perhaps a surplus, sell milk in towns in competition with registered dairy people.  It seems to me the point the Senator made was that the provision regarding non-registered suppliers of creameries was too lax rather than that the other portions of the Bill were too stringent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was pointed out in the Dáil that experience of the Dairy Produce Act had undoubtedly raised the standards of clean production amongst dairymen in areas that supply creameries with milk.  I am inclined to think that Senator Wilson gave support to that proposition when he said that milk four days old, when it is pasteurised, could be sent to hospitals and public institutions and could pass as sweet milk.  If it is possible for that to be done, it indicates that there is a great improvement in the methods of production in milk of areas that supply creameries.  I take it that it is intended that procedure under the Bill shall be gradual towards a really first-class milk supply <Col N="1624" /> throughout the country.  I do not think the Bill is drastic at all.  In the main it aims at raising the standard of milk sent to towns for whole milk consumption to the level which has been reached by dairies supplying creameries, and I think it will be a step ahead of that standard when this Bill has had full effect.</P>
    <P>One or two points raised by Senator Wilson rather surprised me, particularly when he referred to milk from diseased animals.  I happened to compare a report of a Committee of which he was chairman and I can see no difference in the recommendation of the Committee and the recommendations in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I only pointed to the opinion of the Minister for Agriculture, who is a doctor, on the point.  He said that milk from a chronic mastitis cow was not injurious to health and he produced the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that it is the Minister for Agriculture is producing the Bill.  The recommendations which the Bill follows come from a higher authority than even the Minister for Agriculture.  There were at least three doctors on the Committee, one or two veterinary surgeons, and three or four farmers who were milk producers and had experience of the handling of cattle.  I do not think there is any just ground for Senator Wilson's criticism of that section, seeing that it is really embodying in legislation the recommendations of his own committee.  Perhaps the Minister would give some assurance regarding designated milk.  I take it that it is intended to designate certified milk and tuberculin tested milk into two or three standards according to report. Senator Wilson suggested that it should be possible for a milk supplier, who has a licence to sell, shall I say, a Grade A milk, to supply any other milk.  That seems to me to be very dangerous.  If a man advertises that he is licensed to sell certified milk and sells 25 per cent. of that milk certified, and the rest is not certified I imagine the other 75 per cent. would be sold at the Grade A price.  It is a dangerous proposition <Col N="1625" /> that a man working under a certificate should be free to sell another kind of milk, which is not certified.  I remember a certain well advertised dairy, the proprietor of which made great advertising value of the fact that he gained prizes in every show for his Jersey cattle, and I happen to know that he had about 20 per cent. of Jersey cattic in his herd and sold Jersey milk to a few people, but to all the rest non-Jersey milk.  That may happen here.  It is desirable if a person is working under a licence to supply a particular kind of milk that he should not be allowed to sell any other kind of milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will tell us the position under Section 39.  When a dairyman loses his licence he may appeal to the District Court, if he thinks it desirable to do so, but I am not sure from the reading whether in the interim, between the suspension of the licence and the hearing of the appeal, he will be able to carry on, or whether the licence will be in abeyance pending appeal.  Perhaps the Minister could give some assurance also upon a more important point. In the same section the medical officer, say for Dublin, is suspicious that milk from a certain herd, say in Wicklow, which is outside the sanitary district, is infected, that fever is being conveyed, according to his view, by milk which comes from a certain dairy.  The procedure prescribed here is that the medical officer in the Wicklow area, or in any other area from which the milk comes, shall be served with notice by post, and that certain other requirements of a formal nature are to be followed, all of which seem to indicate a delay of perhaps two or three days.  These are important days, between the fact coming to the notice of the medical officer in the city and compliance with the notice by the medical officer in the country area.  It seems to me that that is dangerous.  Where there is a clear case, in the mind of the medical officer of the city, or in the consuming district, that the infected dairy is in a country district, the machinery should be such as to ensure that a <Col N="1626" /> stoppage should take place forthwith. There should not be any possibility of a delay of two or three days, the serving of notice by post, and the medical officer in the country having to be satisfied that the disease came from that farm.  The consuming area should have some kind of veto on the sale of milk from a particular place, when there is anything like good ground for the suspicion that the disease had its origin in a particular place.  I realise that there are certain administrative difficulties, but it seems to me that the machinery prescribed in the section makes it possible for too great a gap to occur between the infection being observed by the medical officer in the consuming area and action taken by the medical officer in the producing area.</P>
    <P>There is only one other point that strikes me and that is in connection with Section 58.  I take it that this is a Public Health Bill.  I am not able to understand the significance of Section 58 in a Public Health Bill.  It strikes me as being very desirable that the largest possible number of people should be made aware of the regulations in regard to the sale of milk, but making conditions that the vehicles, cans and receptacles from which milk is being sold would have terms in Irish and not in English seems to me to aim not at public health but rather at propaganda.  I am not adverse to the propaganda, but public health purposes should, at least, be as important.  If it is to be made obligatory that Irish terms are painted on the vehicles and the vessels marked, there should also be in English terms.  I am thinking of the matter from the public health point of view.  It is undesirable that mere propagandist motives should have a part in the Bill. A point worth noting is the very great increase in recent years in the sale of iced cream.  Subject to correction by medical authorities, it seems to me that, whatever may be dangerous in the sale of whole milk, there is perhaps a greater danger in respect of iced cream.  As far as I can see, there is no provision in the Bill that ensures <Col N="1627" /> that the sale of iced cream should be under proper supervision.  It may be in other Acts, but I am inclined to think that the provision is not effective and that there should be something inserted in this Bill with that object.</P>
    <P>I would like to have heard the Minister relate this Bill to what I think he indicated as the general purpose of this and other measures, I mean the wider consumption of milk as a food and beverage.  I am not clear yet as to what steps the Government is taking with regard to the wider use of milk as a food and beverage, but I am hoping to see published in a very short time whatever steps of that nature they intend to take.  This Bill undoubtedly, or some such Bill, is necessary to run concurrently with it. I disagree with the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary in saying that until this Bill has become thoroughly effective it is undesirable to promote the much wider use of milk as a food and beverage.  I think it is not too soon to commence with whatever efforts or propaganda it is intended to make with a view to extending the use of milk.  I think it is almost universally recognised in the medical profession that amongst children at least a pint of milk per day is desirable and, some people think, necessary.  I am told that in the United States they are even talking about a quart of milk per day as being the necessary minimum. If either of those figures were taken, if a pint of milk were prescribed for children, and not less than a pint for adults, it would mean about 50,000 gallons of milk a day for consumption in Dublin City and the surrounding townships.  I do not know what the present consumption is, but I do not imagine it is half that. Certainly it is not much more than half.  A wide extension of whole-milk consumption would undoubtedly be beneficial from the public health point of view and from the point of view of the agricultural community.  I think it is very desirable that the Ministry of Public Health, in association with the Ministry of Agriculture, should, if possible, acting together, contrive <Col N="1628" /> some method of advertising and making popular the use of milk as a food and beverage.  I hope that this is merely one of a series of Bills with that object in view.</P>

      <P>I am very glad that this very admirable Bill has received the reception it has.  As a beginning it is a very admirable Bill, but it does not go far enough.  I want to say only a word or two with regard to the remarks made by Senator Wilson as to milk got from the creameries. Really the fact is that the milk from the creameries is very much rather above the average of milk sold for human consumption than below it.  If we were to get for the city supply such quality of milk as is now delivered at the creameries the average would be above what we are getting.  Even the Senator knows that the exemption with regard to the creameries is temporary. In the creamery with which was associated a great many years ago before we used the milk for making butter there was such a straining of the milk that it almost amounted to filtering.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>To make assurance doubly sure we strained it.  This legislation would not be before us now if all the milk delivered to the consumers in this State was like that milk.  Everybody who has had to do with milk knows that while a considerable improvement has taken place, the milk supplied in the cities was of a very filthy character, and I am sorry to say that a good deal of its distribution is of a very filthy character. The creameries have machinery for <Col N="1629" /> dealing with milk.  The milk is sometimes partly sterilised in the creameries.  They have cooling machinery of a such kind as to reduce the temperature to such a degree that it can stand a long railway journey without any multiplication of microorganisms and it is kept sweet and wholesome.  The point that Senator Wilson made with regard to the creameries was very much exaggerated. I agree with the Senator in one way. I think the Minister should look into Section 26 with regard to the matter of the cancellation of registration on the grounds of unsuitability.  While I quite agree that a man's licence may be cancelled for any deliberate offence such as that under Section 39 of the Bill I think it is rather drastic to have a provision whereby the licence may be taken away for an offence under the Food and Drugs Act.  I would like if the Minister would look into that matter.  There is no doubt that amendments will be drafted for the Committee Stage and I will be prepared to support an amendment with regard to the provision under which a man may have his licence cancelled even for one offence under this section.  Senator Johnson called attention to what seems to me to be a very important point under Section 39 which deals with the stoppage of supplies of milk likely to cause disease.  The prohibition order is immediately effected under Section 26. But later on in the section it is provided that Dairymen may appeal in the prescribed manner through the District Court.  It is not clear if the section permits the dairymen to sell milk during the intervening period, that is from the time of the prohibition order until the appeal is heard. I think it would be very wrong if it did not.  I would like the Minister in reply to give some information on that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not like the Senators to whom we have just been listening&mdash;a real expert in the matter of milk&mdash;but I have a daughter who was one of the original agitators for clean milk and clean milk supplies in the Free State.  Years ago, in the <Col N="1630" /> time of the late Government, she with others tried to get a Bill of this sort put through.  For years she has been working at this matter of a clean milk supply.  I thought that the wisest thing I could do was to write down to that lady who is now carrying on the business of a very extensive dairy farmer.  She and her husband have 30 or 40 cows and they sell milk, cream, butter and cheeses.  They have, undoubtedly, got the latest ideas that can be got about these industries.  I wrote down and asked what her opinion about this Bill was.  I could make up more or less a speech on this subject but, if the Seanad will excuse me, I think it will be better if I read for the House what she says.  Here it is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Bill has been so improved that I have not many suggestions to offer ... The new version of the Bill is much clearer and better defined than the first.  Part II is tremendously important and will give real control of milk sales, premises and dairymen.  In Part III I imagine that the words &lsquo;vessels and vehicles&rsquo; will cover the carts, etc. which sell loose milk and the bicycle delivery. Not that one has anything against the bicycles but against the fearful milk containers often hung thereon.  Part IX contains an excellent definition of contaminated milk which had previously been left undefined.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>She gives that line of criticism and suggests that it should come very much in its place on the Second Reading discussion and then she goes on to speak of the powers as to sampling milk and says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Here the dairyman might be very badly and unfairly hit unless the words in Section 15 &lsquo;taken in the prescribed manner&rsquo; have a very definite meaning.  No sample of milk from counties outside Dublin could reach a bacteriologist under 24 hours from the time of milking.  If samples are sent this distance in iced containers, all is well.  If sent in an ordinary parcel by postal delivery, the bacteria will have multiplied enormously by the time the sample reaches the bacteriologist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1631" /> One can quite easily see that the samples are going through a process of deterioration much more so than the milk which the dairyman is selling. That milk has not to go through such a process.  He is selling his milk quickly whereas the sample which is put into a small bottle. sent through the post can quite easily deteriorate. Then she continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I consider this would be most unfair on the dairyman.  It is all right for the licensed dairies &lsquo;under the actual control of the seller,&rsquo; because at least their sample of milk will be cooled before transport.  What &lsquo;sampling officer&rsquo; will take the trouble to cool his sample before sending it off?  One could ruin a man's trade again and again unless the taking of the samples is above suspicion.  Summer is the worst time for dairying, and treble the number of samples should be taken in summer than in winter if dairymen are to be helped out of their difficulties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>She speaks there of proper safeguards in the taking of samples and she uses the word &ldquo;icing,&rdquo; but in the ordinary taking of samples icing is not possible. I am sure the Minister will take care if the suggestion is followed up at all to see that prescribed conditions will be laid down, conditions which can be applied and which will ensure that the samples are what they ought to be when studied by a bacteriologist.  And she adds:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No such details could be inserted in the Bill, but I suppose the words &lsquo;prescribed manner&rdquo; should be clearly understood to mean technically correct methods of conveyance of samples from dairyman to bacteriologist.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is not a bad remark for a woman to make, but that is the gist of the whole thing.  That is her criticism of the Bill.  There is not the slightest doubt that she is one of the persons who for the last eight or ten years has followed up this business, trying to get good milk for the people in the Free State.  There is no one who will welcome this Bill more than she. Evidently from the extracts I have read <Col N="1632" /> from her letters she considers that this is a thoroughly good Bill.  Whether we will make the Bill any better by the time we are done with it I do not know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to this discussion with great interest, but, I must confess, without much enthusiasm. My lack of enthusiasm is not because of the Government's sins of commission in this case, but their sins of omission. I am of opinion that this Bill does not go far enough to eradicate the trouble of infectious milk supplies to town consumers.  Until the trouble is killed at its source, it will continue even after this Bill is passed, and if I had anything to do with the Bill-and I have had considerable experience on public boards in my town and outside it of milk supplies&mdash;I would make it compulsory on every dairyman applying for registration as a milk supplier to produce a veterinary inspector's certificate that his herd is free from tuberculosis and other kindred infectious diseases, and, further, to produce a medical certificate that the staff who help to produce and handle the milk was also free from all infectious diseases.</P>
      <P>It is absolutely useless to compile a lot of sections dealing with the penalties that will be imposed on people found guilty of marketing infectious milk.  They may have thousands of people infected before the inspector comes along and finds that they are supplying such milk.  If you kill the trouble at its source and see that, from the outset, the herd is free from disease, and that the human beings attending on the herd are free from disease, you will have very little trouble afterwards in the way of prosecutions, which are very undesirable. For the dairyman, the taking of these precautions would, in the long run, be cheaper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the other point that, as the law stands at present, if a dairyman wants to get a certificate that his herd is free from tuberculosis and from kindred infectious diseases, he must employ <Col N="1633" /> and pay a veterinary inspector to produce such a certificate.  As long as human nature is as it is at present, it is only reasonable to assume that, in regard to the people who employ him and pay him a good salary, he will not be averse from acting as they wish him to act.  Such certificates should be under the control of the local authority and that inspector should be paid by the local authority and he should be sent out to a dairy with an independent air, knowing that he is to receive nothing and has nothing to expect for the fair discharge of his duty.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to take note of that fact because it is very important.</P>
    <P>There are other points which have not been touched upon.  One of them is that in provincial towns&mdash;I do not know what the position is in the cities &mdash;on fair days and market days, when there are much cows for sale, the poor women go to the railway station and to the fair green, milk these cattle and retail the milk to the poor people in the town, without even putting it through a strainer to remove grit or dirt.  This is most dangerous and a matter which should be brought under control.  There is also the matter that, outside the ordinary registered dairyman, there are certain small dealers who buy milk from all sorts of people and retail it without being under any control whatever.  The one great point, however, is that the danger should be killed at its source before it comes into the towns.  The only way to kill it at the source is to have dairy herds inspected and dairy staffs inspected by a veterinary inspector to ensure that the herd and those who are attending to it are free from all diseases, infectious and otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Wilson, in the course of his remarks, conveyed the impression that the object of the Bill was to secure closer inspection at the source of production and that we were relying, in the main, for any good results that might flow from this legislation on that closer inspection at the source of production.  To an extent, I agree with the Senator, but I suggest to him that the real safeguard is in the <Col N="1634" /> registration.  That will, of course, carry with it a closer inspection at the source of production, but if the sanitary authorities in this particular instance discharge their duties under this Bill conscientiously and well, I think there cannot be any possible room for doubt that the cleanliness and wholesomeness of the milk supply will be improved, and improved out of all measure.</P>
      <P>The Senator took rather strong exception to the exemption of creameries under Section 21.  Many of the Senators who have taken part in this debate have dealt with the position of the creameries and the reasons for this special exemption as clearly, I think, as I can deal with it.  As a result of the clarity with which the position has been explained by other speakers, my remarks on this particular aspect of the legislation may be brief.  I would again point out that the exemption is temporary; that the creameries are only exempted in respect of the production and sale of designated milk; and that if any creamery puts on the market milk other than designated milk all the suppliers to that creamery will be subject to the full restrictions of the Bill.  Deputy Wilson may not possibly have adverted to the Minister's powers in the matter of regulations attaching to licences for the production of special designated milk, but such regulations in regard to pasteurised milk will, undoubtedly, prescribe the method of pasteurising, the particular pasteurising plant which must be installed and the particular process that must be observed by any creamery, individual or group of individuals undertaking to put on the market pasteurised milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to that, the creamery will be liable to inspection under the regulations made within the terms of this Bill and the milk which will subsequently be pasteurised and sold as pasteurised milk will have to reach a certain standard of cleanliness and wholesomeness and a certain bacterial content that will be laid down in the regulations before it is pasteurised. I mention that for the reason that it would be altogether wrong that the impression should go out in relation <Col N="1635" /> to this particular matter that a creamery could heat up any kind of dirty milk and put it on the market as pasteurised milk.  That is not so and that will not be allowed.  Even if it were possible, and we did not intend to deal with that matter under the regulations to be made, I do not believe it would be likely to occur, because there is not any doubt&mdash; and we might as well be fair to the creameries as well as to anybody else&mdash;that the standard of cleanliness of milk sold to the creameries is considerably higher than the standard of cleanliness of milk sold for human consumption by ordinary milk retailers.  Senator Wilson smiles.  I grant at once that the conditions under which milk is produced in County Dublin are good and that the standard is high, but I doubt if Senator Wilson is aware of the appalling conditions under which milk is produced for human consumption and exposed for sale throughout the provinces.  If we have the production of milk in the rest of the Free State area brought up to the same standard as obtains in Senator Wilson's area, there would not be so much need for this legislation at all.  The suppliers to a creamery are subject to certain restrictions.  They cannot bring in any kind of dirty milk and sell it to the creamery.  Under the Dairy Produce Act, as, I am sure, Senator Wilson knows, people who supply dirty or contaminated milk to a creamery are liable to prosecution and from day to day&mdash;I would be safe in saying every week&mdash;you will see prosecutions by creamery inspectors for selling dirty milk to the creameries.</P>

      <P>It must be registered if it is going to get a special designation licence, and if a local authority is not satisfied that that special designation milk is being produced by the creamery it is up to the local authority to refuse registration.  Senator Wilson may say: <Col N="1636" />&ldquo;Oh, yes, but the creamery is away down in Limerick and they are selling the milk here in Dublin,&rdquo; but under this Bill, not only must they be registered in the area in which the milk is produced but they must also be registered in the area in which it is sold by them as purveyors of milk and Senator Wilson's local authority can get after them in the area in which they are selling the milk, if he has any reason to suspect that it is not being produced under proper conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am devoting most of my attention to Senator Wilson because, I frankly confess, he was the most critical of the Bill.  Most of the other Senators who took part in the discussion had very little fault to find with it.  Senator Wilson was disturbed about the possible reactions of Section 26 which sets out that where a sanitary authority are satisfied that (b) any person registered in such register has been convicted of an offence under this Act or of an offence under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, they may cancel the registration.  Approaching this matter from a common-sense point of view and from our knowledge of the relationship existing between members of local authorities and their neighbours, is it likely that a sanitary authority will cancel the registration unless they are fully satisfied that they are bound in conscience to do so in defence of the people who are consuming the milk? They are given the power to cancel the registration but there is no doubt that a sanitary authority will be slow&mdash; unfortunately I believe that these authorities will be too slow&mdash;to cancel registration.  It is because of the danger of sluggishness in this particular respect that we have made it mandatory on local authorities, where there have been three convictions in court, to cancel the licence.  In that regard, we have left them no option. I do not think that dairymen or purveyors of milk will suffer undue hardship by the rigid manner in which sanitary authorities are likely to enforce Section 26.  If a sanitary authority should, for any narrow reason, attempt to victimise a dairyman <Col N="1637" /> by cancelling his licence without sufficient reason, the dairyman has a right of appeal to the Minister.  Regardless altogether of who may be the occupant of the seat of authority from time to time, a Minister can generally be trusted to see, in such circumstances, that there is fair-play and that a man is not victimised.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnson raised a point about the special designation licence.  I am not quite sure that I got his point clearly.  However, it will not be lawful for anybody to sell milk under a special designation other than the class of milk set out in that special designation licence.  I do not think that that is exactly the point that Senator Johnson had in mind.  What the Senator had in mind, I think, was the possibility of selling pasteurised or semi-pasteurised milk as ordinary milk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might explain my point.  A man has a Grade A certificate.  He advertises that fact. He sells, quite legitimately, a portion of his product under that designation, but a large number of his customers do not want that particular quality of milk.  To these customers, he sells a second-grade milk.  In these circumstances, it will be very difficult for the customer to make sure that he is getting the milk that he is supposed to get.  If a dairyman is allowed to sell Grade A milk and milk of some other quality, he will advertise his Grade A certificate and he will not tell the people that some of his milk is not a Grade A product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>He would be liable to have his licence cancelled if he sold any milk as designated milk which did not reach the standard of purity and wholesomeness laid down in the conditions attaching to the licence.  I shall look into this matter further, but I do not think that it would be possible or, perhaps, fair to prohibit a dairyman who had a special designation licence from selling ordinary milk just because he had that licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>He could not get a special designation licence if he was producing this ordinary milk on the same premises.  The licence will cover <Col N="1638" /> all the production on the same premises.  Sometimes, however, there is a surplus and he will have to sell that against the creamery milk.  He will, therefore, have to sell high grade milk as ordinary milk.  You cannot stop him from doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall see if there is any means of improving the Bill in that respect.  I doubt if we can make it any better in that respect than it is. Senator Johnson raised a point regarding a medical officer in a consuming district having to notify by post a medical officer from a neighbouring district that he has reason to believe that an outbreak of disease in his area is attributable to milk from that neighbouring district.  That is a point which could be usefully examined further.  Notification by post is undoubtedly slow, and if we can find a more expeditious method of notifying a neighbouring officer of health, it would be desirable to adopt it.  As to the possibility of contaminated ice-cream being exposed for sale, there is no doubt as to that, but this Bill cannot deal with that problem.  We are considering the question of introducing special legislation to deal with ice-cream. As to the question when a prohibition order becomes effective, it becomes effective when it issues. Should the person affected appeal to the court and should it be shown to the satisfaction of the justice that the dairyman did not knowingly commit the offence attributed to him, he will have power to recover damages from the sanitary authority for the period during which his premises were closed.</P>

      <P>That is a point which would have to be discussed in Committee. On the question of sampling, I was very interested in the letter read by Senator Jameson.  The lady who wrote that letter appears to have made a very close study of the Bill. The manner of taking samples will be prescribed in detail and, of course, it will be absolutely essential that such samples should be packed in ice-boxes to safeguard the producer.  All that will be dealt with by regulation.  These details are not incorporated in the Bill.  Senator Honan would not be in favour of registering anybody as a dairyman except the owner of a tubercle-free herd.  It would be very desirable if we had reached the stage when milk from cows that might be suffering from tuberculosis would not be exposed for sale for human consumption. However, we have not yet reached the position in which we can insist on the milk of every cow in the Twenty-Six County area being certified as being tubercle-free.  It would be very desirable if we could do that, but we have to go much more slowly for the present.  I am sure that Senator Honan is aware that a large number of positive reactors to the tuberculin test do not give infected milk.  It does not follow that because cows react positively to the tuberculin test their milk is dangerous for human consumption.  The whole question of the elimination of tuberculosis from cattle is one for the Minister for Agriculture. We are dealing here with the production of milk for human consumption. This Bill is a public health measure.  The other matter is being examined by the Minister for Agriculture. We in the Public Health Department are, of course, deeply interested in that matter and I understand from the Minister for Agriculture that legislation is being considered in his Department and will, within a reasonable time, be introduced, to deal with <Col N="1640" /> this question of the elimination of tuberculosis from cattle.  If the Minister is able to eliminate tuberculosis from cattle, our job, from the public health point of view, will be considerably simplified.</P>

The Minister stated that the quotas and the provisions relating to restrictions were imposed by the British Government&mdash;that our Government is in no way responsible for these regulations.

      <P>With regard to the other matters the Minister referred to, the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Act, he said he intends to bring in an amending Bill.  The sooner he brings it in the better because the present Act has been flagrantly disregarded. It has been disregarded by the exporters, the butchers, and the greatest offender of all is the Minister himself.  There is a clause in the Act which says that the Minister when fixing the minimum price for stall-fed cattle shall take into account the cost of production.  Has the Minister complied with the Act in that respect? Does the Minister consider 22/- per cwt. live-weight enough to meet the cost of production of stall-fed cattle, for that is the figure which the Minister himself has ordered to be paid for the cattle that he is buying for export to Germany.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be some excuse for the exporters who are compelled to pay 25/- per cwt. live-weight because at the time that price was fixed there was a duty of £6 per head but there is no excuse for the butcher because during my time, which is fairly considerable and long, I do not remember when first-class quality beef could be bought at 25/- a cwt.  The butchers in those days were selling at a lesser price than they are to-day.  I have made enquiries and I find that there are not more than three Dublin victuallers paying the minimum price in the Dublin market and all the money which has been expended on inspectors for this whole Act has gone by the board.  I am sure it must be a very serious disappointment to Senator Wilson, who was very enthusiastic about the Act. Since January the 1st, when the price of these cattle had fallen considerably, the Minister has reduced the bounty to 20/- for aged cattle or for cattle that paid the £6 duty and no bounty for any other class of animal, and no bounty for sheep.  We have to pay also 5/- per head to the butcher for every sheep he slaughters and £1 for every beast.  I say that money is coming directly out of the farmers' pockets <Col N="1642" /> and not out of the butchers'.  I would ask the Minister to seriously consider raising the bounty on cattle for export at least to 30/- a head.  I mentioned the matter to him before and it is not a pleasure to be always coming here supplicating the Minister to do something for the farmers, but if the Minister wants to carry on and not to be knocked out even this year he would do something to raise the bounty and he would assist the farmers in Kerry, Mayo and Galway.</P>
    <P>The distribution of export licences has been referred to.  It is an unenviable job for the Minister or the officials and in fairness to the Minister I would say that the export licences were not all given to Fianna Fáil, his own supporters. I believe they were distributed honestly and fairly and as honestly and fairly as the Minister thought fit, with very little regard to the political colour of the applicant. At the same time I would ask the Minister to consider the suggestions made on the Second Reading by Senator Blythe.  If there was more publicity and a wider knowledge of the people who are interested in the export trade and what considerations are taken into account when the licences are being allocated, I think it would allay all fears which are at present held that people are getting licences who have no right to get them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try not to be too long and not to bring in the economic war.  It is not easy when you are listening to a speech to assimilate it all so I read over what the Minister said quietly and tried to see what it implied and what were the objects in the Bill.  I came to the conclusion that it appeared to be a genuine effort to get sale and market for our agricultural produce in countries other than Great Britain, and if that is so it seems we are to look at the Bill as a whole and to look at the question of the sale of our agricultural produce and see <Col N="1643" /> how far this Bill goes towards increasing the sale of our agricultural produce before we finally put it on the Statute Book.  If that is the object of it I have some things to say.  The Minister I thought told us that as far as the Act of 1933 is concerned it was settled by Great Britain and I thought at first that the other countries which he is now trying to get power to deal with also had put in restrictions and that the powers the Minister seeks in this Bill must be placed in his hands before he can deal with these other countries.  As far as I can read from his statement he never said that at all. He is taking these powers over the other countries really and truly with the object of being able to trade with these countries and not because of the restrictions Great Britain imposed upon him.  As far as I was able to judge from reading it this Bill is to secure trade with countries other than Great Britain.  The Minister has come to the conclusion that the sales of our agricultural produce in these countries are not sufficient.  He thinks that if he takes the power to control the sale of agricultural produce to these particular countries he will be able to do a great deal better than the people who are now selling our goods in these countries.  That may be so but you know the Minister is taking a lot on himself when he thinks that, because as far as my experience in business is concerned it is the traders who are trying to sell and the people who are producing goods who know best how to manage the market.  The Minister may be dealing with Germany, France or Spain and if he proposes to take in his hands complete control of the sale of our agricultural produce to these countries I must say that it is a very difficult matter.  He is taking great responsibility upon himself.  I believe now honestly that he is making a genuine effort to increase the sale of our agricultural produce to these other countries.  He instanced the case of eggs in Spain and said that with restrictions in his hand he could prevent the sending of too many eggs to Spain. prevent the cut-throat competition and get better prices on a restricted <Col N="1644" /> market.  But, you know, there are many other countries producing eggs besides the Free State and if enough eggs were not sent into Spain the price might not be low enough and the market might be cut from under our feet by some other country.  Last winter I happened to be in Tangier and we went to lunch with some residents one day and we were given some roast beef.  We were told &ldquo;That is your own Irish beef&rdquo; and we said &ldquo;How does it come over here&rdquo; and they said &ldquo;It is the cheapest beef in the market we can possibly get at the present time.&rdquo;  Whether if we tried to raise the price of beef in the market of Tangier we would not lose our sales there is a point that the Minister will have seriously to consider.  Our exports of agricultural products to countries outside of Great Britain are at the present time so low that I see no reason why we should not let the Minister have a run for his money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point of importance. The Minister for Agriculture is taking power in this Bill to hand over certain of his functions and powers to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The reason for that is not clearly stated in the Bill.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, of course, is engaged in making business arrangements with various countries.  If he can make an agreement with another country to take more of our agricultural products, then it would be an excellent thing that he should have this power.  In view of the fact, however, that he is the Minister responsible for the tariffs that have been raised against nearly everything coming in from other countries, he would not appear to me to be the best individual to select for making any sort of business arrangement with those other countries.  I am not at all sure that our Minister for Agriculture, if he were in the position to disassociate himself from the heavy tariff restrictions which are creating a great deal of enmity between countries, would not be more favourably listened to by the representatives of a foreign Government than our Minister for Industry and Commerce.  If the latter attempts to negotiate business arrangements <Col N="1645" /> with foreign countries he may not be very well received, as he has tariffed almost everything coming in here from those countries.  However, if the Minister really tries to increase the sale of our agricultural products in countries outside of Great Britain by making bargains with them, I am afraid he will have to reduce the tariffs that operate on the goods which they are trying to send in here.  If the tariffs are reduced with that object in view, and if there is an increased export of our agricultural products, the citizens of this country will be very glad of it.</P>
    <P>I was accused in the House the other day of being a free trader.  I think even the Minister himself said that I had forgotten all about &ldquo;free trade being a dead horse,&rdquo; or words to that effect.  In the last ten or 15 years I have travelled over almost the whole world trying to sell the article which I produce.  In nearly every country I found a policy of violent protection in operation.  Therefore, I was hardly likely in this late debate to hold the view that one could trade with any country on purely free trade principles. I am afraid that when our Minister for Agriculture tries to make trade arrangements with foreign countries he is going to meet with a very difficult state of affairs.  I say that from experience.  He will find it very hard to increase the sales of our agricultural products.  From the words he used on, I think, the last occasion he spoke here he must be of the same opinion himself, because he said &ldquo;there is no greater prospect of finding a larger market for any of these commodities at the present time.&rdquo;  Now, I think the Minister and myself are much of the same opinion on that matter.  I believe that both the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture are really trying to see if they cannot find an increased sale for our agricultural products abroad, but I cannot see how this Bill is going to help them.  If it does not, where do we stand?  So far as one's investigations go, they lead one to the belief that there is not going to be any very great increase in the sale of our agricultural products to countries outside Great Britain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1646" /> There is this point, which some people are inclined to forget: when we were in the United Kingdom, whether they had protection in Great Britain or not, Ireland was able to carry on with her on full free trade principles.  I ask Senators to think what that meant to this country and what the position is to-day&mdash;to think of what protection has done for this country. There are many people, of course, who say that free trade is dead in Great Britain.  But when we were in the United Kingdom free trade was not dead so far as we were concerned. We know the amount of prosperity that came to this country during that time.  Now we have no free trade, but we have tremendous protection both on the British side and on our side.  I doubt very much if the great advocates of protection are particularly pleased with its results, especially so far as the Free State is concerned.  I do not think that England likes the results either.  The end of these free trade relations caused a grave dislocation of trade between the Irish Free State and Great Britain and the results have been extremely damaging to both countries.</P>
    <P>I am not now referring to the economic war.  I am referring to the economic fact&mdash;the fact that we have lost our free trade standing with the best customer that this country ever had or ever will have.  There is no use in saying that I do not recognise that the whole world has gone in for protection and that free trade is all over.  In America they have free trade over a whole continent, and because of that they are able to stand the shocks they experience when they do protect themselves.  In this little country we are not able to do that. We have no free trade now with any country.  We are living under a policy of full protection and I do not know that it is doing us much good.  At any rate, if we are not able to increase the sale of our agricultural products, with conditions as they are here, our position will be extremly serious.  We are very large importers of a great number of things from countries which buy nothing from us.  We import sugar, iron, rubber, tin, motors, and <Col N="1647" /> quite a lot of things that we cannot do without.  How are we going to pay for them?  The correct way, of course, would be by exporting our industrial and agricultural products.  We have very few industries with an export margin.  You could count them on the fingers of two hands.  In fact, what those industrial exports would realise is a mere bagatelle compared to the amount which we spend on imports. There are, of course, the dividends our citizens receive from their investments in outside countries.  The amount which people are receiving in that way is dwindling.  In addition, a great many of our rich people are gone.  The amount which our citizens receive in dividends from money invested in outside countries is small compared with what it used to be.</P>
    <P>There is another sad fact and it is that there are a great many people in the Free State who, because of present conditions, are beginning to spend and have been spending their savings. There is one good bit of business that we do.  It is in connection with the Sweep.  Of course, so far as the Irish contributors are concerned the Sweep is no good.  It is a wash out.  The Government, of course, get something out of it.  As far as Great Britain and the United States are concerned, where the millions come from, it is quite an excellent thing.  The Government make several hundred thousand pounds a year out of it.  I have no doubt that a good many of the promoters are also making a comfortable thing out of it.  But, speaking of the money that comes into this country in the way of dividends and thinking of all that we have to pay for our imports, we find a huge margin against us on balance.  That balance can only be rectified by an increased sale of our agricultural products. This country always had a very large exportable surplus of agricultural products. Up till recently our exports were able to pay for our imports.  We had not a bad balance of business. Unless this Bill helps us to increase the sale of our agricultural products very considerably, then we are going <Col N="1648" /> to go steadily down the hill.  We are going to rush into debt and we will not be able to pay our way.</P>
    <P>I do not know when that state of affairs will arise.  The only way to arrest it is for our Minister to increase, as I believe he intends under this Bill, the sale of our agricultural products in foreign countries.  That is the only salvation for this country.  I wish our citizens would wake up to the fact that, as we are going at present, we are steadily heading towards the bankruptcy courts, in which so many countries are involved, as the time is not far distant when we will not be able to pay for imports.  Our credit will then be such that we will not be able to get credit because other countries will know that we cannot pay for imports. That is going to happen within a reasonable time, if we do not do something along the lines of increasing the sales of agricultural products abroad.</P>

      <P>In the Dáil the Minister made what I might call a cryptic remark in regard to the coal-cattle pact.  I should like if he explained what he really had in mind when he mentioned that, so far as he was concerned, he did not consider it one which he favoured as it reduced his liberty to carry on.  The greatest difficulty in this country is to sell our cattle, and selling 150,000 of them, even at a bad price, was an opening for the trade.  I cannot understand how the Minister could have expressed himself in the way I mention. Perhaps there was something about the pact that was not understood. The Minister's statement appeared to me to be a wrong one to be made by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

Regarding what Senator Wilson said about the coal-cattle pact, that pact has, of course, made a little difference but not a great deal.  Although what Senator Counihan said is not strictly relevant to this Bill, it turns upon it and I suppose I am entitled to refer to it.  I hope the new Meat Bill will be brought in as soon as possible, because the other Act has been an absolute failure. I have undoubted evidence of cattle being bought at fairs at 18/- per cwt. within earshot of the inspectors. Senator Counihan mentioned 22/-. Cattle have been bought under the Act at 18/- and in a few places as low as 16/- per cwt.</P>

      <P>With regard to the coal-cattle pact, I do not think Senator Wilson quoted me correctly.  As far as I remember the circumstances under which the remark was made, I was dealing with surplus cattle.  What I deplored were the circumstances that compelled a Government to have to make an agreement such as the coal-cattle pact.  Under the circumstances I think it was a very good agreement. If we had no surplus cattle we would not be compelled to take coal from England.  We could take it where we liked.  As we had surplus cattle we had to make that pact and under the circumstances I suppose it was as good as we could make.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I mean by surplus is the surplus over what we have been finding a market for, either at home or abroad.  I find it extremely difficult to reply to anything that was said in the debate because, with all due respect to the Chair, I am afraid the same debate could arise on anything concerning agriculture.  If I brought in a wheat agreement the same debate could take place.  One question was asked by Senator Jameson which was relevant, and I should like to answer it.  He wanted to know if we had been compelled by countries other than Great Britain to implement legislation of this kind.  We were.  I may not have made that clear on the Second Reading.  For instance, the German Government in their agreement stipulated that they must not get more than a certain amount each month.  The German Government are the buyers in each case.  In a case of that kind, we cannot send a certain number of great hundreds of eggs each week, as we should do under the agreement, unless we could control exports. It is not intended that the Minister should do it.  We must at least be able to control and be able to say to exporters: &ldquo;You must not export more than a certain number.&rdquo;  This Bill gives power to do that.  There are other agreements, perhaps somewhat different.  For instance, the agreement with Spain gives us a quota for so many eggs over a longer period&mdash;for three months.  It would be possible in that case to let the eggs go in the ordinary way, not to have any control over exports, but to let the Spaniards tell us when the quantity was filled, and to let them stop the eggs going there.  But that would not give us the best possible price.  It is almost inevitable that any exporter who got a penny or twopence more for eggs going to Spain than for eggs going to Great Britain, would take the penny or twopence and competition would become so severe that they would eventually take the lowest price.  The price would become as near as possible <Col N="1651" /> to the export price in Great Britain, although they might be able to get, say, 1/- a hundred more if they held out.  That is the case I make with regard to the Spanish market, because I felt I could get more if they were not undercutting one another.</P>
      <P>The example which I gave was with regard to the export of fresh cream to Great Britain.  They were quoting against one another.  Last year we found that the creameries recognised that the export of fresh cream to Great Britain was a slightly better business than the making of butter, and a number of them turned to the export of cream.  Some creameries, not in the market previously, had to get markets from other creameries.  They got them by undercutting, and gradually they got the price down until it was smaller than butter and the market was no good to anyone.  We have powers under two or three Acts to deal with that position, under the Stabilisation of Prices Act and the Dairy Produce Act. Consequently we were able to tell the creameries that no more cream could be exported unless under permit.  When we got the creamery people together we told them we would give permits all round, provided they took not less than a certain price.  In that way we got them better prices in Great Britain than they were getting and that saved the position.  It was not of any great gain to the creameries, but it saved the Exchequer certain bounties and there were certain savings of general funds. Had we not had power to interfere, that could not have happened and there would be no saving of the public purse. It is something the same with regard to eggs going to Spain.  It is not that they will get more, or that they will be told to hold out and they will get 1/- more.  What we say is that they must hold out and get more or we will reduce the bounty so that we can save money on the bounty funds.  These are some of the cases where this Bill is necessary, when trading with countries other than Great Britain, and where it is not taken for granted that the Minister must go and trade himself or intervene to regulate trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1652" /> A few points with regard to the Cattle Act can be discussed on the amending Bill that is to be brought in after Easter, to deal with certain defects of administration.  I think Senator Counihan was wrong in accusing the Minister of not taking into account the cost of stall-feeding cattle. A Senator told me that he thought the people who were stall-feeding cattle made as much as ever, because they bought cattle at a certain price, sold at a certain price, and the margin was as good as ever.</P>

      <P>That the Seanad requests the Executive Council to set up a Commission to consider and report on the further steps which might be taken through the medium of broadcasting, talking pictures and printed publications to supplement and make more effective the work for the Irish language at present being done in the schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down this motion because certain things lately have convinced me that <Col N="1654" /> it is time that the matters to which this motion refers were very thoroughly explored and that they were gone into more carefully, with greater attention and in a more formal way than has been the case up to the present.  The policy of preserving and restoring the Irish language is a national policy.  It is a policy that has been followed by two Governments.  It is part of the policy of all the principal Parties in this country.  At the same time, anybody who pays attention to the facts must be aware that the difficulties in the way of making the position of the Irish language secure have by no means been overcome.  In fact, nobody who is aware of the whole facts of the situation could say with certainty that the Irish language will be saved as a spoken language which can be spread again over the whole country from the areas in which it has survived up to the present time.  The schools, both primary and otherwise, are naturally the principal media by which the language may be preserved and extended.  I think that so far as the schools are concerned everything that may be done has either been done or is in train.  Of course, the schools are not yet the effective medium that we would wish.  That is to say, taking the schools generally, they cannot be put into the position that we would like to have them.  That will not be possible for 30 or 40 years more.  The Minister for Education in a speech in the Dáil last week mentioned the fact that a quarter of the national teachers have, up to the present, no qualification for teaching Irish.  In Leinster, he said that in some areas as much as half are without qualifications.  It is going to be a very long time before we will reach the point that all teachers have the qualifications we should wish for.  It is going to be 30 or 40 years before they all have the qualifications we should wish them to have.  Even the teachers who entered on their work since the Treaty, though not without qualifications, have not in many cases the qualifications up to the necessary standard.  These teachers were allowed through and they are perhaps better than many of the teachers who were trained under the old régime.  But they <Col N="1655" /> are not absolutely qualified.  The schools would serve the cause of the language by making new Irish speakers and by educating those who come to school already knowing Irish in such a way that they would give new vigour to the language in the districts in which it is spoken and cause a new point of view to prevail amongst the people there.  Generally speaking there is still going on a process of decay of the language. If the schools and the other machinery at work cannot do all that is required, there are other reasons, beyond the fact that a great many teachers are either unqualified or not fully qualified to do the work.  I need not go into some of them, such as the fact that you have schools in which the classes are much too large for the new and difficult work of restoring the language.</P>
    <P>I want to go into the question of the atmosphere that surrounds school work and the support that ought to be given to school work.  Because of the various factors you find the work of the school being undone, you find that children going to school may be living in a house with elder brothers and sisters who have themselves left school a year or two, or find that in many cases those elder brothers and sisters have more or less dropped interest in the Irish language, or have dropped its study or have dropped the habit of using the language which they may have acquired at school.  If it is not a case of brothers and sisters in the house, it is the young people next door or the new people with whom they may be working in the factories and shops or with whom they may be playing football.  Although these themselves may have only left school a year or two, they are not showing that interest in the language that they should show, say, by using it. All these things tend to make the work in the schools, no matter how good the teacher may be, less effective than it should be.</P>
    <P>Of course the restoration of the Irish language cannot be accomplished merely by what the State may do. There has got to be voluntary effort and individual enthusiasm.  The <Col N="1656" /> question of organising this voluntary effort and inspiring that individual enthusiasm is a matter with which I do not want to deal on this motion.  I want to deal with the things that the State ought to do and must do in addition to putting the schools right and doing what is already being done by way of making a knowledge of Irish necessary for various professions, for entry into the public services and for things of that sort.  I mentioned briefly when the programmes in the Broadcasting Station were being criticised the treatment of Irish by our broadcasting service and I said that it was extremely bad.  In the first place the quantity of Irish given out is much too little.  It is very small and it is very much less than what is given out in Welsh by the British Broadcasting Corporation in the Cardiff station which serves the most anglicised part of Wales and a large part of the West of England where there is no Welsh at all.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Cathaoirleach resumed the Chair.</i>
    </P>
    <P>I think our station here ought to give us, to begin with, seven hours a week of Irish, rising to 14 hours a week.  I am not suggesting that that ought to be taken out of the time that is now given to broadcasting.  I think there ought to be some extension of hours.  I do not want to say whether that Irish matter ought all to be interlarded with English matter or whether there should not be an entire Irish night and some other Irish broadcasts through the rest of the week.  These might be matters on which there would be great differences of opinion; also as to the question of whether there might not, with three stations, be alternative programmes. I do think that it is necessary, if we are not to wilfully waste the work that is being done in the schools, that something like a fair show be given to the Irish language in the Broadcasting Station.  Not only must there be more time given to it, but there must be an improvement in quality.</P>
    <P>I admit that that question of getting the quality right is quite a difficult <Col N="1657" /> one.  It was a matter to which, perhaps, I did not give as much time and thought some years ago as I ought to have done, but I did to a certain extent take it up and made certain representations which, however, came to nothing.  I have now reached the conclusion that one of the things wanted is additional staff in the station to deal with the problem.  So far as English is concerned, it would be possible to organise a fairly good programme of lectures and talks by simply selecting from the applicants who would come forward the people who will lecture or give talks.  But so far as Irish is concerned it is quite a different thing.</P>
    <P>The number qualified to give talks in Irish is small.  Remember numbers of people who might be qualified from the point of view of Irish have not the other experience, and people with the experience have not the standard of Irish necessary.  So it is a question of going after people.  It might also be a question of paying higher fees.  It will not do simply to write a person to ask him to lecture in Irish.  It may be necessary to go to see him. Some years ago I sent a list of suggestions to the then director of the Broadcasting Station saying that people like those I mentioned should be got to talk.  I gather that these people were written to but that nothing came of it.  There are people who dislike going before the microphone, and there are all sorts of reasons of that kind which may have operated.  I think it would be necessary to go after Irish speakers and perhaps to press them a great deal.</P>
    <P>I believe myself that a great deal of the broadcasting time for Irish should be given to talks.  You would need a Gaelic Talks Director.  I here have a list of names of people who could be looked up.  I could easily run off up to 40 people each of whom could give a lecture in Irish.  Most of them could, I believe, be got to do it if there were a Talks Director to urge them on. They are people whose names and qualifications are known and they have good Irish.  A great deal of attention should be given to making it a matter not of duty <Col N="1658" /> but of interest on the part of the youth of the country to listen to Irish talks. Although we do not have political debates or discussions carried on in the studio in English for the benefit of listeners, I rather think that it would be desirable to do so in Irish.  That would give young people an interest.  I would like to hear the Minister for Education and a national teacher discussing the question of what is possible to be done for Irish in a city school with classes of the size they are. It would be something to which people would listen.  We might have other things of that kind too.  The same sort of difficulty exist in regard even to the drama or dramatic matters and the question of songs as in regard to lectures.  There is no great choice of matter or personnel.  I think that money would have to be paid for the adaptation of plays or for the translation of plays.  If plays are to be given, some special arrangement might have to be made for the actual acting, reading or production of them which takes place in the studio, but if we are to do any good with the Irish programme it is not a matter which can be left to the offers of people who wish to perform.  There must be a staff; there must be some money spent; and there must be forethought and care to an extent that has not been possible under the system that exists. It may be, for instance, necessary to look out for books from which special plays for broadcasting might be secured.  I understand that the plays that are most successful as broadcast plays are those specially written for broadcasting and not those really written for the stage.  I should imagine that it would be part of the business of the Broadcasting Station to offer prizes and to employ people, if they could find competent people, to adapt plays. Otherwise, there will be an uninteresting, thin and, to a large extent, useless programme.</P>
    <P>Then, there is the question of songs in Irish.  There are lots of lovely and surpassingly excellent songs, but when you are dealing with the revival of a language and the maintenance of an interest in it, you cannot run along on old songs.  You cannot always bring <Col N="1659" /> out the old favourites and those old songs which have failed to be favourites.  This is a problem which would not face the British broadcasting service and it would not face the broadcasting services in other countries, but it does definitely face the service here&mdash;this question of trying to see if it is possible to get new songs. Are there people who can write new songs or musicians who can set music to new songs, or, if you do not go as far as that, can compose new words for old songs?  I saw a whole audience being very much interested, pleased and amused when somebody sang the Irish version of &ldquo;Biddy Mulligan, the Pride of the Coombe,&rdquo; and if we can do no better, can we not get people who would from time to time compose such songs?</P>
    <P>I do not think we should be rigid or take up an impossiblist attitude on the question of Irish music because the popular songs of the day are going to be sung here and they are going to be known here.  I heard people talking about youngsters in the Blasket Islands singing the popular song of the day and my feeling is that it would be worth consideration whether we should not get somebody to write Irish words to the tune of &ldquo;Get Along, Little Dogie, Get Along&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Isle of Capri.&rdquo;  There may be a great difference of opinion in regard to that, but in any case, I think there must be newness and variety in songs and that is one of the big difficulties which the station has to face.  It is not merely sufficient to have the old songs; the need for newness exists.</P>
    <P>There is then the question of school broadcasts.  I notice that from the Cardiff Station to which I referred, there are broadcasts, perhaps three or four times a week, at five minutes past three o'clock for schools.  I have never happened to be at home at a time when I could listen to one of them and I do not really know what sort of stuff is given in them, but I take it that they are historical lectures designed specially for school children. I mentioned already that many of our national teachers are not <Col N="1660" /> fully qualified to make Irish speakers. They cannot be and we will not have them all so qualified for, certainly, 30 years more.  It would be a great help, I feel, in those schools in which the teacher can make a fair shape at teaching Irish, but is not really highly qualified, if broadcasting were brought into the life of the schools and if the children could, a couple of times a week, hear other people talking Irish to them on some subject.  Even where the teacher is very good, if the school is in a district in which there is little Irish spoken, I think you are not going to make Irish speakers merely through the work of the teacher alone.  You must bring in other elements and the question as to whether we should arrange for broadcasts for schools and make some arrangement for the provision of receiving sets so that these broadcasts could be heard in the schools deserves great attention.  The thing is being done across the water and it seems to me that there is a need for something like that here.</P>
    <P>I referred last week to the news service from the Dublin studio.  I think that every night there ought to be a news bulletin in Irish which is not going to be translated.  There is nothing more tiresome or more useless than to have matter given out first in Irish, and then in English.  Various people have also mentioned to me that it might be considered whether religious discourses, lectures or sermons might not be given every Sunday afternoon in Irish, or at least, from time to time.  I think the broadcasting of descriptions of outside events might also take place in Irish.  There is also the question of announcers.  If we are going to have Irish used a good deal in broadcasting&mdash;and the question of dialect enters into it&mdash;my own feeling is that we ought to have a couple of announcers, who, I think, ought to have Connacht Irish.  Although the Irish I learned myself is Munster Irish and my interest lies in that direction, I think that the middle dialect, as someone has called it, is what should be most generally used.  There might be a great deal of discussion on that, and I think it is an important matter. The announcers ought to be Connacht <Col N="1661" /> men who have experience of other dialects and who could, therefore, avoid certain pronunciations and phrases that would make understanding difficult.</P>
    <P>A great deal more might be said about broadcasting, but I think the subject is important enough and intricate enough to justify some special steps being taken to consider what should be done.  All that could be done might not be undertaken in the beginning, but some plan might be laid down to bring about greater development. There is a new director coming in and I am not suggesting anything that I am putting forward now, with a view to handicapping or prejudicing him.  I think that if the whole problem were considered his work might be made easier for him.  For instance, finance difficulties might be removed, and, on the whole, a great deal of progress made much more speedily. The question of broadcasting is one which did not arise when the Gaelic League was formed. Broadcasting is a new discovery and it is something which could be made serviceable to the revival of the Irish language and something which, if not dealt with, could be very injurious to the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I think the same thing applies to talking pictures.  We are promised stereoscopic pictures and coloured pictures within a year or two and these are going to add still further to the popularity and to the influence of talking pictures.  It seems to me that, with the spread of picture houses and with additional attractiveness in pictures, if we are to have no talking pictures in Irish language the outlook for the preservation of the Irish language, in view of its present position, is rather blue.  I think that is a matter which the Government must take up.  I saw it announced some time ago, when a talking picture to which I shall refer was shown, that the Government had spent a little money to get this picture made, but that any further efforts in that direction were not for the State.  I think that is a wrong view.  The Government has had to take up the publication of books and, as in other countries, broadcasting, <Col N="1662" /> and I feel that as far as the Irish language is concerned, it is necessary, for some time at any rate, that the Government should give attention to the production of talking pictures.</P>
    <P>I think the Government ought not to be discouraged by the result of a picture like &ldquo;Oidhche Sheanchais.&rdquo; I admit that that picture is a model of everything an Irish talking picture ought not to be.  I am not speaking in any sort of cavilling spirit.  Personally, if I had had ministerial responsibility, I very probably would have done what the Government did.  I know that when I heard that Mr. Flaherty was to make the picture, I thought it was a fine thing.  I thought he was the sort of man who would make a good picture.  I had not seen his &ldquo;Man of Aran&rdquo; or his other pictures and I did not realise that he was a man whose speciality, while he is a camera artist of great distinction, was to present wild and woolly people from wild and woolly places to the denizens of metropolitan drawing-rooms, and that what he would do with a picture of Ireland was sure to be wrong from our point of view.  Everybody who saw the picture will realise that it is not propagandist in effect, but, rather, I should say, contrapropagandist. First, we had Maggie Dirrane, who has no voice for singing, made to sing part of a song which gave a note of grotesqueness at the beginning.</P>
    <P>Then, we had the choice of subject. There is nothing duller than folklore to the ordinary man in the street, and I should say that it was a mistake to choose a folklore subject, but if it had to be folklore, we have to remember that the women and girls who have Irish are the same as the women and girls who have no Irish, and I am sure that any of them would rather have had the tale told by Tiger King than by the old gentleman with whiskers who did tell it. In any case, the face of the old man, who may be a good story-teller, was expressionless; his emphasis was absurd, as it is in the case of many of these story-tellers; and, generally, it was the most hopeless thing possible from the point of view of entertainment. I am not saying that by way of <Col N="1663" /> cavilling because anybody could have made the mistake.  It merely illustrates the difficulties before us.  I saw that some people blamed the Irish speakers of Dublin for not going to the picture. Of course, that is all wrong.  If a picture is right, the people will go to it and enjoy it; if the people do not go to it, you may take it that the picture is wrong and not the people.  It was one of those things that was not a success, but there is nobody to blame.  It was well worth the very little money spent on it.  The very knowledge gained and the pitfalls it disclosed were more than worth the very little money spent on it.  I think the Government ought to make up its mind either that it will take up this question of talking pictures or have it examined by a commission, as I suggest.</P>
    <P>I think again, that the first talking pictures ought to be made for the schools.  I have pointed out two or three times already the deficiencies of so many teachers.  You may do something else for children in Dublin.  You might arrange to take them to theatrical performances at which Irish would be well and naturally spoken, just as they are taken to concerts given by the military band, but for the children throughout Leinster and most of the places in which there is no Irish, there is very little means of bringing them into touch with the natural speaking of the language at present, and I do not believe that, even where the teacher is tip-top, his work alone is sufficient. Where the teacher is just only able to carry on, I think it is more necessary, if there is to be any hope of the children becoming Irish speakers, that they have some experience of Irish being spoken in a natural way.  There are, I understand, portable sets whereby talking pictures can be projected in any hall and I think that if talking pictures in Irish, suitable for school children and interesting to school children, were made, it would be a great advantage to take them around the schools and show them to the children who had made some progress with Irish.  Of course, that sort of picture is as difficult to make as any, but they could be short and cheap.  The <Col N="1664" /> Government could then proceed to other pictures which might be shown generally in the country.</P>
    <P>I remember seeing a French picture a year or two ago in which the spoken matter was in French, but there was very little spoken matter and the picture was so arranged that people who knew no French could follow it and enjoy it.  It might be possible to make pictures in Irish with very little spoken matter which could be generally shown here without causing fierce discontent amongst the non-Irish-speaking audiences in the ordinary picture houses.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of whether Gaelic editions of English pictures could be got.  I do not know the first thing about the technique of picture-making but it might be possible to do that and to fit other voices on to the actors.  I do not know whether that could be done with any artistic effect, but the whole matter, I think, requires examination.  I feel positive that if it is not tackled the work of the schools is going to be largely undone in the picture houses when the children leave the school and there will be nothing to support the children in any tendency to use and to keep up their knowledge of Irish once they leave school.  Of course, the difficulty on that side may be relieved to some extent later, if television develops and other means of dealing with the problem may appear.</P>
    <P>I come now to the last point which I set down in the motion and that is the question of publications.  This is an age of print.  There is practically no illiteracy.  Everybody reads and a great many people read a good deal. With the disappearance of illiteracy in the Gaeltacht&mdash;Senators will understand my point&mdash;a certain protection for the language goes.</P>
    <P>In the recent past, the greatest bulwark of the Irish language in a particular district was the existence of a certain number of monoglot Irish speakers.  I heard of one village in County Galway which had become practically an outpost for the speaking of Irish.  All around it, English had crept in.  What kept Irish as a spoken language there was the presence of a young man who was illiterate but who <Col N="1665" /> was amusing, witty and influential and who always spoke to the people around him in Irish.  He was at no disadvantage in dealing with people who spoke English to him because he was able to make fun of them.  He kept the whole village Irish-speaking.  That young man was taken to Ballykinlar, learned English there, and, in a very short time after his return, English had become the spoken language of that village.  With the complete disappearance, through the work of the schools and of education, of monoglot Irish speakers, the question of plenty of reading matter in Irish becomes of the most urgent necessity.  I have myself seen the effect of the introduction of a newspaper printed in English amongst Irish speakers. Before the war, I was in a house in County Kerry which was full of people who were speaking Irish.  Somebody brought in a newspaper&mdash;say <i>The Kerryman</i>&mdash;and read an account of the latest match in which the Kerry team had taken part.  For the remainder of the evening, the talk was in English. I have heard other people relate the same experience.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of reading matter, the individual must be remembered. At present, there is no use in thinking of the market for Irish reading matter.  You have to think of the individual and what matter is available to the individual.  The very fact that the number of Irish-speaking individuals is small practically necessitates the provision of much more reading matter for them than would be otherwise necessary.  It is worth noting that, in a small country like Denmark, there is an enormous output of books. I read the other day that, in a recent year, the output of books in Denmark was 3,500, of which 500 were described as representing Danish creative literature. That, I presume, would cover novels, plays and poetry.  I suppose the other books were reprints, translations, technical handbooks or school books.  That is a very big output in a country which has a population about the size of that of the Free State.  I do not think that the Irish language can survive the virtual absence of reading matter in Irish, which is the <Col N="1666" /> present position.  I read somewhere lately where somebody suggested that there should be no English taught in the Gaeltacht schools.  That is a proposition with which I would not agree for various reasons.  If it were carried out at the present time, having regard to the absence of reading matter in Irish and the absence of the other facilities to which I have referred, it would be a great injustice to the young people of the Gaeltacht and, in the long run, would produce some reaction that would destroy the possibility of the results for which the people who make the suggestion are hoping.  On the question of reading matter, standards are different nowadays from what they were 100 or 200 years ago and a much greater quantity is required.  I have referred to the output of books in Denmark as an illustration of this point.  I understand that, since the State-aided scheme for the issue of books in Irish was initiated ten years ago, there have been 250 books published.  That is absolutely and literally negligible.  As many books would be produced in a week in England and the number is a very small fraction of what would be produced in a year in a country like Denmark.  I think I have read all the books published in Irish during those years.  There may be a few which I found uninteresting and did not pursue, but I have looked at all of them and I have read practically all of them. Yet I have at times been months without reading a single Irish book, although I am not a voracious reader at all.  All the matter that is coming out in Irish can be read by anybody who gives to the reading of it about two hours a week.  I think that that is a completely impossible position and even the figures do not at all represent the real deficiency.  The output for ten years has been about one book or booklet per fortnight.  I read all of them and it did not take up much of my time.  Most of them, however.  I read because of my special concern for Irish.  As regards the ordinary reader who reads purely for interest or for pastime, there might not be more than three or four books of those issued which would be of any great interest to him.  The boy or <Col N="1667" /> young man who likes detective stories and stories of adventure would not have more than a dozen or fourteen books available to him.  That means that, after a short time, a boy inclined to read has either to read matter which does not appeal to him and which may be a sort of task to him or turn to the reading of English. That makes the work in the schools&mdash; whether primary or secondary&mdash; extremely difficult.</P>
    <P>I had always hoped that the work of the Book Committee would be speeded up.  As long as I was in office, I was trying&mdash;I do not say with any great success&mdash;to get that done. There are many difficulties in the way but, since I left, I do not think there has been any speeding up.  I do not know whether some of the continued delay is due to the people who think that we should print mainly original matter.  A small number of very meritorious original books&mdash;books of literary excellence&mdash;have been produced in Irish, but the number is very small.  I was trying to make a note of these works and I could only count about nine or ten books of that sort, in all, published by the Gúm.  Some of the books to which I have referred are published by outside publishers. Even if the position improves, the greatest number of original works in Irish of high quality you can get, considering the number of writers available, would be about ten or 12 in the year.  Tastes differ, and while you may have 12 quite good books published, there may be only one book available for a particular individual. The output of original Irish books which may be expected is so small, therefore, as to be of no consequence. You cannot expect the majority of people to read Irish on principle.  Some people will do that, but most people will simply read what they like and, if that is not available in Irish, they will read it in English.</P>
    <P>The fact that there is very little matter available in Irish makes the reading of Irish more difficult.  I read every Irish book that comes out, but I could not read Irish at all as quickly as I read English.  I could not throw my eye down a page of an Irish book <Col N="1668" /> and take in the contents, as I could do in English.  I do not suppose that there are more than half-a-dozen persons who could read Irish with the same facility as English is read, the reason being that not 1 per cent. of the matter available to them in English is available to them in Irish. When you have few books available in Irish, the tendency of the people to read Irish is therefore lessened.  If there were plenty of books available, the inclination to read would be greater.  I am quite sure that there are differences of opinion holding up progress.  A commission could thrash out these differences and arrive at a conclusion.  I think that we must rely mainly upon translations to provide the reading matter in mass which is necessary if we are to secure the preservation and restoration of the Irish language.  I should like to encourage original work.  Certain steps in that direction have been taken from time to time.  A prize was given for a novel in Irish.  The competition was not very successful.  Perhaps the prize was not sufficiently good or the time allowed was not sufficient.  One of the novels which secured the prize had the appearance of being scamped towards the end, and I have been told that the author said he had to rush it, towards the end, to be in time for the competition. If a prize were awarded every year, a competitor could hold over his work until he was satisfied with it. Many things could be done to encourage original work, but we must rely mainly on translation.</P>
    <P>Some people say that we should not have any translations from English.  I think that that is a wrong idea but, if it is causing any hold up, it should be considered in some formal way.  For the vitality and purity of the Irish language, copious literary translation from English is necessary because, if you have not literary translation, you will have casual verbal translation and you will have any amount of slovenly, unskilful constructions creeping in, which would be bad for the language. If there were a large amount of literary translation, verbal translation would be on a different plane and would be much more skilful and correct.  There are difficulties about <Col N="1669" /> translation from English.  A lot of the translation done must be of contemporary work and the difficulty of getting permission to translate it presents a problem.  I agree that we should have as much translation as possible from Continental languages. That would add to the flexibility and balance of development of the Irish language.  I think we ought to have translation from all the main continental languages.  If we did that and had good work translated into Irish, it might mean that the reader of Irish would have a better and a fuller view of the mind and thought of Europe than an ordinary reader of English would have, in spite of the great richness and quantity of English literature.</P>
    <P>What should be done to train people to translate Continental work into Irish is a matter which should be considered. In the last year Cumann na nGaedheal was in office, I got a provision for a small sum inserted in the Estimates to provide in a tentative way for training for writers.  That provision disappeared-for what reason I do not know.  If that was not the right way of tackling the matter, some other way should be adopted. Whether appointments might not be given in a temporary way on our legation staffs abroad to writers of Irish is a question which might be considered. No matter what we do as regards Irish reading matter, we are not going to be able to cater for the woman who runs to two novels a week. I am told that there are many thousands of women of that class in the country.  I do not see any possibility of providing quantity and variety for them but I do think steps ought to be taken to increase the Gúm output to ten times what it has been up to the present time.  Even that would not be very much.  Steps should also be taken to push sales.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the Gúm work.  Up to the present, only soft stuff is translated such as novels and plays.  No works involving technical terminology, whether on religion, architecture, history or art, are coming out, and I have come to the conclusion that it is necessary to employ a staff of translators and to have group <Col N="1670" /> work for such books.  The Dáil translation staff has done magnificent and marvellous work in its translation of the Acts.  I know that there are people who laugh at that work but I should say to most of those who laugh that if they had to sit down themselves and to produce from English statutes adequate Irish translations they would not make much of a job of it.  That staff is able to do its marvellous work because there is team work, because there is consultation, and pooling of knowledge and the possibility of discussion. The Gúm translation staff might be smaller than the Dáil staff and might have occasional people on it, as well as permanent people.  The position at present is that, for the student or the youth of inquiring mind whose reading, perhaps, is going to result in literary work or speeches or the publication of information, there is practically nothing to read.  An infinitely small quantity of reading matter is available but, with the exception of one or two school books, a translation of Dr. Dick Hayes's book on the French Revolution, and the <i>Autobiography of Wolfe Tone</i> which was done by An Seabhac, it is all fiction or plays.  That situation must be remedied.</P>
    <P>I have noted many things that a boy might be interested in, that he might want to read about, but about which he would not find a word in the Irish language.  I refer to such things as gardening, photography, motor cars, religious matters, doctrinal or devotional philosophy, economics, the New Deal, the Soviets, a history of the Great War, a history of the United States of America, foreign travel, aviation. In Irish there is not even a cookery book, a book on contract bridge, on golf, Roman law, or any subject that a man might have an interest in or a desire to study.  It seems to me that our work in the schools and elsewhere is going to be futile, in view of the rain of print under which we are living, unless we take steps to remedy that state of affairs.  I do not say that it can be remedied in a day, because everywhere we are up against the shortage of trained personnel. There is no doubt, however, that the work that has been done already provides <Col N="1671" /> a basis for further work.  A certain amount of trained personnel is now available that was not available up to the present.  It may be possible soon to get an output, between translations and original works, of four or five books a week.  While that would be very little, it would be a beginning, and ultimately a reading public would arise so that losses at present suffered would be lessened.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, some steps should be taken, now that the question of folklore has been dealt with, to get into print the great mass of Irish matter, from the eighteenth century particularly, which is in the Royal Irish Academy and which has never been published.  There is a great deal of valuable matter there and now is the time it should be published.  If not printed inside ten years it need never be printed, because new moulds will have been created in the language.</P>
    <P>There is one other thing I want to say about reading matter.  Great numbers of people are not going to read books.  I had something to do with the initiation of a scheme, that is still provided for in the Estimates, for subsidising papers published in Irish, or newspapers that published news matter in Irish.  I have come to the conclusion that that is not adequate, and that any scheme of that sort will not meet the requirements.  Dealing with any problem like this, the State cannot really hold to precedent or say that no other State did this or that. I think there is a necessity for something in the form of a weekly publication, a newspaper in Irish.  I do not mean a small publication such as was issued by the Gaelic League.  I mean a big paper of full newspaper size which will deal with every topic. It might give a little local news from the Gaeltacht.  I would not, however, want it to compete with ordinary newspapers, but to give in Irish world news that ordinary people are interested in. The difficulty now is that you do not get that news in Irish.  It should contain news of political crises, threats of war, news of earthquakes and sensational murders, new scientific discoveries, whether about heavy <Col N="1672" /> hydrogen, oxygen or the helicopter. Most people find some difficulty at present in talking in Irish about some of these things because they are not written about, and are not common topics in Irish-speaking districts.  We have people compiling lists of technical terms.  It would be far better to have terms that would be read and used week by week.  Special steps might be taken to see that such an organ should have a special sale in the Gaeltacht.  While such a paper would involve employment of translators, it might be linked up to some extent with other Government services so as to lessen costs. It might mean a considerable loss in the beginning, but I think it is a necessity.  We all heard the story of the man in Galway, an Irish speaker, who said: &ldquo;Bhí an t-M.P. ag cainnt ag meeting i yard an hotel.&rdquo;  While that may be a joke, there is in fact a difficulty about dealing with unusual topics or modern topics in Irish, because the ordinary person has not the terminology or the turns of phrase.  That is all very much in the way of a handicap to the Irish language and it should be dealt with by the publication of a great weekly paper dealing with all current questions in Irish.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other matters in connection with publication which I will not deal with now; I simply suggest that what I have put before the Seanad indicates a big need and a big problem.  I do not say that all these things are to be undertaken directly by the State.  But it seems to me that something like what I suggest must, at least, be helped by the State, and must be initiated by the State. It may be that some of it would not be done directly by the Government and that the Minister might form boards similar, though on a smaller scale, to the Shannon Board.  There may also be a question of special subsidies to private firms to do some of the work. All that is for consideration later. If we do not deal with this problem all these things&mdash;broadcasting, talking pictures, and printing&mdash;are going to work vitally against the Irish language.  We must use them for the preservation of the language.  We all <Col N="1673" /> know that the language has sunk to a low level owing to certain difficulties and that the decay has not yet been arrested.  We are dealing with something that is in a perilous situation and that does not brook any great delay.  A commission or some such body is needed to clear the ground, to formulate proposals to curtail difficulties, and to remove obstacles which may be raised, in perfect good faith, in the administrative machine.  I feel that this problem should be dealt with at once and I put it to the Government not by way of criticism&mdash;I am not raising the question whether the Government might not have done more in the ordinary way&mdash;that here is a fundamental problem that has become urgent and that should be dealt with as suggested in the motion.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to say very much on what Senator Blythe said, in connection with the various ways and means whereby Irish can be better encouraged and better developed than it has been.  There is nothing in the way of a difference of opinion between the main elements in the House on this question.  I think all national opinion is now convinced that everything possible should be done to foster the language.  The problem is rather one of what we can do, what we can afford to do, and the ways and means whereby the forces that are available can be used to foster the language, to take up the work of the schools at the point where they cease to operate; to consolidate that work, to perfect it, and to make the educational work done <Col N="1674" /> by the teachers in the schools grow into the natural growth that we want to see in the country, namely, an Irish-speaking population.</P>
      <P>I am in full sympathy with the proposal and with all that Senator Blythe put forward.  The question as to the setting up of a commission is one that I should like to think about.  It is one which I am sure caused the Senator some doubts in his own mind, before he put down the motion in this form.  I do not know how he reacted to the number of commissions created when he was in office.  I have always this fear, and particularly on an issue like this, that you get a great deal of valuable material from a commission, but you also get a great deal of valueless material.  You get on every commission a man who has an idea in his mind about something that he wants done irrespective of what it is going to cost.  There is this to be said about a commission such as this, that it is going to be entirely dependent on the finances of the State.  Some people on commissions think that nothing is too extravagant for such a commission to suggest.  I should like that this matter, as regards the selection or creation of the commission, should be left over.  I will undertake to bring the matter before the Executive Council and to see that it is fully considered there.  Nobody need have any doubt in their minds as regards the full sympathy, the full co-operation and the whole-hearted interest that every member of the Executive Council has in this problem of restoring the Irish language to its full position as the language of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to deal with one or two of the practical propositions that Senator Blythe brought forward.  I will take them in the order in which he brought them forward.  The question of broadcasting is all important.  I feel that there are great difficulties not only from the point of view of broadcasting in Irish but from the point of view of general broadcasting in this country.  I have the greatest sympathy with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in his handling of that work and I have <Col N="1675" /> the utmost sympathy with the new appointee who is taking over the direction of the Station.  Nobody is satisfied with the way Irish has been done on the air and very few, if any, have been satisfied with the general programmes of the Broadcasting Station.  We hope that drastic changes can be made.  The limitations that are imposed on the Director are not alone the financial limitations.  He is handicapped by the facilities or opportunities that are afforded in the way of the artistes available, the variety in their work and the material that you want and the tastes of the people.</P>
    <P>However all that may be, there is one thing in the way of broadcasting in relation to Irish which I certainly think should be done.  There is one proposal that I had definitely in mind when I was in charge of broadcasting as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and that was the linking up with the school programme.  We have some thing like 6,000 schools in the country I believe, and the question is whether these schools could be linked up for at least a half an hour a day with the Broadcasting Station.  I have several viewpoints about that and one was that it would in a way be a relaxation both for the teacher and the pupils if at least a half an hour a day were devoted to broadcasting, preferably in Irish.  Certainly 70 or 80 per cent, if not 100 per cent., of that half hour would be taken in Irish.  I see no reason, in view of the curriculum of the school, why 100 per cent. of the time should not be used in broadcasting Irish.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of what you would broadcast for the schools. What we want above all in Irish is variety.  There is, let us be quite frank about it, a monotony and a sameness about every item in Irish put through the Broadcasting Station. I would like to see every school having a half an hour's broadcasting at the end of the day.  There are a number of difficulties about it.  There is the school curriculum and you have to determine how many hours a week the Department of Education could allow <Col N="1676" /> for it.  Then there is the difficulty that the State would have to provide 6,000 radio sets.  The State might have to do that, but I do not see why it should.  The schools are equipped and kept in repair by the managers and the people, and it is not inconceivable that céilidhe could be run in the schools which would provide the £10 or £12 necessary for the radio set. There would, of course, be the question of maintenance, but that would be trifling.  Senator Blythe has made quite a number of suggestions.  He will know better than anyone here, better than I would know, what he visualises in the way of financial commitments in this matter.  It is true that when he was Minister for Finance he was not niggardly in regard to the development of the Irish language.  I think he may take it that if a reasonable proposition can be furnished which would show any promise of success that this will be developed. I am not committing the Minister for Finance to anything in saying that, but I know that the urge is there to have the Irish language fostered and made alive for the whole people of the country.</P>
    <P>The question of making talking pictures is one on which I would not like to express any definite opinion.  I would like to see film development in this country not only from the point of view of Irish but from the point of view of the general culture of the country. The question is whether, first of all, you are going to have an adequate market or whether we are to develop an export market for films produced in Ireland.  I have spoken to people in the United States on the question of the atmosphere, the weather circumstances and the rest. They are all agreed that the scenery is here and that you do get all the effects that you need.  It has been proved by such few films as have been taken that that is so but whether you would get enough of the dry days or sufficiently long spells of dry weather for the purpose is something that I could not say.</P>
    <P>But there is a more important difficulty than that.  We all know what elaborate structures and what tremendous capital are involved in the <Col N="1677" /> film industry.  We know that the big films, that will have a world wide showing, cost in many cases millions of dollars or hundreds of thousands of pounds.  What I am afraid of with regard to the development of the film in Irish is that we will have the same result if not quite so bad as the complaint that Senator Blythe has made about the film recently shown.  I agree that it is much better not to have any film at all than something that discredits the Irish language and produces something which is inartistic and hopeless and really does damage not only to the Irish language but which does damage to our whole sense of art and culture.  There are certain developments in the way of small outfits for taking and developing films.  I do not know if it would be practicable to get these.  The question is whether it would be worth while and would not be an injury rather than an assistance to the language movement.  That is something that should be examined.  I am not a Puritan, but my feeling on the whole question of film production, and even of the film censorship, is that 90 per cent. of the films produced in one sense or another offend one's intelligence.  Most of them are stupid, inane and are dealing with the type of life that is inane and stupid.  I am afraid that the influence of these films on the mentality of the youth of the country is bad.  I am not speaking from the point of view of purity or morality now but from the point of view of giving the people a cultural film.  The films certainly have been a great influence in modern life but to my mind the greatest force against developing the culture of the people has come from the films.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to speak on the question of publications.  I am all in favour of the translation idea.  Let us take the type of thing that the people want, and let us be cognisant of the fact that being merely Irish is not enough.  Boys growing up from the age of 12, 14 or 16 years of age to manhood need to be interested.  They want material that is able to take the place of what they have been reading in English.  They will read this matter in English if they do not get it in Irish. <Col N="1678" /> I see no hope of replacing publications in English by publications in Irish.  I do not see how anybody can have such a hope.  My conception is that at the very best we are bound to be a bilingual people.  That is not undesirable. Indeed I would prefer to see us a trilingual people.  But in so far as we are going in this matter of publications I would say that the main trend and tendency should be to get books suitable for the adolescent population so as to get continuity after the school-leaving age.  That is the desirable thing.  With regard to technical books and such I am not so sure.  The technologist will find his material whether in German, French or English. He will find that material because he is interested in his subject.  I do think that the vital thing in the present condition of the language is to grip the youth as it leaves school and to insure that there is continuity.  I have evidence at home and elsewhere how difficult it is for the youth to continue what Irish they got in school.  The youth must read and if there is any tendency to read at all that is the age at which readers are most voracious, say from 14 to 22 years of age.  I think most of us have experience of that.  These are the years when most of us are gluttonous with regard to reading books.  For that reason that should be our aim.  It is all a question here of ways and means.  It is a question of whether a commission is the best way to get at it.  Perhaps it is, provided the commission is carefully selected.  I am not in a position to state at the moment whether the Government would be prepared to set up the commission. It is a matter, at any rate, that will have our closest attention.</P>
    <P>Senator Blythe's speech has provided a great deal of material for thought, and it has provided a great deal of suggestions, and, no doubt, there will be many more suggestions coming from the other speakers, but I thought it well to express my own point of view on the various matters which he raised.  Whether this motion is carried or not, the matter will be considered, and I will bring before the Executive Council the suggestion of <Col N="1679" /> the setting up of a commission, and the House can rest assured that the Executive Council will consider it earnestly and sympathetically.</P>
