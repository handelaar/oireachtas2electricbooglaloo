      <P>I agree with what Senator Jameson said with reference to the dangers of the licensing system, which is embodied in this Bill and in many other Bills.  This system means that issues of great financial importance are decided by the Minister or the Minister's officers without the safeguards that ordinarily attach to the decisions of financial importance they have been accustomed hitherto to make.  For instance, when contracts are being entered into, a choice has to be made between one firm and another, but generally the amount of the tender will decide that issue.  When the question is one of the actual expenditure of money, there is the safeguard of the audit system.  In this licensing system, which involves issues of financial importance, there is none of these types of safeguard.  Everything really depends on the discretion and integrity of the official concerned, and, to some extent, on the possibility of a big row being kicked up and exposure taking place if anything unjustifiable be done. <Col N="1492" /> There are bound to be a great many border-line cases, and if the system continues to be carried out on a large scale with the amount of privacy that at present attaches to it, one would fear that a certain demoralisation or growth of unsatisfactory practices would arise.  Although this Bill deals with licensing only in a very small way, I think it right to take the opportunity of asking the Minister whether the Government does not consider that there should be a very wide measure of publicity if this licensing system is to continue.  I do not say that the licences given to each person and the quantity covered by the licences should be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, but I think it should be possible for any interested member of the public to get any information he requires in regard to licences which may be issued under this Bill.  Certain administrative difficulties might arise out of that measure of publicity, but these difficulties would, I believe, smooth themselves out.  The extra claims and complaints which would arise would be settled and a sort of routine would be established. Possibly, after a time, there would be no more difficulty in administering that portion of the Bill with a wider measure of publicity than there is in administering other measures under conditions which make it difficult for a person who desires to make a complaint to get the necessary data.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that this matter is important because I cannot see an end to this system of licensing If we were finished with the economic war, there would be a great deal less of it but, as the world is developing at present, it seems as if there will be, for as far ahead as we may care to look, a system of restriction of imports.  We are not going to get back to the freedom of trade which existed before the European War.  If we settled the present dispute, many of the existing restrictions would disappear, but some of them would remain.  It would be necessary to regulate exports, and the regulation of exports means, as Senator Jameson has pointed out, a certain regulation of imports.  That sort of work is of the greatest financial and economic <Col N="1493" /> importance.  If it continues on any considerable scale, it will touch the lives of great numbers of workers and other citizens.  The whole question of procedure and machinery requires, in my opinion, a great deal of study.</P>
    <P>In connection with the Estimates, it was pointed out that we have a great increase in the number of officials.  I am not speaking from that point of view.  I am thinking of the many undesirable factors that will arise if this matter is dealt with in a bureaucratic spirit and according to bureaucratic methods.  I have as high an appreciation as anybody of the integrity, ability and zeal of the Civil Service, but I do think that, in these matters, it is undesirable that the point of view of the civil servant and the Minister only should be effective.  I think that it is necessary to develop some sort of system which will identify more closely with the administration the people who are engaged in the industries affected by the restrictions or the representatives of those people.  It may not be possible to do more now than set up a number of advisory committees, but I do think that it is undesirable that this system, which I call, for short, a licensing system, should be administered with the amount of privacy with which it is now administered or that it should be carried on, so to speak, in the dark.  Taking the long view, it is, I think, undesirable that it should be run by departments without any direct, constant and well-regulated system of consultation with the people engaged in the industries affected.  It is all very well to call in a deputation or representative group from time to time, but something of a more permanent character than that is requisite.  I do not know whether the Minister would, on this Bill, which is, after all, an amending Bill, be prepared to consider amendments on the question of publicity or on the question of affording information with regard to licences. Perhaps he would tell us&mdash;this matter was put to the Government in the Seanad before&mdash;if the Government are inclined to modify the view which they originally had with regard to the question of publicity as affecting the issue of licences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had the advantage of a very interesting and varied discussion on this Bill.  Nobody can complain of the spirit in which the matter has been discussed by our friends on the opposite side or by Senators on this side of the House. With regard to the speech we heard last evening from Senator Jameson. nobody could say but that he was extremely courteous and considerate to everybody who differed from him. Having said that of his address, I think that it leaves me free to say something more by way of criticism. The Senator frankly declared that he always has been, is now and is likely to remain a free trader.  In his college days, he was probably impregnated with the doctrines of Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill.  He has not forgotten those doctrines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite likely that he has never had to bother about economic problems ever since and that his reading on these subjects stopped short with the cessation of his college days.  But it is interesting to find somebody who is still a free trader.  It is very interesting to find that.  Everybody who professed Liberalism, or friendship for the people, or interest in the masses in England, at one time was a free trader, from the time of the repeal of the Corn Laws down to very recent times.  It is obvious why they were free traders, being an industrial, and not an agricultural country.  It was obvious in another sense, because they were a great carrying country who carried the produce of the world to their own country and became the distributors for Western Europe for the products of half the world or a great deal more.  Therefore, they were free traders and they remained so from the repeal of the Corn Laws until comparatively modern times, that is, professedly free traders, but whether students of economics remained free traders or not depended upon whether they stopped short with reading John Stuart Mill or Adam Smith, or whether they kept themselves up to date by reading the doctrines enunciated by more modern economists than those distinguished men.  Anybody who has studied economics can trace the history <Col N="1495" /> of protection.  First, by following it through the advocates of free trade and then by the advocates of out-and-out protection.  Now we have come to this stage: we have protection in England; we have everything that is indicative of protection from the free trade or dumping methods of other countries that have an excess of products over those required for their own consumption, but still, the learned Senator confesses himself a free trader. I would like to follow him, of course, in his views, in trying to understand them, and I am sure a great number of Senators would agree with him in some of his conclusions, if it was possible to do so, but when I listened to his ideas and reflected on them, I could not fail to remember once seeing a play called &ldquo;Rip van Winkle.&rdquo;  It was described as the adventures of a person who fell asleep and remained asleep for a great number of years and one day woke up suddenly and went out and saw great changes in the streets, all of which amazed him.  I have been thinking since that if, instead of waking up at that period the character remained asleep until the present day, and heard telephone bells and loud-speakers and radios and all the rest of the things we are now familiar with, what would he think of the free trade doctrines that were prevalent when he fell asleep and remained prevalent for a good deal of the time he was asleep?  Therefore, though we must all be grateful and very much appreciate the courtesy and spirit in which the remarks of the Senator were addressed to the House, I regret that, having made that comment, I cannot agree with most of his other conclusions.  I come to my friend Senator Baxter, who addressed the House on this subject with great skill, as he always does.  I endeavoured to follow him as well as I could&mdash;I hope I have followed him correctly&mdash;because I would not like to do him an injustice in any criticism I make upon his remarks. He has always stood forth, and very properly, as the advocate of the claims and of the wrongs and injuries of a class.  He seems to think that he alone is privileged to speak <Col N="1496" /> for that class and that nobody in the House is interested in the welfare of that class except himself.  He may be erroneous in coming to that conclusion. There may be on this side of the House people who are just as interested in the welfare of that class as Senator Baxter or any other person on the other side of the House.</P>
    <P>I have been endeavouring to follow the ideas of Senator Baxter, and in the first place, I would wish to point out for his correction that this is not a Bill to limit production&mdash;it is a Bill to control the quota of distribution, an entirely distinct and different thing, and when the Senator says that it is due to those in the agricultural industry, if the Minister wants to get this measure through the House, that they should get an assurance from him as to the amount of agricultural produce that would be required for the supply and the filling up of quotas of exports that that is a draught upon the prophetic powers of any Minister.</P>
    <P>I think it is without precedent. Having said that that ought to be done by the Minister, he stops and leaves it at that.  I was wondering whether he would indicate what penalty or punishment should be imposed on the Minister who professed to be able to prophesy that there would be a dearth or a plenitude of agricultural produce and who called upon people in the industry to regulate their operations for 12 months by his prophecies. There are tipsters of all kinds who advertise their wares in various papers, I am told, but that is a form of tipping never required, as far as I know, from any Minister.  However, it has the novelty of my friend's suggestion and I hope the Minister will consider it and deal with it in his reply.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter which the Senator forgot and it is this.  It is an elementary truism in economy that price is regulated by demand and supply, assuming that things are normal.  Of course, it is possible that price would not be regulated by demand and supply if anything went wrong with the people who were in control of purchasing, but I think <Col N="1497" /> this is out of the question in this country.  It is impossible that such circumstances should exist in this country but I will adopt the principle as being, I believe, that price is regulated by demand and supply. Now, if it is regulated by demand and supply, what I would like to know is this: how is it prejudicial to the interests of the section of the community on whose behalf Senator Baxter speaks, that the demand for agricultural produce should be increased, duplicated or triplicated perhaps, by the efforts of a Minister in seeking agreements with other countries?  I would illustrate my point.  How does it strike anybody as being prejudicial to the production of beef, say, if the Minister were able to make arrangements by which products could be exported to countries who had bound themselves to take 600 or 700 cattle a week out of this country? Is that prejudicial?  My friend the Senator, who addressed the House with such clearness, did not explain how that was prejudicial, but he seemed to think that this method of quotas was mysterious, and, that having said that there was something mysterious about it, you could leave it at that.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise this on behalf of those whom my friend the Senator represents, that there is nothing more in the interests of the farmers than the establishment of those quotas with foreign countries that the Minister is trying to secure. In other words, there could not be anything more in the interests of the farmers than to prevent foreign countries clearing out thousands or millions of money year after year and buying nothing from us.  But if, on the other hand, the Minister for Agriculture makes a tour of people who are dealing with this country and says to them: if you want to sell £1,000 worth or £10,000 worth of your raw materials in this country, you must buy something of a value corresponding to what you send in.  I say that it is more in the interests of the farmers and the agricultural community than sitting down and doing <Col N="1498" /> nothing, which was the policy adopted in this country from 1922 to 1932, and when the Minister, who is a person who knows something about agriculture, takes up this subject and deals with it in a practical and reasonable way that would commend itself to anybody outside politics, all he gets is the captious criticism of people who say that the proposals of the Minister should be scanned with the closest scrutiny.  Nobody can complain with what Senator Blythe has said, though one might be disposed to ask after his expression of apprehension as to the consequence of issuing licences, what Senator Blythe fears?  His suggestions are, however, worthy of consideration and I am sure will receive it, though in the matter of dealing with these licences, it will be done with the greatest care and, if necessary, the opinion of a committee of producers interested in the particular article should be considered when issuing licences to purchasers of those particular articles.  That is a matter which, I merely venture to suggest, is worthy of the earnest consideration of the Minister, and I am sure it will receive that consideration.  There is one other matter I would like to say a word on.  I have heard it in this debate and in some other debates. Some people seem to be obsessed with it because they bring it into every debate, like the man in the novel who brought the head of Charles I into everything he was writing.  There are some people who think, apparently, that they would experience great difficulty in changing the method of farming from the practice or method they have carried on to a different practice, owing to the apprehension that if they employed labour the labourers would refuse to work or pretend to work or both.  The only answer or comment I will make on that is: if they have that apprehension as to the fact that labourers will refuse or having promised to work, will not work, I will say these words to them: &ldquo;try them; give them a chance.&rdquo;  They are entitled to live as well as people in better circumstances.</P>

      <P>I have been considering for some time the course which this debate has taken and I have got the original measure.  Certainly, this would be very appropriate on the original measure, but seeing that the Bill before the House aims only to clarify a definition in the original measure, and to transfer the functions of the Minister for Agriculture to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the debate has wandered somewhat.  However, I did not stop Senator Lynch because I did not stop Senator Baxter.  I was very much interested also in Senator Jameson's speech, which was on the general principles of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, may I say that I took it that I was quite within my rights and also in order in referring to the matter to which I did refer, namely, the question of agricultural products in connection with which the Minister is taking power in this amending measure?  I did not introduce any matter other than that. That was the point I made, and Senator Lynch had either misunderstood it or he is trying to misrepresent me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Leas-Chathaoirleach Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another matter.  The Senator is quite right in regard to a portion of what he has said. What happened in regard to this measure is this: there was in the original Act of 1933 a definition of agricultural product, and Senator Jameson said nothing until I pointed out to him that agricultural product might include whiskey and stout.  Then he got this amendment put in: &ldquo;but does not include intoxicating liquor.&rdquo; It was found in the working of the Act that that definition was not sufficiently comprehensive.  The Minister has now come to the House to ask it to extend the definition so that agricultural product might include cattle, cream, milk or things of that kind. <Col N="1500" /> However, the debate has proceeded over a rather wide field, and I do not want to stop Senator Lynch at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickLynchKC" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I was nearly finished. All this has been scarcely worth the time and energy expended by the learned Senator in asking for a ruling as to whether what I was saying was relevant or irrelevant.  I was very much affected by the observations made by some Senators who spoke on this yesterday about the grave apprehensions felt as to difficulty that will be experienced in bringing about the change that will be necessary to give effect to what the Minister proposes in order to fill a particular quota.  To do that it will be necessary for people to change their present methods of farming. Some members seem to have very grave apprehensions about that.  These are matters that have been discussed a good deal here, and I am not going to throw the apple of discord amongst my friends.  But I do say that when an amendment comes before the House from a Minister which, on the face of it, appears to be reasonable and moderate, and that when, in discussing it, my friends roamed into all sorts of fields and discussed various topics I, unfortunately, was induced to follow them.  I apologise to the House for having done so, but I offer by way of explanation that I was misled by the so-called arguments to which the House was treated by some of my friends last evening and to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>Under ordinary conditions nobody is in favour of having any more restrictions on trade than are absolutely necessary, but at the present time, both here and in the country which is our principal surplus market, things are not normal.  They are abnormal.  I think that also holds true of the potential market which the Minister is now trying to develop, and for that reason this measure is justified. However, I would like the Minister to consider if he would not agree to put a time limit to this measure, say of five years.  If at the end of that time, a greater degree of normality had not come about, then the measure could be re-enacted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be appropriate to do that in connection with the Principal Act.  Is the Senator suggesting that there should be a time limit to the Principal Act or merely to this measure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>If it were necessary at the end of the five year period this measure could be re-enacted or, possibly, you could have a co-ordinating measure of the Principal Act and of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine there will be many measures of this kind before the end of five years so that if the Senator's suggestion is adopted the co-ordinating legislation will be of considerable magnitude. I think that the argument of Senator Jameson was directed against the whole principle of regulating exports.</P>
      <P>That might be sound as an argument in a world where freedom of traffic prevails, but in present circumstances, unless it is to be decided that there should be no agreements made with other countries regarding trade, some such measure as this is, I think, imposed on the Ministry.  The facts and the circumstances prevailing make it inevitable that some such legislation as this shall be enacted, but I am in general agreement with Senator Blythe in his desire that the system of licensing and of giving permissions to certain people, and of prohibitions to other people, in respect to these trading operations should be limited as much as possible, and whatever is done by way of prohibition and licence should be made as public as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that in the amending clause &mdash;Section 2 of the Bill&mdash;it speaks of specific articles of any specific description, of giving the Minister power regarding specific persons and specific articles and of prohibitions and permissions which are a considerable extension of the powers in the original Act.  That is probably necessary in virtue of the new purpose which this Bill is intended to serve, but it emphasises the need for publicity and of making clear to the public, not merely the rival firms concerned, but <Col N="1502" /> generally, what is being done by the Ministry under the powers that are given.</P>
    <P>I want to touch on a matter that will probably arise on another Bill: the fact that the Orders that are to be made under this Bill and under the existing Acts are to be made by the Executive Council or, in this case, by the Minister.  They are required to be laid on the Table and, during the next subsequent 21 sitting days the Oireachtas has power to annul any Order made.  I think it is very desirable in this group of enactments that the powers given in the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act should be inserted: that is to say, that the Orders shall not merely become operative and remain operative unless the Oireachtas annuls them, but that it shall be obligatory on the Ministry to seek specific sanction within a certain time.  The system of legislation by Order is, of course, being extended very widely, and while a good deal of it is necessary I think that the other side of the picture is that when an Order is made it should not be allowed to remain operative simply because nobody takes action to annul it.  I think that an Order which has the effect of legislation should be brought for specific sanction before each House of the Oireachtas, and I think that if that procedure were adopted in regard to this class of legislation&mdash; legislation by decree&mdash;it would be somewhat of a safeguard.  At least, it would be an assurance that all the facts could be examined by the legislature and not simply left in the archives on the chance that nobody will notice them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>In the present good-humoured atmosphere of the Seanad I may, perhaps, be excused for saying that the wind has been, more or less, taken out of my sails by the speech of Senator Johnson.  I listened with considerable interest to the speeches made on this Bill.  I derived considerable pleasure from, so to speak, my ramble from field to field with the various speakers.  Senator Blythe opened his speech by saying that he <Col N="1503" /> agreed with Senator Jameson.  I was anxious to discover on what points they were in agreement, but having listened carefully to his speech I failed to see that there was very much agreement between the two Senators.  The impression that I have gained from listening to the various speeches is this, that there is very little genuine opposition to the Bill. I believe that Senator Blythe's difficulties might be solved by a change of Government in this country, but I am afraid that Senator Jameson's difficulties would only be solved by a change of Government, not only in this country, but in several other countries.</P>
      <P>It must be obvious that the present measure is necessary partly because of the policy of our own Government and largely because of the policies adopted by the Governments of a number of other countries with which we are trading at the present time.  I believe that it is a ridiculous thing for anybody in this House or outside of it to try and obstruct the activities of our Minister for Agriculture with regard to this or similar measures.  Senator Jameson has expressed himself as being a confirmed free trader.  Even though that is so, and even though he believes that that would be the best policy for the country, as I am sure he does, he should at least take into consideration that we are dealing with countries the people of which have decided on a policy of protection for themselves. Therefore, it will be necessary for our Minister for Agriculture to have the powers which he is seeking under this Bill until such time as, not only we, but the people of those countries change their policy.  I believe this Bill is designed to benefit producers, and I believe that those who are interested in farmers, and in producers generally, should wholeheartedly support it.</P>

      <P>Senator Quirke stated that no one should harass the Minister in his efforts on behalf of the agricultural industry, and particularly in this Bill.  Nobody has tried to do so. No one wants unduly to prevent the Minister carrying his policy into operation. <Col N="1504" /> If the Minister seeks these powers, and wants the Seanad to bring it about that there shall be an amendment in the form of an extension of the Agricultural Products (Regulation of Export) Act of 1933, I think the House is going to give those powers.  It was quite unnecessary to make some of the comments that were made.  For instance, there was one comment made by Senator Lynch which would not add very much to the friendly understanding which we seem to have brought about.  Senator Lynch had high words of praise for the present Minister's efforts on behalf of the agricultural industry.  He stated that the present Government were entirely different from their predecessors, who had sat down from 1922 to 1932 and did nothing.  I could not possibly allow that comment to pass without making a few remarks.</P>

      <P>I do not differ with Senator Lynch when he says that the Minister for Agriculture is making great efforts on behalf of agriculture, He is.  The Minister is doing his best for the agricultural industry in the position in which he finds himself.  It is because of the position in which he finds himself that we are going to allow this Bill, in so far as we can act in the matter, to go through.  I used the words &ldquo;in the position in which he <Col N="1505" /> finds himself.&rdquo;  The position in which he finds the agricultural industry is largely of the Government's making, and I have to say a few words on that by way of comparison.  The present Government has brought about a condition of things where certain measures of this kind have to be enacted, and in the position in which the Minister finds himself he is doing his best.  The Minister's predecessor in office found a free and an open market in a friendly country.  Friendly relations were maintained, and the entire of our surplus products found a ready and open market in that country.  What did the Minister do?</P>

      <P>Do not think I am making an exception of you, Senator.  The Minister is asking for additional powers to prohibit the export of a specific description of exports. He is also asking power to prevent the export of such products from Saorstát Eireann by any person other than the Minister or such persons as he may from time to time authorise.  He is asking for an extension of the definition to carry out the original intentions of the Bill.  The Minister is the only person who has really spoken to the measure up to the present.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to make any remarks on this Bill but, seeing that certain statements were made by Senator Lynch, that the Minister and the Government are doing their best for agriculture, I cannot agree with <Col N="1506" /> them.  When we consider the inter-trading position and the loss on imports and exports since the Government came into office, I certainly do not agree with such remarks.  No farmers would agree with them.  If we take the position of those who live by farming, those who run may read. Having regard to the present condition of farmers and labourers, I do not agree that the best is being done for the agricultural industry.  I am not going to deal with the economic war now, but I will refer to what was described as the great policy of high protection.  It was dealt with by some Senators, especially by Senator Lynch. As far as agriculture is concerned, I say that high protection has been the ruin of farming since it was instituted here.  As farmers, we know that from experience.  I challenge any Senator with any knowledge of farming to contradict the truth of that statement. In any country that has had experience of high protection, America and Australia, for instance, the farmers are the poorest of the poor and are in a struggling position.  I do not agree that the powers asked for in this Bill should be given to the Minister.  There should be no quotas or licences for farming products.  Senator Lynch stated that farming products had not diminished by the changed conditions. It looks as if the Senator was a Rip van Winkle in that matter.  What has been done with regard to cattle?  Has not the cattle population diminished and have not calves been slaughtered after birth?  Does not that mean a diminution of production?  Another Bill is to come before the House to reduce the production of pigs.  Notwithstanding our resources, climate, and the soil, our production, when compared with any similar-sized country, is the smallest, while we have the best market in the world at our doors. These advantages are being destroyed. I suggest that our great cattle trade and other farming products, owing to quotas and other restrictions, is coming to an end.  There is no use in saying that butter and bacon and other things are desirable products.  We must have livestock.  Can we have butter without cows?  We must also <Col N="1507" /> have calves.  Every farmer depends on live stock more than on any product so that he may be able to pay his way at the end of the year.  This Bill, in imposing quotas, is differentiating between one class of agricultural product and another.  It is differentiating in favour of butter against cattle, and in favour of bacon against something else.  Above all, it is differentiating agricultural products against other products, perhaps whiskey, stout, and other commodities.  Have the exports of the other commodities diminished? It is only farming products that have diminished.  When Senator Lynch said that agricultural labourers were being unfairly treated by farmers I will not say that the statement is a lie, but it is beside the truth.</P>

Whatever may be said against farmers they never forget the interests of their labourers.  If they can they pay them to the full extent of their capacity to do so.  I say that this class of Bill is objectionable because it ties up farmers above any other class. When I say that I do not forget the interests of the State as a whole.  I have never done so.  I say that the liberties of producers of cattle and beet are being tied up because they have to get contracts and licences to carry on their business.</P>

      <P>The last speaker said that the Minister hopes to increase the output of pigs as a result of this but if this goes through he will have to increase the pig-headed population of the country.  Now, I think that the wrong trend was given to this discussion by Senator Lynch.  We are not seeking to consider the issue of free trade or protection which had been raised by Senator Jameson.  I think that there was an entire lack of appreciation of the point Senator Jameson <Col N="1508" /> raised.  It was not a question of free trade or protection, but whether there was to be liberty of the individual to trade at all or not.  I think, Sir, that it is not relevant to this Bill to consider it merely as free trade and protection. This Bill is to amend the original Bill in certain details and to consider the implication of the policy underlying that and the original Bill is desirable.  If the issue were simply free trade or protection I would know where I stand, but there is no use ignoring the tendency of State policy which is to regulate production and to create undesirable monopolies.  There is a tendency to set up monopolies, to limit production, to have State control, State direction and State ownership of the sources of production.  I say that that is all implied in this Bill and in the Bill which it amends.  I believe, Sir, that the function of Government in regard to production, in regard to commerce and in regard to trade, should be not to interfere in regulating activities of any individual except in so far as they should see that the activities of those individuals are carried on along human and rational lines.  The function of the State's authority should be to remove from the path of the individual obstacles that stand in the way of efficient production and liberty in so far as it can, to leave the individual free to operate these sources and that they should not be limited by the State telling them to stand aside and tell them how much they are to produce.  But I think it cannot be overlooked and I think that Senator Jameson raised very serious matters when he drew attention to the undesirable tendency to have State ownership and State production.  That tendency is growing very definitely. There is a tendency to have legislation by order instead of legislation by statute, a tendency to give over to the control of the State Departments functions for the welfare of enterprise and making them dependent upon what may be the caprice of individual Ministers or civil servants.  I think that is an undesirable tendency and I am not prepared to admit that it is an inevitable tendency and one that we must regard as inevitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1509" /> Senator Lynch took exception to something Senator Baxter said when he asked the Minister to indicate in some way how the individual producer was going to regulate his production, what is the scope of his production, what is the amount he would be expected to produce.  Senator Lynch seemed to think that Senator Baxter asked for something wrong, or was pursuing a wrong line of thought when he asked the Minister to say how the individual producers would know what they are to produce.  I say it is essential that the producers must know what they are to produce, and that is what this legislation is leading up to, and when the Minister, or his Department, takes the control of production export and import, they must be able to tell individuals their ration, the amount they are expected to produce, and if there is any miscalculation in the forecast of the Department or of the Minister, it should be open to the producers who have relied upon the Minister's forecast and information for their quotas, to have an action against them to compensate them for their losses. That is the tendency of this legislation, and we must not close our eyes to it. If this kind of legislation is to continue the Minister and his Department must be in a position to give forecasts to the producers, and Senator Baxter's question is one that should be answered and not overlooked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very big issues have been raised in this particular debate which I did certainly not anticipate.  I think that Senator Lynch said that this Bill would limit production.  It does not limit production, but a number of Senators have spoken here as if this Bill would limit production.  It has nothing at all to do with production. It should be looked at in the other way.  It has been said that this Government is bringing in a Bill to limit production, whereas, in fact, it has been necessary to introduce it by the legislation of the United Kingdom Government and we would not be able to export at all if we did not pass it. This Bill has absolutely nothing to do with production.  Whether the Senators who said that it would limit production <Col N="1510" /> really meant that, or knew that it did not limit production but merely wanted to raise a point, I do not know.  But I state that it is the action of the United Kingdom Government in fixing the quotas which has caused us to introduce this legislation.  The similar quotas of the United Kingdom Government apply to potatoes, tinned milk, eggs and cattle.  In regard to cattle, the quota order applies in another way, which I shall deal with separately.  But if we did not bring in this Bill we could not at the present moment export any bacon, tinned milk, potatoes or eggs to Great Britain.  Now, again, some Senators made the point that it was due to Government action that we brought in this legislation.  That is not so.  As I have already said, it is due to the action of the United Kingdom Government and there is no foundation for the point that the Senators have been making.  When the Minister for Industry and Commerce brings along quota orders here limiting imports, then, of course, that is due to this Government's policy, but it is not the Government's policy to curtail exports to any country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Baxter asked a question which would involve me in a very long answer and would take more time for a full reply than the Seanad would be prepared to give, and I probably would not be allowed by the Chairman to go into it, as it is outside the scope of the Bill.  Senator Baxter asked me what is the Government's policy with regard to production.  Well, the answer to that is this: that there is no limit on our exports in so far as we can find a market for them whether at home or abroad, and we have done everything we possibly can to get markets, and as far as these markets go, we will encourage production, but I will agree that any Minister who would encourage production of things for which there is no market would be putting producers in a very invidious position, producing for a saturated market.  At the present time, I will say that there is no great prospect of finding a larger market for any of these commodities.  Now, regarding the allegation that we are restricting pro duction of commodities, let me say that <Col N="1511" /> we are producing more eggs than before this Government came into power.  In the case of dairy produce, we are producing more.  We are producing a calculated increase of 10 per cent. of eggs this year.  At the same time as we have increased our production, we have expanded considerably in tillage, so that there is no reason for saying that our production is lowered.  Senator Dillon said that we have brought a Bill in the Dáil to limit the production of pigs, but he should read the Bill.  We brought in a Bill of 153 sections and that is exactly what it was not intended to do.  That is the sort of criticism we have to meet here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will leave that point until the Bill comes before this House. Now, I want to say a word about cattle. There are more cattle in the country as a result of the restriction of exports. If you take the years 1931 or 1930 or what better suits my purpose, the year 1931, you will find that there are more cattle this year than there were in those years, both fat cattle and store cattle.  There is no foundation for the argument that we cannot use our surplus crops because live stock has gone down.  Senator Jameson began his speech by saying that this Bill is due to Government policy.  I think it will be clear to the Senator that that is not so, but I suppose that I shall have to repeat the same refutation again here, because like every other House of this kind, Senators have the habit habit of using the same arguments over and over again whether the truth is pointed out to them or not.  Senator Jameson says that the producer cannot sell or produce under the Bill.  Of course, that is an outlandish statement. Senator Jameson said he has always been a free trader.  He forgets that the world is not free trade now.  His <Col N="1512" /> arguments would be quite good if there was a single country in the world free trade at present.  But no country will take any goods from us now unless there is some agreement about quotas and tariffs.  We must, naturally, make regulations to meet those conditions.  I might be a free trader myself if every other country was free trade and if we were allowed to be free trade here.  But we are not allowed to be free trade and we must accept the position as it is.  I do not think we should lose time arguing whether we are free trade or protectionist because, whatever we might like to be, we must meet conditions laid down by other Governments before they will allow our goods in. That applies not only to Great Britain but to other countries.  Germany will not take goods from us unless their export is regulated by the Government here.  The same remark applies to Spain.  If agreements were made with other countries, they would lay down similar conditions.  I think that the United States is the only country which has not got a strict quota system.  They have there what is called an open market, but it is an open market with extremely high tariffs.  There is no limit to the amount of goods we could put in there&mdash;butter and bacon, for instance&mdash; if it paid us to send them in but the tariff is extremely high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of licences was raised by Senator Jameson and Senator Blythe.  So far as my Department is concerned, the position is that we have to issue licences under these quotas and, in addition, issue licences under the cattle quota.  The cattle quota is not administered under the principal Regulation of Export Act.  In the case of the cattle quota, the licences come direct from the Board of Trade in London and are merely distributed by us.  In the other cases&mdash;bacon, tinned cream, tinned milk, potatoes and so forth&mdash; the licences originate here and are issued by us.  We may have to do the same with regard to eggs in the near future.  In the case of bacon, we are told, for example, that we are to send 40,000 cwts. in the month of April. <Col N="1513" /> We issue licences to the various curers to send out that quantity of bacon. The case of bacon may be considered, particularly, because it is on the same basis that anything done under this Bill will be done.  We took, for the purpose of allocation, the year previous to the Act coming into force &mdash;from about the middle of 1932 to the middle of 1933.  On the basis of the exports during that year, licences were issued to the various factories which are exporters.  A consultative council, representative of those factories, was set up.  That council was consulted with regard to the list.  The list was laid before the council showing the allocation we proposed&mdash;the percentage to each factory out of each month's quota.  There were certain objections. A certain factory stated that for one reason or another they had not been as much in the business that year as they would ordinarily have been.  In some cases, the other factories agreed that this factory's allocation should be a little higher than that which we had allowed.  Eventually, we got as near agreement as possible.</P>
    <P>That arrangement held up to the end of 1934.  In 1934 we had some difficulty in filling the quota during three or four months.  It was a losing proposition for the factory to fill the quota during three or four months.  Some factories did it; others did not.  In order to induce them to fill the quota, we stated that the year 1934 would be taken as the basis of further allocations. Some of the factories, taking that into consideration, faced the loss and filled the quotas.  Since then, from the 1st January, 1934, to the 1st January, 1935, has been the basis.  The list is open to the members of the consultative council at all times.  Each factory knows it must get a certain percentage of the quota each month. The same would apply in the case of potatoes, tinned cream and tinned milk.  There is only one exporter of tinned cream and milk.  In the case of eggs, similar steps would be taken.  A basis would be taken in respect of the previous year, a consultative council would be set up and the consultative council would consider complaints from <Col N="1514" /> individual exporters.  If there is a case of hardship, the consultative council recommends that some leniency should be shown, and eventually we get down to a basis which we stick to unless a factory goes out of business. We have got to the stage in respect of the bacon quota in which we never get a complaint.  The factories know that they are entitled to a certain percentage. They know what they get and there is no complaint.  That has been the case for six months or so.</P>
    <P>In the case of cattle, there is a different position.  In that case, we get the licences from the Board of Trade. We had to take some basis of allocation. We decided that, from the 1st January, 1934, we would give out the licences on the basis of the shipments of each exporter for 1933&mdash;each month against the corresponding month of 1933.  That appeared to us to be the fair way of dealing with the matter. It was the obvious method&mdash;that we should hand the licences to the people who had been in the habit of exporting. There were grave complaints about exporters not giving the price they should give and, during the year, we had to depart from that system with regard to fat cattle.  We gave the fat cattle licences entirely to feeders and producers.  We continued to give the store cattle licences to the exporters. There, again, we had a consultative council and we had various meetings representative of the trade during the early months to see if we could get a basis.  The great majority of the licences were distributed on the basis of exports during 1933, but even the consultative council urged that a case could be made for two other classes.  One class was the exporter whose exports were low in 1933 for reasons over which he had no control&mdash; for instance, illness or, as happened in some cases, the trader dying and his sons not getting properly into the business until two or three months afterwards.  In those cases, exporters got somewhat more than the quota to which they were entitled.  The second class for whom a case was made for exceptional treatment were buyers in remote districts&mdash;not for the sake of the buyer but for the sake of the <Col N="1515" /> remote districts.  That applied to the whole, practically, of Connacht, to Donegal, Clare, Kerry and West Cork. Exporters from these areas got more licences than they were entitled to, so as to help those areas as far as possible.  We had, however, a residue which had to be got rid of.  We had, say, 3,000 exporters.  When you divide 3,000 into 15,000 or 17,000, there are always from 50 to 200 licences over which must be distributed somehow. These were, if Senators like to put it that way, at the discretion of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I should like to explain how exactly these remaining licences are dealt with. I get letters from people who think they have very great grievances&mdash; producers throughout the country. Deputies and Senators get letters of complaint and they write to me.  All these letters are examined so far as possible, although it is a very big job. From 2,000 to 3,000 letters are dealt with each fortnight by a junior officer. The work has to be done by a junior officer because a higher officer could not be spared.  The junior officer goes through these letters and picks out what he believes to be about 200 of the most deserving cases.  Eventually, they come up to the higher officer and he sends the list along to me for my sanction.  I admit that, if I get a letter from a person I know or from a Deputy recommending a person, these letters go down to the junior officer and junior officers, I admit, are inclined to please the Minister.  In that way, perhaps, the letters that pass through me get more consideration than others but not always.  Time and again, I get letters from the country asking why it is that such a prominent opponent of the Government should get licences while the writer of the letter, who is a supporter of the Government, cannot get a licence.  I find, on investigation, that the name has been put on this list quite rightly by this official because he considered it was a genuine case.  That is how matters are dealt with.  I do not know any other way by which that residue of licences could be disposed of.  There is a list of about 3,000 cattle licensees.  It is a huge volume with <Col N="1516" /> names, addresses, numbers, and reasons why they got the licences, with the figures which qualified them for getting them.  That list was open to members of the consultative council but they got tired examining it.  They came along very enthusiastically during the first few months but they got very tired of the job and did not trouble to examine it any more.</P>
    <P>I should be very glad if the distribution of cattle licences could be carried out otherwise than by my Department. I do not think that there is any great danger of&mdash;to put it bluntly&mdash;corruption. Senator Blythe said he had great faith in members of the Civil Service and I think what he wanted to convey was that he did not desire to put great temptations in their way.  It would be unfair, of course, to put great temptations in the way of some of these officers who are on rather low salaries but Senator Blythe knows that it is very hard for an individual officer in any Department to carry off anything on his own account.  These lists pass through four or five other officers before they reach the top, so that nothing improper could be done except the person concerned was in collusion with the others.  The list may not always come by the same route either, so that there would be extreme difficulty in carrying through anything improper.  If an officer were inclined to be corrupt&mdash;very few of them would be so inclined&mdash;it would be extremely difficult to issue a licence to which he was not entitled to an exporter or producer in return for a bribe.  I think that it would be practically impossible for him to do that even if he were so inclined.  I agree with what Senator Blythe has said that, if possible, we should get out of this system.  In the bacon system, we have reached a stage at which anybody in the trade is entitled to see the percentage a person is getting.  Some bacon factories do not want other bacon factories to know exactly what quota they are getting but they know one another's percentages.  If we have 40,000 cwts. for distribution and if a man gets his own percentage, he knows he is not being wronged.  If we <Col N="1517" /> could reach in respect of other exports the same stage that we have reached in the bacon trade, I think the system would be absolutely fair, and nobody could have any complaint against it.  It would be difficult to have a system like that in respect of cattle because there is so much change in the number of licences.  The number of licences varies very much every month.  There is also this position&mdash;that there are many exporters who did business in the spring and autumn and did not do any business in the summer, so that some months you would have men on the list who would not be on it at all for other months.  It would not be a case of having an exact percentage the whole year round, as in the bacon trade.</P>
    <P>Senator Dowdall suggested that there might be a time limit.  The Cathaoirleach said that that provision would have to be made in the Principal Act.  I think that that is so.  I do not think that there is any necessity for a time limit in the case of any of these Bills dealing with economic matters because it is now almost impossible to frame a Bill dealing with economic affairs that will hold for five years.  We are practically certain to be here again with this Bill for amendment within the next five years.  When Senator Dowdall made a point I was jotting down that particular Act on which my Department is working has been amended since I came into this position.  The Horse Breeding Act was amended here some time ago&mdash;and the Creameries and Dairy Produce Act has also been amended, as well as the Diseases of Animals Act.  These Acts were passed by my predecessor and the Fresh Meat Act which was also passed, during his term of office, will need amendment in the near future.  Even Acts brought in by me, the Cereals Act and the Dairy Produce (Prices Stabilisation) Act had to be amended twice in each case since they were brought in. The last Act, the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Act, will, I am fairly certain, have to be along here shortly for some small amendment.  If each one of these Acts has to be amended sooner or later, a term of five years for this one is hardly necessary.  In regard to <Col N="1518" /> Deputy Johnson's point, about having orders confirmed by these Houses, I am afraid I would have to be here very often.  There is an Order to be made in respect of each period, setting out the amount of each article for each country.  A period is usually a month, sometimes it is fortnightly or quarterly. Bacon is a monthly period, cattle a fortnightly period.  For practically every article and every country, we would have to take up a considerable time of the Seanad, particularly if Senators continue to be as interested in agriculture as they have been up to this.  They do take the opportunity of talking about agriculture in general when I come here.  If I had to come here 14 times each month it would be very hard to find time.  I don't agree with Senator Milroy that there is a tendency to regulate production&mdash;I would agree there is a necessity to regulate production under present conditions&mdash;but I do not think there is any great tendency.  There is no Government Department inclined to do more than they have to do in that direction and I don't know if any Minister is inclined or induced by his Department to take any further step in that direction.</P>
    <P>We do find necessity in certain directions more as a result of world conditions than of any condition that might be in this country as such.  I do not know if Senator Milroy has established his contention that we are creating undesirable monopolies.  I did take power under the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Act to establish certain monopolies, but they were in businesses which nobody would take up.  For instance, in the making of meat meal, no ordinary person who wanted to make money would go into that business. He could not possibly take it up unless the Government gave him guarantees of the price at which he would get the cattle and the protection which it would secure him in the market.  He would want to get these guarantees and several other things before he would go into the business, and if the Government was going to give these guarantees they would want the power to give the monopoly.  The same would <Col N="1519" /> apply to the canning of meat and the production of meat extract.  It is not an economic proposition on its own, and no ordinary capital could be got, as matters stand, unless the Government would come forward with a guarantee with regard to the price of cattle and impose a quota or tariff on competing articles.  No firm could go into it, and a Government would not be in a position to give guarantees unless they also gave a monopoly.  No genuine trader would go into these businesses under any circumstances, and no genuine trader would object under these circumstances.  I have tried to deal with all the points raised and to answer all the questions, and I hope I have satisfied Senators.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
    <P>(1)  The Minister may, if and whenever he thinks proper, do by order <Col N="1520" /> (in this Act referred to as an aliens order) all or any of the following things in respect either of all aliens or of aliens of a particular nationality or otherwise of a particular class, or of particular aliens, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  prohibit the aliens to whom the order relates from landing in or entering into Saorstát Eireann;</P>
    <P>(b)  impose on such aliens restrictions and conditions in respect of landing in or entering into Saorstát Eireann, including limiting such landing or entering to particular places or prohibiting such landing or entering at particular places:</P>
    <P>(c)  prohibit such aliens from leaving Saorstát Eireann and for that purpose prohibit such aliens from embarking on ships or aircraft in Saorstát Eireann;</P>
    <P>(d)  impose on such aliens restrictions and conditions in respect of leaving Saorstát Eireann including limiting such leaving to particular places or particular means of travelling or prohibiting such leaving from particular places or by particular means of travelling;</P>

    <P>(2)  An aliens order may contain provisions for all or any of the following purposes, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  imposing such obligations and restrictions on the masters of ships entering or leaving Saorstát Eireann, the pilots or other persons <Col N="1521" /> in charge of aircraft entering or leaving Saorstát Eireann, railway companies whose railway lines cross the land frontier of Saorstát Eireann, and the drivers or other persons in charge of road vehicles entering or leaving Saorstát Eireann as may, in the opinion of the Minister, be necessary for giving full effect to or securing compliance with such order;</P>
    <P>(b)  conferring on the Minister and on officers of the Minister, officers of customs and excise and the military and police forces of the State all such powers (including powers of arrest and detention) as are, in the opinion of the Minister, necessary for giving full effect to or enforcing compliance with such order;</P>
    <P>(c)  determining the nationality to be ascribed to aliens whose nationality is unknown or uncertain;</P>
    <P>(d)  in the case of an aliens order which provides for the exclusion or the deportation and exclusion of aliens, continuing the operation of such order and every order made thereunder notwithstanding any change in the nationality of the aliens or the alien to which such order or the order made thereunder relates;</P>

    <P>(3)  If in any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, any question arises under or in relation to an aliens order or an order made under an aliens order whether any person is or is not an alien, or is or is not an alien of a particular nationality or otherwise of a particular class, or is or is not a particular alien specified in such order, the onus of proving <Col N="1522" /> (as the case may require) that such person is not an alien, or is not an alien of a particular nationality or of a particular class, or is not such particular alien, shall lie on such person</P>
    <P>(4)  An aliens order shall not apply to any of the following persons, that is to say:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (1).  To add at the end of the sub-section the words &ldquo;The words &lsquo;a particular class&rsquo; in this <Col N="1523" /> section shall not be construed as enabling the Minister to make an aliens order describing as a class those aliens who hold particular religious beliefs or political opinions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is one of a series of amendments which aim at limiting the powers of the Minister to act by order, and while I would have preferred that a discussion on this particular item should be deferred, it seems to fit in at this part of the section and must be discussed first.  The powers given under the Bill to the Minister are that he may act by order in respect either of all aliens or of aliens of a particular nationality or of a particular class, or particular aliens, and it causes certain anxiety to understand what is meant by aliens of &ldquo;a particular class.&rdquo;  It is in such a form that in the discretion of the Minister any collection of persons might be called a class, no matter what the general characteristics of the group were, and it is quite conceivable that under waves of popular feeling antipathies against persons because of religious beliefs or political opinions might arise, and the Minister might make an order directed against these persons because of that character, belief or opinion, and I want to guard against that.  If we are going to give the Minister these extraordinary powers, we must at least confine him as closely as possible to what the Oireachtas desires.  I can understand at certain times the necessity for making a general order to apply to all aliens or to aliens of a particular nationality and I can understand in certain circumstances, particular classes being defined and having orders made against them, but I want to understand what is meant by &ldquo;particular class&rdquo; and I want to guard against the possibility that there should be orders made to apply to any group of persons because of religious beliefs or political opinions.  I do not know if it is necessary to enlarge upon the desirability of having such a restriction, but I want the House to bear in mind, when considering the amendment, that the power given in respect of persons of a particular class, the &ldquo;particular <Col N="1524" /> class&rdquo; not being defined, means that it would be at the discretion of the Minister to prohibit them from entering the country, to ensure that if they did enter it they should enter it by a particular entrance, to prohibit their movements and generally to restrict their activities.  It seems to me that that ought not to be done at the discretion of the Minister, and, I think, should not be done at all, unless a specific and particular case was made. I cannot conceive of this House or this country desiring to impose particular legislation or restrictive orders against people of religious beliefs unless, at least, a kind of feeling developing in certain countries were to take hold in an unaccountable way of the minds and emotions of people of this country.  We are specifically giving powers to deal with persons of a particular class without defining what is meant by &ldquo;a particular class,&rdquo; and I would like to guard against the possibility that people, because of religious belief or political opinion, should be grouped together and legislated against merely by the Minister's order.  That is the purpose of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (The President) Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The President)</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, there is no doubt that the word &ldquo;class&rdquo; is one of very wide connotation, but it would be extremely difficult, I think, to get any other word that could be substituted for it in this connection.  It means that the Minister, instead of dealing with individuals, can group a number of individuals and regard them as a class, this class being distinguished by some common characteristic.  The Senator wishes to prohibit the Minister from specifying as a class people of a particular religious belief or people who hold special political views.  I do not know that there is any reason why the hands of the Minister should be bound in that particular way.  This is a general Act, and if an occasion should arise in which it were necessary to take action, then I think the Minister should be at liberty to do so.  But Senators will realise that, any order in that direction would have to be laid on the Table of both Houses.  If there is any objection to it, as there would be <Col N="1525" /> obviously if it were harsh and did not meet with general approval and there was no good reason for it, then it would be dealt with on its own merits at a particular time.</P>
      <P>I do not know why anybody should have any reason to anticipate that a Minister would take it upon himself to act in a way which would be contrary to the general spirit of the Constitution under which citizens are guaranteed freedom of conscience and freedom of opinion, provided that these are not contrary to public order and morality.  Take, let us say, the case of some particular cult, it might happen that its activities were of a subversive character and that they would be regarded generally as being against public order and morality.  If we were to limit this we would be preventing the Minister from dealing with it. Why should the Minister be precluded from dealing with such a cult simply because his doing so might be regarded as particularising people of a particular religious belief or faith, let us say?  Its practices might be very objectionable and might be held to be contrary to public order and morality.  In the same way it is possible to have political views which would be regarded in the same light by our people here, and that, in fact, would be subversive. There are political philosophies and political beliefs that are undoubtedly contrary to our conception of ordered government.  Suppose that a number of people who believed, for instance, that all government was wrong: that it was contrary to the general welfare and to the full life of human beings, why should we allow that to be propagated here when, in its very nature, it would be subversive of our idea of ordered government, and of what, I think, would be regarded as subversive generally under the terms of the Constitution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator must remember that this Bill, when it becomes an Act, will be operated by the Minister, with this safeguard: that any order made under it has to be laid on the Table of both Houses.  That is I think, a sufficient safeguard.  In this and in all similar cases we have to rely on the Act being administered reasonably.  If there <Col N="1526" /> should be any attempt on the part of the Minister to abuse the powers reposed in him, and apparently if they are to be made effective they must be reposed in him, then there is a way for dealing with the Minister and a way of annulling his orders.  If an order under which someone is prevented from coming in cannot be annulled at once, at any rate action can be taken after a specified period by members of the Oireachtas, and if any reasonable objection can be shown to the order, then Parliament can remedy that.  The same would apply to any hardship that might be considered to be imposed by an order regarding entry at some particular port.  That is a matter that could also be remedied by the action of Parliament.  In all the circumstances I do not think that the amendment is necessary, and, therefore.  I cannot accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the President, though I have a good deal of sympathy with the point of view expressed by Senator Johnson.  But, having read the amendment, I came to the same conclusion as the President, that it would be impossible to add such an amendment to the Bill.  The reason is that circumstances might arise in which you would have something that was claimed by the person concerned to be a religious belief which we here would not accept as a religious belief. Perhaps what the President said will, to some extent, meet Senator Johnson's point of view, namely, that you can annul an order by a resolution of either House.  The difficulty at the moment is that while you can annul the order by resolution you cannot propose an amendment of it. The only case in which I can conceive a difficulty might arise is either with regard to religious beliefs or certain political opinions.  It would be extremely difficult to meet such a case if the only power that is left to the Oireachtas is to annul the order.  If there was power to amend an order then a particular point of view could be expressed. One of the difficulties in connection with the present system of Orders is that they can only be annulled.  They cannot be amended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise quite well that there are certain difficulties.  A good deal of my argument on this particular amendment is based upon my antipathy to the method of governing in such matters as this by the Order of the Minister.  I have very little faith in the value of what has become the practice regarding the powers of the Oireachtas when an Order has been laid on the Table.  The twenty-one sitting days is of no value at all in many cases if the House has adjourned, say, from the 1st of August to the 1st January.  Whatever damage might be done is being done all the time when the House is not sitting.  While it has a certain value for the purpose of ensuring publicity in matters of this kind which involve a great deal of interference with individuals it is not of very much value.</P>
      <P>The real trouble, I think, in this particular connection is the vagueness of the phrase &ldquo;particular class.&rdquo; I should certainly like the Minister to consider whether he could not define a little more particularly what is meant by a &ldquo;particular class.&rdquo;&ldquo;Nationality&rdquo; is fairly easily understood.  &ldquo;All aliens&rdquo; is understood because there is a definition in the Bill itself.  &ldquo;Particular aliens&rdquo; is easily understood because they are going to be described but &ldquo;particular class&rdquo; is not understood. It may be composed of people with red hair or of people with turned up toes.  Anything at all that the Minister may define to be a &ldquo;particular class&rdquo; is a particular class which we are giving him power to legislate against.  That, to me, is the essence of this difficulty that I am in.  I would like if we could have a little more precise information as to what is meant by a &ldquo;particular class.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Order that has been in operation for some time gives power to deal with classes, and, as we shall hear later, arose out of emergency legislation that at any rate could be revised. I would appeal to the President to consider whether there could not be a somewhat better definition of this phrase &ldquo;particular class,&rdquo; so that it would not be left to the imagination of whoever is in charge at the time to decide what is a class and who shall be comprised within it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 5, sub-section (2).  To delete paragraph (b).</P>
      <P>The paragraph that I wish to delete is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Conferring on the Minister and on officers of the Minister, officers of customs and excise and the military and police forces of the State all such powers (including powers of arrest and detention) as are, in the opinion of the Minister, necessary for giving full effect to or enforcing compliance with such order.</P>
      <P>The powers proposed to be given in that paragraph appear to me to be nearly as wide as the powers given in the Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Act.  We are going to do this by free, full and open authority&mdash;to hand over to the Minister these powers which he can exercise as long as the House is not sitting.  It is in the Minister's discretion to say what length that interregnum is to be&mdash;it may be for several months in the year.  In my opinion these powers ought to be contained in the Bill itself.  We ought not to leave this open to the Minister to operate by Order.  I am with Deputy McGilligan on this, at least.  He is on the side of the angels for once.  He pointed out that the Act of 1914 which is dated the 5th of August of that year &mdash;we know what an ominous date that was&mdash;was passed as emergency war legislation.  But even the section which is equivalent to what is proposed here, says that the person shall be specified. It gives power to the Minister for the time being, by Order in Council, to confer upon such persons&mdash;that is officers&mdash;as may be specified in such order.  There is no reference to specifying persons in the Order in this particular section, so that this is very much wider than the emergency war legislation of the British Parliament in 1914.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I can see there is no reason whatever why the powers that are intended to be conferred upon the Minister, and the officers of the Minister, should not be specified in this Bill. I am pretty sure that they are already <Col N="1529" /> in the Department's files, and if they are not capable of being placed in this Bill, then they should be greatly limited.  I would ask the House to read them and think of what is meant.  The Minister may issue an Aliens Order. Such an Aliens Order is to confer upon himself and his officers&mdash;officers of Customs and Excise and on the military and police forces&mdash;all such powers, including powers of arrest and detention, as are in his opinion necessary for giving full effect to and forcing compliance with, etc....</P>
    <P>I am asking to have defined in the legislation what the powers are, not to limit them in any way, but to say how long the detention shall be and what kind of officers shall have these powers, junior clerks or superintendents of police or whoever they may be. The Minister is going to have the power to do these things.  I know the answer that always comes, when criticism is made, that we must trust to the discretion of the Minister. That answer is never very satisfying. It is the kind of answer which justifies one saying that there is no need for any legislation at all.  In matters dealing with aliens we are giving the Minister power to use his discretion as to how he shall deal with them. The purpose of legislation is, not only to give powers to Ministers, but to limit their powers.  In this case we are giving powers to the Minister but not limiting them in any way.  I think this paragraph should be deleted, for the purpose of forcing upon the Minister the obligation of inserting in the Bill the kind of powers he wants, and a limitation of the powers which should be given.  I cannot draft an amendment conferring on the Minister the powers I think he ought to have, but it is not outside the province of the Minister to do so.  If he is capable of doing that at some future time, perhaps at a time of excitement, when an order is going to be issued, he is, at least, as capable of doing it now, in the calm of prevailing peace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Johnson generally with regard to the need for an amendment of this sub-section. <Col N="1530" /> He is right when he says that there is practically no limit, though I think the paragraph which includes powers of arrest and detention might be somewhat limited in law.  Perhaps the fact that the words are there suggests that there could not be a death penalty in the order. The President, I suggest, should consider what is wanted.  To my mind what is wanted is, that at the port if the police authorities are in doubt, they should have power to detain a person for 24 hours or for a short period until he can be brought before a court or a responsible person who would deal with the enforcement of the order.  No other power than that should be given to officials of the Customs and Excise.  The wide powers provided here are quite unnecessary. While I am not suggesting that they would ever be carried out as drastically as Senator Johnson believes, I think there should not be put into the Bill a provision giving to officials of the Customs and Excise powers over aliens to the extent provided.  To do so would be to make people nervous and possibly give the impression that we were trying to take unnecessary powers regarding those who visit this country.  From some experience I had as a member of a committee that had something to do with the treatment of Germans during the Great War, I know that in many cases mistakes in the way of detention were made and that persons complained they were detained without proper reason.  That is one reason why the powers given to Customs and Excise officials should not be too drastic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It is almost impossible to imagine all the possible powers that might be required, and to specify them in legislation.  We know that it is easy to create a good deal of difficulty and to nullify the intention of the Legislature by leaving loopholes of various kinds.  The moment you specify them there arises the possibility of nullifying the intentions of the Legislature in giving powers like these to Ministers.  The fundamental question is: Is the Minister to have discretion to make certain orders?  He <Col N="1531" /> can make these orders, and Parliament has the right to nullify them.  If orders are made surely the Minister must be put in a position to make them effective.  There is ample limitation of the powers officials shall have, that they shall be only those that are reasonably necessary for the enforcement of the order.  The insertion of words dealing with powers of arrest and detention indicates, as Senator Douglas pointed out, the maximum sort of powers that would seem to be necessary.  I could not hope to exhaust all the imaginary ways that might be resorted to to defeat a particular order.  There might be a simple method of evasion, and the Minister should have power to see that these methods were not effective. While I understand the general spirit in which criticism is directed against giving these wide powers, and the danger that there is in cases of this kind, we must give the Minister such powers as will enable him to make effective the order which he wants to enforce.  The question is, what do you want to do?  You may have to direct the person to stay in a particular place. I am very much afraid it would be impossible to specify the varieties of evasions that might be attempted, or to specify the powers the Minister should have.  I am quite conscious that that might be regarded as a lazy reply, in order to avoid an investigation of all the possibilities, but, after all, life is too short to attempt to meet all the things that might arise.  In a matter like his, if there is any excitement abroad, it will not be on the part of the Minister.  It is much more likely to be on the part of the populace.  I do not know if the Senator wants to have this deleted, but there must be some clause in the Bill giving power to the Minister to enforce an order.</P>

      <P>Have the police not got power to arrest aliens that break the law?  If an alien disobeys an order made by the Minister he is breaking the law.  In my opinion the police should only make arrests and bring the persons before the court.  Whatever is necessary to have that done should be provided.  Without supporting Senator <Col N="1532" /> Johnson in his drastic amendment, possibly the Minister would consider whether there should not be a limit to the time of detention.</P>

      <P>May I remind Senator Douglas that there are some breaches of the law in respect of which there is no power of arrest?  May I say to Senator Johnson that the clause he seeks to have deleted is only ancillary to the order provided in Section 5 (1). That order only deals with the landing, leaving, exclusion, residence and the registration of aliens.  Before you conclude I wish to say that these are five matters in respect of which these ancillary powers are taken, and that there could be no such thing as sentencing a man to death.</P>

      <P>I do not think there would be any question of adopting Senator Johnson's amendment and deleting the whole section.  We agree with the President that the clause is necessary, but that there is hesitation to have unlimited detention without any necessity to bring an alien before a court or other body.  There is no <i>habeas corpus</i> in regard to aliens, and if the Bill is left as it is by order anyone can be arrested and certified as an alien and kept in detention for an unlimited time.  That is the only point of difference.  We would like to have a little information as to limiting the detention.</P>

      <P>Under the Constitution there is power of <i>habeas corpus.</i> It is &ldquo;a person&rdquo; is referred to. Senators are reading more into this Bill than could possibly be in it. These are the only powers necessary to give effect to the orders which are to be made and which will be passed by the House.  As the Leas-Chathaoirleach has pointed out they are orders referring to particular activities and to residence, etc., of aliens. I am as sensitive as most people with regard to these matters.  This is not a case in which I apprehend any abuse whatever of the powers to be given. Customs officers require to have powers <Col N="1533" /> to do certain things, because they are the people immediately dealing with these matters and not the police.  It is one thing to detain a man coming off a ship and another thing to have to search or to follow him up afterwards. What is the need for duplicating forces?  Is a Customs officer not a responsible officer in carrying out these duties?  We arc unnecessarily anxious about the powers to be given, and I am afraid I cannot promise to get a satisfactory amendment, unless we were completely to eliminate such powers.  Are the powers of arrest and detention sufficient?  I cannot imagine what possible case would arise in the section from (a) to (h).  The only possible amendment I can imagine would be to limit the powers in general, and I do not think the House wishes that to be done.  What are the cases that might be thought of?  We are either to limit their powers or leave general power there which, I think, is not unreasonable.  We must not run away with the general idea that this is an objectionable type of legislation and so on and try to argue on that basis, because if ever there was an occasion in which this type of legislation which would seem to be justified it is here.  As a result of criticism of the Bill we inserted amendments dealing with search warrants, bringing before justices and so on.  These were not in the original Bill, and in the view of a number of Senators they will meet objections which have been raised.  I would be quite willing if there were any specific suggestion that could be dealt with and which did not seem to curtail the Minister's powers&mdash; I would be willing to consider it, but I do not see how I can amend it except by doing it in such a way as would leave it powerless.</P>

      <P>I ask the President if it is not possible to amend it in such a way for instance as to deprive him of power to impose fines of £100. This is the power, with slight modification, that was conferred in 1914 upon officers of the British Ministry, and there were, in fact, abuses which could not be remedied <Col N="1534" /> because the powers were given by Parliament to the Minister.  The President used a phrase which, simple as it is, would give the power &ldquo;reasonably necessary for the enforcement of the Order.&rdquo;  I cannot understand what powers will appear in an order that cannot appear in the Bill.  There could be defined powers in the Bill stating in the different sections what the Orders applied to.  The whole question is how far the powers of the Minister to legislate are to be extended.  It is necessary for certain powers to be given, but the question is how far is it desirable that they should be limited.  The President has stated that there is not any case of unfair use of the 1914-19 Act.  Granted, but that is just a confidence trick, getting the Order by saying that there have been no abuses because nothing happened.  But the moment something does happen you find that the thing has been done and that you have no remedy.  I think that the President ought to consider just how far he is going with this type of legislation.  There is no reason why these powers should be given to the Minister for exercise in the form of an Order instead of being prescribed by legislation.  It is unwise, in my judgment at any rate, that unlimited powers of this kind should be conferred on the Minister and upon those whom he likes to name when it is quite possible and practicable for the powers to be defined in the Bill.</P>

      <P>With regard to the general principle, I agree with Senator Johnson that this tendency in legislation is wrong but, due to the complexity of the things that have to be dealt with, it is impossible to be explicit.  The powers I want cannot be specified in the Bill.  It would be different if one were dealing with one specific body.  Here it is not possible and no suggestions have been made which would enable us to carry out our proposals in any other way.  I think you will have sufficient safeguard <Col N="1535" /> in the fact that the order will have to be laid on the Table of the House.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to another matter while talking about the Table of the House.  I think that some objection was raised by Senator Johnson about the laying of papers on the Table of the House&mdash;that such orders might be made when the House was not sitting.  I was wondering whether something could not be done to meet that point, but I find that it would be necessary for the Minister to have power to take the action which would be necessary for the protection of the general body of the people even with the possibility of injustice to a single individual.  It might be said that the Minister could summon the House and that the onus for doing so should be on him, but I think that where you have the public interest on the one hand and possible injustice to an individual on the other, you must consider the general public interest and that the expense of summoning the House should not be put on the people.  It would not be reasonable to compel the Minister to bring the House together in order to deal with a case of that sort.  As I have said, if there be any circumstance which would excuse the taking of these powers this is it.</P>

Cases of that kind arise and no matter what case might be made for definition in the legislation, the officers of the Department could raise a case which would not be covered in the Bill.

      <P>I think it is unwise to give those powers unless the circumstances of the moment are grave.  They would be required in time of war perhaps but in times of peace I think that it is not a power that we should be asked to give to the Minister.  I am simply asking that such a power shall <Col N="1537" /> not be exercisable in respect of all aliens&mdash;people who are not citizens&mdash; or in respect of aliens of a particular nationality except in times of war or grave emergency.  It is, again, a question as to whether we as a legislature are prepared to entrust the Minister with these extraordinary powers, to be exercised when he thinks fit, without restriction upon the time or circumstances in which they will be exercised. Again, the President will say that the Orders will be laid upon the Table and, though the House may not be sitting at the time, it will be necessary that the House meet at least once a year for the discharge of the necessary financial legislation.  Meanwhile, this Order will be operating.  It is quite clear that this kind of legislation is particularly necessary in times of war, whether directed against all aliens or against aliens of a particular nationality. My amendment would allow that to operate but I do suggest that we should not give the Minister power to bang and bolt the door against all aliens at any time he wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The point at issue is whether we are to have power to prohibit strangers from coming in and completely upsetting the whole position of our people by, perhaps, displacing them from employment, or whether there should be power of restriction in the Minister, who will have regard to the general welfare of the community. If that power were taken away, the Bill would be useless.  Without that provision, the Bill would not confer the necessary power at all.  We must remember that this Bill and the Orders made under it will be operated not merely to protect the community in the ordinary way from hostile action which might be apprehended in time of war, but to protect the community in respect of its economic and industrial interests. If you deprive the Minister of the power to make an Order in regard to all aliens, I am afraid you are going to take away from him a power which has been exercised, and exercised fairly consistently and widely, up to the present.  In the present period of reorganisation of our industrial, social and economic life, powers like this are <Col N="1538" /> necessary, and such powers are now exercised, as we know, in practically every country.  The question is whether or not we should have an open door here.  That might be advisable if it were done by the world in general, but the question is whether, like other forms of protection, this form of protection should not be given to our community.  I am afraid I shall have to resist this amendment.  The amendment also refers to aliens of a particular nationality.  In reference to aliens of a particular nationality we have in the Nationality Bill and also in this Bill certain powers of exemption which might need to be specified in an Aliens Order.  We might have to specify in an Aliens Order certain exemptions and special regulations in regard to members of a particular nationality.  We may wish to confer rights on people similar to those which they confer upon us.  In regard to all aliens and in regard to aliens of a particular nationality, I am afraid that, if we were to accept the amendment, the powers which we deem necessary would go by the board.</P>

      <P>But this Bill wants to give power to the Minister to make an Order directed against any person who is not a citizen.  I do not know whether it is a matter of grammar or grammatical construction, but it seems to me that this section gives power to the Minister to prohibit the entry of any person who is not a citizen, to control the movement of such a person, if he comes in, and to require that he leave.  That Order may apply to all aliens.  If he wants to apply the Order to particular aliens or to a particular class of aliens, he may do that under my amendment.  But he would not be entitled under the amendment to exclude holus bolus, by his own decree, everybody who is not a citizen, or to say that no German, no Russian or no South American would be allowed into the country.  If he wishes to say that certain persons of a particular class or certain individuals who shall be specified are not to be allowed in, I can understand it, but the making of a general Order covering every alien, or a general Order covering every alien of a particular nationality, seems to me to be a thing which should not be within the power of the Minister.  It is to the extent of these powers to be given to a particular Minister&mdash;and that Minister the head of the Police Department&mdash;that I object.  This is a police measure.  It is not an External Affairs measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Douglas that one can hardly conceive an Order being made absolutely prohibiting all aliens from landing except in time of very grave emergency.  But we are legislating now to give power for the making of general Orders.  The Senator has anticipated the reply I propose to make.  He will admit that the Minister should have power to make Orders with respect to particular aliens.  It is quite clear that, in the case of a large number of aliens, we could not specify the individuals and we might have to refer to them as a particular class or group.  Then we come to aliens of a particular nationality. Certain circumstances, other than war, might make it advisable to have powers in regard to aliens of a particular nationality.  I have already referred to certain cases&mdash;cases of exemption&mdash;in which we will require to have this power.  The objection is fined down to a point which it is not so easy to answer&mdash;that with regard to all aliens.  Having gone so far, I do not think that we should stop at giving the Minister the powers necessary to make this Bill sufficiently wide and comprehensive to deal with all the circumstances that will arise.  The Order will have to be laid on the Table of both Houses.  I admit, with the Senator, that that is not absolutely and completely satisfactory, but in this case I think it affords ample protection. Another measure might have to be brought in at an awkward time if steps had to be taken against all aliens and the courts were to hold that a state of war did not exist.  Again, I am of opinion that Senators are unnecessarily anxious.  It is right that these Bills should be examined carefully, but, on full consideration, I think that Senators will find that there is no necessity for apprehension on the ground of abuse of the powers.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1541" /> Section 5, sub-section (5).  To insert before the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(5)  An alien who has been for a period of not less than five years resident in Saorstát Eireann and is in employment or engaged in business or in the practice of a profession in Saorstát Eireann shall not be deported under the provisions of this section unless&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  pursuant to the sentence of a court of competent jurisdiction in Saorstát Eireann such alien has undergone or is undergoing a term of imprisonment for a breach of the law of Saorstát Eireann; or</P>
    <P>(b)  a judge or district justice before whom such alien has been brought for trial on a criminal charge has recommended his deportation; or</P>
    <P>(c)  the Minister has caused such alien to be served with a notice in writing stating that it is intended to make an order for his deportation and an interval of not less than three months has elapsed since the service of such notice.</P>
    <P>This amendment is one of limited scope.  If it were accepted as it stands or in principle, it would not make any drastic alteration in the powers conferred by the Bill.  It applies to a class of aliens to whom I referred on Second Reading&mdash;people who had been for a considerable period engaged in some lawful occupation in the country, who had not run foul of the law or committed any misdemeanour. My amendment does not propose to fetter the discretion of the Executive in any way.  It proposes to establish what is really a very small safeguard. It deals only with the question of deportation, which is amongst the many powers taken in this Bill.  I propose that there should be a certain limitation in respect of the power of deportation simply because there is a sort of finality about deportation.  To deport an alien might seem to be less serious action than to intern him.  I presume there are powers of internment under other Acts.  If a man were interned without good cause, representations <Col N="1542" /> could be made and, if his internment was due to some misunderstanding or to hasty action by a police officer, he could be released.  But if he were taken and thrown neck and crop out of the country, it would be practically impossible to do anything for him.  After such treatment, he might be afraid to come back, so that there is somewhat the same finality about deportation that there is about execution.</P>
    <P>I think that, in general, if an alien were deported, however great the hardship or injustice to his family, nothing could be done about it, and so far as representations in the Dáil and Seanad are concerned, they would be of no avail, because anything done under an Order would be valid even if the Order were revoked.  Something like this should go in as a headline in. the administration of the Bill.  As a matter of fact, although three months is suggested, if there is an alien whom the Government has some reason to get out of the country, he can be restricted in so many ways that he can do no damage during the three months.  If he is a person who ought to be got rid of or if he were really dangerous in circumstances of strained relations, the remedy would be not to deport him, but to intern him.  I do not say the amendment deals with aliens adequately but it would set a headline for a Minister, and something like that is desirable.  Without some such safeguards, the position is than an alien has no rights.  I do not want to say that people would be harshly dealt with without any consideration, but circumstances might arise if there was a little feeling when the tendency would be to be over-cavalier and to disregard people outside the protection of our law, and I regard it as one of the signs of civilisation that &ldquo;a stranger within the gates&rdquo; should get fair treatment and have his human rights regarded.  If there is a class of alien here in respect of whom there are certain difficulties, the tendency on the part of the police and of other officials would be to consider the case of aliens who are protected with more care and to be less <Col N="1543" /> hasty to throw them out.  I understand that elsewhere great hardships have been inflicted on aliens by way of deportation and I think that the Government ought to consider whether something like this by way of headline to those who will be administering the Act in future, ought to be set which would, to some degree, act as a standard which would not impede anything in the interests of the people or in the interests of the country.</P>

    <P>This is really aimed at doing in a better fashion what I sought under sub-section (3).  The intention is that if the Minister is going to make an order to apply to all aliens, or to all aliens with particular nationality, that that order must receive specific sanction from the Legislature, just as if an order were made by way of an Act and not by way of the Minister's own decree.  I do not think there is any need to argue this, therefore, to any further extent.  It raises the question whether the powers of the Minister shall be those of the Legislature pro <Col N="1544" /> tem. or whether when you are going to deal with aliens of a particular nationality, you should not have the specific sanction of the Legislature.  That is the whole purpose and effect of the amendment.</P>

Between the two I naturally choose or lean to the one that I think would be most for the safeguarding of our own people.</P>

      <P>The object of this amendment is to bring it in line with orders dealing with books.  It is provided that orders under other Acts dealing with the importation of books and periodicals are to be published in the Official Gazette. I simply want it to be known to the public that when an order is issued against A.B. and all his tribe or group or community, that the public shall know such an order has been issued and therefore, I ask that it should be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, I do not think it is desirable that the Minister should have these powers without making public how he is using them.  That information, at least, should be given to the public.  We are providing that other things shall be laid before the Oireachtas, and the Oireachtas may then take such action as it wishes, but unless the Oireachtas knows how it is working or what classes of people the order is made against, the value of its power of revocation is very small indeed, so I think it is at least desirable that the publication should be made available showing how the Minister is using the powers.

      <P>It would appear that Senator Johnson and I have changed sides in this particular matter.  I am interested from another point of view, and there are reasons why I feel we must object I have the interests of the particular person against whom an <Col N="1546" /> order may be made, in mind, and I am considering whether he would wish to have the fact published in this particular way.  We have then to choose between two things&mdash;one is the desire of the Seanad and people of the country to know how these powers have been exercised, and, on the other hand, the natural desire not to harm people against whom we might be compelled to take action, more than is necessary for our immediate protection. The issue is whether it is advisable to issue names and to have these put on a black list.  In thinking over it, I was wondering whether it was less objectionable if a return was made available for members of both Houses or if it could be got by parliamentary question.  The return could be had by either of these ways, but it might have as detrimental an effect as if the publicity were given in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  My feeling is that we should not do it in the case of particular aliens.  Whether a parliamentary question should be resorted to or a return given instead, and whether that would be better, I would like to hear Senators' views.  I have an open mind, and here is a case from ar administration point of view, which does not mean much, but from the point of view of keeping acts of the Minister in front of the public appears advisable.  The question is: would we be doing unnecessary harm to the people concerned?  If any suggestions are made, I would be glad to consider them on the Report Stage.  Senator Johnson is approaching it from one angle and I from another.</P>

      <P>I agree with the President. I do not think it would be fair to publish the names when it might be undesirable to give the reasons in so many cases.  The reason may be purely national and there may be nothing against the character of a particular person, but it might be held to be against his character in another country.  The only suggestion I could make would be that the Department of External Affairs could permit the list of members to be seen by Deputies and Senators or by properly accredited members of the legal profession&mdash;<Col N="1547" /> something of that kind without any definite publicity.  To publish a list of names to members of the Oireachtas would be the same as putting it in the Official Gazette.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not able to understand this argument, and, unless there are reasons of the kind that would appeal to the average citizen, there should not be an Order directed against a person at all.  One assumes that it is only for serious faults or dangers to the community, industrial or otherwise, that persons are being prohibited.  If there is a tenderness for the alien, then it must be presumed that the alien is going to be prohibited for no fault or danger at all.  If there is not going to be any publicity, how is anybody to know in what way the Minister is using his powers?  On two occasions when the Expiring Laws Bill was presented here for re-enactment, I did ask how the Act taken over here was being operated.  I was not told, and I did not press for the information.  But, unless it is made known the kind of person against whom these Orders are being directed, the number of persons against whom they are being directed, what kind of policy the Minister is following out under the powers that we are giving him, how is the Legislature to know?  We are handing over powers, which are statute-making in effect, to a Minister, and we are not ensuring that we shall be told how he is using those powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand being tender, perhaps, to aliens if the powers are going to be used without good reason&mdash;if they are going to be used out of mere prejudice&mdash;but, if there is any solid public reason for excluding aliens, surely the reason should be made public as well as how the powers under the Act are being administered.  It may be that that is too logical.  It <Col N="1548" /> may be that one should get away from ordinary reasons in these things.  The powers that we are giving to our Minister are not to be renewable annually. The presumption about the annual renewal of powers is that they may be exercised in such a way that they should be withdrawn, but this is a permanent piece of legislation.  It is different from that passed by the British, which is renewable annually.  We are handing over these powers to the Minister, and we are not going to ask him how is he administering them.  That, I suggest, is not a wise thing.  I think that we should place on the Minister the obligation of publishing the names of the persons against whom he is directing his Orders.</P>

      <P>I think I have already given the real reason for our objection to the amendment.  It is not to cover up something or anything of that sort.  I am sure that Senator Johnson will see the force of the remarks made by Senator Douglas on this matter.  As he has pointed out, a person may be excluded for national reasons or for some reason which did not reflect on his character at all. Again, as Senator Douglas pointed out, a person may be excluded for reasons that it might be very awkward to give. To state the fact that a person was excluded without giving a reason might also be very harmful, because in these cases if there are several reasons for which a person may be deported the worst possible reason might be suggested as the real reason why he was deported.  Therefore we are loth to give that publicity.  I was wondering whether we could have some list that, without making it public, would be available at stated periods for those interested in a matter of this kind: for instance, to members of the two Houses.  If that information were made available in the form of a return, it would, I suppose, have to be published.</P>

      <P>I had arrived at almost the same conclusion regarding <Col N="1549" /> that as the Senator.  If the information given in returns was of a startling nature the newspapers would be glad to get hold of it and make use of it.  That is one difficulty I see.  At any rate, I will have a further conference with the officers of the Department of Justice on the matter.  If, after hearing all the arguments that may be put up in regard to aliens, I come to the conclusion that, in order to protect the public against possible abuses by the Ministry&mdash;that such a consideration is really overpowering in the case&mdash;then I will agree to the insertion of the amendment later, but at the moment I would like to have more time to consider it.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 10 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, I would like to have a statement from the President as to the relation between it and Section 5.  Under Section 10 the Executive Council is taking power to exempt the citizens of any particular country from the provisions of the Bill.  What I am anxious to find out is whether, in the event of a particular country being exempt, it would still be impossible to make an individual order against a particular alien who is a citizen of that country.  I am inclined to think that a difficulty might arise there.  To speak plainly, while circumstances are as they are and while most of us hope that it will be possible some time to have reciprocal arrangements with the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, the position is that Section 10 will apply to the citizens of those countries. Nevertheless, there may be cases in which it is thought desirable to make an order against a particular individual who is a citizen of one of these countries. What I am anxious to know is whether the President thinks he will have power under this Bill to exempt a particular country, and still retain powers to deal with an individual who is a citizen of that country?  From the wording of Section 10 the position seems to me to be rather doubtful.  I <Col N="1550" /> think the matter is worthy of consideration because, quite conceivably, such a situation might arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also ask the President to consider the question of immunity that is given to certain people under sub-section (4) of Section 5.  When I raised this matter on the Second Reading of the Bill, the President seemed to indicate that there was sufficient power to deal with it under Section 10.  The President's comment was that High Commissioners received here would be likely to be from States within the British Commonwealth. I pointed out that we might have representatives from other countries, and that so far as they were concerned Section 10 could hardly operate.  I believe that we have here at present a French commercial attaché.  Whether his appointment would come under &ldquo;the head of any diplomatic mission duly accredited to Saorstát Eireann, the members of the household of such head&rdquo; I do not know.  It may be that a trade commissioner or a commercial attaché would be directly responsible to his home Government or home Department. If so, I do not think that he would be covered by Section 10 as it stands, because I think that section relates exclusively to the representatives of States within the Commonwealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it would be desirable to have an amendment of sub-section (4).  It might be well if discretionary powers of exemption were given to the Minister.  Under paragraphs (a) and (b) of that sub-section certain classes are exempt.  For instance, a consul-general might have a secretary, and while technically he might be a part of the diplomatic staff if he did not come specifically under this sub-section there might not be power to exempt him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Would there not always be power to exempt under the terms of the Order itself?  That is a matter that would come up in the framing of the Order.  When an exemption order is being made powers will <Col N="1551" /> need to be reserved to deal with the aliens of the particular country that is being exempt.  The aliens from that particular country will have to be safeguarded. The order made relating to them will have to be drawn up with extreme care.  I think the same thing applies to exemptions.  It is quite clear that particular people can be specified individually or as a class in an Aliens Order.  With regard to the point raised by Senator Milroy, if the commercial attaché is a member of a diplomatic mission accredited as such he will be covered by this.  Again, if any particular exemptions were required they would have to be provided for in the Order itself.  Therefore, I do not think there is need to make any special provision to deal with this, as suggested by the Senator.  I think there would be a good deal of objection if I had to come here with a Bill giving powers to make all sorts of exemptions.  The Bill has been examined from that point of view and is, I think, watertight on all the points that have been raised.  If we pass the Committee Stage this evening, these are matters that can get further consideration before the Report Stage is taken next week.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the President has dealt with the point I raised with regard to Section 10, which provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Executive Council may by order exempt from the application of any provision or provisions of this Act, or of any aliens order, the citizens of any country in respect of which the Executive Council are satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances and in particular the laws of such country in relation to immigrants, it is proper that the exemption mentioned in such order should be granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Government to be able to exempt the citizens of a particular country from any and every part of this Act.  Nevertheless, I want them to have power to deal with a particular individual who is objectionable.  I am not satisfied that there is power under <Col N="1552" /> the section, as it stands, to do that, and what I am suggesting is that the section should be further examined from that point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been considered, but we can examine it again. The question is, what would be the form?  Senators seem to have in mind a very general form of order passed by the Executive Council that could be detailed with regard to the deportation of an undesirable character.  I would like Senators to tell me if that is the point.  Otherwise I have not got it. As I understand it, the point made is that Senators fear the order which would be made by the Executive Council, exempting citizens of a certain country, would be of such a character that it would preclude Ministers from dealing with particular aliens.</P>

      <P>Reverting to the point made by Senator Douglas, it is as well to bear in mind that the implication of this section is reciprocity.  If you are going to make exceptions, touching groups or classes of individuals, or leaving it open to exclude certain individuals from the country with whom reciprocal arrangements are made, you must expect that they will do the same thing.  Their views and ours as to who is desirable may differ at times. It is as well to leave this as open as possible, so that the reciprocity will be complete and absolute.</P>

The provisions are sufficiently wide to enable us to deal with any circumstances such as the Senator indicated.  A point of view opposite to that of Senator Douglas has been expressed by Senator Johnson. <Col N="1554" /> The question of reciprocity will have to be very carefully considered. In the drawing of particular orders the Executive Council, when considering the details, will have to have clearly in mind the needs of reciprocity, and to know exactly all the circumstances. They will be entitled to retain the power of saying to a particular alien that he is undesirable, on the ground of some type of undesirability, if we have the difficulty Senator Johnson indicated.  That is a matter for the order and not a provision for the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather surprising that the Government is still insisting on going on with this Bill.  It seems to have been introduced and passed in the Dáil for a special occasion, with a view to fighting a certain set of local elections on a particular basis.  Those elections are now passed, and it will be a couple of years before county councils have again to be elected. There is every appearance that before the county council elections come around again, a more serious and, perhaps, more drastic change in the whole system of local government is going to take place.  I do not see any possibility of avoiding an increased Exchequer contribution to the finances of local authorities, whatever form that increased contribution may take, and if that occurs I presume it is going to involve certain changes in regard to the administration and working of local bodies.  It would seem to me to be more reasonable, and would involve the avoidance of something like the unnecessary use of legislative machinery, if this matter had been left over until the whole local government system comes under review. Even the Government will hardly deny that it must come under review.  Apart from that, I think this Bill is bad in principle.  It is assimilating the local government franchise to the Parliamentary franchise and, in fact, there is no sound argument for that.  The powers of the Parliament are all-embracing and deal with every aspect of national life.  They affect the rights and position of every individual, and it is necessary and proper that every individual should have a share in voting in the elections of Members of Parliament.  The position is different so far as local government is concerned. The powers of local bodies are limited and the field of taxation is strictly circumscribed.  They raise revenue practically entirely by rates which fall on a limited class of citizens.  That is the sort of taxation that perhaps cannot be passed on, whereas the national taxation falls on every citizen.  The argument that the sort of household franchise which has existed up to the present for local <Col N="1556" /> government is not merely that it is a ratepayers' franchise, but that it is desirable local elections should be carried out as far as possible on the basis of local necessities and the desire to have local business done in a particular way.  It is undesirable that it should be possible to say that local elections are an exact test of political strength.  On the present franchise, just as on the extended franchise, they are a pretty close test of political strength.  I do not think any particular Party is going to gain or to loose much by making everyone a Parliamentary voter.  As long as it is a restricted franchise, or that you cannot have an exact political test, you have the opportunity, at any rate, of having local interests and the efficiency of local administration made a fair part in the fight for election.  If you extend the Parliamentary franchise to these elections the political elements are going to outweigh everything else and the elections will be really Parliamentary by-elections and that is not at all desirable. The local representatives will be elected as political nominees.  That is going to injure the efficiency of local government.  I believe this Bill is never going to be effective as it stands because other changes have to take place and I would not spend a great deal of time opposing it except I believe that it is bad.  It seems to me that it is a very undesirable procedure and that in the circumstances the Government should not proceed in putting it into law.</P>

      <P>It seems to me rather strange to hear the leader of the alleged youth of the country protesting against extending the local franchise, but to me it would appear that Senator Blythe has lost confidence in the youth of the country from the point of view of elections.  He says that the local elections are not in reality any indication of political strength but he must have changed his opinions about the indications that could be had from such elections as a result of the last local elections.  Before those elections we were told what great indications the <Col N="1557" /> feeling of the people in the local election would be because at that time it was anticipated as a foregone conclusion that the following of the Opposition in the country would show a difference from the Parliamentary elections.  We all know what happened and I think it is pretty late in the day for Senator Blythe or anyone in the Opposition to come out and tell us that the result of the last election was not an indication of the feeling of the people of the country.  He says it is all right for these young people to have a vote in the Parliamentary elections but the irresponsible rabble as they used to be called should not have a vote in the local elections.  How is it all right for people to vote for the election of the House which has the administration of the Central Fund and not to have a vote for the parish pump? Sixty per cent of the funds which will be administered by the local bodies come out of the Central Fund.  It is an extraordinary thing that a man like Senator Blythe who used to be regarded as responsible can come along here and make a statement of that kind&mdash;that men who have a vote for electing for the people to spend out of the Central Fund must not have a vote in the local elections.  He says that a change will have to be made before another election will come around.  I think the majority of the people in the country feel that this extension of the franchise is a very desirable change.  This Bill when it comes into law will be welcomed by the people of the country.  There was considerable jubilation when the Bill was originally introduced.</P>

I believe that it is time for a change in the attitude about the stake in the country and that the people who will get a vote under this <Col N="1558" /> Bill are as much entitled to it as anybody else.  The men who subscribe to the Central Fund include the man who takes a pint of porter, the man who smokes an ounce of tobacco, and the old woman who takes a cup of tea.  It is they who subscribe to the Fund from which most of the money goes to local authorities.  It is time now to stop referring to people as having no stake in the country.  The time has come for a change in the attitude of mind which measures the stake in the country by acres or pounds.  All the young men of the country who gave their best services to it, and who always give their services, have a stake in the country and they have a right to vote in this election of the parish pump or the erection of a bridge.</P>

The elections are due in Dublin in 15 months' time, next June twelve months.  Surely the local elections are not more important than the general elections?  This Government is elected on the extended franchise, and why should it not apply to the local elections?  There is the question about who pays the rates; indirectly some of the rates are paid by people living in slums; they pay it in the form of rent to the landlord.  As one of the representatives of Dublin City I welcome this Bill.</P>

Senator Blythe's remarks had no connection with his leadership of the League of Youth.  I come from the country and I say that the Government had no mandate to introduce this Bill.

They should get down to the fundamental things and reconstruct the country.  That is what is needed, not politics.  Local administration is likely to get better results from those who have administered it in the past.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to say anything, because any points that I might make in reply to Senator Blythe have been made very effectively by Senator Quirke. As regards Senator O'Hanlon, I know him since he was much younger than he is now and I think that the advice that he has extended to this House and the country he might very well have extended to himself. Perhaps it is as a result of his own experiences of life that he thinks now that he might have done better service to the country if he had acted up to his advice.  Senator Blythe and I differ altogether on this question of the franchise.  It is, I claim, a question of principle.  Senator Blythe does not think so, and I do, and whether the local elections take place next year or in five years does not matter; the principle to me remains the same, and I think that the Government was right in bringing in this measure. If I had had my way it would have been brought in earlier.  It was a question of time.  Local government may be reorganised.  Senator Blythe <Col N="1560" /> thinks that it is quite on the cards that a larger part of the cost of local government will be brought on to the National Exchequer in the near future. That may or not be so.  As Senator Quirke has pointed out, more than 60 per cent.  of the expenditure on county government is being borne by the Exchequer at present.  Whether that proportion will be increased or not remains to be seen.  Whether or not it is increased does not affect the position of those who believe that it is a matter of principle to give to those who are contributory parties to the rates, as well as to the taxes, an opportunity of expressing their views in local elections as well as in national affairs.  It is hardly a year ago&mdash;some Senator referred to this&mdash;when the repudiated leader of Senator Blythe and, I think, of Senator O'Hanlon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

General O'Duffy's own Party kicked out the Bill here&mdash;so much did they think of their leader even before he split the camp.  We thought we would give his own followers an opportunity of showing what they thought of him, and they showed it very effectively. <Col N="1561" /> When we were discussing this Bill before, there was much talk on one side about politics being kept out of local authorities.  Local bodies, it was said, should be run without reference to politics.  I should like to see the ordinary affairs of local business authorities run in a businesslike way without reference to politics.

It would probably be better if broad national issues were left out of local affairs.  In practice, however, we find that they are not left out.  The last time I was interested in local politics, as a candidate for Dublin Corporation, there was a very strong agitation by Senator Blythe's Party that politics should be left out of the municipal affairs of the city.  In many of the speeches I made, I said: &ldquo;That is all very well, but will they be left out?  We know very well that they will not.  Probably the first people who will bring them in at a suitable opportunity will be the Party who say they should be left out.&rdquo;  Of course, that happened. I do not say that I myself have not often brought politics into local bodies. When I found it necessary, I did so and, if I were there again, I might do the same.</P>

      <P>There is nothing like it.  If I myself did not say these things, some of my friends would remember them and say them for me. Even if Senator Blythe is right and the power sought to be given to the youth of the country is not used to any great extent, I do not see that any harm can be done.  It may be that when the reorganisation of local government &mdash;which has been talked about a great deal&mdash;comes, the powers of local authorities, if the National Exchequer <Col N="1562" /> is to bear a greater part of the cost of local administration, will be further curtailed.  Even then, it would be no harm, from any point of view, to have the voice of the youth of the country heard in the local authorities.  As I said here and in the Dáil before, I have found straight dealing and honesty much more in the ascendant amongst the younger people on local authorities than amongst others.</P>
