      <P>Pursuant to the understanding arrived at last week, I propose to ask the House to order the Committee Stages of Nos. 2 to 10, inclusive, on to-day's Order Paper for to-morrow, as and when the Second Stage is completed to-day.  If Senators desire to offer any amendments to any of these Bills I am prepared to take them at short notice, but they should be handed in before the adjournment of the House this evening, in order that they may appear on the printed Order Paper for to-morrow.</P>
      <P>It is desirable that we should finish the business on to-day's Order Paper before we adjourn this evening, but I suggest that we wait for some time to see what progress we make before we discuss the possibility of a late sitting.  Is that agreed?</P>

      <P>There are two or three very important Bills and I cannot see that we will have sufficient time to consider amendments to these Bills at such short notice.  I think, if we cannot meet next week, that we should adjourn the Committee Stages of these Bills until this day fortnight. They are very important Bills from the point of view of the farmers.  The farmer representatives are prepared to come here.  The Labour Party may be anxious to go to the seaside and others may be anxious to go to the moors.  At all events, the farmer <Col N="886" /> Senators have quite as much as they can do in attending to the harvest and still they are prepared to come here.  I think, Sir, you ought to stick to the Standing Orders and adjourn the Committee Stages of at least two of these Bills for a fortnight.</P>

      <P>At any rate it did not seem likely that we were to take the Committee Stage in the case of two of these Bills this week.  Two of the Bills on the Order Paper raise many contentious principles.  Apart altogether from the established principle, it is unwise to take the Committee Stage at such short notice.  If a Senator has made other arrangements he does not expect to come here next week but it would be much better to decide now that this House is not to meet next week and so the Committee Stages of these Bills could be adjourned until the following week. Senators may have their arrangements made for next week.</P>

      <P>I do not know that I would succeed in convincing the House after the vote given here on the last day.  This much I should like to say&mdash;it is, of course, known that this measure, like similar measures dealing with social services, will be constantly under review and constantly the object of amendment.  I am satisfied that this Widows' and Orphans' Bill which has gone through both Houses so far will have the same history attaching to it from the legislative point of view as similar legislation and, possibly every year for a number of years there will be amending Bills brought in here.  From my knowledge of the subject, I think that when money is more free and when more money is available the subject of the amendment that we were not in a position to accept though pressed by the Seanad here, <Col N="888" /> is one of the things that will receive earliest consideration when the amending legislation comes along here.</P>

    <Title>Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) (No. 2) Bill, 1935&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh) Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Six months ago the Seanad passed a temporary Bill dealing with the relief from rates to be given in the financial year that closed on 31st March last to occupiers of agricultural land.  The present Bill reproduces for the most part that measure and deals with the grant for the current year.</P>
      <P>There are, however, points of difference between the Bill now before the Seanad and last year's measure; but before referring to these it will perhaps be useful to recall the scheme that has been in operation.  Last year every occupier of agricultural land not exceeding £20 in valuation got an abatement at the same rate as was given in the financial year 1933-34 to occupiers of land not exceeding £10 valuation.  Relief at an equal rate was given on the first £20 valuation of larger holdings.  This relief was called the primary allowance. Occupiers of land not exceeding £20 in valuation got the primary allowance and nothing more.  Larger occupiers got, in addition to the primary allowance, an employment allowance or a supplementary allowance or both.</P>
      <P>The employment allowance was given where one or more men were at work on the holding and the occupier made a claim.  For each man employed an abatement was given at the primary allowance rate on £12 10s. if the occupier had so much additional valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the primary and employment allowances were paid there was a balance of the grant in every county which went to the relief of the part of the valuation above £20 in respect of which an employment allowance was not granted.  This balance was <Col N="889" /> applied by way of supplementary allowance at an equal rate over the remaining valuation.  The supplementary rate of relief was everywhere below the primary allowance rate.</P>
    <P>The present Bill makes similar arrangements with necessary changes for the current year.  The period during which a man must be employed was, last year, the nine months that ended on 31st December, 1933.  This year it is the whole of the year 1934. It might, perhaps, make the scheme clearer if I take a particular case and show how the relief is calculated.  An occupier of a farm of which the land is valued at £50 has a relative and one paid man regularly at work.  On the first £20 of the valuation he would get the primary rate of relief which differs in every county and is about 6/4 in the £ on the average.  He would get relief at the primary rate on an additional £12 10s. for his relative and also on £12 10s. for his labourer.  That means that he would get the maximum rate of relief on £45 altogether.  On the remaining £5 valuation he would get relief at the supplementary allowance rate which this year will approximate in the average case to about half of the primary rate.</P>
    <P>Now I come to the points of difference between this year's Bill and last year's.  The main difference is in the amount of the grant.  Last year the grant was £1,970,000, this year it will be £1,870,000, or £100,000 less.  I may say here that the sum of £370,000, which is mentioned in Section 4, is the amount that must be added to the sums provided under the Acts of 1898, 1925 and 1931, to make up the full grant.  The reduction this year will not affect the majority of occupiers as it will come out of the money available for the supplementary allowance. Approximately £400,000 was the cost of the supplementary allowances last year.  The share of each county has been reduced by one quarter the cost of these allowances and the effect of this will normally be to reduce the supplementary allowance rate by one quarter.  In connection with this reduction I may mention that it was never intended to maintain the <Col N="890" /> supplementary allowance rate at last year's figure and when speaking in the Dáil on last year's Bill I thought it advisable to give warning that, where employment commensurate with the valuation of the holding was not afforded, occupiers should not expect to get relief in future years at the same rate as in the initial year.</P>
    <P>The other changes are of less importance.  It is left to each county council to decide whether they will give part of the abatement by means of the issue of credit notes or not.  The part that can be given in this way approximates to about 2/- in the £ on the specified valuation, which means that ordinarily the credit note will amount to £1 approximately on each moiety if the valuation is £20 or over and proportionately less for lower valuations.  The credit notes expire on 31st October and 31st March, but the council is given power, if they use credit notes, to extend the time in which the first moiety note can be tendered and accepted by three months and, in the case of the second, by one month.  The purpose of the credit note is to offer an inducement to early payment and penalise delay. If the period in which it can be availed of is extended too far the credit note does not fulfil any purpose. Last year credit notes were in some counties issued for very large amounts and for that reason I have not refused consent to any council that wished to extend the period in which they could be realised.  This year the amounts are strictly limited in amount and I think there should be some definite time within which they should be realised if they are to be of any use.</P>
    <P>Urban districts that are entitled to participate in the grant will be treated in the same manner as last year, that is, they will get from county councils the same as they got in 1933 and, in addition, whatever is necessary to bring the rate of relief in the district, on the first £20, up to the primary rate of relief in the county.  There are 22 of these urban districts, all of which have been created or extended since the Act of 1898 was passed and <Col N="891" /> are for that reason getting a share of the grant.</P>
    <P>If the share going to a county is reduced to a sum below the amount of the grant fixed in the Bill, as has happened owing to the operation of the Guarantee Fund, the shares of the urban districts in the county will be proportionately reduced.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a temporary measure applying only to the present year. When it will be possible to bring forward a permanent measure I cannot say, though I am not without hope that the next Bill will cover more than a single year.  For six years in succession the grant has varied, some years upwards and some downwards, and I am afraid it cannot be assumed it has yet settled at a fixed figure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not much to say in the way of criticism of this Bill.  While I do not understand all its ramifications, I understand that our rates will be increased by something like 20 per cent. this year, and that the Government has reduced the Agricultural Grant by £100,000. When the last Government was in office a supplementary grant of £750,000 was given for the relief of farmers.  The members of the present Government were then in Opposition and they denounced the Government of that day for the niggardly manner in which they were treating farmers.  They proposed that the amount should be at least £1,000,000, but it was not carried.  The present Government came into office the next year and they granted £1,000,000 for that year but cut it down the two following years.  The grant was increased last year, but with this year's reduction the total amount is £300,000 less than it was when the last Government was denounced for being so niggardly. That is one thing which the Minister should explain.  Are farmers in a better position now than they were in 1931, when the then Opposition said that at least £1,000,000 should be granted for the relief of farmers?  The Government <Col N="892" /> is making great bones about the allowance that is being given to farmers who give employment.  The amount is not very much, and does not represent more than one week's wages of an agricultural labourer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My principal reason in intervening now is to try to induce the Minister to agree to accept an amendment of the Bill on the next Stage, which would grant some relief to farmers who hold land in fee simple.  One of the main objects of the 1933 Land Act was to give relief to farmers, by reducing the annuities by 50 per cent.  At that time I pointed out that many farmers who hold in fee simple were suffering from the depression, and were in the same bad position as farmers who pay annuities, but I was not successful in having the Act amended.  I had some discussion with the Minister for Local Government on the question, and this is an opportune time for introducing an amendment to deal with that position.  During the Great War years and previously, some farmers who had saved money went to the Land Commission and purchased the fee simple of their holdings.  Some of them borrowed money from the banks and are paying interest which is larger than the amount of annuities that ordinary tenants have to pay to the Land Commission.  Under previous Land Acts farmers could only borrow from banks ten times the value of the annuity.  That was all that the banks were allowed to advance on the security of the land. Where farmers wanted large advances they bought the fee simple of their holdings, and the banks were then in a position to hold the land as security for repayment of their money.  As a result, many landholders are paying more in interest than is being paid by other farmers as annuities to the Land Commission. Farmers who bought in fee simple have suffered just as much as farmers who are paying annuities, and in justice and in equity they should get some relief, especially as the annuities have been reduced to half the original amount.  The number of <Col N="893" /> farmers that would be affected by the amendment that I suggest would not be very great and there would be no loss to the Government.  As a matter of justice and fair play the case of these men should be considered, and on the Committee Stage I intend to move an amendment to that effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are outstanding features of this Bill that it might be no harm to bring to the attention of the House and the Minister.  The first is that the amount of the grant is £100,000 less than it was last year, and that, compared with the financial year 1931-32, it is about £78,000 less. It must be borne in mind that last year's warrant was £775,000 greater than the warrant for 1931-32 and that. in addition, £718,000 were retained on account of unpaid annuities.  Consequently, the burden on the ratepayers under the régime of this Government is much heavier than in 1931-32.  The Government must bear a good deal of the responsibility, because they have imposed a lot of rates through statutory legislation which falls on the local authorities. In addition, it must be borne in mind that there has been a complete reversal of policy.  At one time the policy of this Government was derating.  We were told that the land annuities when retained would be used for the purpose of giving complete derating.  I suggest that there was never more necessity for derating than now, in order to give some relief from the great charges that have been imposed on ratepayers since 1931-32. We were told that the section of one Land Act dealing with employment allowance aimed at giving increased employment.  Between 1932 and 1934 the increased employment of farm labourers affected only 1,600 persons. I submit that the tremendous financial burdens that have been imposed on farmers are not at all commensurate with the number of labourers that have been employed, having regard to the fact that the sons and daughters of farmers are ineffectively employed; in other <Col N="894" /> words, are looking at each other on farms where they are trying to subsist. The Government should try to reverse the present policy.  This Bill is totally unacceptable.  It should also be mentioned that the arrears of rates last year amounted to £1,000,000 owing to the distress amongst necessitous farmers.  The responsibility for that state of affairs must be borne largely by the Government, because they introduced measures during the last few years that made it impossible for farmers to earn what would pay the rates.  Now, the grant given by the Government has been reduced by £100,000, while the rates warrant is £750,000 more than what it was.  The troubles that farmers have to contend with in the way of selling their produce, and paying their way, are due to the inflated charges that they have to meet, because this Government did not take the opportunity to revise these charges, though the market that made it economic to carry on has been destroyed.</P>
      <P>In his opening remarks the Minister stated that that provision was only temporary and that in the course of time it would be withdrawn. Farmers who would be entitled to an allowance under this Bill are the largest employers of labour. The people in the greatest need are those who employ agricultural labourers, men and women, who receive no reward from the State. There are no people in greater distress than those who were in receipt of that supplementary allowance, as they employed agricultural labourers. I think conditions have made it impossible and intolerable for farmers to carry on.  Things that are intolerable will have to be resisted.  It is possible to expect that people will resist.  That is my honest view of people who are trying to carry on and to secure what will rear their families.  It is quite natural for them to resist when they find it impossible to carry on and when the Government has taken all means of carrying on a livelihood from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that it is undesirable that it should be necessary <Col N="895" /> to have a Bill every year fixing the amount of the Agricultural Grant because that makes it very easy for the Government to reduce the amount of the grant.  If we had permanent legislation fixing a particular sum and the Government had to introduce a Bill to reduce the amount, the reduction would not be so readily effected. As matters are, we have a reduction of £100,000 this year.  I did not read the debates in the Dáil carefully but, in the Minister's statement here, no justification of the reduction was offered.  The £100,000 is simply cut off from the farmers, as it were, by the stroke of a pen.  If the Minister speaks again, I should be interested to hear his justification of the reduction of the grant this year.  The Minister told us that the reduction comes chiefly off the Supplementary Grant.  He is quite correct in saying that he indicated previously that the intention was that the Supplementary Grant should be gradually reduced.  If the Supplementary Grant is to be reduced, there is no reason why the Minister should not make provision for some increase in the primary grant by whatever method is thought best or why he should not make some increase in the Employment Grant.  It has been already admitted in this House on behalf of the Government&mdash;the matter was referred to again to-day&mdash;that the amount of the Employment Grant is so small that, at best, it is only a gesture.  It can have no effect, while it is at its present level, in inducing any farmer to give employment.  I cannot imagine that the amount available for any farmer who is wavering between giving employment and not giving employment would induce him to take on an extra man.  When I referred to this matter before, the Minister admitted that the grant was only a gesture.  He indicated that, as time went on, the intention of the Government was to make it more than a gesture.  If there is any reason for it at all, it ought not to be continued as a gesture.  While a gesture may produce certain reactions when first made, if it continues to be little more <Col N="896" /> than a gesture, it is not going to have any effect.  If the Minister felt that it was necessary, in pursuance of his policy, that the Supplementary Grant should be reduced, the proper course to take would have been to transfer the £100,000 to the Employment Grant so as to make it at least a trifle more substantial than it is.  The Minister indicated to-day that this was not the last of these Bills&mdash;that the amount of the Agricultural Grant had not settled down at permanent level.  I am afraid that that can only be taken as an indication that it is intended to make further reductions in the amount provided for the relief of rates on agricultural land.  Nothing in the position of agriculture of which one hears would indicate that it is fair or reasonable to reduce the Agricultural Grant at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred briefly to the draws on the Guarantee Fund.  Even if we assume that the necessity for draws on the Guarantee Fund arises through the fault of farmers who do not pay when they could pay without difficulty, even if we assume that their not paying is an anti-social act, the fact remains that when a draw takes place on the Guarantee Fund the farmer who has paid has his rates increased because of the reduction of the amount that comes to the councils.  Seeing that the draw was so big last year and that the indications are that it will be big this year, it seems to be specially hard for the Minister to reduce the total of the Agricultural Grant and, therefore, add something to the increase that is being put on the rates of those farmers who have managed to pay their land annuities and who are suffering because others have not managed to pay.  I hope the Minister will alter his view on the question of permanency.  I think that it is very bad for the councils and for everybody concerned that there should be uncertainty as to the amount of the Agricultural Grant.  Agriculture, in the general opinion, is an industry in which rapid changes cannot be made &mdash;an industry in which there is a certain element of stability and permanence. I think that there ought to be <Col N="897" /> stability in the amount of the Agricultural Grant.  Whatever amount the Government is prepared to give should be set out in a permanent Bill, so that councils would know what they would receive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very great disappointment at the decision of the Minister to reduce the grant for the relief of rates on agricultural land by £100,000 as compared with the grant for last year.  Senator Blythe has put the Minister a very direct question and we should like to know the Minister's justification for this reduction which, we feel, is unjust.  If the position be that the money cannot be made available or is not forthcoming from another Ministry, that is an answer, but we will not accept it as a justification for this decision. In other years, in discussing the problem of rates on agricultural land, it used to be urged that the rates levied on the farmer and the services for which he was called upon to pay should be considered from the point of view as to whether these services were local or national&mdash;whether or not they were of value to him as an occupier of land.  I am afraid we are getting very far, indeed, from the considerations which were in the minds of people some years ago.  When we recollect that members of the Ministry urged very strongly at that period that a policy of complete derating ought to be pursued in connection with agriculture, it is little wonder that our farmers to-day are disappointed and very pessimistic as to the future.  The treatment they are being given is very far from what they anticipated it would be.  The Minister will, no doubt, take credit for the fact that local services in every county are being developed.  Nobody will find fault with a policy which will bring the requisite amenities to towns and rural districts to make life more tolerable. But when one considers the conditions in rural Ireland to-day, when one remembers that a great many of the Minister's new schemes can only be put into operation in towns and villages by imposing additional rates on the occupiers of agricultural land <Col N="898" /> up to a point beyond the capacity of these people to pay, one is inclined to question the wisdom and the justice of the policy being pursued by the Minister, however valuable in its ultimate effect that policy may be.  In every county we have all sorts of new schemes &mdash; housing schemes, water schemes, sanitation schemes, and so on.  They are all admirable in their results.  While they are being carried out they are giving much-needed employment.  To a degree they are creating a position where we have that sort of inflation that gives the appearance of prosperity, but which in reality is not justified, because it is not lasting.  All that is only being done, and can only be done, by imposing to-day and to-morrow and in the future additional burdens on the dwellers on agricultural land beyond what they have been accustomed to carry in the past; burdens greater than those carried by them in the days before the present Minister occupied his position in Local Government.  In those days the Minister believed, with his colleagues, that the farmers' rates were too high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will not challenge the truth of my statement that all his new schemes can be made operative only by raising the rates on agricultural land, so that land will make its contribution towards the fund that is created under the Minister's legislation to carry out those new schemes. The farmer is supposed to be really the most conservative individual in the whole community.  There may be justification for making such an allegation against him.  But we have to remember the conditions under which farmers have to try to live.  The farmer feels bound to throw up his defences.  He finds a great mass of opinion always ready to attack him; to pass the burdens on to him where they can be passed on from the other sections of the community.  He is standing with his back to the wall and cannot pass them on to anyone else.  It is reasonable that the farmer should, as a whole, be a rather conservative type of individual.  He may have opposed in the past policies that might have <Col N="899" /> made for better conditions in our towns and in the country generally.  But he did so, we believe, because he felt that most of the paying was going to be done by him and he could not see that he was going to get any great value from these new services that were being created.</P>
    <P>The Minister's net contribution to the carrying out of his new policy this year is to withhold from the farmers £100,000 which he gave to them last year.  That is not an incentive to the representatives of the farmers to come forward with new schemes in their counties.  In the present circumstances, to withhold £100,000 from agriculture is not helping it along through its difficulties, and is unjustifiable. Ministers generally admit that the farmers are passing through a most difficult period.  They are urging, when they get the opportunity to speak to the public, that the farmers need help and co-operation from other sections of the community, if they are to be helped through their difficulties and put on to firmer ground.  The Minister's contribution is not the way to give that help.  I think it is admitted, whatever may be happening here and there, that as far as local services are concerned, and as far as the farmer is concerned in making his contribution through his rates, he is doing it like a man.  He is doing his best in every county to pay his rates. Goodness only knows the difficulties that many of our farmers are encountering to-day in finding the money for the rate collector when he comes along.  Notwithstanding all that, there are very considerable arrears of rates accumulating in the country generally.  These arrears are being carried forward from one year to another.  I do not know the figure at which they stand at present, but I presume the Minister will be able to let us have the figure.</P>
    <P>In addition to these arrears, which have to be met some time, and which to-day are being met in one way or another by overdrafts from the banks at not very low rates of interest, there are other arrears accumulating in the <Col N="900" /> matter of land annuities.  The Minister has repeated that it is the policy, where land annuities are not being paid, that moneys from the Guarantee Fund will not be available in the shape of grants for the relief of rates on agricultural land.  If there ever was a case, if there ever was justification for an examination of the position, there is justification on the statement which the Minister made.  If it is to be the continued policy of the Government to withhold these moneys and not pass them on to the county councils in the shape of relief of rates on agricultural land, the Minister and the Executive Council ought to be satisfied that the arrears are accumulating and the moneys not being paid into the land annuities fund because men cannot pay them and will not pay them.</P>
    <P>I suggest seriously to the Minister that the arrears of land annuities are creating a problem for all of us, for himself as Minister for Local Government and for the Executive Council generally, that it would be well for the country to have tackled and examined at once.  If the present position continues, the Guarantee Fund is going to be in such a position that very little money will be available from it towards the relief of rates.  If, on the other hand, the payment of rates in the counties is becoming increasingly difficult, by what means are our local services going to be maintained?</P>
    <P>It is my view that the land annuities fund is in the position in which it is to-day because of the difficulties through which our farmers are passing and in spite of which they are trying to exist.  These difficulties are not going to be overcome either by ignoring them or by suggesting that the farmers are creating them for themselves. The Minister's policy of withholding the grants, which local ratepayers believe ought to be paid to the county councils, is not a wise policy.  We believe that the Minister ought to alter the law by introducing into this Bill a section which would change the present position which makes it possible to withhold from the county councils the grants which they <Col N="901" /> believe are due to them merely because the farmers in these counties find themselves unable to pay their land annuities.  The position is that the farmers are unable to pay and, because they are unable to pay, the Minister decides that the local ratepayers must be taxed more highly to find the balance which the Minister ought to supply.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to amend the law or if he is not prepared to amend the law he ought to examine the position, and he ought to satisfy himself whether on grounds of equity his policy is justified.  Many of us believe, honestly and genuinely, that if there was the type of investigation which we believe could be carried out, there are facts to prove that the situation is so serious that, in this respect particularly, the Minister's policy should be altered.  We believe that if the facts were brought home, as they would be brought home, to the Executive Council by an impartial investigation, the Executive Council would decide that their policy should be altered.  The Minister can do either of two things in this Bill.  He can amend the Bill or he can alter the present position by altering the law. If that be not done, little wonder that the farmers of the country will feel that they are not getting a square deal.  You cannot make any man feel that he is getting a square deal if you call on him to pay charges that are ever growing higher while at the same time he finds himself in the position that the price of the commodities he has to sell is ever getting lower.</P>

      <P>The reduction of £100,000 in this grant is one which the Government ought to explain.  As the Seanad knows the term &ldquo;Agricultural Grant&rdquo; is a misnomer.  It is not a grant at all.  It is simply a payment from the Exchequer to meet the debit which is placed on the farmer to pay for services which he does not receive. The cost of these services is debited to the farmer in his rates and the sum of money which is called a grant is the amount which the Government has to pay for the services, the cost of which as I say is debited to the farmer <Col N="902" /> although he receives no benefit from them.  I was a little bit surprised by the remarks which Senator Blythe addressed to the Minister regarding this grant, especially when he asked the Minister why legislation was not introduced to make this grant a special fixed sum yearly.  Senator Blythe was just as big an obstacle in the farmers' eyes to the payment of these agricultural grants as the present Minister for Finance, and although the farmers had a period of prosperity under his régime, we were always under the impression that the rights of the case were that farms should be derated on the merits and on the equities.  That proposal, however, was turned down, and I am surprised that Senator Blythe should ask the Minister why this amount is not made a fixed amount by legislation so that we should not have these variations from year to year, because he was ten years at the job and he did not finish it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister how we stand this year in respect of the amounts which were deducted from the grant last year because of the nonpayment of annuities which have since been collected and paid into the fund. I should like to know whether any credit has been allowed for these amounts and how they balance with the amounts deducted this year owing to the short payment of annuities.  As between the two sums, do we gain anything this year?  Has there been a greater sum collected than has been cut off?  If we stand fairly level I will be satisfied.  I must say that in these times it is very difficult for the farmers to pay up for their neighbours' delinquencies, especially since Ministers themselves preach the doctrine to everybody: &ldquo;Oh, the farmers are in a depressed condition; help them along and give them a good price for their commodities.&rdquo;  Yet the Minister in this Bill docks our allowance by £100,000.  I call that lip sympathy or deceptive publicity, if you like, but it is very bad for the farmer. Just imagine our position.  The returns from everything we have to sell are only 80 per cent. of pre-war prices.  That means that we are only <Col N="903" /> getting 16/- in the £ on pre-war prices while our expenses have increased enormously.  The official cost-of-living figure is returned at 154, showing an increase of 50 per cent. over pre-war, but we know that many items of the farmers' outlay have increased considerably more.  Wages, for instance, are 100 per cent. over the pre-war figure.  How the Ministry should consider that the farming community can exist under conditions of that sort while they dock £100,000 off the Agricultural Grant, puzzles me.</P>
    <P>I have said that the farmers are getting only 80 per cent. of the pre-war price for their produce.  Everybody knows that the money realised from the sale of cattle represented the largest share of the farmers' income. The stipulated price for cattle, which we never get, is now supposed to be 22/- per cwt.  You may take it that the actual price is about 18/-.  Contrast that price with the price of 32/- or 33/- per cwt. pre-war.  That shows a bigger reduction than 20 per cent. on pre-war prices.  Conditions such as that are shaking the financial institutions of the State and unless they are remedied we shall have to face some very hard times.  We farmers, who are determined to carry on as best we can, are up against a very bad position and I am sorry that the Minister should be so ignorant of the true condition of things as to reduce this year's Agricultural Grant by £100,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to minimise the conditions under which the farmers have to live, but I think they seem to be a little bit selfish.  The farmers are not the entire community. They are really the producers of the raw material which has to be handled by other members of the community before it becomes the finished article. In my opinion, there is a big section of the community who have much greater grievances to bear than the farmers have.  I am not at all insensible to the difficulties attached to existence on the land at the present time, but, as against these difficulties, the farmers have got many concessions in <Col N="904" /> recent years.  The land annuities have been halved and they are getting bounties and subsidies on almost every crop that they grow.  There is a very big section of the community living in the towns and villages of the country who have not got any concessions at all.  It is a natural thing to assume that, as the farmers have got all the land of the country in their possession, they are the producers of the entire wealth of the country.  If they are, and if the return from the produce which they have to sell has decreased by 40 or 50 per cent., it is also quite reasonable to assume that the income of town dwellers who have to live on the farmers, has decreased proportionately. But how are these town dwellers treated?  Have their rents been halved?  Certainly not.  Their rates have been increased, their income tax has grown enormously, and the property tax, as calculated on the valuation of their houses, has been increased by 25 per cent. this year.  In every way the town dweller has got the worst end of the bargain and he has to pay more than his share towards the bounties and subsidies which have been granted to the farmers.</P>
      <P>I should like to see the farmers in a prosperous condition but, while the present difficulties, due to world depression, last, let us try to bear them equally.  Let us not have all the complaints from one side because there is another big section of the community that is suffering even more.  I would advise the farmers to do the best they can, like all other sections of the community until better times arrive.  It is a most depressing thing to sit here and listen to the same old statements and the same old speeches about the farmers' sufferings while there are others suffering equally, who say nothing but carry on to the best of their ability under grave difficulties, grave restrictions and at great loss to their families.  Still, they are willing to bear the burden while the fight is being pursued, not on behalf of one section, but on behalf of the community as a whole.</P>

      <P>I only wish to say a very few words, but I think we have <Col N="905" /> listened to a typical Fianna Fáil speech just now and, for one thing, I want to deny, as I think we ought to deny every time we hear this falsehood, that the farmers have been allowed off half their annuities, when, as a matter of fact, they have paid their annuities three times.  We have heard an extraordinary statements to the effect that the people in the towns are bearing a share of this burden.  If they are, it is only by way of a reflection from what the farmers are suffering and passing it on to them.  Everybody knows that the towns in the country depend entirely on the prosperity of the farmers in the surrounding districts for their own prosperity.  I deny that the towns are paying more than the farmers themselves for the subsidies and so on&mdash;a very small portion of which is reaching the farmers.  In any case, these subsidies are not worth mentioning when you think of the great losses that have been brought about directly by the Government policy.  This question has been very fully threshed out by other Senators, and so I do not wish to say more, but I simply want to deny the allegation that the farmers are being relieved in any way by these subsidies, and so on. They are very small, in any case, and some of them do not even reach the farmer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senator Honan is rightly accused of making a typical Fianna Fáil speech, I feel sure that no such accusation can be levelled against me.  We have heard this old tale about the land annuities having been paid three or four times from practically every speaker to-day, and we have heard it on many other occasions during the last few years.  In that connection, I do not mind repeating what I said last week which was to the effect that, while I have sympathy with people who are genuinely distressed, I have no sympathy at all with the type of people who refuse to pay and who are jumping on their hind legs to pay the sheriff.  Senator Honan seems to have absorbed a lot of this talk that has been handed out by members of the Opposition, and I am inclined to <Col N="906" /> think that the Senator believes that these people are representative of the farming community of this country. They are not representative of the farming community of the country.  As we go along, it is daily becoming more and more evident that there are two sections of farmers in the country, and that the two sections, while they may not be definitely opposed politically to one another, are represented in this House by people who are definitely opposed to one another politically.</P>
      <P>This question of full derating on agricultural land has been thrown up to us here to-day as seemingly the last line trenches of the United Ireland Party.  Now, that Party, at their recent Ard-Fheis, I understand, discussed this question of full derating and, so far as I am aware, they were not able to get a majority on the question of full derating of agricultural land.  I dare say that they, as well as we, have gone thoroughly into this question of the full derating of agricultural land; but, in any case, it is pretty evident to anybody who has carefully examined this question that a policy of full derating, while it would definitely benefit one section of the farming community, would just as definitely injure another section of the farming community.  Fully 75 per cent. of the holdings in the entire Free State are under £15 valuation, and every one of these holdings under £15 valuation would lose by a system of full derating of agricultural land.  That class includes everybody from the cottier to the man with a few acres, and on up through the holdings of larger valuation until you come to the man with a holding of £15 valuation.  The man with the holding of £15 valuation would probably work out about even, and the fellow with a valuation of over £15 would gain, in proportion to the size of his holding, by a system of full derating. It is quite evident that Senator Dillon was referring to that, and the same applies to the other speakers who have dealt to-day with this question of the full derating of agricultural land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that the members of the Opposition were a little bit shortsighted <Col N="907" /> and that Senator Wilson and Senator Blythe should have foreseen this position, and that they should have taken the necessary steps to see that Fianna Fáil would not be handed a stick with which to beat the Opposition. However, they handed that and other sticks to Fianna Fáil and, apparently, they do not like an occasional little tip of the stick which is now in the hands of the Fianna Fáil Government.  It is possible that if they had full derating of agricultural land they might be a little more successful in the campaign for non-payment of the annuities.  They might be able to get on in that way, but the farmers, in a great number of cases, have realised by now that they have been ruined by this policy of non-payment of annuities.  They realise now that that campaign is going to react on themselves, and that if they do not pay their annuities their default will have to be made up in the rates. I am sure that that is having a pretty bad effect on the policy of Fine Gael through the country, and I can sympathise with the people who are trying to bolster up that policy.  I think it was Senator Dillon who said that this measure, which provides for the relief of agriculture in proportion to the amount of employment given on the land, was totally unacceptable to the farming community.  I can quite understand its being unacceptable to a man with a few hundred acres of land who never employed more than one or two men on his land; but if the Senator says that that is applicable to the farmers of this country as a whole, I wish to say that that is incorrect.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that it is very acceptable to such men as have been employing men on their land for a considerable number of years.  It is very acceptable to such a man to find that now, at long last, a Government has come into power which is prepared to place a premium on industry and not, as heretofore, on idleness.  The policy indicated by the various speakers who are opposed to this Bill is that of placing a premium on idleness and a penalty on industry, <Col N="908" /> because you cannot possibly put a man who is giving generous employment on his land on the same footing as a man who is giving little or no employment.  It is an extraordinary state of affairs to find Senator Blythe and other speakers coming along and saying that this thing is only a gesture and that it did not amount to anything.  If it is only a gesture, and if the amount involved is so insignificant, why all the row about it?  I, as a farmer, appreciate what is being done.  I appreciate the fact that, with the development of our agricultural policy, not alone are we going to encourage the provision of markets for our produce but that we are to be compensated, in so far as it is possible to do so, in the amount of employment to be given on our farms. I believe that, far from its being unacceptable to the farming community as a whole, it will be very acceptable to the farming community, of whom 75 per cent. have holdings under £15 valuation.  I believe it will be appreciated through the country, as the various other measures are appreciated by the majority of the people of this country, as a definite effort to distribute the weight as evenly as possible amongst every section of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>After the speech we have heard, I feel inclined to ask, paraphrasing the old question, &ldquo;Is this a private debate for farmers or can anybody join in?&rdquo;  I am not a farmer; I know nothing about farming. It is about the only slice of luck I ever had in my life, except listening to speeches such as that we have just listened to and the one which came from Senator Honan.  It is to be hoped the Minister, when replying, has a better defence for his Bill than <Col N="909" /> any that has fallen from the two Senators who support the Government here to-day.  Could anything be more melancholy, more saddening or more disillusioning than the wail of Senator Honan, whose home town, mind you, is very near to the throne? He comes from that part of the country which returned to the Dáil the present President of the Executive Council and with such close association to the powers deciding the present, and likely to decide the future, of the country, we have from Senator Honan only a melancholy appeal to help the townsmen who have embarked on a fight which, judging by the tone in which Senator Honan expressed his words, must be a very badly losing fight.</P>
      <P>As to Senator Quirke's speech, it is idle to attempt to get a single point from it on which to build a concrete idea or argument.  I think the statement with which the Minister initiated this discussion was one the implications of which it was very difficult to grasp.  It would have to be read and considered in detail before one could grasp exactly its implications; but the one chief item in this Bill which has figured most in the discussion so far is that the Government are defaulting in the payment of rates to the extent of £100,000.  That is precisely what it amounts to, and the effect of this Bill is to increase the rates for local services by £100,000.  What effect is that going to have, and, above all, how can the Government justify it?  So far as I could follow the trend of the Minister's observations in sponsoring this Bill, there was no attempt either to explain or to justify the reduction of this grant in relief of local rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal of stress has been laid by several speakers on this side upon the Government's previous assurances of derating and their present policy. I remember when the Finance Bill was being discussed here I made some similar reference, and Senator MacEllin, who is not here to-day, interjected that no responsible member of the Fianna Fáil Party promised derating.  I had not the exact authority with me at the time and, therefore, <Col N="910" /> I could make only a tentative denial, but I have this extract from a statement by one whom, I think, Senator MacEllin would be slow to define as irresponsible:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The over-head charges of the farmers are too heavy for them and must be lightened.  One of the heaviest of these charges is the burden of local rates.  We propose to derate agricultural holdings.  They are derated in Britain and in the Six Counties.  £2,000,000 of the £3,000,000 unjustly taken from us every year in land annuities will suffice for this derating.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement was made at an interview by Mr. de Valera with a representative of the <i>News Chronicle</i> and published in the <i>Irish Press</i> on 18th February, 1932.  Is that an irresponsible statement?  Is that a statement from an irresponsible person?  I have here even a more interesting statement. The Minister, speaking in the Dáil on this measure, referred to Westmeath. He was dealing with the alleged campaign to prevent the payment of annuities and rates.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Take the latest illustration, the County Westmeath.  It was the most backward of the Twenty-Six Counties in the payment of its rates. Then, when the county council was got rid of, and a Commissioner appointed, the rates came in without the asking.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In 1930, there was an election in Longford-Westmeath, and here is a leaflet published on behalf of the Fianna Fáil candidate which gives certain interesting figures and make certain interesting statements.  It says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Free State Government takes from Longford as land annuities and sends to England each year £57,466, and from Westmeath £419,822, a total of £177,288, so that if the Government elected by the people would only stand by the rights of the people&mdash;rights admitted to be theirs by British Statute&mdash;the farmers, householders, shopkeepers of Longford-Westmeath need not pay one penny in the rates.  The land <Col N="911" /> annuities would do the whole thing and leave £30,000 over to aid agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator MacEllin would probably say that that was not the statement of any responsible Party, but that is the dope that got the Fianna Fáil candidate elected and the dope primarily responsible for getting the Fianna Fáil Government elected to control of this country.  To-day, however, that is all to be disclaimed, and to-day Senator Quirke wants to show how inequitable to one section of the community, the farmers, full derating would be.</P>

      <P>This matter of the land annuities is a very serious one and will not be settled merely by interchanges of this kind.  I should like to say a few words in reference to what Senator Baxter stated.  The acrimonious aspect of this question and the fact that it is playing havoc with the morale of public life is a very serious matter.  The question of the land annuities and the reduction of moneys to public bodies which would normally go to the relief of rates, and which are deducted in consequence of the so-called non-payment of the land annuities, is having a very serious effect upon the public life of the country.  I raised this matter on the Finance Bill, and other Senators, including Senator Baxter, referred to it.  They pointed out that the equity of the matter should be enquired into. I believe there is a prima facie case in justification of those who say that Saorstát Eireann has no right to collect one penny of these annuities for the purpose of general Exchequer revenue, whilst the amount originally arranged and agreed upon, is being <Col N="912" /> paid by the purchasing tenants and is being collected by the British Government. I suggest that this matter is not disposed of by requests or suggestions that the people should take that point of view, and act upon it, and refuse to pay the land annuities. All that they complain of and all that is behind their attitude, is not going to be swept aside or disposed of by the flippant reference that under the machinery which the British Exchequer has devised to collect the moneys the farmer is paying more than the full amount which would normally be paid in the form of land annuities, and for the purpose of clearing off the land annuities.  That is incontestable. No one will deny that every penny that is going to the British Ministry, to be utilised to pay off the commitments of the land annuities, is being paid by the farmer.  Is there anyone who will deny that?  The question the farmer asks is this: That being so, is it just or equitable that they, the farmers, should be asked to contribute another 50 per cent in the form of land annuities to the Free State Exchequer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the Minister, dealing in a sort of elusive way with this matter, said &ldquo;the law is the law.&rdquo;  That may be so.  But I certainly agree with Senator Baxter that this matter should be enquired into.  The equity of the matter should be enquired into, and the effect of the whole transaction upon the morale of public life should be enquired into.  And if there is some basis for the contention that I am trying to express, and if the law, as the Minister says, is there, then I say it should be altered in the regular way.  Meantime the one fact the agricultural community have to consider, in regard to this Bill, is that in spite of all those splendid conditions which the Fianna Fáil Party promised to bring to pass, once it got into office, there has been, as far as this Bill is concerned, a definite, substantial, and serious increase in the burden which the agricultural community have to bear.  I do not expect that the Minister can give judgment upon these matters <Col N="913" /> that I have raised.  Senator Colonel Moore need not be apprehensive that I have raised these matters for the purpose of trying to assail his pet theory.  I am not discussing the matter that originally gave rise to the question of equity or otherwise of the land annuities.  I am only emphasising this point, and I want to conclude upon it, so that it will remain in the mind of the Minister: That no matter what be the equity as to the collection of the land annuities, the fact remains that these annuities are being collected by Britain, and until the dispute is settled between Britain and Saorstát Eireann, there is no moral right here as far as I can judge, to collect one penny of these annuities from the farmers.  That is the contention I put up, and it is the contention I should like to see examined.  If it can be rebutted it should be rebutted. If it cannot be rebutted, and if it stands as incontrovertible, then I say it should not be swept aside as a triviality, because it is, in fact, a very serious matter and should receive very serious treatment at the hands of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that this Bill varies from Bills that have preceded it in certain matters, and that such Bills will vary very likely from time to time as the necessity arises.  There is, I think, perhaps, no harm, without speaking directly to this particular Bill, to speak a little generally of such Bills, as they have been, and will be in the future.  There are two ways in which Bills brought in in the last two or three years vary from the custom known before.  One of these is a differentiation between small farmers and large farmers, and the second is a differentiation in the question of the employment of workers. First, with regard to the small farmers with a valuation of £10 or £15, I do not speak of these at all.  These people, to my mind, are more a matter for charitable consideration than anything else and they certainly are not suitable from the point of view of imposing taxation because they are at a decided disadvantage and hardly anybody <Col N="914" /> will dispute that.  It is certainly undesirable that the poor people who live in very bad cottages should be taxed.</P>
      <P>The question that next arises is a more difficult one and that is the question of the employment of labour, or rather the allowance to farmers who employ labourers to work their farms. It seems difficult to understand why they should be included.  There are farms suitable for the employment of labour and, on the other hand, many farms are unsuitable from this point of view.  Why should a man with a bad farm, a farm unsuitable for tillage, be differentiated against as compared with a man who has a fine, flourishing tillage farm?  He is already in the possession of much more valuable property. He is in a position of security and possibly makes considerable sums of money out of the employment of people.  He is all the better off because he employs them.  I know places in Clare where the holdings contain little but barren patches and rocky ground.  It is largely used by farmers for the grazing of sheep, but that does not require a large number of workers. The land is not very valuable, but the owner makes something out of it through the grazing of sheep.  It seems rather strange that that type of man should be taxed more than the man with the fine, rich farm, living almost beside him.  I think that is a matter that ought seriously to be considered because it is really deserving of consideration. Perhaps the Minister could explain in what way the existing condition of things has come about.  I know that the matter has already been discussed, but there was never an attempt to answer it.  I would like some reason given why a man with rocky and barren land should be charged more than the person who occupies a holding of fine, cultivable land.</P>

      <P>The limits of Second Reading debates are sometimes elastic, and this one is no exception.  As the debate here has taken the form of an assertion by certain farming Senators that the farming section of the community are worse hit than other <Col N="915" /> sections in those bad times and are more in need of relief and that, therefore, this Bill is inadequate and should be amended, and counter-assertions on the part of other Senators who are not farming Senators to the effect that the farming community are not by any means the worst off, that there are people far worse off and that this is a selfish move on the part of farming Senators, I feel that I should like to make my views on the matter clear. I am not a professional farmer, but at the same time I am not entirely ignorant of the subject or of the position of the farming community as related to the rest of the community.  My view is that this is an agricultural country and that nothing, however artificial and however hard driven, will make it otherwise without disaster.  Farming is the true source of our national wealth; all else really hangs upon it. I consider farmers are worse hit than anybody else and that more hangs on them.</P>
      <P>The fact that a very large proportion of the agricultural endeavour of the country is being carried on and has been carried on at a loss for a considerable time is, to my mind, by far the more serious aspect of the national economic position, because everything else hangs on it and it is only by artificial means we can disguise it, and that only for a time.  Relief of rates or any other form of relief is no real cure; it is only a sort of alleviation. The cure is the restoration of the markets which we used to have and which we might have now if they had not been deliberately thrown away.  If by that means you arrive at a reasonable measure of prosperity for our farming community, all else will follow and we would not hear so much of relief being wanted by every other section.  I recognise that that is unrealisable at the moment, that it is not practical politics at the moment, but as the economic situation is being reviewed generally, I feel justified in saying that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those farmer Senators who have argued that this Bill is inadequate and that more relief ought to be given to <Col N="916" /> the farming community, are justified in their statements and that is the only attitude they can adopt.  The position of a great many farmers is, through no fault of their own, quite desperate.  If Senators introduce amendments on the Committee Stage, and if those amendments recommend themselves to me, I shall feel disposed to support them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one subject that has been referred to frequently in this debate, and that is the question of the land annuities and the non-payment of them.  The opinion has been expressed that this is a matter that really requires investigation.  I would like to say a few words to that effect, because it certainly does seem to be a matter which ought to be investigated. First and foremost, I do not know where the truth lies as to why these annuities are not being paid.  The Government adopt a certain line of policy and have taken and are taking certain action.  They are taking very harsh action, indeed, in the way of seizing farming stock and everything of that kind and selling it off, leaving the farmer without any stock for his land. Then there are statements that that stock, although it will not be sold back to the owner at a certain price, is sold by the Government, who make quite a lot of money out of the transaction. These statements are injurious to the farming community and to the Government. I think it would be advisable to have some inquiry held to decide whether the farmers who are not paying their annuities are not paying them because they have not got the money and cannot pay them, or whether there is any combination not to pay the annuities which are due and which the farmers can pay.  It is a very serious matter concerning a very large number of inhabitants.  I think it is a matter that an interested committee could inquire into, and they could find out where the truth lies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is this other disputed point that Senator Milroy is dealing with.  It is a very complicated point&mdash; the application of the land annuities that are collected by the present Government.  The idea, I think, that <Col N="917" /> lies in Senator Milroy's mind is that these land annuities should be applied, but in some way dealing with the British claims.  The present Government have definitely stated that they took the payment of those land annuities over to themselves without any obligation whatever as regards the British people, that they were going to use them for their own purpose, and apparently they have done so.  But they have released a large amount of them, half of them without asking anybody's leave, good, bad or indifferent, and whatever other amount they have collected they have, I believe, applied it to whatever expenditure they considered advisable.  But certainly the one thing to which the money has never been put is the payment of the debt which the British people claim from this country.</P>
    <P>The great grievance of the farmers is that by having taken this step and repudiated payment of these annuities that have not been paid, the British people have put a taxation on our live stock and agricultural produce which has destroyed our farmers' markets and destroyed the prices they got.  These things have brought them down barely to a living way of carrying on their business.  That is the point where the farmers consider they are getting a very bad deal.  If we look at it now from the British point of view we see another thing.  The British have no claim for the non-payment of the annuities in the past.  They say that they have got out of the taxation upon Irish agricultural produce all the interest to which they are entitled.  Therefore, if we sit down to-morrow and settle with the British, they would make no claim for the past. They stated they cannot make a claim for the past, and that being so, the payment of the annuities is wiped out as far as that aspect of it is concerned. Our farmers say: &ldquo;Yes, the British have got all the money they claimed from us in the past for the interest on the land bonds, but it has been paid at our expense.  They have got it out of taxation on agricultural produce which we sent over to Great Britain.&rdquo; In reality our farmers have already <Col N="918" /> paid all this money.  It is an extremely complicated argument, because the British have no claim against us.  They have been paid.  It would be a very wise thing if the Government came out now with a definite statement about the land annuities, showing the public how they have been applied, and what the future of them is&mdash;making it quite clear that the future payments of the annuities by our farmers is a vital thing in their own self interest, because thereby hangs the title to their own land.  It is a much more serious thing for our farmers, who hold their land by the payment of annuities.  The Government should deal with that question in the near future.</P>
    <P>I believe if there was to be an honest inquiry made into the matter that there is no question that some very big concessions would be found to be due to our farmers, because the land annuities in the past as claimed by the British have been really paid and levied on our agricultural stock.  That would only come out in a final inquiry as to who was liable.  I think that our farmers in paying their annuities ought to be warned by some good authority that in that payment the title to their land is at issue.  They ought be told that that has no relation whatever to the settlement with Great Britain or the payment of interest on the land bonds to Great Britain.  The Government ought to make some definite statement on the whole of this point, and they ought also to hold an inquiry as to the real truth as to why land annuities are not now being paid.  From the banking point of view I have had dealings with the farmers of this country for a great number of years.  During all those years I found that the most honest section of the community with whom we had to deal were the farmers.</P>

      <P>Except under very exceptional circumstances the farmers have always paid up.  We have had an extremely small number of bad debts amongst them in all those years.  Of late years there have been complications but despite that I <Col N="919" /> believe that our farmers now are as honest as ever and if there has been non-payment of debts there is some real definite reason for it.  Some great effort ought to be made to find out what is the cause of it.  If this enquiry were held then some statement as to the facts would be elicited and some remedy applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say just a few words on this subject.  I certainly think that Senator Baxter's amendment should be entertained by the Minister.  Senators are all aware that last year the British Government collected, through this tariff imposed on live stock and agricultural produce from this country, something like £4,900,000.  Everybody knows that that money has come from the farmers of this country.  I remember some short time ago that a question was asked of the President of the Executive Council in the Dáil.  The President then announced that the land annuities proper amounted to £2,960,000.  If you deduct £2,960,000 from £4,900,000 the balance is £1,940,000.  That item of £1,940,000 represents what the farmers of this country paid, in excess, in these tariffs on their cattle and agricultural produce.  They paid £1,940,000 more than if they had been paying the annuities.  One can understand that some such things as police pensions and quite a number of other things besides land annuities are included in this sum of approximately £5,000,000 which the British have claimed.  It is my candid opinion now that as the quota on store cattle is no longer in force that the British will get another £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 next year.  Surely it ought to be quite enough for the farmers of this country to pay £2,960,000 in annuities proper. In a few years' time these land annuities will have been much reduced.  Anybody who has bought out under the Ashbourne Acts knows that in some cases the land annuities either have already expired or will expire in a few years.  If things went on normally the amount of the annuities that would have to be paid <Col N="920" /> within the next few years would be ever so much lower than it is at present.  That is really all that I have to say on this question of the annuities.  I have heard some farmers, people who make out they are farmers anyhow, say, that they are all well satisfied with this reduction of £100,000.  All that I can say to them is &ldquo;If you are, you are very easily pleased.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not propose to take part in this debate, but it has diverged into so many channels that I feel it my duty to say something, and particularly about the legal aspects of it which have been touched upon.  I can quite appreciate what has been said by Senator Jameson or what can be said by anybody about this question of the annuities who has not studied it.  I would venture to say to anyone who suggests the setting up of a tribunal of the kind suggested by Senator Jameson that the fundamental question in the issue about the annuities is whether or not this country is liable to pay them. You may have as many conferences as you wish as to whether the Free State is liable to pay them to Great Britain, or otherwise, but these conferences can never lead to anything definite or conclusive except on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this point, Sir, I must call your attention to what has occurred during the course of this debate, and that is that when certain Senators, including myself, stand up to address the House, we do so under great difficulty owing to the persistent conversation carried on here by certain Senators.  I wish to say that if that course is persisted in while I am addressing the House, then I shall feel it my duty to call the attention of the Chair to it.  When I was interrupted in my address by the noise of those who have already spoken in the debate, some of them at considerable length, I was proceeding to make certain observations on what might appear to be the suggestion of a useful character that was made by Senator Jameson.  Indeed, I may say that I have never heard <Col N="921" /> Senator Jameson speak in this House without contributing something useful to our discussions.  In answer to his suggestion, that something ought to be done to end this trouble about the annuities, I wish to impress upon him and upon any person so well-intentioned, that the fundamental question to be determined in any discussions that may take place is the liability of this country to pay the annuities or not.  Once you have that ascertained you can very easily settle the question.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been written and spoken on this subject by people who take different views on it.  I am afraid that it we were to follow in this debate the question as to whether a particular contribution is to be made by the Exchequer in relief of rates, and to have a discussion on the question of the annuities, such a debate would certainly furnish an irresistible argument for the abolition of this Chamber. I would venture to say that for an Assembly of this sort, which is a revising Chamber, to have a discussion on the question as to whether a particular sum, which admittedly must vary every year and which, according to our legislation, has never been made permanent&mdash;a discussion of the kind that has been indulged in here for the last two hours&mdash;is not very complimentary to a revising Chamber such as this.  It is obvious, of course, to anyone who has followed what has occurred in this country during the last two or three years that the farming community, and particularly those whom my friends, if I may call them my friends, claim to represent&mdash;the very extensive farmers&mdash;have suffered very considerably during that period. It has been suggested, in the course of this debate, that the situation which produced that distress was caused by the present Government.  Here, again, is an initial and a fundamental question on which it is necessary to have clear thinking before there is any discussion on the annuities.  If this country was not liable to pay the annuities, surely it was the business of the Executive Council to say that they could not pay out of the revenue <Col N="922" /> of the country sums of money which they were never authorised by the legislature to pay out.  If they took up that position, and if it was a clear, definite and legally sound position, I presume there is a way of determining whether they are right or wrong other than the means that were adopted. What were these means?</P>
    <P>It is said that the war, or, as it is called, the economic war, was caused owing to the attitude taken up by this Government.  I deny that.  If the Government were not liable, and were bound in duty to their citizens not to pay out these moneys, they did not produce the war.  The war was produced by a powerful neighbour, who said: &ldquo;If you do not pay this sum of money we will not discuss with you whether you are liable for it or not, but we will collect it off the cattle your farmers send into this country.&rdquo; And this powerful neighbour did that, and that is how the economic war started.  There is no use in blinking, or in denying, the facts.</P>

      <P>The fundamental question at the root of the dispute about the annuities is: Is this country liable to pay or is it not?  Is a solution of the question likely to be contributed to by the debate that we have listened to for the last two hours?  I venture to suggest not.  Is it, consequently, a discussion that the House should consider useful?  I suggest that it is not.  I suggest that the introduction of the very acrimonious, bitter, political addresses which have been delivered here during the last two hours on a question which ought <Col N="923" /> to be considered by us in a quiet, calm, semi-judicial manner will be used as an argument for the abolition of this House, if that question arises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I hold strong views regarding the annuities question and the origin of the dispute that has contributed to the present deplorable position of our farmers since the economic war was started, because of the refusal to pay over the land annuities.  From the commencement I held the opinion that when arbitration was offered by the present Government the chairman of the commission should be someone outside the British Commonwealth of Nations. I agreed to that principle in view of what happened in Ireland when this country was partitioned and when the Boundary Commission of which Mr. Justice Feetham was Chairman was set up.  In my opinion he showed partiality to the British and to the Northern majority.  I consider that Mr. J.H. Thomas is to be blamed more than any one else for the deplorable position that arose in connection with the land annuities.  As the representative of the great British Empire and the British Dominions, upon which they boast the sun never sets, he should have agreed to the offer that was made.  The present position, as I understand it, is that the legal advisers of the present Government hold that the annuities are not owing, while the legal advisers of the last Government are of opinion that the annuities are owing.  The dispute should have been settled without letting things drift. In the meantime there have been enormous losses amongst farmers.  I can speak from personal knowledge of the losses that have been occasioned.  There can be no change in the situation until the question is thrashed out and settled, when the people will know whether they do or not owe the money.  Mr. Thomas, as the representative of the British Government, imposed duties on live stock exports from this country and collected more than the amount of <Col N="924" /> the land annuities.  He was in a position to dictate terms in that way.  It reminds one of the story of Nero fiddling while Rome was burning. The cattle trade of this country is being penalised all the time.  As the prosperity of this country depends upon the live stock industry the sooner the dispute is settled the better.  There is evidence now of a possibility of the question being settled.  The onus as to the rights and wrongs of the question should be decided seeing that the annuities are being retained by the Government and used for purposes about which there are differences of opinion.  I hope the question of a settlement will be brought to a successful conclusion at an early date.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether it would be out of place on my part to call the attention of the House to the fact that from start to finish there is not a word about land annuities in this Bill.  There are 23 sections in the Bill.  It takes a good many words to formulate 23 sections, but I defy any member of the House, however ingenious&mdash;and there are some ingenious members in it&mdash;to find any words on which to hang a speech relating to land annuities.  Yet it has been done with good effect.  Personally it is very interesting to come here and to listen to the speeches of members of this House, even when dealing with topics restricted to what are to some extent <i>ex gratia</i> grants to help the agricultural community, or to speeches on the variety of topics that we listened to in the course of to-day's discussion. The economic war was widely quoted. Any complaint I might make might be that there might be a little more originality.  I do not come to this House as often as I should like, because it is always very interesting but, with all respect, I should like to hear a little more originality, after a debate that lasted nearly three hours, on &ldquo;the eternal economic war,&rdquo; as it is called. It would appear from the tone of some of the speeches, rather than the matter, that some Senators would like me to appear in the dock, as it were, on behalf of the Government, and to have <Col N="925" /> to defend my action in coming here on behalf of the Government, to ask the House to pass this Bill which gives a considerable sum of money out of the nation's purse to help the farming community in a time of stress.  I do not feel a bit like coming into the dock. People who would suggest that that should be the proper attitude ought to examine their consciences, and ought to look into their own hearts to see who should be in the dock.  Should it not be Senator Counihan, who criticised the Government, and who, I gathered from the tone of his speech, would, if possible, like to see this Bill thrown out, although it gives a considerable sum of money to help the farming community?  I should like to hear what the farming community that he may represent would say to that proposition.  I hope I am not misrepresenting what the Senator said.  I suggest his proposition would be to throw out the Bill or to amend it in such a way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not object in the least.  I have no doubt that Senator Counihan and many other Senators, perhaps on different sides of the House, would like to ask that more and more should be given to the farming community.  Personally I would like to be in a position to give a great deal more to the farming community.  Nobody can deny that the farming community is going through hard times. It is like a proposition in euclid, and has been so since 1929.  The farming community is suffering to a certain extent.  Perhaps it is suffering more than other sections of the community. That is debatable but, at any rate, the farming community is suffering. Everybody would like to see the farming community assisted to the fullest extent that the nation's resources permit. I should like, as any other Minister would like, to be able to come in here with full hands and give as large a measure of assistance as possible to the farming community.  That is what we are proposing, to a certain extent, <Col N="926" /> in this Bill.  The Government have given generously out of the nation's purse to meet agricultural conditions since they came into office.  We realise that the farming community needs certain assistance, as does the farming community in every other country with which I am acquainted.  I know of the farming conditions in many countries of Europe.  I know what the conditions are in America, Australia and other countries.  Senators know as well as I do that the collapse in agricultural prices is not confined to Ireland, to Europe, or to the United States but is universal.  It is not worse here than in many countries Senators and I could mention and, in many respects, it is not as bad.  In one respect it is worse, perhaps, but if we take the nation as a whole, it is not as bad.  From my observation in the last few years I should say that the agricultural community here is not so badly off as members of some agricultural communities with whom I have personal acquaintance&mdash; people who were in days gone by better off than our farmers.</P>

Senator Counihan said that the Government were proposing to give £300,000 less than was given by the last Government in 1932-33, when the grant reached its highest figure.  That is not correct.  The correct figure was given by Senator Dillon.  The amount is £78,000 less.  That is a considerable sum of money.  Any of us here would be glad to have it but, spread over 26 counties by way of relief of rates, what does it mean?  It would mean about £3,000 per county, as some of it would have to go into the City of Dublin. In that way, the reduction of £100,000 is not a very serious matter when spread over the 26 counties.</P>

      <P>If you spread it over the 26 counties it means a small sum for each county, but the total represents a large sum out of the national Exchequer.  It would probably amount to some pence per head of every member of the agricultural community in each county.  People may say that pence have to be reckoned in these times, but this would be a small sum per county and a smaller sum for the members of the agricultural community in each county, while it is a considerable sum to pay out of the national Exchequer.  The suggestion made by Senator Counihan that amendments should be introduced relative to holders of land in fee-simple is not a matter which could come into this Bill.  If it is to be considered at all, it should be incorporated in a Land Bill.  I doubt if an amendment could be framed on that subject which would come within the title of the Bill at present under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that there would be any purpose in my following the various speakers who shed so much light on the question of the land annuities.  Senator Jameson asked that the Government should make further pronouncements and declarations on this matter and that it should hold an inquiry into the question of the annuities.  The Senator was answered very well by Senator Lynch.  I think there is no subject on which there has been so much written and spoken from all sides as the subject of the land annuities.  I am sure that these discussions and that that publicity will continue until some agreement is arrived at.  I do not think that any useful purpose would be served by setting up a Commission of the kind suggested by the Senator and by Senator Baxter.  I do not see what value it would be.  Even if you had such a Commission set up and a report issued, I do not see that we would be any nearer agreement or that we could secure acceptance of the findings of the Commission.  A smaller Commission and one which was not of as great importance nationally was <Col N="928" /> set up in recent years&mdash;the Derating Commission.  Senator Baxter was, I think, a member of that Commission, and on it there were also members of the Seanad and Dáil, and members of local authorities representing the agricultural community and other interests. There was a very full investigation into derating.  The question whether derating would be a good proposition for the country as a whole was considered.  Generally speaking, the findings of that Commission were against the complete derating of agricultural land, and that is not so long ago.  Only a few weeks ago in the Dáil we had a discussion on a motion to reverse that decision.  We had some of the signatories to the report of the Commission standing up and arguing with all the force they could use against the findings in their own report.  We had several members of the Party which, when in office, nominated that Commission voting for complete derating and tearing up the recommendations of the Commission.</P>

      <P>I am not going to make any promise that I am not sure of carrying out.  Senator Blythe knows the position of the Guarantee Fund and how it stands with regard to legislation. He knows, and the Seanad generally knows, that it is being operated now in the same manner as it was operated all the time.  Unquestionably it comes with a little greater weight on the local authorities and on certain people as the draws from the Guarantee Fund go back on to the rates.  Let us hope that will not continue.  I do not know what the position is at the moment with regard to the Guarantee Fund and the payment of arrears of annuities, but the Government are prepared to make advances out of that fund, as they did last year, as the arrears come in, probably once a quarter, to the local authorities to help them to meet the draws taken from <Col N="930" /> them in previous years.  But until the fund is balanced, which does not take place until some time in the middle of February each year, it would be impossible to say what amount had come in or what amount would be available out of that money for the local authorities.</P>
      <P>As I said in the beginning, I have no intention of allowing the Government or myself to be put in the dock in regard to this matter.  We are legislating now for a reduction of £100,000 this year in the amount of the additional agricultural grant.  While that is so, much more money has been given directly or indirectly to the farming community through other channels. My Department deals with the administration of old age pensions and blind pensions, and in the past two years the amount distributed in old age pensions has increased by some £700,000.  That is a large sum of money, and I do not think anybody will deny that two-thirds of that goes into the rural areas.  So that while we have admittedly reduced, and I will say personally with regret, the agricultural grant this year by £100,000, we have in the one item alone of old age pensions given that sum back four-fold to the rural areas.  That cannot be denied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then the Widows' and Orphans' Bill, which will come into operation on 1st January, will cost the Government during this financial year £250,000.  A great part of that will go to the widows and orphans of agriculturists, as well as of other members of the community. That is a considerable sum of money put at the disposal of agriculturists that they had not before.  All this additional expenditure, as well as that on blind pensions, has to come out of the national purse, and if there are economies here and there the agricultural community have to bear some of them.  They are not bearing it all, but they have to bear some.  I know what the arguments are as to the present position of the agriculturists and that they should not be asked to bear any additional burden.  But the whole nation is bearing a heavy burden at present and, unquestionably, the agriculturists will have to bear their share <Col N="931" /> of it.  It is a matter for argument, of course, what their right share is.  I doubt if we would ever get agreement in this House on that, or in any other mixed assembly.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter gave credit to the Government for the extension of social services.  We are doing a good deal in improving the social services.  In my own Department we are spending a considerable sum of money, not alone in the cities and towns, but in the small villages in providing waterworks and sewage works.  A great deal of money is being spent in that way.  More than ever before in the history of the country has been spent in the last couple of years, and will be spent, as long as this Government is in existence, every year to improve these social services. Senator Counihan and Senator Baxter, who made the best case they could for the farming community, will probably ask: &ldquo;What benefit does the farmer derive from these services?&rdquo;  He does derive a benefit, although it may not go direct into his home in the view of some people, but I claim it does.  We are reducing the incidence of diseases of various kinds all over the country by the provision of improved water supplies and sewerage in these villages and towns into which the farming community have to go almost every day in the week.  Where the communities are larger there is likely to be a greater amount of illness, and if such diseases as scarlet fever and diphtheria are rife they are more likely to be contracted in the villages.  Would a farmer not be prepared to pay a few pence more in the £ in the year in his rates to save the lives of his children?  If the incidence of scarlet fever and diphtheria is going to decrease, or if these diseases are going to disappear, as they have in many cases, as a result of the improved health services, would not the farmers, though the schemes did not come to their door, be prepared to pay a little more so that the health of the community might be improved and their own lives and the lives of their families might be saved.</P>
    <P>You cannot measure in terms of money what it costs a family to have serious illness of the kind I speak of <Col N="932" /> brought into the home, or to have a child's life taken away as a result. Put in that way I say that the farmers, as well as every other section in the community, are getting good value for the amount they are paying in rates, having regard to the improved and extended services that are given to them in every part of the country.</P>
    <P>It is regretted that the non-payment of land annuities does affect local authorities and the position actually now is that if there were little or no arrears of land annuities in the country, no county council would be in financial difficulties.  As to the collection of rates I am not unduly worried about the position.  Last year, owing partly to our own fault &mdash;legislation was late&mdash;the collection of rates was not begun until a late period in the year.  In fact at the 31st December the collection looked very bad but by the 31st March there was a brisk payment and on the 30th June this year the condition of the collection was much better than the year before.  As far as I can see, certainly the collection for the coming year will be no worse and I have reason to believe that it will be considerably better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to apologise for the absence of the Minister for Finance for whom I am taking this Bill.  The operative clauses of the Approved Investments Act, 1933, cease to have effect after a period of two years from the passing of the Act.  The Act does not expire as a whole, but after that date those clauses under which alone action can be taken to extend the list of securities approved for investment of Government funds or Government moneys cease to be operative.  The Approved Investments Act, 1933, became law on the 29th September, 1933, and it will accordingly be impossible to operate it after the 28th September 1935.  The purpose of the present Bill is to extend the period of the operation of the Principal Act.  As stated above, the Approved Investments Act, 1933, became law on the 29th September, 1933.  Regulations had to be made under Section 2 (2) of the Act prescribing the manner in which the shareholding banks should nominate their representatives on the Investments Advisory Committee.  As the preparation of these regulations involved consultation with each of the eight shareholding banks, the regulations were not in final form until the beginning of November, 1933; they were formally made on the 16th November, 1933.  In the interval, the Chief Justice and the Stock Exchange were consulted as to their nominees on the Advisory Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 12th February, 1934, the Committee was formally constituted by the Minister for Finance, and held its first meeting on the 5th March, 1934. It consists of: Mr. Joseph Brennan, <Col N="934" /> Chairman of the Currency Commission; Mr. Justice W.J. Johnston, a Judge of the High Court; Mr. G.B. Symes, the President of the Stock Exchange; Mr. John P. Butler, Director, National Bank, Ltd.; Mr. J.J. McElligott, Secretary, Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>After the constitution of the Committee the preparation of the further regulations required under Section 7 of the Act was put in hand in the Department of Finance.  These regulations prescribed the form and manner in which application is to be made to the Minister for Finance for the approval of securities under Section 7 of the Act.  The draft of these regulations was agreed to by the Investments Advisory Committee on the 10th September, 1934, and the regulations were made on the 29th September, 1934.  A notice was published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> stating that the regulations had been made and that copies of the prescribed form could be obtained on application to the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>On the 15th October, 1934, ten applications under seal were received from the Dublin County Borough Council for the approval of securities under the terms of Section 7 of the Act.  To enable the Investments Advisory Committee to work out an appropriate procedure, it was decided to refer only one of these applications to the Committee in connection with a single fund, the National Health Insurance Fund Investment Account being chosen for the purpose.  The application was formally referred to the Committee on the 11th January, 1935. The Committee disposed of it and of subsequent references with regard to the nine other securities on the 25th April, 1935.  The appropriate notice indicating that the Minister for Finance had approved of six of the securities in question was duly published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  It is proposed to refer the same securities to the Committee for consideration in connection with the National Health Insurance Central Fund Account, and a memorandum outlining the characteristics and requirements of this fund is at present being prepared in the Department of Finance.  It should be <Col N="935" /> noted that no other applications were received for the approval of securities under Section 7 of the Act and that no action has been taken to have the Committee advise under the terms of either Section 6 (1) of Section 6 (2) of the Act.</P>
    <P>As will be seen from the above account, it took a considerable time to set in motion the rather elaborate machinery prescribed for operating the Act, and, in consequence, the positive results achieved by the measure up to the present date are rather small. This preliminary work will not have to be repeated if the Act is extended, and accordingly more considerable results may reasonably be anticipated for any further period of extension. It is not proposed to take advantage of the legislation to effect any amendment of the Bill.  It is quite correct that the original measure was declared to be of an experimental character, but the experience gained has not been sufficient to allow any decision to be reached as to what amendments, if any, ought to be effected in it.  That is the main reason for having an extension sought by this amending Bill. I will ask the House to give it its approval.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to bring about certain amendments in the Unemployment Assistance Act which circumstances have shown to be necessary.  In the first place, it is desired to establish machinery which will enable applicants, who are dissatisfied with the assessment of their means by unemployment assistance officers, to have their appeals considered and determined expeditiously.  An applicant who has been refused a qualification <Col N="936" /> certificate, or who disagrees with the valuation of his means made by the unemployment assistance officer, has, under the Principal Act, a right of appeal to the Appeals Committee, which Committee sits in Dublin and consists of officers from the Department of Finance, the Department of Industry and Commerce, and the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  That machinery would be quite adequate in normal circumstances, but, in the year in which the Act came into operation, a large number of cases were refused, for one reason or another, and an equally large number of persons were dissatisfied with the assessment of their means, and, in all such cases, the right of appeal was exercised, with the result that some 35,000 appeals were made and the machinery available was totally inadequate to deal with them.  Certain temporary measures were adopted to try to ease that situation, but it has been found necessary to set up a new method of determining these appeals.  The method proposed here is the appointment of appeal officers who will come in between the unemployment assistance officer and the Appeals Committee with the right to determine finally the appeal of any applicant, but also with the right to pass on the appeal of the Appeals Committee if, in the opinion of the appeals officer, any question of general principle arises to be considered.  In any event, the determinations made by the appeals officers will be based upon the decisions of the Appeals Committee, so that there will be uniformity in the application of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another amendment which it is desired to effect is one designed to enable any person who has been receiving unemployment assistance to get work, not exceeding six weeks in duration, without interrupting the continuity of his claim to assistance.  At the present time, a person who receives two days' employment, interrupting two periods of unemployment of not less than two days, is deemed to be continuously unemployed and does not have to undergo the waiting period of a week <Col N="937" /> before again receiving unemployment assistance, but if such a person gets three or four days' work, or any period in excess of two days, then, in order to be entitled to receive unemployment assistance he has, under the present Act, to wait for a certain period before getting assistance.  That has operated in the way of deterring such a man from taking short periods of employment as they offered.  Under the new arrangement, persons receiving unemployment assistance will be allowed to take work up to six weeks in duration without losing unemployment assistance except for the days upon which they were actually employed.  Although that change may, by itself, increase the cost of unemployment assistance to some extent, we hope that its effect in encouraging people to seek for and obtain short periods of work that may be available will have a counteracting effect.  Furthermore, it is intended to allow persons to draw unemployment assistance or unemployment insurance benefit to which they may be entitled, at their own discretion. Ordinarily, of course, if the amount of benefit to which the persons concerned are entitled is considerable, they will draw it because it is paid at considerably higher rates, but as the former Act stands at the present moment, if the person concerned does some work and gets, let us say, one insurance stamp placed to his credit, he is in an unfortunate position because he has to wait one week to get his insurance benefit, and then has to wait another week before he gets his unemployment assistance benefit.  That also operated to deter workers from taking short periods of employment. By allowing them to draw unemployment assistance, if they so choose, we get over that deterrent.  We avoid the necessity for a second waiting week and we allow the worker to accumulate these occasional insurance stamps which he may be able to get until they are of a sufficient number to make it worth his while to claim benefit on them.</P>
    <P>Another one of the major changes which it is proposed to effect arises under Section 11.  At the present time, when a person's means are <Col N="938" /> assessed, the total of the determined weekly value of the means is stated in his qualification certificate, and when he becomes entitled to unemployment assistance he gets the scheduled rate of assistance less the amount of means, stated in his certificate, plus 2/-.  In other words, 2/- of the means assessed are not calculated. There is a margin, under the existing Act, allowed, which was intended originally to provide a certain elasticity, or a certain margin for error of 2/-, and a person who has means amounting to 2/- in the week, or of any lesser sum, is entitled to unemployment assistance at the full rate.  That means that such a person, with means calculated at 2/- a week, is, in a sense, better off than a person with no means at all and who gets the same amount of assistance. In any case, it was considered that the margin allowed was too wide and that a smaller margin would serve the purpose for which the section in the original Act was designed to serve.  It is true that there is a substantially wider margin of uncalculated means under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill and the Old Age Pensions Act, but in this legislation we think it is desirable that we should eliminate items of cost of that kind.  The main principle of the legislation is to provide assistance at the rates set out in the Princical Act, to persons who, during unemployment, are temporarily unable to provide for themselves.  The individual amounts which can be made available will depend on the success of the Department in eliminating non-essential items of cost.  We have contemplated the abolition of uncalculated means altogether, but we decided that it would be unwise to do so at this stage because there is a certain amount of uncertainty in the calculation of means, and the total abolition of that margin could not be considered until, at least, the arrears of appeals have been wiped out and all the cases that gave rise to appeals have been recorded and an examination made of the different factors that produced disagreement, <Col N="939" /> whereever there is a disagreement, between the unemployment assistance officer on the one hand and the Appeals Committee on the other hand.</P>
    <P>The other changes proposed to be effected are not of such importance. We are proposing to include, as dependents of their parents, invalid sons and daughters over 18 years of age. The purpose of that is to correct a certain error in the original Act.  In the original Act a person can claim, as dependents, invalid sisters and brothers who are maintained by him, but he is not allowed to claim for his own sons or daughters, even if, through invalidity, they are unable to provide for themselves.  The whole section is being repealed, and being re-enacted in a slightly different form: first, to effect that change, and, secondly, to get uniformity in the terms in which dependency is defined.  There are three or four different expressions used in the Principal Act.  They are all being changed in this Bill to the term &ldquo;wholly or mainly supported by.&rdquo; Furthermore, the section, in its new form, excludes from the list of dependents the wife of an applicant for assistance where the wife has a pension or private means capable of supporting herself.  That also is to correct a mistake in the preparation of the original Act.</P>
    <P>Senators are aware that different rates of assistance are payable in different areas.  The rate in the county boroughs and in the borough of Dun Laoghaire is higher than the rate in urban areas having a population in excess of 7,000 and, in those areas, it is higher than the rate paid in the rest of the Saorstát.  As the original Act stands, if the boundary of a county borough were extended&mdash;and there is, in fact, I think, a proposal to extend the boundary of the borough of Dun Laoghaire at the present time&mdash;or if in consequence of the census we take next year, a town at present below 7,000 population were to be revealed to be a town with a population in excess of 7,000, the position would be that <Col N="940" /> persons in the area added to the county borough, and persons in those towns would not be entitled to unemployment assistance at all.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that they will become entitled to assistance at the rates applicable to the areas.</P>
    <P>The other changes are of still lesser importance.  There is provision whereby persons who obtain unemployment assistance by deliberately making false or misleading statements or by concealing material facts will not be permitted to retain such assistance. There is also a provision by which public assistance authorities can, in certain circumstances, recover excess relief paid by them.  If a person holding a qualification certificate applies for unemployment assistance, and is held by the unemployment assistance officer to be disqualified on any of the grounds&mdash;that he is not unemployed; that he is not seeking work; that he is not available for work or any of the other reasons&mdash;that person has a right of appeal to the Court of Referees and if the court decides in his favour, he becomes entitled to unemployment assistance as from the date of his claim.  In the meantime, however, he may have been assisted by the local authority and may have received home assistance for a period of some weeks. As it stands, he not merely gets that home assistance, but at the end of the period he gets a lump sum representing the arrears of unemployment assistance due to him.  We are providing that out of that lump sum the home assistance authority can be recouped the amount of home assistance paid. The other changes are minor.  Some are merely designed to bring the Unemployment Assistance Act into conformity with the Unemployment Insurance Acts for convenience of administration and others dealing with such minor matters as the definition of a day, certain changes designed to facilitate the determination of appeals, and other matters of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see that this Bill embodies necessary amendments to the Principal Act, but I think that in Section 11 the Minister has a blemish <Col N="941" /> on his escutcheon.  The Minister spoke about elasticity&mdash;whatever that means in legislation&mdash;but I should like to have it a little more lucid.  It does seem to be mean and paltry to take these means into account in respect of uncalculated means.  Certainly I think that any person whose only income or means is two shillings is destitute, and to reduce that by 50 per cent. is something which is repugnant to one's sense of social correctness.  I should like to know to what extent, if any, the Minister anticipates a saving in that respect, and also what additional expense the operation of this amending Bill will entail.  I think that the figure in respect of the original Act was £1,600,000, and, obviously, the introduction of this amending Bill suggests a miscalculation in the estimate of the cost of the Principal Act.  I do not think the Minister has given us any information at all of what the additional cost of the Bill will be, but in his statement in the other House he indicated that it would involve increased expenditure on the Exchequer.  I think it would be interesting to know what is the extent of that increase, and also what is the likelihood of a saving by this reduction of the 2/- to 1/-.  I hope someone else will deal with this matter which does seem to me to jar on one's sense of good taste, to say the least&mdash;the State making statutory provision for reducing uncalculated means from 2/- to 1/-.  I hope someone else will supplement what I have said in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other point on which I wish to be clear, with regard to claims made in consequence of a claim being disallowed by the competent committee and which, on appeal, result in favour of the applicant.  Is the payment on these claims retrospective? There is provision that the recovery of assistance given under false pretences shall have retrospective effect, but how it is to be recovered from destitute people will provide a puzzle for the Minister.  I should like to know if there will be retrospective effect in the case of a claim found to be genuine. If a person's claim is disallowed and if, on appeal, his claim is found to be genuine, does he get payment from the <Col N="942" /> time he originally made the claim or does it start from the time his claim is allowed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the cost of the measure, the savings that will arise under some heads and the increased expenditure that will arise under others, I should like to impress upon the Senator the extraordinary difficulty of making even an estimate, having regard to the limited experience the Department has had of the working of the Act.  It only came into operation last year and barely into full operation this year.  On the 1st May last year, unemployment ment assistance became payable but no more than a small proportion of those who claimed were able to get assistance on that date, because their claims had to be considered and the necessary administrative action taken before they became entitled to assistance. It was only towards the end of the year that any considerable number of the applicants were, in fact, receiving assistance.  Because of that inadequate experience of the operation of the Act, there is considerable difficulty in making estimates apart from other factors.  On the experience of last year the reduction in non-calculated means will produce a saving of £180,000 in a full year on the assumption that there will be the same number of people receiving assistance, and the same proportion of that number of persons with means, and that the duration of each claim is the same.  These are factors that will vary considerably and will be influenced this year by the Employments Period Orders, which have been made, and the second of which is now in operation, and under which persons holding land in excess of £4 valuation, or persons who are single, and without dependents in rural areas, are debarred from receiving unemployment assistance until the end of September.  At any rate there will not be any saving like that in the present year or in any full year for that matter arising from the operation of this Bill as a whole, because <Col N="943" /> other proposals will be operating to increase the cost of unemployment assistance.  One cannot say to what extent the new definition of dependents will increase the claims of persons now receiving assistance.  And the operations of the new appeals machinery will have the effect of increasing the cost, but no one can attempt to forecast any figures as to what the increase will be.  The estimated cost of unemployment assistance in this year was £1,600,000. That was the estimate prepared in the beginning of the year.  But a certain proportion of that amount will be recoverable by the Department as appropriation-in-aid&mdash;£250,000 from the unemployment insurance fund and, roughly, £200,000 from certain local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Estimates were prepared, as stated in the Budget speech of the Minister for Finance, other factors have become apparent, and it is estimated that these other factors will reduce the cost of the scheme this year from £1,600,000 to £1,300,000.  These are three in number: (1) the requirement under which persons employed upon public works, financed in whole or in part out of State funds, must be persons receiving unemployment assistance where such persons are available, and the increased provision for public works this year; (2) the Employment Periods Order to which I have referred, and (3) to some extent, this measure.  These three factors are, it is thought, likely to reduce the cost of unemployment assistance this year from the estimated figures by £300,000.  But even assuming figures by £300,000.  But even assuming that the figure was one that did provide a considerable measure of estimation it must be remembered there was no previous experience, and one can never tell, with certainty, what the results, in any year, of a scheme of this kind are likely to be.  The original estimated cost was, roughly, £1,300,000.  When the unemployment assistance scheme was devised it was thought it would cost in the year 1934 in full operation the sum of £1,300,000.  But that figure, although it was, in fact, shown to be accurate was itself the result of <Col N="944" /> certain mistakes.  The number of persons without means who became entitled to assistance at the full rate proved to be less than we had estimated, whereas the number of persons with means, namely, landholders, and sons of landholders, proved to be considerably greater. Thus, the total number of persons receiving assistance was more than we thought it would be, but the average payment per person was less.  We got the estimated results, but by a different method from what we calculated.</P>
    <P>With regard to the retrospective payment to persons appealing against the basis of the unemployment assistance officers' decisions, it is necessary to clear up what Senator Milroy referred to.  A person when refused a qualification certificate can appeal against that, and also against the assessment of his means as stated in the certificate to the Unemployment Appeals Committee. But any change in the position resulting from the decision of the Committee, either as to the granting of certificates, or the assessment of means on a different basis, does not operate retrospectively for that person.  But the Senator will understand that a person actually applying for a certificate, or appealing against an assessment of means might not be entitled to unemployment assistance; such a person might be employed.  Any person whose means are less than the means prescribed in the first Act is entitled to a certificate, and thus becomes entitled to receive unemployment assistance when unemployed.  But when a person has got a certificate, and becomes unemployed, and applies for payment of assistance, if refused, he appeals to the local Court of Referees. This is a body consisting of a neutral chairman&mdash;a gentleman who is a solicitor, or some other such person&mdash;and an equal number of representatives of workers and employers living in the area.  That court decides on the appeal subject to a further appeal in certain cases to the umpire.  If that decision is favourable to the applicant, the payment is retrospective.</P>

      <P>In the case of appeals to the Appeals Committee, there are arrears of appeals which have accumulated from the time that the Act came into operation.  There are 30,000 appeals out of a total of 35,000 awaiting decision.  The Appeals Committee only covered 5,000, but it does not follow that the remaining 30,000 cases are all cases of hardship, because arising out of the decisions by the Appeals Committee in the 5,000 cases I have referred to, the officers throughout the country were asked to reconsider their decisions, and in 9,000 cases they have revised their decisions in favour of the applicants.  But it is because these appeals are there, and because the existing machinery is inadequate to deal with them, that this Bill is introduced for the purpose of establishing new machinery.</P>

      <P>The Senator has apparently formed a wrong impression. A person might have a good claim to a qualification certificate and still not be entitled to unemployment assistance.  Any person can have his qualification certificate and in due course every worker will have a qualification certificate, and if there is any alteration in his means he will be entitled to appeal to that Committee to get his means re-assessed.  But such persons might not be entitled to payment of assistance at all, because they may not be unemployed, they may not be seeking employment or they may be otherwise disqualified. It is only when they prove their eligibility to payment that their claim becomes valid.  If there is any dispute, retrospective payment is made to the date of the claim for assistance but not to the date of the application for the qualifying certificate, which is a different matter.</P>

      <P>This is a minor measure and it was introduced in the Dáil by the leader of the Labour Party.  As there was no opposition, it was accepted as a Government measure to avoid the procedure of select committee. Under the Trade Union Act of 1871 a trade union is prevented from holding land exceeding one acre in extent. That provision of that Act was repealed in Great Britain some ten years ago and it is desired to have it repealed here, as certain unions are desirous of possessing&mdash;in fact, they do not actually possess&mdash;land exceeding one acre in extent.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of the working of the Fresh Meat Act during the last four or five years it is felt that there is at least a strong administrative reason for bringing in some amendments.  They are very simple amendments and they do not involve any principle.  The simplest way will be to take each section of the Bill.  Section 2 permits the examination of animals under the Fresh Meat Act without the payment of a fee.  It is felt that in some cases this will be necessary, for instance, where a firm might be exporting only one particular organ of an animal and where it would not pay them to meet the fee for inspection.  There was such a case last year.  In one particular factory&mdash;it would not be desirable to mention the name&mdash;only the livers of the animals were exported and the fee for <Col N="947" /> examination was more than 50 per cent. of the value of that particular organ and, therefore, it proved a nonremunerative business and it was discontinued. When the Bacon Act is in operation we will have veterinary surgeons examining the animals in any case and the Exchequer will not lose anything under this particular section. I do not think the section will be availed of to any great extent.</P>
      <P>Section 3 removes an anomaly. Under the main Act premises were registered and the proprietor licensed. It has happened on a few occasions that the registration was withdrawn for some reason or other, but the licence still remained with the proprietor and the licensee was bound to pay a certain minimum fee each half-year. In two cases it was more or less due to an oversight, but we had to insist on the fee being paid although the man had actually gone out of business. Under this amending section, if the registration is removed the licence goes with it.  Section 4 deals with the superannuation of officers.  It was felt that officers acting under a local authority who give part of their time acting under the Minister for Agriculture in the administration of the Fresh Meat Act might thereby endanger their status with regard to superannuation. There is a similar section to this in the Pigs and Bacon Act.  This is to make sure that these officers do not miss their superannuation rights if they happen to work from time to time for the Minister for Agriculture as well as for the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 refers to minor amendments in the Schedule and Sections 6 and 7 are merely formal sections.  In the Schedule the various amendments look rather formidable, but I think we can dispose of them without very much trouble.  The amendments to Sections 35 and 36 change the present definition of meat which is fit for human consumption. At the present time it is defined as free from disease.  That is not altogether satisfactory because it sometimes happens that the veterinary surgeon may wish to condemn a quarter of a beast because of injury, perhaps an ante-mortem injury, and he <Col N="948" /> cannot do so if the quarter is free from disease.  We are changing the definition in order to meet such a case. Under the amendment to Section 36 he will be enabled to condemn meat because of malformation or not being properly developed, and so on, which he has not power to do at present.</P>
    <P>The remaining amendments to the Schedule deal with one point and that is: that meat can be exported from any registered premises.  The position is that meat must be exported from the registered premises in which the animal is slaughtered.  There was a small trade started here last summer for offals to two Continental countries.  It was rather difficult to develop that trade by asking each registered premises to send out direct the livers, hearts and tongues&mdash;those were the principal organs concerned&mdash;in small lots.  It is felt the trade could be developed better if the offals could be collected and exported from the one place.  The amendments amount to this, that fresh meat can be changed from one registered premises to another before being exported.  That is the full effect of the amendments.  That is all that the Bill deals with and there is nothing of any great importance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a part of this Bill that I cannot understand and it strikes me as very unreal.  Perhaps the Minister might explain it.  We see in Section 2 &ldquo;in the case of any person who held during such half-year or any part thereof a beef exporter's licence in respect of such specified premises ....&rdquo;  Since the 1st January, 1934, the export of beef has been prohibited and I cannot understand the application of this section, the withdrawing of a licence for the doing of something that could not be done, the export of beef to Great Britain, to Smithfield. I might mention that I was interested in a factory that exported something like 100 cattle per week.  It did a very fine trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you will allow me, Sir, I should like to read a paragraph from our report to the shareholders in June, 1934.  It is of great importance.  I was asked to bring it to the notice of the Minister on some appropriate occasion <Col N="949" /> in the hope that we might get some of this trade back.  The paragraph in the report dealing with this matter reads:&mdash;&ldquo;We killed 1,261 cattle last year as compared with 169 the year before, and we would have more than doubled this number only for the prohibition against sending dressed beef to Britain coming into force on last January 1st.  This prohibition order against dressed beef affected our suppliers and ourselves very badly. We were providing an outlet and obtaining very satisfactory prices, as ruling prices went, for about 100 cattle a week.  This order broke up our organisation and reduced the outlet for our suppliers to the few cattle for which they could get quotas.  We regret to say that, so far as we can see, there is no prospect of any change in the dressed beef situation in the near future, and must only hope that a change for the better will come soon.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was asked to bring the matter to the notice of the Minister and the House here, in the hope that trade might be restored.  I know there are big difficulties in the way of trying to secure that Great Britain would allow us to export these 100 or 200 cattle per week.  This trade would not go on evenly for the whole year.  In some weeks as many as 200 cattle came in. It would have been developed into something big were it not for the prohibition order.  Some people did not believe that there was very much in it, but our experience proved that there was a great deal in it for the country as a whole.  We directed our activities to cattle of the right sort.  We exported nice, fat animals of about 5½ cwt. net.  These carcases were dressed properly and exported from our factory in Waterford.  They left a very good return in the way of profit, and there was ready sale for the cattle. These cattle were selected cattle and the suppliers were organised.  We took none of the big six-cwt. or seven-cwt. cattle to which we had been accustomed.</P>
    <P>It was principally in connection with the licences that are referred to in this Bill that I brought this matter before the House in the hope that <Col N="950" /> something would be done to restore these licences, whether by means of intervention with the authorities on the other side or in some other way.  I do not know if there is a hope that it can be done.  At all events, we are now getting the quota for store cattle increased to 100 per cent., and, consequently, there is a hope that we might get this export trade restored through the intervention of the Minister and the Government.  It would be a great thing for us in the South of Ireland because it would be an outlet for our smaller cattle.  In our co-operative society we have 6,000 shareholders and all are of about the same denomination, averaging £10 each.  The dressed beef side of it was the primary object of the factory.  In the past in this business there was experienced a good deal of discouragement now and again. The societies had not organised proper supplies.  They did not have the same means of organising as we had.</P>
    <P>Coming to the Bill, it seems to me in connection with Section 2 that that section is unreal.  I say that because it seems to withdraw something that is not here&mdash;that is the authority to slaughter and to send over dressed cattle to England.  We are prohibited doing that since the 1st January, 1934. If there could be anything done to take away that prohibition and to restore that trade it would be a very big thing for our society, for those directly engaged in this business and for the country as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question raised by Senator Dillon&mdash;the dressed meat business&mdash;I am afraid that that particular business has always been rather an uncertain item in this country even before there were any tariffs or quotas put on by the British.  There were I think several attempts in the last 25 or 30 years to develop an export trade in dressed beef to Great Britain, but somehow or other it always failed.  It has failed for a different reason now&mdash;the British Government has prohibited the import of fresh veal or fresh meat into Great Britain and as long as the prohibition remains it cannot be done.  I think it unlikely that there will be any yielding <Col N="951" /> on that point for the present.  I do not know exactly what the reasons are but it appears to me that the principal reason for this particular prohibition was the question of employment in Great Britain.  That had more to do with it than anything else.  If there had been no question of a quota, I do not think there would be any objection to allowing in dead carcases instead of live cattle.  But there was a very big increase in the export of fresh beef from this country, during the year 1933, and it was felt that that order prohibiting any further imports of fresh dressed beef was made largely owing to the question of employment in Great Britain.  However, as far as the Government are concerned they will do everything possible to get a quota for fresh beef.  With regard to Section 2, I want to tell the Senator that that section is not so much to deal with the British markets as it is to deal with the continental markets, somewhat on the same lines as Section 5.</P>
      <P>When speaking a few minutes ago I mentioned that there was one particular firm last year that wanted to export one particular organ to the continental markets.  There would have been some advantage in exporting that particular firm's output.  This particular export was small, but even small things cannot be lost sight of.  It is for that reason that the section was inserted. At the moment I do not think that section will be used because that firm is not anxious to develop the business now, and it is only in case the trade should arise again that the section has been put in.  I think the Seanad will agree that a section like that is never likely to be used to any great extent, because the Minister for Agriculture has to get the consent of the Minister for Finance and very good cause has to be shown before the Minister for Finance will forego the fees that are payable in cases like that.  I do not think any other point has been made with which I need deal.</P>

      <P>Early last year I came before the Seanad with a Bill which arose out of a decision of the Supreme Courts concerning the Erne fisheries, and particularly Co. Donegal.  According to that decision, the estuary of the River Erne was declared a public fishery, which meant that anyone from Donegal, or any place else in the Free State, had a right to apply for a licence to fish there and was entitled to get it.  It was felt by the Fisheries Department here that there was great danger that the River Erne would be over-fished. It was a very valuable fishery.  It was felt that the conservators in the area would lose a considerable income, as up to that period they had been getting a considerable rate from the former owners, or, as the Court declared, those who claimed to own the fisheries. That income is gone, and, in order to remedy these matters, a Bill was brought in which gave power to the Minister for Fisheries to give local licences at an increased fee.  In that way it was hoped to limit the number who would fish there and to raise an income for the conservators.  That Act only dealt with a limited period.  It was experimental, the idea, as far as I am aware, not having been tried here or in any other country.  It worked satisfactorily and would expire on September 30th next.  As the House is aware, a Commission has been sitting for some time dealing with inland fisheries.  A report is being presented and is with the printers, but it may be some time before it is edited and ready for the public.  It will certainly be <Col N="953" /> some time before the report is considered by the Government.  After it is considered, legislation will be prepared. I cannot say whether or not it will be on the lines of the report, but certainly some legislation will be prepared to deal with inland fisheries.  It is, therefore, proposed to extend the provisions of this Bill for two years.  I think I can promise that within two years, at least, comprehensive legislation dealing with inland fisheries will be brought before Parliament, and in that case there will probably be no necessity for a temporary Act any further.  If it is found impossible to bring in a larger measure in the meantime, we will have to come before Parliament to get authority to continue the provisions of this Bill, dealing with tidal waters that are in the same position as the tidal waters of the River Erne.</P>

      <P>This is an absolutely necessary Bill but there is just one matter on which I should like to get some information from the Minister. In addition to cases like the Erne case, where there has been a decision of the courts in favour of the public, as against an owner who had exercised the exclusive right of fishing, there is I understand another class of case in the Bill.  That is the case of a private owner who had exercised the exclusive right of fishing but who did not wish to contest it any longer, as against the public, and who voluntarily gives up the exclusive right of fishing, when it becomes part of the tidal water fisheries managed by the Minister in the Act we are now amending.  Have there been any number of cases of that kind?  I am referring to persons who gave up the voluntary right they had been exercising all these years to the Minister. I know of one case in connection with the Ownea river in County Donegal. The Young family who, I think, live on the other side of the estuary exercised the exclusive right of fishing in the Ownea river and also the tidal waters in the estuary.  Though they gave that up they continued to exercise a right which they had before they gave up the exclusive rights in <Col N="954" /> the river and estuary.  They had three bag nets in the estuary.  They were very valuable, more valuable than the exclusive right of fishing.  Having given up the exclusive right of fishing in the river and in the estuary it became illegal under an old Act of Parliament, made in 1842, to use a bag net. To some extent, they have been breaking the law.  They were ignorant of the fact.  The owners have now recognised that, and have given up using the bag nets.  Some of the poor employees have been put out of employment and the owners have been deprived of a very valuable right.  I should like to know if there has been any number of these cases, and if the Minister would say whether he would look sympathetically on a claim for compensation in cases of that kind.</P>

As it is one that will have to be placed before the Executive Council for consideration it would be hardly fair to bind the Minister by any answer he might give.  As the Senator knows, it is a very big question.  I know something about the Erne Fisheries, and having regard to the opportunity that there will be when the report of the Fisheries Commission is available, perhaps it would be more prudent in the interests of these people, if the matter was allowed to remain over until then, if a promise was given by the Minister that he would recommend for sympathetic consideration the matters that have been referred to.</P>

I think I can say&mdash;although it has not been considered&mdash;that the Government will be sympathetic towards some method of compensation in cases like the Young case.  As Senator Lynch mentioned, the Erne case is on a different footing, and I would not like to express any opinion at the moment.  I do not want to prejudice the matter in any way.</P>

      <P>The Diseases of Animals Act, 1894, gives the Minister for Agriculture power to deal directly with four specific diseases&mdash;cattle plague, pleuro-pneumonia, foot-and-mouth disease and swine fever.  All other diseases are dealt with by the local authority.  I do not want to claim that, because the Department of Agriculture were in charge, they eliminated these four diseases but, whether it is a coincidence or not, I am happy to be able to say that these diseases have almost disappeared. Pleuro-pneumonia and cattle plague have not been known for years <Col N="956" /> in this country.  There has been no outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the Free State since 1928.  There was an outbreak in Northern Ireland in 1931 but this State has been free from that disease for seven years.  We have almost got rid of swine fever.  It had been declining for a year or two, and last year it disappeared completely.  It is very difficult to ascertain what was responsible for its disappearance.  Some say that it was due to the boiling order for offals in the City of Dublin.  An order was made that offals must be boiled before being fed to pigs.  It is claimed by some people that that was responsible for eliminating swine fever, while it has also been claimed that what amounts to an embargo on the import of bacon has stopped swine fever.  At any rate, we have practically got rid of it.  Apart from these four diseases, the local authorities deal with all other diseases.  Under this Bill I propose to take power to deal directly with all other diseases of animals as well as these four diseases.  I may say that that power is being taken principally for the purpose of dealing with tuberculosis in cattle.  Under the scheme for dealing with old and uneconomic cows, which are being sent to the factory at Roscrea, which commenced business yesterday, it is hoped to get rid of a great number of old cows&mdash;cows that are not necessarily diseased&mdash;county by county.  We hope not to send diseased cows to Roscrea but we cannot guarantee that.  Of course, the old, wasted and uneconomic cows will go there.  We hope to follow up that by bringing into force this tuberculosis order, centrally administering it in each county and clearing out the tubercular cows.  In that way, we shall try to get our herds into a healthy condition.  The administration of the tuberculosis order by the local authorities cannot be regarded as very satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the year ended 31st March, 1935, the number of animals slaughtered under the order was only 3,672.  We have over 1,300,000 cows, so that the number slaughtered works out at only .3 per cent. of the total number in the country.  There is no doubt that the <Col N="957" /> number of tubercular cows is greater than that.  Then, the order is not worked uniformly.  In the same year the number of animals slaughtered in one county was 751, while in another county it was only six.  A good deal depends on the local authority, but more depends on the veterinary officer in charge.  Some of these officers are very keen on this business, and go as far as possible in order to get tuberculosis stamped out.  Others adopt an easy attitude.  It is proposed, under this Bill, to take over the administration of the Bovine Tuberculosis Order in one county, after Roscrea has cleared out the old cows, and work it strenuously for a month or six weeks, then handing it back to the local authority.  We hope to move over the country in that way, not dealing with, perhaps, more than two counties at a time.  We hope to get the whole country cleared first of the old, uneconomic cows, and then cleared of diseased cows, under this order, inside 15 or 18 months.  The officers of the local authorities will be employed, as well as additional officers from headquarters, while this measure is being worked in any particular county.</P>
    <P>A question may arise as regards compensation.  At present, the local authority pays half the compensation and the other half is paid out of the Exchequer.  We propose, in this Bill, to pay the entire amount of compensation so long as the Minister is administering the Act in any particular county.  We thought it advisable to do that because, otherwise, the local authority might complain that we put heavy cost on them by our too strenuous administration of the Act for the couple of months we would be in the county.  We shall relieve the local authority, to a certain extent, by administering the Act in this way, and we shall leave them a cleaner herd when the headquarters officers have finished their work in the county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill and I agree with the Minister that we have perhaps the cleanest bill of health in respect of live stock of any country in the world to-day.  Fortunately, we have had no outbreak of foot-and-mouth <Col N="958" /> disease for a long time, and the Minister was quite right in saying that that was possibly due to the exclusion of foreign beef.  In England, where they have had outbreaks of this disease in places 100 miles apart, the only cause which the authorities could find for these outbreaks was infection from chilled or frozen meat from the Argentine and the Continent.  It has been definitely proved that the bones of cattle affected with foot-and-mouth disease will contaminate pigs and cattle for a considerable period.  We all approve of the attitude of the Minister as regards the exclusion of imported beef and I hope that every other Government we have here will continue that policy.</P>
      <P>With regard to the wiping out of tuberculosis, that is a fairly difficult job.  The present policy of the county councils would make very little impression on the problem, as the compensation they are giving is practically negligible.  A person has to go to a lot of trouble in regard to inspection and so forth, and the most he will get in any case will be £1.  That will not induce anybody to call in a veterinary surgeon to have his cow destroyed. With regard to the Minister's statement that he proposes killing off the old cows, I do not believe that that will eliminate tuberculosis, because the majority of the old cows are not affected with tuberculosis.  The Minister speaks about starting with Kerry. There is very little tuberculosis amongst Kerry cattle, either old or young.  It would be a good job, however, to kill off some of the old cows and give the people in Kerry something for their old cows for which they are not getting anything now.  I am not objecting to his starting with Kerry, as I would be glad to see my county getting anything that is going.</P>

      <P>There is one thing which is giving a very considerable amount of trouble this year, and that is the warble fly.  I should like to ask the Minister if any special precautions can be taken to prevent the ravages of the warble fly or if any steps are being taken to deal with the matter.  In the old days the Department of Agriculture <Col N="959" /> did a considerable amount in educating the people by distributing leaflets to help them to get rid of this pest.  An enormous loss on hides is experienced through the ravages of the warble fly.  Another disease which has been prevalent for years and shows no signs of abating is contagious abortion in cattle.  I often wonder why some means are not taken to deal with this.  We are always told that investigations are being made and that veterinary surgeons are studying the disease.  Perhaps in the present circumstances the Minister might take some steps to deal with it.  It would be just as humane as the slaughtering of calves, that horrible crime which will never be forgotten in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to raise one or two points with regard to the administration of the Bill.  I am sure the House and the country will welcome any measure to continue the policy of having a clean bill of health for our cattle stocks.  I am quite certain that this action on the part of the Minister is not to be taken as an indication of the belief that diseases of the types mentioned are to any extent existent in our cattle stocks.  I think that tuberculosis even is possibly very much rarer than might generally be believed.  A great amount has been said about this disease in cattle, particularly by medical men without, as I believe, any great knowledge on their part as to the extent to which it is prevalent. We can see evidence in another country of the point of view that cattle across the Channel are very seriously affected by this disease.  We have seen it suggested within the last day or two that it is very likely that cattle going from this country to Scotland might be taking with them some of these diseases.  The Minister gave a figure of the total number of cattle believed to be affected with tuberculosis which is a very low percentage indeed, but there is no great evidence that the figure is very much greater than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="960" /> What I want to get from the Minister is how exactly this Bill is going to operate.  Are we going to have every herd in the country examined? Is it to be a voluntary act on the part of the owner of the herd?  When it comes to a question of clearing out the affected beasts, who is to determine the value that is going to be put upon these animals?  Would it be entirely a matter for the official of the Minister to determine the value of such an animal?  I think it is very essential, if the measure is to be a success, that the sympathetic co-operation of the farmers should be obtained.  That is going to be very difficult if the feeling goes abroad that the examination of their cattle may lead to the condemnation of some of them and that the compensation given will be so low as not to be acceptable.  I think it is in the interest of the State as a whole that our cattle should have a clean bill of health; but if that is going to be brought about the State must be reasonable in the treatment of the people with whom it has to deal.  It is as well for us to face the fact that, whether the percentage of diseased animals is small or larger than we might think, the administration of this Bill is going to cost a considerable amount of money.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister has made any estimate as to what it is likely to cost?  The inspection of 1,300,000 cows alone will cost something when the travelling and other expenses are taken into consideration.  The Minister possibly has made his calculation and it would be as well if we got some indication from him as to what this will cost the country.  I understand that under the existing Act when a beast was condemned an impartial valuer came along to value the beast.  I wonder whether that policy is going to be continued, because if we are to have an official of the Minister coming along to make an examination and condemn beasts and then value them, I think the attitude of the farmer to the administration of the Bill will not be what it ought to be and that would be very unfortunate from the point of view of making it effective.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that I did not make myself quite clear when I was talking about old cows.  Judging by what Senator Counihan said, I did not make myself very clear.  What I meant to say was that old cows will, we expect, be cleared off at Roscrea in the making of meat meal.  Then we can follow up with the Tuberculosis Order in each particular county after it has been cleared of old cows.  That does not mean that the Tuberculosis Order will be confined to old cows.  It will be applied to all animals.  Senator Baxter wants to know whether that will be applied voluntarily.  Well, it will be practically voluntary.  We mean to follow the present practice, which is practically a voluntary procedure.  A farmer notifies the Gárda that he suspects he has a tubercular cow, and the Gárda notify the secretary of the county council.  A veterinary surgeon is then sent along to examine the animal.  If he says that he thinks the cow is tubercular it must be slaughtered.  I think it is the practice of most veterinary surgeons in cases like that to examine the whole herd. In that case the veterinary surgeon is entitled to insist on a number of cows being slaughtered, if he believes they <Col N="962" /> are tubercular.  It is the practice also, I believe, in some places, if a veterinary surgeon sees an animal at a fair or a market that he believes to be tubercular, to give a direction to have that animal slaughtered.  That is as far as we intend to go in a compulsory way.</P>
      <P>In regard to compensation, we have to follow the Principal Act.  The procedure is that the owner of the animal and the veterinary surgeon agree upon a price or upon the value of the animal. The value agreed upon is the price which an ordinary buyer would pay for the animal if he were not aware that the animal was tubercular.  If they do not agree upon the value of the animal, an arbitrator is called in to value the animal, and the same practice will be followed in this case.  The experience is that arbitrators are very seldom called in, which goes to show that the veterinary surgeons are on the whole generous in their valuation.  Working on that value, if the beast is slaughtered and found to be not tubercular the owner gets that value plus £1.  The present practice is that if the animal is not advanced in tuberculosis the farmer gets three-fourths of the price, and if it is in an advanced stage of tuberculosis he gets one-fourth of its value.  We intend in administering this Bill to give better compensation than has been given in the past.  In fact, our minimum would be £2 10s., because if we do not give a minimum of £2 10s.  I am afraid the farmers would send all their tubercular cattle to Roscrea.  We do not want that. We want to keep tubercular cows out of Roscrea if possible, so that we will have to give a good minimum price for tubercular cattle slaughtered.  There will be no such thing in future as the payment of £1 compensation.  The minimum will be £2 10s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that Senator Miss Browne mentioned the warble fly. That is a matter that has been under consideration for some time.  As a matter of fact Senator Counihan has been reminding us of it and he intended to get some legislation introduced to deal with it.  The only difficulty I see is that we cannot deal with the warble fly unless the authorities <Col N="963" /> in Northern Ireland deal with it at the same time because, of course, the Border will not stop the warble fly coming across.  We must therefore act simultaneously.  There is a chance that, perhaps not immediately but in the near future, an attempt will be made to deal with the warble fly in the two areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The authorities in Great Britain are beginning to move in the matter and are considering the bringing in of legislation to deal with it. When they do so, the authorities in Northern Ireland and ourselves will be practically compelled to take similar measures because if not, our cattle will not be allowed into Britain.  That is perhaps the best way to get Northern Ireland and the Free State to act at the same time. I do not think that the question of contagious abortion arises under this Bill but neither on economical nor ethical grounds could I approve of the practices to which Senators referred.  The cost of the administration of this Bill has been referred to.  Of course if as some people say our cattle are infected with tuberculosis it would cost £10,000,000 because it would mean that three-quarters of the cattle of the country would have to be slaughtered.  It will not however cost anything like that.  We had veterinary surgeons working last year investigating the incidence of tuberculosis and contagious abortion but they did not cover sufficient territory to give us a true picture of the country.  Their findings showed that in some territories the incidence of these diseases was very high and that in some districts it was extremely low but we would have to cover the whole country to have any idea of how things actually stand.  I estimate the cost for this financial year to be about £10,000, because we shall not be <Col N="964" /> able to cover more than two or three counties by the time County Kerry has been cleared of old cows. It will take about three months to do that.  It is probably the biggest county that has to be dealt with from that point of view.  We shall then go through the other counties and we shall follow that up with the tuberculosis order.  We shall not get very far in this financial year and I think it is fairly safe to estimate that it will cost not more than £10,000 for this financial year.</P>

      <P>Much of what I said on the Fisheries (Tidal Waters) Amendment Bill would apply to this Bill also, that is, that we expect to have comprehensive legislation brought in in relation to all fisheries within twelve months.  In the meantime we want to leave matters as they are.  Under the Fisheries Act of 1925, Section 13 enabled boards of conservators to strike a rate on the value of the private fisheries in their territory. That, with the income from licences, made up their total revenue.</P>
      <P>Naturally these rates formed a considerable part of the revenue of the boards of conservators, and if that source of income were removed they would have very little chance of paying bailiffs and other people concerned with the conservation of fisheries.  It is proposed, in this Bill, to extend that period for two years and to cover the interim period also.  There is also in that section a provision to the extent that, if the local authority makes a grant of more than an equivalent of 1d. in the £, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health makes good that excess to the local authority. These provisions are being renewed for a period of two years, and I ask the Seanad to agree.</P>

      <P>This Bill is brought in to amend the Principal Act passed last year.  It contains two or three rather large <Col N="967" /> principles and a number of small amendments.  In the first place, we are changing from the free beef scheme to a contributory scheme.  At the time that the free beef scheme was introduced, it was felt&mdash;and I remember saying it both in the Dáil and Seanad &mdash;that it would be preferable to have a contributory scheme and that we hoped to be able to change from a free beef scheme to a contributory scheme.  We felt, however, at the time that it would be better to carry on the scheme on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis, but that, eventually, we would change over to the provisions embodied in this Bill.  There are also other points, some of which may, possibly, be more important.  Section 5 in this Bill, which has to do with the deletion of certain parts of Section 12 of the Principal Act, is not as formidable as, at first sight, it might appear. The position has been that when we have to produce evidence in a court on the matter of the Minister's certificate, the opposing person might ask: &ldquo;How do we know that it is actually the Minister's certificate?&rdquo;  and then we had to send an officer from the Department to prove that the document was actually the Minister's document.  This section, I understand, has the effect of compelling the Justice to accept the document for what it purports to be, and in that way saves us the expense of sending an officer from the Department down to the country, but it does not in any way interfere with the rights of the plaintiff in the case.  He has the same rights as heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next thing is Sections 6 and 7 which amend Sections 14 and 18 of the Principal Act.  They merely mean that more power is given to inspectors to examine the contents of a premises when they come to a premises.  Up to the present, they had not power to examine skins, offals, and hides, and so on, and sometimes, when asked to verify figures given by the victualler, they were prevented by the person concerned, who was sometimes quite a good lawyer, from verifying their figures.  Sections 8 and 9 deal with weighing facilities.  We found, from <Col N="968" /> experience there also, that where an inspector goes in to a victualler and suspects that the number given of sheep or cattle slaughtered is not a true record, and where, in order to verify the matter, he asks the registered person to weigh the remaining meat hanging up in his shop, the person says: &ldquo;I have no scales.&rdquo;  While it is quite possible that, in some cases, they might not have scales, we have found, through experience, that in some cases, they did away with their scales so as to evade the Act, or that they would say that the scales they had were inadequate.  The effect of this section is that, where the victualler says that his scales are inadequate, the inspector can ask him to cut down the carcase so as to fit the scales.</P>
    <P>Section 10 was considered a drastic section by certain members of the Dáil. This section gives the Minister power to serve an order on certain registered persons to buy only from the Minister, or to buy his cattle from a person appointed by the Minister.  The history of that section is interesting. About three months ago I had a meeting of the Consultative Council that was appointed under the Principal Act. That Consultative Council is composed of butchers, exporters, victuallers, and so on.  Everybody admitted, even the victuallers, that the minimum price was not being paid by many people. I asked if there was any suggestion for remedying that matter and one member of the Consultative Council suggested this method as a remedy.  It appeared to me at the time to be one method at least of dealing with the abuses that had crept in.  I must say that the victuallers who were present at the Consultative Council did not agree with the suggestion, but the majority of the Consultative Council thought it was the best way of dealing with it.  We then found from experience that there are many victuallers in the country who were in the habit, before the Principal Act came into operation, of buying cattle from surrounding farmers, but, since the Principal Act came in, they buy from one farmer or dealer.  In the books, they show that they are paying the minimum <Col N="969" /> price, but the farmer or dealer from whom they buy is not paying anything like the minimum price to the people from whom he buys.  It is very suspicious, at least, that a butcher should change his system of buying and buy through one person.  We, in the Department, cannot prove that he is doing anything wrong because his books show that he has done everything correctly and we cannot see any other method of dealing with such men than the method suggested here.  If, however, the Seanad could suggest a better method, I am quite open to conviction.</P>
    <P>Section 11 and Section 15 both deal with the time of slaughter, but they are two very different sections.  Under Section 11 the Minister may serve a notice on a registered proprietor that he must not slaughter unless he has first given 24 hours' notice to the inspector. That is designed to deal with individuals who are very hard to catch out but who are fairly obviously evading the payment of levies.  For instance, where an inspector visits a slaughtering premises or a victualler's shop and where he invariably finds that the number of sheep hanging up corresponds with the number slaughtered that week, that is, whether he goes on Monday or Thursday or Friday, the particular butcher is only commencing to sell meat for that week, he cannot prove anything, but it is obviously not the truth.  I do not want to give the impression at all that I am speaking of all butchers; it is only a small minority who are evading the Act in this way.  They have a very good intelligence system and they know when the inspector is coming, and if they have four sheep carcases hanging up in the shop, by the time the inspector arrives the entry in the book is that they killed four sheep that week and the inspector cannot do anything.  The butcher must first serve notice before he kills any cattle or sheep and notify the inspector so that the inspector may be present if he wishes to verify the number killed.</P>
    <P>Section 15 is quite different.  It is a general section dealing with the time of slaughter.  It prohibits slaughter on <Col N="970" /> Sunday and also prohibits slaughter within certain hours.  The section is only to be used to prohibit slaughter within rather unreasonable hours.  We intend, of course, to give a working day.  Slaughter may be allowed between 8 o'clock and 8 o'clock, or between 8 o'clock and 6 o'clock.  We fix the hours according to the areas, so that we may fall in with whatever custom there is in the different areas with regard to half-holidays, bank holidays and Church holidays.  It is a general section which is not meant to penalise anybody, but to regulate slaughtering within reasonable limits. There are victuallers, for instance, at the present moment who are very insistent that they must slaughter their cattle and sheep between 12 o'clock and 2 o'clock in the morning.  We think that is not necessary, and it will be stopped under this section.</P>
    <P>Section 12 gives powers of search for cattle and sheep.  The meaning of the section is plain, but whether Senators agree or not I do not know.  There is, however, no difficulty about understanding its meaning.  It is that an inspector may ask a person in charge of sheep or cattle any questions with regard to matters on which he requires information as to the numbers there, the numbers that came in during the week, the numbers that went out and so on, in order to verify any information he might have from the registered person or from the victualler.  Section 13 is somewhat like Section 5 with regard to the recovery of levies.  The account submitted to the court will be taken as being a correct account until it is disproved by the other person. We send the account down in writing to the District Justice, and the District Justice accepts that as the account without our having to send an officer there to prove that it is the account submitted by the Minister.  In that way we may avoid considerable expense entailed in sending officers from headquarters to vouch for these accounts.  The local inspector will naturally be present to do anything necessary with regard to proving the figures and so on.</P>
    <P>Section 14 is not a penal section <Col N="971" /> either.  There are cases&mdash;a number of cases, as a matter of fact&mdash;of persons who commenced to slaughter cattle and sheep while awaiting registration. They thought they were not doing anything wrong.  Afterwards, when we came to collect the levy from the registered person, as he afterwards became registered, he made returns of having slaughtered certain cattle and sheep before his registration arrived. The Department is not empowered under the Principal Act to accept those levies, and the only thing we could do is to prosecute the man for slaughtering cattle without being registered. We do not want to do that, because it was only a mistake on his part in having commenced business a few days before he should have, and the easiest thing is to accept the levies and say there was no offence committed.  On the other hand, it does not make it legal for a person who is not registered to slaughter.  If any person deliberately slaughters for consumption in Saorstát Eireann, as laid down in the Principal Act, and does not register, he will still be guilty of an offence and will be dealt with under the Principal Act as well as paying his levies under this section.</P>
    <P>Section 16 more or less strengthens Section 25 of the Principal Act, which deals with the minimum price.  Under that section of the Principal Act there was no offence committed unless the registered person had actually bought the cattle and bought them under the minimum price.  What very often occurred was that a registered person went to buy cattle, and when the seller, after some little negotiation said: &ldquo;I will sell at the minimum price&rdquo; the buyer immediately went away stating that the cattle were not suitable, knowing that he was dealing with a dangerous man, and had no further dealings with him.  This makes it an offence for a person to offer or agree or contract to buy, so that if he went on to make a bargain, even if he did not close it, which would be offering or agreeing to pay less than the minimum price, he is guilty of an offence.  It also absolves the seller from any guilt <Col N="972" /> if he enters into a bargain like that with a buyer.</P>
    <P>Section 17 requires explanation. Under the Principal Act the Minister had to be satisfied that the manufacturer was guilty of an offence under the Act before he could remove the licence.  The change here is not because the Minister wants greater power, but for this reason: the Minister may hold a licence, and want to give it up.  But he could not do so unless he accused himself of having contravened the Act.  This section is to enable him to do that without having to accuse himself of having contravened the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 18 exempts the manufacturer from certain provisions of the Principal Act, or gives the Minister power to do so.  The obvious question to any Senator is whether we would allow the manufacturer to buy cattle under the minimum price.  That is one of the exemptions that will be granted. There is a tinned meat factory being constructed.  These people will not be able to pay the minimum price for certain cattle that they will have to buy.  They will require rather thin cattle, for part of their business, and it would be unfair to compel them to pay the minimum price laid down for fat cattle.  These people will require a certain number of stores.  They will be matured cattle without any great excess of fat, and there is no reason why they should be compelled to pay more than the market price for stores.  The rest of the Bill, from Section 19 to the end, deals with the free beef sections, and the change from free to a contributory system.  Sections 19 and 21 empower the Minister to give tinned beef instead of fresh in certain cases.  Sections 23 and 24 and the Schedule are to amend the Principal Act in consequence of the change from free beef to the contributory scheme.  I think I have now dealt with the principal points that arise under the Bill, but I shall be only too glad to give any further information that may be required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not stated anything about the financial effect of the sections to which he last <Col N="973" /> referred.  I take it that they will have considerable financial effect.  When the Principal Act was introduced the Government arranged that free beef should be given to certain persons.  As a contribution to the cost of that free beef they arranged a levy for beasts on sale.  As far as I can gather, under this Bill the levy is still to continue, but free beef is to end.  The Government has been paying 4d. a lb. for free beef.  I do not know what arrangements are contemplated with regard to the future.  The Minister did not forecast any.  He said that people getting cheap beef will pay 2d. and the Government will pay 2d. and the position, as far as I can see, is simply we have here another aspect of the Budget. Here we have people, who heretofore were in receipt of free beef, being asked to give twopence or three halfpence or a penny or whatever the sum may be as a contribution towards the Exchequer.  If it was not a case of making these people pay what is in effect a tax, we would have the levies reduced.  It seems to me that in the scheme as originally introduced they hang together.  We had free beef and a levy.  Now the free beef is going but the levy is to continue.  If that is not taxing those who hitherto were recipients of free beef, the Government would reduce the levy so as to let the butchers, and through them the purchasers, off the amount that will henceforward be contributed by those who are getting free beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government probably have already, in a general way, made up their minds upon this matter.  They have decided at what date the section will be brought into operation, and what contribution those who are to get the advantage of the latter section of the Bill will have to make.  I hope before the Second Reading passes, the Minister will give us some more information. I hope he will state what are the arrangements that are going to be made.  He should tell us whether, for instance, the total price is to remain as at present, fourpence, or whether it is recognised by the Minister that that is low, and whether there is going to be an increase in the total price, and what are the respective proportions <Col N="974" /> that will be paid by the Department, and paid by others getting meat, and, generally, what will be the effect upon the State financially of the change in the arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to Section 10 as a very drastic section.  I think it is a very drastic section.  I am afraid hardships will be suffered under it, and that there will be grave danger of injustice being inflicted.  The object is to force butchers to pay the minimum price.  I do not think that anything the Minister could do will force traders to pay something more than the market price of the goods they buy.  Even, if by means of penalties and by means of extra inspectors, the Minister makes difficult the forms of evasion to which he alluded, and that are practised heretofore, other forms which will amount to evasion will be invented.  If a butcher is going to pay more than the market price of an animal to a particular seller, he certainly will be conferring a favour upon that seller.  It is picking a man out amongst others by giving something more than would be given in the ordinary course of business.  Now somehow or other, a great lot of traders will find means of getting repayment for that sort of favour.  It may be that there will be secret &ldquo;luck pennies&rdquo; in certain cases; that is a very simple method.  It may be that there will be other transactions carried out between purchasers and sellers in which consideration will be given.  Another case may be that the beast sold will not be a fat animal.  Dozens of methods can be discovered whereby a man compelled by law to give a favour to a person selling to him will manage to get value for the discrimination he exercises in favour of that person. I do not know any machinery that can be invented that is going to make such a scheme watertight.  I admit that because of that fact it is impossible for the Minister to provide penal machinery by which the guilt is determined and punishments are allocated.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were to have no power to act, as was suggested and <Col N="975" /> as I think it could be argued would be right, except there had been a case proven in court and a conviction, he would only succeed in inflicting the extra penalties that are set forth in the Bill on very few persons.  But even if the Minister is determined to retain the power to go on with this business of trying to force people to pay a price that is above the market price, and even if he is determined to take powers to deal administratively with those who offend, I think he might adopt a somewhat different scheme from what is embodied in this Bill.  If these provisions stand, what will happen is that individuals who are a little less expert than their neighbours, but who are not behaving very differently, will suffer drastic punishment and in some cases their being punished or not being punished will depend on the attitude of some official towards them, of his peculiar outlook, the degree of suspiciousness which is in his character, and so on.</P>
    <P>This power in Section 10 is to be exercised when there is no proof, is to be exercised on suspicion, according to what the Minister says, because a man, in changing his method of trading, has begun to get supplies in a somewhat different way.  It may well be that an individual has changed his habits in this respect without offending, and, while it may be reasonable to suspect him, it would be very serious to punish him in the way he might be punished under this section.  He can be prohibited from purchasing the animals he requires from farmers or cattle dealers. He can be compelled to take them from a person appointed by the Minister.  He can be compelled to take them at such price as the Minister may fix.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the intention is, and the Minister has not stated it, in regard to price.  Does the Minister intend that the animals shall be supplied at the minimum price, which, presumably, is a high price for them, as otherwise it would not be necessary to put the section in force at all, or will the man have to pay 2½ or 10 per cent. more than the minimum price? <Col N="976" /> Under sub-section (4) the Minister could charge anything he likes for the cost of administering this measure.  If he has to have extra inspectors, or if they spend a considerable time on this business, he can charge the whole cost to whatever persons get the notices under Section 10, and that could easily drive a man out of business.  Even if the animals are supplied at approximately the minimum price, there are different sorts of trade to be considered. For instance, one butcher supplies customers who may have certain preferences, and another butcher supplies a different class of customers and for that reason he buys a different animal.  With the best will in the world, and without any desire to disregard the interests of the particular butcher concerned, the inspector operating in his area might not buy him the animals necessary to enable him to keep his trade.  In that way he might almost be driven out of business.</P>
    <P>It will be seen that Section 10 gives tremendous powers to the Minister and contemplates what will mean in reality very serious punishment being inflicted on mere suspicion.  The methods of evasion are so many that a person cannot be detected and brought to book before an ordinary court.  I do not think the sort of appeal that was inserted in the Committee or Report Stage in the Dáil could be regarded as satisfactory.  An appeal from the Minister to the Minister is not likely to give good results.  I do not know whether the Minister could alter the section so that an inspector would make the order, or some official specially authorised would make it, and that there should be in the Department some sort of appeals officer, a different person not concerned with the making of the order, to hear the representations put forward.</P>
    <P>As the matter stands, the case will be made up by officials of the Department. A memorandum will be prepared for the Minister advising that a prohibitory order be served on a certain butcher.  The Minister initials it, and the order duly issues.  Then the Minister receives some representations from the person concerned.  It is <Col N="977" /> unlikely that person can say anything that will not be on the file already, and it is unlikely the Minister will be moved to reverse his original decision.  I think it would be better if the Minister were kept out of it.  It may be the whole thing may be done under seal without coming to the Minister, but if it is, it is the one person who will make the original decision and consider the appeal.  I think it would be better if arrangements could be made so that the prohibitory notice would be issued by one officer while another officer would consider the representations that may be made.</P>
    <P>I also suggest there ought to be a term to every prohibitory notice. There is power in the section for the Minister to withdraw the prohibitory notice, but as this may be a very severe punishment, and I think it is bound to be a fairly severe punishment in every case, there ought to be a term to the notice.  The life of a prohibitory notice ought to be a month or perhaps three months, and it ought to lapse, with power to the Minister to withdraw it earlier if he thinks it necessary.  I remember some years ago there was tremendous opposition in the Dáil to the possibility, under an existing law for certain revenue offences, of people being kept in prison almost indefinitely. I think arrangements have been made to change that.  I think it is undesirable that on suspicion it might be possible for a person to be prohibited as long as this Act remains in operation from purchasing cattle for himself.</P>
    <P>There is this phrase in the section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Whenever the Minister serves a prohibitory notice he shall make arrangements to provide cattle....</P>
    <P>That ought to read: &ldquo;Before the Minister serves a prohibitory notice he shall make arrangements....&rdquo;  With the difficulties there are about Departmental machinery operating, a man might get a prohibitory notice, and it might be three weeks or a month before arrangements would be made to supply cattle to him.</P>
    <P>With regard to Section 11, I do not see any provision for a withdrawal of <Col N="978" /> this notice.  This is not penal to anything like the same extent as the other section, but to make it impossible for a man to slaughter cattle when the exigencies of his trade make it necessary is something in the way of a penalty.  It may in certain cases impose considerable inconvenience and cause a loss of trade.  Apparently it is an obligation that is only going to be imposed on those of whom the Department have suspicion and whose conduct in relation to the provisions of this Act seems unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I think that there ought to be some provision for the withdrawal of such notice.  I do not think that it is necessary and it is not so penal that the terms should be limited&mdash;it is not so fixed as in the other case&mdash;but I think it is desirable that some arrangement should be made to enable the Minister after a time to withdraw it. Because while these things may be necessary in view of the general position&mdash;and seeing what the scheme of the Bill as a whole is&mdash;they are in a sense undesirable in so far as practicable punishments should only follow the conviction by a court on evidence. Where anything of a penal nature is done all possible safeguards should surround it.  Therefore, so far as possible, power should be given not to have the penalty too severe or of too long continuance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has taken a very unusual course in introducing this Bill.  He directed the attention of the Seanad to Section 10 with a view to getting the ideas of the Seanad upon the principle, the scope and implications of that section.  I have often thought in the course of the last two or three years that the purchase and sale of all cattle by an officer of the Minister would lay the foundation for indemnifying the agricultural community in respect of any special losses which they may have incurred as a result of the political circumstances of the time.  For that reason I welcome the idea that is contained in this section&mdash;the idea of purchase by an officer of the Minister. But I think it would only be just if <Col N="979" /> it were of universal application.  To apply that to one man I think will work and must work injustice.  In the first place it is a grave reflection upon his honesty.</P>
      <P>No man ought to be deprived of the free market which every butcher ought to have unless he is a thorough rogue. That is the conclusion at which I would arrive, knowing something of what people think in the country. Because if there is a butcher who is in the position that he cannot get any cattle except through an officer of the Minister, well that man's character is gone no matter whether other butchers have been defrauding the revenue or not.  It is a very serious thing to take away both the livelihood and the character of a butcher.  I would suggest, if there is any other means of dealing with the matter, that that should not be done except on the report of an officer countersigned by another and independent officer.  That is a matter that was suggested by Senator Blythe and I think it would be very necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister introduced this section it was obviously clear to me that it did not accord with his own sense of justice.  I say that because he took the very unusual course of asking the opinion of the various Senators upon this section.  I hope the Senators will give their opinions upon it fairly and frankly.  Something should be done.  The difficulty is there.  Undoubtedly there is a fraud going on, fraud in the way suggested by Senator Blythe and fraud in one hundred other ways.  I buy a fat cow from a man. I give him more than the minimum price for the fat cow, but I may buy a yearling or a two-year-old for little or nothing.  We know how this thing is going on.  I sell my cow to your son and your son can sell at the minimum price.  It is almost impossible to carry out this principle of a minimum price for cattle unless and until you have the purchase made by a representative of the Minister.  It is almost impossible to carry it out properly and equitably.  Therefore, the reason why I am interested in the proposal contained <Col N="980" /> in this section is this: that I think it is the first indication of a method which must ultimately be resorted to if conditions in this country remain for any length of time as they are at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this Bill and I oppose it for the reasons that I opposed the Principal Act&mdash;it is revolutionary and it interferes drastically with the rights of an important body of citizens of this State.  The only advantage the Minister will get out of this Bill will be that it will help him to collect his levies more effectively, but it will be no benefit or improvement to the Principal Act so far as getting butchers or exporters to pay the minimum price.  The Principal Act so far as that goes is an Act which it is impossible to amend or to make a workable proposition.  The Minister blames the butchers for the breakdown in the Principal Act.  He blames the exporters and he blames the farmers for its breakdown.  I blame the Minister, and I think he is more blameworthy than any of the people on whom he is trying to put the blame. The Minister has frequently and openly ignored the provisions of the Principal Act himself.  There is a section in the Principal Act which says that the Minister in fixing the minimum price for cattle shall take into account the cost of production.  In his Order he fixed the price at 25/- per cwt. live weight for the best cattle. At that time the Minister was paying a bounty of 35/- per beast.  When the Minister fixed the 25/- per cwt. it was intended for grass-fed cattle.  At the time that the stall-fed cattle are due to be sold, he lowered the price to 22/- and he cut the bounty to £1.  Does the Minister think that an economic price, or that it met the cost of production for stall-fed cattle?  I submit that the Minister's action was a flagrant violation of the provisions of the Principal Act.  The Minister can have no excuse for not carrying out the law.  Because of his own action he should not censure certain classes of traders who did break the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="981" /> In my opinion the butchers could easily pay the minimum price.  I have no sympathy for them.  When the price of 25/- per cwt. was fixed, the exporters could not pay it in view of the fact that they had to pay a tariff of £6 per head on the cattle going out as well as to meet their ordinary expenses.  In fact, they could not afford to pay 22/-.  It is against human nature to think that exporters will continue to buy cattle, merely for the sake of buying them and lose money thereby.  That is what it meant to them.  The farmers, of course, did not keep their part of the bargain either, and it is hard to blame them.  They brought their cattle to the market expecting to get the 25/- per cwt. which the Minister promised they would get under the Principal Act.  Their experience was that nobody offered them 25/- per cwt. They remained on the market for three or four hours and at the end of that time, seeing other people selling their stock, these farmers sold theirs at the best price they could get.  Personally, I do not sell very many cattle to butchers.  I do not think that there is 1 per cent. of the butchers in the Free State now or at any time paying the minimum price. There is no minimum price for exporters. The butchers are not paying it, and will not pay it so long as there is a surplus of cattle on the market.</P>
    <P>The Minister himself could afford to pay the minimum price when he started buying cattle for Germany and Belgium.  There was no £6 tariff on those cattle, and yet he did not pay more that 22/- per cwt. for them. That is another glaring instance of how the Minister evaded the provisions of the Principal Act.  He may say that there was no necessity to pay more: that he was able to get all the cattle he wanted at 22/- That was the excuse he gave the other day for not raising the price for wheat above 23/6 per barrel.  He said that he was able to get plenty of farmers to grow considerable quantities of wheat at that price, and that there was no reason why he should pay more until the farmers refused to <Col N="982" /> grow it at that price.  I can tell him that he can get cattle at less than 22/- per cwt.  He can get them at 17/- or 18/- if that is his top price. But is there any reason why the Minister should cut the price below the cost of production?  It is no excuse for the Minister to say that people were falling over one another to get the German and Belgian buyers to take their cattle at 22/-.  Those buyers will get all the cattle they want at that price because there is no £6 duty on them as there is on the cattle going into the British market.  In the latter case, the Minister is only giving a 20/- bounty as a refund on the £6 duty.  That explains why the German and the Belgian buyers are able to get all the cattle they want at 22/-.</P>
    <P>Before this dispute started with England we used to export to that country about 450,000 head of fat cattle.  According to the British definition of fat cattle, we would still, if the circumstances were normal, be exporting that number to England.  I believe that a fat beast is defined to be one that is 52 per cent. of its live weight.  In previous years a good many of the cattle now classified as fat used to go in as store cattle.  Because of the fact that they are now classified as fat cattle, they must be exported under a licence for fat cattle.  Yet, in spite of all that, we still have a very considerable surplus of cattle in the country, and while that is so it will be impossible to compel the butcher or anybody else to pay the minimum price.  I do not believe they will do it. I do not believe that one per cent. of the butchers of the country are paying the minimum price.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words on Section 10, which has been referred to by Senator Blythe, Senator Comyn and the Minister.  It is a section that, I think, should either be eliminated or drastically amended.  It is a terrible thing to go out and name one or two butchers, to brand them as rogues or thieves, when everybody in the country knows&mdash;I am perfectly sure the Minister and his officials know&mdash;that there are not three butchers in the City <Col N="983" /> of Dublin who have paid, or are paying, the minimum price.  Why pick out two or three butchers and say to them that they must buy their cattle from the Government buyers at a fixed price, and that otherwise they will not be allowed to trade!  I think a more equitable way of dealing with the situation would be that suggested by Senator Comyn, namely, to take the buying out of the hands of all the butchers, the Government to supply cattle to them.  There should be no exceptions.  I have been told on what I regard as very good authority that there are not three butchers in Dublin paying the minimum price.  I know plenty of them, but personally I do not know one who is paying it.  I think they are all buying at very much less than the minimum price.  We have been told on high authority that the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah was destroyed because seven just men could not be found in them.  If three just men cannot be found amongst the butchers in the City of Dublin, I suggest that they should go in with the others, and that the buying of cattle should be taken out of the hands of all of them.</P>
    <P>We all know that each butcher has a special trade of his own.  One man will buy old cows, another, light heifer beef, another, strong heavy bullock beef, and some will buy all classes of cattle to meet the requirements of their trade.  It will be very difficult for the Minister to fix all that, and to keep the butchers in the same trade, and under the same conditions, as previously. Another consideration that the Minister should take into account, before supplying all the butchers, is that many of them have a weekly credit, sometimes with the Dublin salesmen and sometimes with farmers. If the Minister is going to take over the business, is he going to give credit to the butchers for a week, a fortnight or a month?  Will he consider the position of cattle salesmen in whose books they are for previous supplies? These are things that the Minister will want to consider before he thinks of taking over the supplying of victuallers. As Senator Comyn stated, <Col N="984" /> if he is going to act fairly he must take over the whole business and not victimise a few.  Everybody knows that there are only three, out of all the butchers operating in Dublin, paying the minimum prices.  That being so, all of them deserve to be taken over. Section 11 imposes too many restrictions on butchers.  Such restrictions might be all right in a city like Dublin or in big towns.  It would be a big handicap in other parts of the country if 24 hours' notice had to be given before a beast was killed.  Apart from the loss to the butchers, great inconvenience would be caused to the general public in some parts by such a provision.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear a further explanation from the Minister of Section 12, dealing with powers of search for cattle and sheep.  As I understand it, an inspector might enter any farm or house where he suspected cattle were kept and could demand records, invoices and particulars, although the owner might have no connection with butchers or might not be in the habit of selling to them.  If Senator Wilson goes to the west of Ireland, attends a couple of fairs, and brings back cattle, according to the section, if an inspector came along he would have to give an account of the prices he paid for the cattle, and when and where he bought them.  I do not think it is just to the farming community to give an inspector power to put them to such inconvenience.  Of course, the Minister says that will not occur and that no inspector should have power to do that.  Section 14 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Every person who, after the commencement of Part II of the Principal Act and either before or after the passing of this Act, slaughters in any premises which, at the time of such slaughter, were or are not registered in the register of slaughtering premises, any cattle or sheep for human consumption in Saorstát Eireann, shall, if the said non-registration of the said premises was or is a contravention of the said Part II, be liable to pay to the Minister <Col N="985" /> on demand made by the Minister a levy on all cattle and sheep so slaughtered.</P>
    <P>Does the section prohibit the slaughter of a sheep or lamb per week?  I believe this section is retrospective. Every sensible and honest person in the country approves of the change from free beef to cheap beef, not that they have any greater regard for the poor and the destitute than some of the Senators who applauded the original proposal, but because they believe that the free beef had a demoralising effect, and would be disastrous amongst a class of people who looked for and obtained free beef.  I know several families where up to 20 lb. of free beef went in every week.  On the other hand, I know several decent working men with big families, who earn less than a £1 a week, and who could not get free beef or cheap beef.  I suggest that the Minister might consider the question of accepting an amendment, by which cheap beef might be given to all classes of workers where the wages are under £1 a week.  A man who is working is more entitled to cheap beef than a man who is idle and who is able to stay in bed all day.  The man who is working for a small wage, and who is trying to carry on, and provide for his family, is more entitled to be fed than the man who is lazy, idle, and drawing the dole.</P>

      <P>It is difficult not to sympathise with the Minister in what one might almost call the colossal task he undertook when the original Act was passed.  In attempting what he did then I think he was attempting the impossible.  At any rate, there is general recognition of the fact that the Act did not succeed in doing what the Minister hoped it would do.  As a consequence this Bill has been introduced. Senator Counihan is very sceptical as to the success of the Bill. He was sceptical when the original Act was passed.  I think it is true to say that hardly any Bill introduced was as terrifying on the face of it as this Bill.  Some of the sections, if <Col N="986" /> operated as they might be, would no doubt be the most extreme effort in law which the Oireachtas has passed. On the other hand, when Senators ask themselves what line of action they should take on such a Bill, it is conceivable that the Minister, having got the decision of the Oireachtas previously, and having got a mandate to act as he did, is entitled when the previous Act did not succeed, to get this Bill.  This Bill is complementary to legislation already passed.  The effects no doubt might very easily be disastrous to a number of people in the butchering business.  I feel that what we have to do is to look at the position as it will be when the Bill is passed.  We have to act as if the original Act will now be made operative, and have the effect it was intended to have, so far as the farmer as a producer and a seller of a commodity is concerned, and at the same time see that its operation, combined with this Bill, will not press hardly or unjustly on other decent responsible citizens.  I have grave doubts if it be possible to get legislation which will have that effect.  I have grave doubts that the operation of this Bill, in conjunction with the previous Act, will give the farmer the minimum price if other factors do not exist to make the ground favourable.  If, on the other hand, the Act be administered as it might well be administered, the consequences for butchers all over the country will be exasperating and, in some cases, very inequitable indeed. The general position, so far as I have been able to ascertain, is that, in spite of the Minister's legislation, there has not been any increased consumption of meat in the country.  That is the result of my inquiries into the matter.  If the Minister has any information at his disposal showing the effects of this free beef scheme, I should like to have it.  My information is that butchers to-day are passing no more meat out of their shops than they were before the Free Meat Bill became law.  Cash customers have, in many cases, I am told, fallen away and the butchers have been put into the position of selling meat at 4d. per lb. to <Col N="987" /> many people who previously purchased it from them at a considerably higher figure.  The Minister may have evidence to the contrary.  If he has, it would be well if we had that evidence. The difficulty is as regards the disposal of the surplus fat cattle.  At the Committee of Agriculture in Cavan yesterday, we found ourselves in a position in which we could issue only 44 licences for 365 cattle for the month of August.  If we can only export 44 head of cattle and the balance are available for killing and eating in the county for that month, is it not difficult to calculate what the butchers ought to pay to the farmer when the farmer wants to sell and has to sell to pay his rates and find money for other charges?  That is the kernel of the whole problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to Section 10, I have no knowledge that there is any such drastic legislation operating.  From the Minister's statement, one gathers that the Bill has been framed because a number of butchers, up and down the country, are not as honest as he thinks they ought to be and have not been playing the game.  The results to the others are going to be very disturbing.  I take it that the Bill would be administered in a reasonable and sensible way.  Butchers whom I met had no complaints about the administration of the existing Act.  They found the officials courteous and reasonable.  I take it that that will continue to be the policy but, as Senator Blythe pointed out, cases may arise in which it may appear, for one reason or another, that a man is breaking the law.  A court might not take the same view. To put an individual in the position of being really guilty without being convinced that he is seems to be hardly equitable.  The Minister says that he finds butchers buying all their cattle from the same individuals. The last thing which ought to be attempted is the buying of cattle by officials.  Would there not be the same opportunities for these officials to buy from the same individuals and might it not be difficult for them <Col N="988" /> not to buy from certain individuals? That is the last thing that ought to be attempted.  I have no doubt that the Minister has no desire to make such a section as that operative but the powers are there and the circumstances may arise.  If it is to be made operative, justice should be done.  Under Section 10 and the sections following, I am not quite clear whether the individual could kill his own cattle after the Minister takes certain action.  I think it is true that a number of the people in the butchering business have as many cattle on hands as would carry them on for six months after the passing of this Bill.  I take it it would be possible to do this, but it is not quite clear.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that Section 15, which refers to the restrictions on the time of sale, is a general section.  It seems to me that, when the Minister is going to make an order, he should do so in consultation with the trade, and I suggest that there is a necessity for an amendment there.  That might be done without having any provision in the Bill, but it would be better to have a provision.  Senator Blythe raised a question to which the House would like to have an answer, that is the price at which the free beef will be available. I do not know whether the Minister proposes to give these figures now, but it would be a good thing if we did know, because the farther we can look ahead the better.  We saw what they did in England within the last couple of days.  Farmers there know what they are going to get for meat up to 1936.  It would be well if the Minister would indicate his views on that question.</P>
    <P>As regards Section 21, the Minister will appoint the persons by whom the canned beef is to be supplied.  Is it the intention that the persons to be appointed will be persons in the trade already, or is it the intention to set up distributing centres under the supervision of an inspector? Under Section 22, the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, contract with any person for <Col N="989" /> the supply of beef.  We see what is happening with regard to the distribution of the free beef.  We see the decisions taken by certain butchers in certain districts with regard to the supplies of free beef because they are not satisfied with the conditions.  It seems to me possible under this section for the Minister to decide that it should be distributed at a certain figure.  If the Minister fails to make a contract on his terms, what does he propose to do?  How would he meet the situation? Would he meet it by setting up a distributing centre of his own?</P>
    <P>The appearance of this Bill generally has had a very disturbing effect amongst a certain section of the community. On the other hand, a number of farmers are hopeful that it will have the result of giving them the fixed minimum price of 22/- per cwt.  The Minister knows as well as anybody in this House how little 22/- per cwt. really goes towards the cost of beef production.  While, with the best will in the world, we may be anxious to help to raise the price for the producer through the passage of this Bill, I think the Minister might honestly express the view that unless certain other factors operate favourably, unless the price of meat outside this country goes up, and unless it be possible for us to export more fat cattle than we are exporting at present, the difficulties of making this legislation effective are very great indeed.  If we knew, for instance, as possibly the Minister does know, the approximate number of cattle available for export for the next six months and, in addition, the number that we would be permitted to export, we would have some idea as to the possibilities of the Minister's aim being attained through the passage of this Bill.  In the meantime, the Minister, I think, will forgive some of us if we are very sceptical as to the value of the measure and very doubtful that it will do what the Minister is hopeful it will do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to speak on any part of this Bill except Section 10.  The Bill has been thoroughly ventilated in the course of <Col N="990" /> this debate, and I do not wish to take up the time of the House any more than to say a few words on that section. It is not to be assumed, however, that I approve of the rest of the Bill, because I do not.  I do not like it as a piece of legislation, any more than I did the Principal Act. But Section 10 really seems to me to reach a sort of high-water mark in bureaucratic legislation.  We are getting rather accustomed to that kind of legislation now in this country. There used to be a great deal of talk about liberty here, but there is not much now.  There certainly is not any liberty in this class of legislation.</P>
      <P>I do really think that this particular section is going too far.  It is capable of inflicting ruin on individuals without any guarantee that they are even guilty.  I do not say that is the intention; but the legislation itself leaves opportunity for that sort of thing to occur.  Bureaucratic legislation attempts to rule the commercial life of the country in detail.  That is extremely difficult to do and it is probably impossible.  The common fate of that sort of legislation is that you have to become more and more arbitrary to make the thing work. That is what this appears to be.  This particular section appears to be so bad that I respectfully suggest to the Minister that he should reconsider the matter with a view to bringing in a Government amendment and substituting something less drastic than this because it is really going frightfully far.  I may add that I am myself a producer of cattle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I will never understand the mentality behind the arguments advanced here and down the country.  The principal wail of the farmers for a very long time was that the difference between the price the consumer had to pay and the price the butcher paid them was probably 400 per cent. and that they were being robbed.  Now, we have representatives of the farmers here bewailing the fact that the Minister proposes to endeavour, as far as possible, to see that the farmers will get a reasonable price for their animals in view of what <Col N="991" /> the consumer has to pay.  That being so, I think the farmers will deem it a great act on the part of the Minister to endeavour to see that they get a fair price for their cattle in comparison with the price the consumer has to pay.  I do not know why any farmer, or any representative of the farmers, should object to that proposal.  I think it is a most equitable and just one.  I do not know why anybody should be so solicitous about the butchers.  I think they are the one section of the trading community that has been doing exceedingly well in their business during what is called the economic pressure. It is complained that the consumer is really paying as much for his meat as when the farmer was getting a good price for his cattle, and that is really so.</P>
      <P>It was not, however, on anything contained in the Bill that I wished really to make any remarks, but on something that is not in the Bill.  Many Bills have been introduced to provide that the meat offered for sale by butchers is of sound and good quality and fit for human consumption.  What I object to is that there is no provision made to see that after the meat has been exposed for sale in a butcher's shop it still remains uncontaminated. I can never understand why a butcher's shop, above all other classes of shops, should be permitted to be an open store with chunks of meat exposed to the dirt and dust coming in from the street.  I think meat can be very easily contaminated in that way.  I wonder if the Minister could make some provision by which butchers' shops should be enclosed shops, the same as any other shops, such as grocers' and drapers' shops.  It seems almost barbaric to see chunks of meat cut up freshly, hanging about, and clouds of dust blowing up and down the streets of country towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To show how the public appreciated the fact, I might mention that in our town there was one butcher who was wise enough to reconstruct his business premises.  He converted it into an up-to-date enclosed shop with a nice window in which he was able to display <Col N="992" /> the meat even better than before in the open stall.  The result of that expenditure and foresight on the part of this butcher was that he was able to increase his business by about 300 per cent.  That is a justification for the remarks I have made and shows that the public appreciated the care which that butcher had taken, as they were certain of what they were getting there while they were never certain of the meat they got in an open stall.  I merely suggest to the Minister that he might find a way, if not now at some later period, to make some provision by which butchers' stalls would be enclosed shops in the same way as other shops.  I think nobody would object to that arrangement on any side of the House.  It might not be appropriate at this moment but it might be appropriate at some other date.  I do not wish to take up the time of the House any further at this hour of the evening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">

      <P>I am referring to the general tone of the criticism of the Bill.  This Bill, I believe, will not improve matters or, if it does, only to a very small extent.  I think it is, if anything, making confusion worse confounded. I do not want to say very much because the matter has been debated very ably by the other farmer Senators.  Senator Counihan made a remark about the distribution of free beef and I want to say that his suggestion, that it should have been given to poor agricultural labourers, was a good one.  It was made here before and I want to remind the Minister that the Wexford County Committee of Agriculture on three separate occasions sent requests to the Minister for Agriculture that free beef should be distributed to poor agricultural labourers who were getting only 7/- and 8/- per week.  The Minister completely denied that, but since his denial I have consulted three members of the county committee of agriculture and they all verified the statement that three separate requests were sent to the Minister and he turned them down. So much for his consideration for the poor agricultural labourer who wanted free beef far worse than a great many of the people who got it.</P>
      <P>This Bill is going to give the Government additional powers, but I do not believe that it is going to benefit the farmers to any extent.  I agree with Senator Baxter that the Act, so far as it was meant to help the farmers to get rid of their surplus cattle was a failure.  Now the truth remains, and it cannot be controverted, that&mdash;not that I believe the Government will recognise this for a moment &mdash;where there is a surplus supply of any cattle the price cannot be kept by Departmental regulation above its natural level.  This is no cure for the failure of the Government to act up to their responsibilities and to put the farmers into a position where they could get an economic price.  There is only one way by which that can be done and that is to give them back the market of which the Government have deliberately deprived them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are very objectionable features <Col N="994" /> in the Bill but they have been criticised so much already that I shall not go over them again.  For instance, there is Section 10.  More and more it illustrates the general tendency of Government legislation to interfere with the people and to take out of their hands the management of their own business.  That is all to the bad. Nothing could be worse.  They have already taken away the independence of the people, the farmers particularly. They have made them slaves in their own land, slaves of the Government, tenants at will of the State.  There is one class of person in this country who will not be troubled about this Bill with regard to the sale of his cattle.  I want to read a letter which came into my hands unsolicited, from a person whom I never saw and who I did not know existed until to-day.  It will put much more forcibly than any words I could command the state to which the farmers have been reduced in spite of assertions to the contrary.</P>

The flying squad at Fermoy visited <Col N="995" /> my place on Saturday, 15th June. They took 16 milking cows, leaving three that were almost dry, and those cows were the only source of regular money to pay my labour bills, etc., every week.  I had three of my little children sick in bed that morning, and were it not for the goodness of my friends those children would not have enough milk and they could eat their bread dry.  I also had had the young calves of these cows&mdash;I had not the heart to slaughter them&mdash;bawling with hunger when we had no milk for them.  They also took my working horses, leaving me without a horse to till my land or cut my corn or hay. I am since begging from my neighbours for horses to do my work. They also took what sheep and lambs were on the farm.  That did not satisfy them.  They next went to an outside farm and when they were finished there&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

I went to the sale at Fermoy, as my friends raised the money to buy them back.  I had a friend bidding. They refused to take his bid and knocked the whole lot down to themselves for £75.  'Twas all done in about ten seconds.  The whole amount, with costs, was offered to them immediately after the bogus sale; they refused to part with their loot.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the case mentioned by Senator Miss Browne&mdash; the case which I think, was a propaganda case&mdash;all I can say is that, if it is God's truth, as the person concerned alleges, he has an action, and a very good action against the sheriff.  However, I do not believe that it is &ldquo;God's truth.&rdquo;  With regard to the matter of the expenditure under this Bill and the receipts accruing, we estimated, in the beginning, that we would receive about £300,000 in levies.  I think that that is about correct, but, of course, we are in arrears in collecting those levies.  However, I think that that figure would be about right.  With the change in the distribution of beef I will give what the figures would be for a full year.  For a full year, under this Bill, the position would be, roughly, £240,000 as a contribution to the beef, £150,000 for the supply of old cows for meat meal, about £20,000 for the supply of cattle for canned beef and something like about £40,000 for purposes of administration; so that the total would be about £450,000, and the receipts would be about £150,000. If this Bill were not passed, that would be increased by something over £200,000 for free beef.  That would be the difference.  That does not take into account the export bounty on cattle and so on.  There was another item in connection with the export of cattle.  There is a certain amount of export of cattle to Belgium and Germany, but there would be no loss in that connection as far as I can see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 10 gave rise to quite a lot of discussion.  I did not say that it was a drastic section.  I said that some members of the Dáil were of opinion that it was a drastic section, and I think that Senators are taking a very serious view of it.  It does not follow at all, in the first place, that very many victuallers would be brought under this section or, in the second place, that they would be driven out of business.  All that happens is that an inspector buys the cattle.  The inspector, of course, pays the minimum price and charges the expenses as well but they will be trivial.  We do <Col N="1000" /> not intend at all to charge for the inspector's time in looking for cattle, for instance.  We only intend to pay for transport charges.  If an inspector buys cattle at a certain fair or market or at a certain farmhouse and has to pay a drover to bring the cattle in, the expense of that would be charged up. It is only such charges as the victualler would have to pay, probably in any case, if he were buying on his own that will be charged and there need be no fear that we are going to penalise a man by driving up the price to an exorbitant level.</P>
    <P>As I said in moving the Second Reading, it is the best solution we can see of the difficulty of getting certain butchers to pay the minimum price, and it must be remembered that they are only a very small number.  That small number, however, is responsible for a very big number not paying the minimum price.  I have met victuallers myself, and I am sure every Senator has met them, who complained that they started off by paying the minimum price, but that their competitor was not paying it and was underselling them and they asked what could they do but come down and buy the cattle as cheaply as their competitors or go out of business.  If we supply, under Section 10, the small minority who are responsible for making the minimum price almost inoperative with cattle and in that way get them to pay the minimum price, I think the big majority will straight away fall into paying the minimum price and we will have achieved what we are out to achieve, so far as the minimum price is concerned.  I do not want it to be misunderstood at all that the original Act dealt only with minimum price. That was one thing with which it dealt, but it was chiefly brought in to deal with the cattle surplus, which was a very big problem.  I think we have succeeded fairly well, so far as getting rid of the big surplus of cattle is concerned, and we are in a much better position now, so far as that surplus is concerned, than we were at this time last year when the Act was introduced.</P>
    <P>Senator Blythe spoke about trying to <Col N="1001" /> make this section a little more equitable with regard to the butcher. I think Senator Blythe will probably agree that drastic action like that, if you like to refer to it as drastic action, action that is going to interfere with the individual, is not taken lightly by any Department.  I might say that it is a most difficult thing to get a licence revoked, for instance, for a creamery, for a maize mill or any of those matters for which we have legislated.  It has to go through several officials and every official up the line must put his note on the file and say whether he agrees or not with the inspector who seeks the removal of the licence.  It goes through the Assistant-Secretary and the Secretary and eventually comes to me.  I think it will be found if anybody had the time to go through these files, that unless there is unanimity at least between two or three higher officials, no action is ever taken.  It will be the same here.  The inspector will propose that an order should be served on a certain victualler that he should buy for that victualler. That would come through at least four higher officials before reaching me, and, as I say, as in the case of other legislation, there is not the slightest danger that action will be taken under this unless each individual officer is satisfied from the case put by the inspector that the course suggested should be adopted.  Unless they were quite satisfied, and so state on the file, no action would be taken.</P>
    <P>I do agree with Senator Blythe that it is rather strange that after this is done the appeal should come to the Minister again.  I can remember within the last three or four days the case of a maize mill in which I had initialled, as Senator Blythe said, the serving of a notice of revocation of licence.  A letter was sent to the person involved stating that he had time to appeal against it, and he made a very good case.  It came back to me and the officers were not nearly as strong as they were in the first instance, having seen his case, but still they all recommended that the licence should go. When I saw that they had weakened, I consulted the Secretary, and said I thought that they were not as strong <Col N="1002" /> as they were in the beginning, and that it should not be proceeded with. He agreed with me, and it was withdrawn in that case.  I think that every Senator will agree that under all these Acts every opportunity is given to the registered person before any drastic action is taken and, indeed, I may say, that Departmental officials and I myself are only too glad to get an excuse for not proceeding.  If the person concerned says he made a mistake and that he was quite sure the thing would not occur again, it is nearly always taken as an excuse for not proceeding with the drastic action.  I do not want to say that if that sort of thing is tried three or four times we are going to agree, but at least for a first offence it is always taken as sufficient reason for not proceeding.</P>
    <P>I think I agree with Senator Blythe that the notice should have some time limit, but I think that, in practice, there is no doubt we will not operate under Sections 10 or 11 indefinitely. I may say that the Principal Act is expiring in any case next year, but my idea is that we would not operate that for more than three weeks.  For a first offence, we certainly would not operate it for more than three weeks and then hand back the buying of his own cattle to the person concerned, stating that we were stepping out and allowing him to buy his own cattle again and that we would see if things would go on in a better way.  Senator Counihan claims that the only advantage which this amending Bill is likely to bring to us is a better collection of levies, and he says that I blamed the butchers, the exporters, the farmers and everybody else, but that he blamed the Minister.  I did not blame anybody to any great extent here.  I blamed the original Act in that it was not drafted in a proper way to catch up with the very small number of butchers&mdash;and I want to repeat that&mdash;the small minority of butchers who were able to evade that Act.  This is like any other trade.  If you have an Act like this which compels a certain trade to pay a certain price, the big majority would prefer to see the Act administered <Col N="1003" /> drastically so that the small minority would be made to pay like the others and so that there would be no unfair competition.  It is the small minority who were not paying the minimum price I blame.  I did not blame the farmers because I did not think of them but, if I had, perhaps I would blame them, because I think the farmers did not behave well in regard to this Act.  They were afraid to stand up to the thing and to report cases.  We got reports of several cases in the Department in which the minimum price was not paid, and in every single case the farmer declined to proceed or to give evidence.  I am quite sure that if the farmers had stood strong in the beginning they could have got the Act operated, but when there was any weakening the farmer who was inclined to stand out was a marked man and was not likely to sell his cattle in future and they were afraid of that.</P>
    <P>Senator Counihan blames me because I did not give more than 22/- for cattle to Belgium and Germany.  I do not want to say that 22/- is enough. I would very much like to give double that, but how could I do it?  If Senator Counihan was in my place and had to send buyers to the Dublin market to pick out, say, 400 cattle, and if he gave much above what was the ordinary price, how would he select those from whom he will buy?  The instruction I have given to the buyers is that they must pay the minimum price of 22/-.  But I have instructed them, and I know they will do what I tell them, that if they can they should lift the market by giving a shilling or sixpence more. But if there is no one giving 22/- I do not see what advantage it would be for them to give more.  There would be a great trouble to find out to whom the benefit should be given.  It would be much better, if there is anything to be made on the German and Belgian trade, that it should be devoted to the cattle trade in general, for instance, by an increase in the export bounty. We are not able to say yet, we are not long enough at it to say, whether we <Col N="1004" /> are going to make a profit or not. But if we make a profit I shall do all I can to induce the Minister for Finance to allow me to take back that money from the Exchequer for the cattle trade in general.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said we are not long enough in the business to know.  Up to the present for the German trade I could give more, but I have been warned all the time not to depend upon the prices now.  Probably prices will slump in Germany in the autumn.  We are not guided by the prices in Germany; we have been guided by trying to bring the traders over here.  I think Senator Counihan is right when he says that before this came into operation 450,000 fat cattle would be the correct figure.  The export to Britain was about 240,000 and the home consumption about 140,000; that would be 380,000.  The Senator says it was 450,000 cattle, but I am not sure.  But I think the surplus is cleared.  The preliminary census was published a few days ago, and it shows a reduction in the cattle in the country since this time last year.  I think the number now would be lower than the average for the last ten years.  Of course we have larger consumption than the average for ten years.  Our export for stores is as big as it was.  If we have got down considerably in &ldquo;fats&rdquo; we have almost made up for that in value.  We have made up for it in the foreign market and in the provision for a canned meat factory.  Taking all these things into consideration, and looking at our cattle and the disposal of them for the last ten years, I think we should be in a position to be able to dispose of the whole of our cattle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The census was taken in June and takes that into account.  As I am on that I should like to refer to the point made by Senator Baxter to the effect that the Act did not do what the Minister hoped.  In the case of the minimum price it did not.  It was not a success so far as the minimum price is concerned.  The Act gave us power to deal with the surplus in many ways and we have availed of those powers given us.  We set up a factory for the conversion of old cows into meat meal; we also are in negotiation with a firm to take on the canned beef business, and they will enter into operations before the end of the year.  Further, we have used the powers given us to export cattle to Continental markets and elsewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Baxter adopted a very fair attitude in his speech on this Bill.  He said that the Oireachtas having given me power last year, and a mandate to proceed with this legislation, it was up to the <Col N="1006" /> Seanad now to improve the Principal Act as far as possible.  I think that is certainly a very fair attitude to adopt, even though Senators may be opposed to certain parts of this Bill. I think, as the Principal Act is there, Senators ought to help to improve the Principal Act, but, of course, if they think that any particular section is not going to be an improvement in its administration it is a different matter.  I have heard from other people what Senator Baxter said that there has been no increase in the consumption of beef as a result of the Principal Act.  I do not think that is true; it is certainly not true of some places.  In Donegal, for instance, there has been a bigger slaughter of cattle on account of the free beef scheme.  The trouble there is that the greater portion goes in free beef, and only a small portion is sold to the ordinary customer. Butchers find it very difficult to make it pay because 4d. per lb. for the greater part of the beef makes it very difficult for them to carry on.  They are not in the position of the Dublin butchers who sell only a small part at 4d. and the greater part at more than 4d.  But taking the Free State as a whole, I cannot yet say how it works out.  We are disposing of about 1,000 cattle a week in the form of free beef.  I do not think it is quite certain we have increased the consumption by 1,000 cattle a week. Part of that beef is, I think, due to the change over; there were people who were purchasing beef before the system came into operation, and are now getting free beef.  I think there is some increased consumption.  We will have a very good idea of that whole business perhaps in about three months more when the Act will be 12 months in operation; we can then see what the levies, and so on, amount to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Baxter wants to know if, under Section 10, a person could kill his own cattle.  I do not think Section 10 prevents him.  It does prevent him from buying.  It will prevent him buying any cattle except through the inspector, but if he has <Col N="1007" /> cattle on his own farm, for instance, there is nothing to interfere, so far as I can interpret the section, with him killing those cattle.  As regards the distribution of canned beef, the persons appointed will be traders. There is no intention of appointing special people for that purpose.  They might be grocers, not necessarily butchers, but that is a thing that has not been definitely decided.  There are very remote places in the West and in Donegal where people live many miles from a butcher's shop and it would be much more convenient for the recipients, and everybody concerned, if they were supplied with canned, rather than fresh beef.  Probably it will be done through the local grocer instead of the butcher, but it will be done through a trader, at any rate.</P>
    <P>The rate of 22/- is very small, but that is governed by the export price. The Senator will remember that 12 months ago the people exporting were getting 25/-, but then there was a big surplus left at home.  The butchers had more than they wanted and they could bring the price down to 15/- or 16/-.  The idea was to make them pay a better price.  It would be very difficult to get them to do this unless we try to keep the export price and the home price about the same.  If Senators say that 22/- is too low we will have to tackle it by raising the export price.  The agitation should be directed towards increasing the export price, and that comes back to Senator Counihan's point about increasing the export bounty.  That proposal may be resisted on the plea that there is not sufficient money to do it.  But it is really towards that end that the agitation should be directed&mdash;to get the export bounty increased.  It is then the export price will go up and the butcher's price will go up.</P>
    <P>I have no power to control cleanliness in butchers' shops.  It would not be a matter for me, but it would be for the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  I assume Senator Miss Browne was referring to the British market when she talked <Col N="1008" /> of the market we took from the farmers.  We did not take the British market from the Irish farmer at all. Patriotic people here believe that the British Government was to blame more than we were.  Of course, we have done a great deal to get the British market back, only we do not get any great credit for it.  We have signed the Coal-Cattle Pact which was not popular with Senator Miss Browne and people of her Party.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact, there were bonfires lighted in Tipperary. At any rate, we have done our best and we will be only too willing to get the greatest possible share of the British market or any other market; but the difference between us is this, that we have other markets, valuable markets, available, and we have particularly the home market.  For beef, the home market is more valuable than the British market.  We are consuming more beef at home.  No matter what Party they may belong to, Senators should not allow that inferiority complex to get hold of them.  Always look on your own country as the most important.  Senator Counihan found fault with Section 10. He rather thinks that I should buy for all the butchers.  That is rather a sweeping thing for the Senator to advocate, and I do not think it would be necessary at all.  He makes the plea that the butchers have weekly credit and might have to buy from the salesmen.  All these things, I take it, will be considered.  What we must consider above all is the producer. Senators should not be hard on me when I try to benefit the farmers. Even though they may have a great regard for the butcher, they should remember the farmer first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying that Section 10 is ideal, but it is one way of dealing <Col N="1009" /> with this thing.  If any Senators have a better way I have quite an open mind on the matter.  Every Senator admits that the butchers are not paying the minimum price.  I think it is rather going too far to suggest that Section 10 should be knocked out and let things go as they are.  We might be a bit hard on the butcher here and there if we administer Section 10. Section 12 gives power to inspect and the inspector can visit various places to see cattle and sheep.  It is impossible to limit those things.  Senator Counihan says it should be limited to a registered person's farm or house, but if you do that you will have evasion again.  If a butcher buys six cattle we want to see what becomes of the six cattle.  The inspector goes to the butcher and the butcher tells him he killed two of the animals.  Then the inspector wants to know where the other four are.  If we had not power to go into everybody's land we could not administer the Act properly.  The butcher might say they were on so-and-so's land, but that man might refuse permission to the inspector to enter and therefore, the whole thing would be evaded.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, I could send an inspector to Senator Counihan's house; indeed, I could send six different inspectors working in County Dublin.  One could accuse him of having maize meal, another of having tobacco, another of having butter, and so on.  But they do not visit him in that way because they have no love for that sort of thing.  They do not go unless they have very good reason, but nevertheless we must give them power to go into everybody's house and land.  If not, they are sure to be frustrated by those clever people who know these Acts better than any lawyer.  They will endeavour to evade the different sections unless we give very full powers to inspectors.</P>

I understand that they have got to be back on 3rd September to attend an important inquiry which is being conducted by a Select Committee.

      <P>I have a suggestion to offer that might perhaps get over the immediate difficulty.  We have been almost always faced with this difficulty of scamping legislation, to some extent, so as to enable the staff to get proper holidays.  That happened last year, it happened the year before, and it happened under the previous Government, so that it is nothing new. We have been always in this dilemma. I think most of us, including Senator Counihan, would like to end this week consistent with a proper examination of these Bills in Committee.  I suggest that we might modify our procedure to this extent, that the understanding might be that immediately after the Committee Stage there should be an adjournment and that an effort should be made, arising out of the points raised, and in which there is indication on the part of the Minister to meet the points of view put forward to submit amendments later to-morrow evening or on Friday.  I think the position is now that the Seanad is not going to reject this Bill.  I am trying to look at the matter from a practical <Col N="1011" /> point of view.  There are several points in these Bills which we are anxious to get altered and I know that the Minister, in the course of the discussion here to-day, has not taken up a non-possumus attitude.  Therefore, it might be possible to reach a compromise on one or two matters.  If that were done after the Committee Stage, without attempting to rush ill-considered amendments to-morrow, we might possibly arrange matters in such a way that we could finish on Friday of this week.  The Minister on Friday might agree to amendments being brought in arising out of the discussion on the Committee Stage to-morrow. If we are to adjourn over next week for a fortnight I think it would be unfortunate for a good many of the staff so far as their holidays are concerned.  For my part, while I am in favour of some such arrangement as this, I must say at the same time that I am not prepared to vote against Senators who feel very deeply about many of the sections in these Bills and who think they should be carefully considered.  I think by adopting the course I suggest it would be possible to reach agreement on a good many points.</P>

      <P>Practically every year something like this has occurred at the end of the session and legislation is rushed through hurriedly.  The House, however, seems determined to give the Minister his way and I am not disposed to fight this matter out. I am prepared to let the Bill go through and if I have spare time I will draft and hand in by to-morrow any amendments that will be possible for me to draft.  But I am not in a position to give this matter enough consideration.  I expect to get home at 10.30 to-night and to get up at 4 o'clock to-morrow morning for the Dublin market.  Under the circumstances I do not expect to have much time for preparing amendments.</P>

      <P>My suggestion was not that the Senator should have his amendments in writing to-morrow; but in Committee the Senator might <Col N="1012" /> indicate points on which he wanted amendments made.  I am not suggesting that he should go home now and spend his time drafting amendments which, under the circumstances, would be ill-considered or at least would not be fully thought out.</P>

      <P>I think it would be within my competence if a Senator suggests an amendment to any section to-morrow to allow it to be considered. That amendment could be made a substantive amendment for the Report Stage on Friday if we think proper.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that you take it in that manner, but I did not mean it that way.  However, whoever the cap fits is welcome to wear it.  If you, Sir, had given me time and not jumped down my throat I was going to say that there is another section of the staff which is being treated to an enforced holiday and we might consider them also and give them an opportunity of working a little longer.</P>

      <P>We all know perfectly well that no amendment which is forced upon the Minister will become law.  That is the position.  The only chance of amending this Bill in the direction I have suggested is with the Minister's consent.  Therefore I consider <Col N="1013" /> that Senator Douglas's suggestion is the better one.</P>

      <P>Very well then, the Committee Stage will be taken to-morrow. I will allow amendments to be moved practically verbally to-morrow. Then if agreement can be <Col N="1014" /> reached between the Minister and the mover of the amendments they can be put down substantively on the Report Stage on Friday.  Is that agreed?</P>
      <P>Ordered accordingly.</P>
      <P>The House adjourned at 9.35 p.m. until 3 o'clock on Thursday, 1st August.</P>
