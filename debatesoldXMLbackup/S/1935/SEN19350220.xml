      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Government is taking a rather unreasonable line in this particular matter.  The amendments introduced by the Seanad were of a reasonable nature.  They were amendments which avoided the creation of artificial constituencies, which prevented the breaking up of counties and which also prevented the creation of an undue and unnecessary number of constituencies in which the proportional representation system would work worse, namely, four member constituencies.  If the Government had accepted the proposal for a conference, I think there is no doubt at all that the result would have seen very considerable amendments in the Bill. When the original Bill was going through the Dáil it met with very heavy weather.  On certain issues the Government was constrained to agree to a free vote, and when a free vote was taken it was found that the proposals put forward by the Government, which were of a piece with the rest of the Bill, did not meet with approval. In fact, there is very strong opposition in the Dáil itself, as there is in the country and in the constituencies, to this principle of taking bits out of two or three constituencies and making new and very artificial electoral units out of them.  If any group of representatives from the Dáil had met any group of representatives from the Seanad and had discussed this, I think there is no doubt that there would have been something very like general agreement, and that several things that are outstanding features of the Bill would have been amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that at this stage, with a view to giving the Government an opportunity of considering the matter further, the Seanad should insist on its amendments, not necessarily that some of them might not be susceptible of improvement.  There is no doubt that if you had a group of Deputies, with their closer touch and greater information, applying their minds to the matter as well as Senators, that these Dáil Deputies might in details adjust some of the Seanad amendments with benefit, and might even reject one or two of them.  I think that the amendments <Col N="1296" /> made by the Seanad, taken as whole, are along the right lines.  They are something that the Seanad ought not to have any doubt about the propriety of insisting on.</P>
    <P>There was a suggestion made here when the Bill came up first that it was no business of the Seanad to interfere with the revision of constituencies.  I think that view was entirely wrong: that if there was any House that ought not to cut into the question of the reallotment of constituencies much it was the Dáil, because the members of it would find great difficulty in looking at the matter impartially.  As a matter of fact, the best way to have done it would have been to set up some sort of a non-party committee in the Dáil, which might have got general agreement, just as agreement was got on a very ticklish Bill last year&mdash;a Bill of quite a different character to this.  In default of doing that, or of bringing in some outside judicial authority, the best way to ensure a satisfactory Bill would have been to recognise that the Seanad stood outside; that the members of it are not pulled by local and Party influences in the same sort of way as are members of the Dáil, and to have met the Seanad on this matter.  If that had been done I think a more satisfactory Bill would have been produced.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think that the Seanad ought to have no doubt about the propriety of its intervening, by way of amendments, in relation to a Bill of this sort.  I think that the Seanad will be doing the right thing by insisting on these amendments, not that all of them should be accepted, but that some such committee as was suggested should be set up so that this whole matter might be considered in a non-Party way, as it has not yet been considered, and in that way producing a Bill more satisfactory to everybody, and particularly to the people in those counties which have been cut up and made parts of the very peculiar and unsatisfactory new constituencies.  I think the Seanad should agree that the Senator's proposal be rejected.</P>

      <P>As there is an equality of votes, it is incumbent upon me to exercise a casting vote in accordance with Article 22 of the Constitution, which states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All matters in each House shall, save as otherwise provided by this Constitution, be determined by a majority of the votes of the members present other than the Chairman or presiding member, who shall have and exercise a casting vote in the case of an equality of votes.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the absence of any reliable precedent in this House, I have given some attention to the practice in Great Britain and the Dominions in regard to the manner in which the Chairman exercises his casting vote.  The guiding principle appears to be that a Speaker does not on his sole responsibility make a change in the <i>status quo</i>, and in particular that he takes the course which is best calculated to avoid change in the law, to uphold previous decisions of the House or a Committee, or to maintain constitutional usage. This Bill implements that Article of the Constitution which provides that the constituencies shall be revised by the Oireachtas at least once in every ten years.  This period expired some time ago, and, if I gave my casting vote against the motion, my action might have the effect of holding the Bill up for a further eighteen months.  In order to maintain constitutional usage, I accordingly give my casting vote&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not know what other members of the House thought, but it never dawned upon me that we would to-day debate and divide upon these amendments on which we spent so much time previously.  I looked at the Orders of the Day and I saw that we were to be told what the decision of the Dáil was in respect of our amendments to this Bill.  But that we were <Col N="1299" /> to go through all the amendments we had made to the Bill, debate them and divide upon them never entered my mind or the mind of any of my friends in the House, so far as I know.  Surely, if we were to have a discussion on these matters, there should have been notice on the Order Paper.  I am sure that many Senators who looked at the Orders of the Day came to the conclusion that we were merely going to receive the decision of the Dáil.  It seems to me to be unfair, on the notice we have received, to deal with these amendments in the way we are doing. I ask you, Sir, to say whether the Orders of the Day give sufficient notice and whether, on that notice, we should proceed to deal with the amendments as we are now doing.  Any Senator who is not here to-day would, I think, be perfectly right in saying that he did not get any notice that these amendments were to be discussed in the manner in which they are being discussed. I ask you, Sir, to look into the matter and to say if something should not be done to meet my point.</P>

      <P>If Senator Jameson looks at Item No. 3 on the Orders of the Day, he will see that the usual form has been adopted in connection with amendments to this Bill.  Item No. 3 sets out a Message saying that the amendment made by the Seanad to the Criminal Law Amendment Bill has been disagreed to by the Dáil.  That refers to a specific amendment but it does not set out what the amendment is.  So far as I remember, that has always been the formula adopted in this House.  In other words, Senators are expected to advert to the Bill, as it originally came to this House, and to inform themselves as to the amendments which were made here.</P>

      <P>May I read the Standing Order?</P>
      <P>When, in the case of a Bill which has been received from the Dáil and amended in the Seanad, a Message has been received from the Dáil disagreeing with or amending all or any of the amendments inserted in the Bill by the Seanad, such Message shall be placed on the Order Paper next thereafter prepared.  Each such amendment shall be considered and any Senator may move without notice ....</P>

      <P>No.  The only thing incumbent on the Clerk is to place on the Orders of the Day the Message from the Dáil, as he has done in this case.  Senators are supposed to be conversant with Standing Orders, where by motions can then be proposed without notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I see, the Orders of the Day merely give us an item of information.  They inform us that the Dáil has disagreed with our amendments.  Any Senator would take it from that that our business would merely be to receive that Message from the Dáil.  Surely it should have been down on the Order Paper that we were going to discuss the amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid, Senator, that I cannot accept your point of view.  All we are obliged to do is to do as we have done here&mdash;that a Message has been received from the Dáil and that when that has been done, it is incumbent on the Senators to know their Standing Orders, and that motions insisting or not insisting on the amendments can then be moved without notice.</P>

      <P>I think that there may be something to be said for Senator Jameson's point.  There are two points connected with this.  First of all, there is the resolution with regard to the conference that was down here.  Looking down to No. 3, we see that Dáil Eireann has disagreed with the amendments.  It seems to me that, possibly, there should have been a similar paragraph there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, Sir, the question is not a question of the merits of the amendments at all.  The question is that of the desirability or otherwise of holding a conference.  That is all, and the merits of the amendments do not arise at all.  I think that your ruling in the matter, Sir, should end it.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, Sir, I am wishful to know how it is possible to move an amendment of substance at this stage.  Surely it is more than the correction of a misspelling of a word or the insertion of a comma, and certainly when the two Houses have not had the Bill before them, when there has been a proposal for a conference, and when that has been refused, it is rather extraordinary that it should be possible to bring in something quite new at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard, a Chathaoirligh, three very well-reasoned and instructive speeches from the proposer and seconder of the motion and from the Minister for Lands, Senator Baxter, in his speech, has dealt with many subjects, and his analysis of the situation is well worth considering.  He has proved very conclusively that the present policy of the Government, particularly as regards agriculture, is altogether wrong.  He has shown that the policy of the former Minister for Agriculture, of one more cow, one more sow, and one more acre under the plough, was very much more effective for the relief of unemployment and for giving a decent standard of living and keeping the farmers of this country sound and solvent than the policy of the present Minister for Agriculture, of more wheat, more beet, more tobacco, and less cattle.  When Mr. Hogan left the Ministry in 1931 we had 90,000 more acres under tillage than Dr. Ryan had in 1934.  It is an extraordinary state of affairs that there were 90,000 more acres under tillage in 1931, without any bounties or any subsidies and with very little protection, and that in 1934, with all the propaganda and all the bounties, all the subsidies and all the protection, there should be 90,000 less acres under tillage.  That is a case into which this committee, if it were set up, could very directly inquire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1305" /> I hoped that this motion would have the unanimous approval of the House, but judging from the Minister's speech I am afraid that he believes that if this committee were set up, it would be usurping the functions of the Executive Council&mdash;that it would be setting up, as he put it himself, a sort of super-Cabinet.  That is all wrong.  The supporters of this resolution have no such intention.  The motion proposes to set up a committee of nine Senators.  Now, of those nine Senators, the majority, possibly, would be supporters of the Government. Accordingly, in that case, there would be no question of dictating the policy of the Government or of creating any propaganda adverse to Government policy.  The question, Sir, is: are we satisfied that the Government fully realise that the inevitable consequences of their policy must lead to the bankruptcy of 90 per cent. of our best farmers in the country?  I, for one, do not believe that any Irish Government, if they were fully aware of the position, would continue a policy which is inflicting such hardships and misery on the majority of our people; and I believe that if this committee were set up, it would inquire into the facts and show to the Government the true position of affairs and open their eyes to the consequences.</P>
    <P>Every member of the Government, and the prominent members of the Fianna Fáil Party, have stated from time to time that the farmers of this country are better off than the farmers in any other part of the world.  Senator Connolly said that the British market was gone and gone forever.  Those statements are all contrary to facts, as statistics prove. The British market is not gone.  The British market is there, and it is there for us if our Government have the commonsense to avail of it, and it is there for more produce than we can hope to produce for a number of years.  I want to say further that it is the only market in the whole world worth having for the export of live stock or agricultural produce.  The other statement&mdash;that our farmers are better off than the farmers of the <Col N="1306" /> other countries of the world&mdash;is also incorrect.  In 1931, our cattle trade exports were worth nearly £13,000,000. The value of that export was reduced in 1934 to less than £5,000,000, which was a direct loss of more than £8,000,000 to the farmers of this country on the cattle trade alone. Now, to get that £5,000,000, about £1,750,000 had to be paid in bounties, which left a net gain of only about £3,000,000, and the farmers themselves had to pay most of what they got in bounties.  That is another question which is very serious, and it is a question on which this committee of the Seanad would be able to advise the Government on their policy.  The country is directly losing and the farmers are directly losing on this economic war, on their cattle trade alone, not less than £10,000,000 when we take into account what they had to take for the cattle which they sold in the home market.</P>
    <P>Another statement has been made on other occasions in this House to the effect that the Irish farmer was no worse off than the British farmer and that the price of beef was so bad in England that the British Government had to subsidise it.  I should like to give an instance of the price which the British farmer is getting for an ordinary beast in comparison to what the Irish farmer receives.  Let us take a 12 cwt. fat bullock fed for three months in England and sold in the British market at the prevailing price, which at the moment would be 35/- per cwt.  That beast would fetch £21.  If we grant, which is not very likely, that the Irish farmer would get £21 on the British market for a bullock of the same weight and quality, the net result of that would be that the Irish farmer would receive £14 10s., including £1 bounty.  If you include the bounty of £3 which the British farmer gets from his Government he would receive £24 for that bullock, so that the Irish farmer has to accept £9 10s. less per beast than the British farmer.  In that case I cannot see how anybody can say that the English farmer is quite as badly off as the Irish farmer and that he is making no more money.</P>

If an Irish farmer markets a 12 cwt. fat bullock in the English market of the same quality as one marketed by a British farmer and gets the prevailing price in England for that animal, the Irish farmer receives £21.  From that has to be deducted £6 for duty and 30/- expenses. Allowing for the £1 bounty, the net price received by the Irish farmer is £14 10s.  The British farmer, on the other hand, receives a bounty of £3, which brings the price of his animal up to £24.</P>

      <P>Everyone has been speaking of the recent trade pacts made by our Government with foreign countries.  We have the cattle and coal pact with England, the &ldquo;three to one&rdquo; pact with Germany, a pact with Belgium, the terms of which we do not know at present, and there is some talk of a trade pact with Brazil.  I <Col N="1308" /> welcome all those pacts.  The more competition we have and the more people we have to come to buy our cattle, the better everyone in the country will be pleased.  I do not find any fault with the Government for making these pacts, but I should like to tell them that all these pacts represent very little in comparison with what we have lost.  Furthermore, I should like to point out that a pact with one English county would be far better for this country.  A pact made with Lancashire would be worth ten times as much as all the pacts they could make with the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>We all approve of the Government's policy of creating new industries, but judging that policy by the present state of the country, I am afraid they are chasing the shadow and neglecting the substance.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has told us that he has created 300 new factories. I would like to tell him that he has closed, or partially closed, 100 factories for every one he has created.  In the Irish Free State we have over 400,000 farmers.  Each of the farmsteads was a factory or a potential factory for the manufacture of beef, bacon, mutton and other produce.  A lot of those factories are now closed or partially closed and the remainder are working on half time.  When you have killed all the farmers' factories, it is no compensation to say that you have created 300 new factories.  It will not compensate the country.  Those factories had always a ready sale for their produce at remunerative prices. When they have closed down, where, then, will the money come from to buy the products of the new factories?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy of placing more people on the land is not going to improve matters.  If you want to have more people on the land the Government must first of all see that the farmers and the agricultural labourers are secured a fair and equitable return for their labour.  They are not getting that at present and I should like to know how they can get it in future. There are hundreds of farmers at the present time receiving the dole and Senator Connolly took great pride in the fact that farmers were getting the <Col N="1309" /> dole.  I think, furthermore, that splitting up the land will not relieve the situation for if the old and experienced farmers were not able to succeed and if they are now on the dole, it is hard to expect that the new farmers, whom the Government have created, without money, without machinery, and without experience, can succeed. The farmers are not getting a square deal in this dispute.  The majority of the Executive Council do not understand rural life and I think that is a great fault.  At least, the members of it who dominate the policy of the Government have no idea of rural life or the hardships, the necessities and wants of the farmers.  If this committee were set up I think we should be able to convince them that the policy which they are pursuing is not in the best interests of the country. In conclusion, I should like to point out to the Government that the farmers are in a bad state, that there is no possibility of any progress being made towards prosperity unless a settlement is made with England and we get back our markets.  I implore them even now, which I believe is an opportune time, to move and to try to have a settlement made of the dispute with England.  I think I can assure them on behalf of every right-minded citizen in the country that they will back them up to the fullest extent in any settlement they make. I hope that the Seanad will pass the motion and that this committee will be set up.</P>

      <P>This motion is to set up a committee to consider and report its opinion on the national policy at present being pursued &ldquo;with particular regard to its consequences on the economic and social life of the people.&rdquo;  If it is really intended to be passed on its face value, it seems to me to be entirely inappropriate and quite an impossible proposition.  I should also have read the second paragraph of the resolution, which says: &ldquo;That the Committee be empowered to send for persons, papers and records and to take evidence.&rdquo;  The present national policy, in so far as it affects economic and social life, is every act of the Executive Council <Col N="1310" /> and if a Committee of the Seanad is set up, and can send for persons, papers and records and can take evidence and examine into every act of the Executive Council, of course it means that the Executive Council is superseded.  As I say, if this motion is meant to be taken at its face value, it is impossible, but as a means of raising a discussion on general policy I think it serves a purpose.  It is so wide that one is justified in talking on almost anything within the jurisdiction of the Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to hear Senator Counihan to-day following upon statements of Senator Baxter's last week, apparently desirous of confining the discussion on this motion to the old topic of the effects of the present fiscal policy and agrarian policy of the Government upon agriculture.  I do not think that the motion should be confined to that side of national policy at all, and I propose, shortly, to refer to certain other aspects of national policy.  Before doing so I should like to draw attention to an extraordinary statement by Senator Baxter last week and more or less repeated and confirmed to-day by Senator Counihan, suggesting that prior to 1932 the farmers were doing very well. Senator Counihan, for instance, quotes the policy of the ex-Minister for Agriculture and makes reference to the acreage under tillage crops.  He is right in his figures as regards the total area under crops but it is just as well for the purposes of record to have it down that the total root green crops, including flax and fruit, is up since 1931 by 71,000 acres and that the deficiencies are due to a decline in the area under hay.  That, by the way.  Senator Baxter told us of the happy homes that had been built up by prosperous farmers in the past. Until recently he said they were paying high rents and rates but, despite these difficulties, they accumulated considerable savings.  That is in Column 1276.  Further on in Column 1279 the Senator said: &ldquo;There are poor farmers in this country, on the western seaboard, who lived decent-lives and enjoyed comparative comfort <Col N="1311" /> for 20 years.&rdquo;  I think that the general indication of the argument of the Senator last week was that prior to the inauguration of the new Government's policy, affecting agriculture, the farmers were in comparative comfort and had considerable savings and that the losses had occurred since the Government came into office with this new policy.  But Senator Baxter had a different view in 1926.  He was then Deputy Baxter, and I shall quote from the Dáil Debates, Volume 14, March 24, 1926, column 1609, where, when speaking on the Estimates, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we consider the plight of the small farmer we have to exclaim that this sum must be reduced, because the people have not got the money and cannot find it.  I hold that not alone do the bank deposits show a falling off, not alone does our export trade show a debit balance, but I am perfectly satisfied that two thirds of the farmers are carrying on, trying to pay their purchase annuities, trying to pay their rates, and trying to pay the national taxation by depleting their capital.  By that I mean the selling off of their cattle and other stock.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I believe that the position is really so serious that unless stock is taken, unless something is done to call a halt, we will find, after a year or two, at our present rate of progress, that half the farmers will not be carrying one-third the stock that is necessary to make the holdings economic, and that, while the other half may not be in such a bad position, they will be very near it. The Minister for Lands and Agriculture knows quite well what the position is; he knows that thousands of farmers to-day are not able to pay their land purchase annuities and have not a hoof on the land.  Other men are paying their annuities by taking, perhaps, their second-last cow to the fair.  I am not overstating the case; I am talking of conditions exactly as I know them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that were the position in 1926, <Col N="1312" /> I wonder does the Senator wish us to believe that between that year and 1932 the condition of affairs, as exemplified in that quotation, was so revolutionised, that the farmers became comfortable, and had considerable savings in the four years of declining prices that followed 1926.  Senator Baxter asked me a direct question, as to what I thought of the policy which he quoted from the Minister for Agriculture, of restrictions on output.  My answer to that is this, that so long as the agriculture of this country, or any country, is dependent for success upon the sale of produce in a market which it cannot control, and if at any time that market decides that the amount that is being sent to it is too great for its capacity to absorb, then a policy of restriction of output is necessary whether that restriction is imposed or is undertaken voluntarily. The policy of restriction of output is, of course, not confined to this country, and if Senator Baxter would agree, I would join him in making a demand that there should be no restriction on output until it is perfectly clear that every inhabitant of this country is fully supplied with all that agriculture can produce.  I would not seek to have any restriction on output until assured that everything that can reasonably be consumed by 3,000,000 of the people is available for them. But we are conducting agriculture for a market, and it is pretty obvious that that market is not willing to receive all that this country could produce in the way of agriculture. Therefore, some restrictions and some re-direction of the course of agricultural production seems to be inevitable.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we find Ministers talking about settling more people on the land, of dividing and sub-dividing farms, and maintaining this as an agricultural country. I am very sorry to say that so far I have not been able to grasp what the national policy of the Government is.  A good many years ago there occurred in this country a real change in the relationship between the land owner and the occupier.  The coming of the Land Acts and the revolution that they created was a real revolution, <Col N="1313" /> inasmuch as they transformed the character of the social relations between the occupier and the owner of land.  But, since the later political revolution of 1916-1921, I have not yet seen any sign that either the last Government or this Government has any notion of a transformation of the relations between townsmen and their fellows.  Their agricultural policy is an extension&mdash;a perfection if you like&mdash;of the policy initiated long before the Free State was established, as a result of the agrarian agitation and the revolutionary activities.  The success of the political revolution was made possible by a belief that it would introduce some changes affecting the future status of the non-agriculturalists, that is to say, that large and respectable class of the community, the men of no property.</P>
    <P>There is going on an attempt to introduce an industrial revival.  Very much has been done in the way of social amelioration, and I have nothing but thanks to give to those who were instrumental in ameliorating the conditions and creating a new state of affairs which will salve the wounds that are caused by the maladjustment of economic relationships.  The President made a speech recently outside the Oireachtas in which he went some little degree towards exposing his mind as to the future policy of the Government and of this country.  He indicated at a lecture that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;our aim is not to overturn the system....  We are reformers.... What we have to do is to try to end the abuses of the system....  It has abuses which have to be attended to but it works, though badly.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They were trying to arrive at a proper balance between the agricultural industry and the manufacturing industry and to get a proper distribution of wealth in the community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At another stage in the speech the President indicated how they were desirous and had the definite purpose of introducing legislation which would make it possible in times of stress and unemployment for people to carry on. All that is very good, but I should suggest, if Ministers were present, that <Col N="1314" /> if they look ahead they are not going to solve their problems by adherence to that policy solely.  I can see no germ yet in the social and economic affairs of this country of any new idea which, by the process of growth, of development, will make impossible or unlikely a recrudescence and a renewal of all the evils which present social legislation is intended to ameliorate.  Ministers have spoken about the settlement of larger numbers on the land, and the division of agricultural holdings.  I made a calculation, roughly, I admit, and it is subject to correction, but is probably not very far out, which indicates that if all the holdings over 100 acres were cut down to 100 acres, and if all the farms under 25 acres were raised to 25 acres, and all the adult male relatives who are living on and assisting on these farms were given 25 acres, there would be a shortage of 1,500,000 acres of land, so that sub-division, to the extent I have indicated, is not possible within the present area of the land of this country.</P>
    <P>But what is too often forgotten when looking at this problem is that there is, at least, as large a number of people who are not land holders, and inasmuch as those who are at present living directly upon the land should get their land hunger satisfied before we come down to the non-agricultural population, it is inevitable that if you settle people upon the land in small holdings, even with the present population, we are going to leave as large a number without land and as large a number without other property of any economic value; meaning to say, men who are dependent for the livelihood of themselves and their families on employment and wages.  If there is to be, as one naturally expects, a growing population, there is going to be a growing population which will be waiting for employment and for wages. That is a very important fact and one that must be taken into account.  I am waiting to hear whether, within the system of property ownership, the Government has any views as to changing the relationship between the non-property owning and the property owning person; to give the non-property owning person some security for <Col N="1315" /> a livelihood, by virtue of earning, not charity&mdash;not doles, and not State assistance&mdash;but by virtue of the fact that he is a full man and capable of earning a livelihood.</P>
    <P>I should like, for instance, if the Minister for Industry and Commerce would give us the results of his thoughts on this problem.  We have had a considerable number of measures brought before us which have become law, all aiming at the re-establishment or establishment of industry, and all moving with the purpose of establishing industry in exactly the same form as has produced the evils which the President, in the statement at the recent lecture, said had caused the abuses which he deplored.</P>
    <P>I want to know whether it is the mind of the Government to introduce into the social economic life of this country any proposal, accepting the property system, which would change the relationship of the non-owning class&mdash;the men who have only their labour to sell&mdash;from that of dependence upon the owning class.  So far there has been no indication of the introduction into the economic social life of this country of any change which, by virtue of its gradual development, will bring about a change in social relationships.  We hear talk of distributism, the wide distribution of property.  What has been suggested or thought of as a means of distributing industrial property?  We have schemes for the amalgamation of capital concerns, the re-establishment of industrial companies with their capital subscribed in this country, all of which, no matter how successful they may be, no matter how they may be dispersed over different towns, means the dependence upon those proprietary interests of the working-class community, which to-day is as large as the agricultural community and which will inevitably grow to be larger in numbers than the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>The question of national policy and its present tendencies, and the consequences upon the economic and social <Col N="1316" /> life of the people, are very appropriate to considerations of this kind. I think Ministers sometimes feel that they are forced, by virtue of the economic facts to do, in regard to the establishment of certain classes of industry, what the idealists amongst them would like to avoid.  Sometimes they think in terms of a wide dispersal of small industries, even cottage industries, but when they come to deal with concrete proposals we have the beet sugar factories requiring a large aggregation of capital.  We get policies in regard to the amalgamation of the carrying companies requiring large aggregations of capital.  We get suggestions about cement factories, three or four, which require large aggregations of capital with their expensive plant and employing few workmen.  As the economic facts emerge, it will be found with the establishment in this country of an industrial arm of any power that the dependence of the working class upon the capitalist class will become as distinct and as clearly marked as it is in other countries, even small countries with a developed industry, inevitably intensifying the cleavages that at present exist in those countries. Similar cleavages will occur in this country unless there are introduced into our economic life and schemes of one kind or another which through their own growth and development are going to bring about a radical change in the social economic relationships which have dominated the past and which, as far as one can see, if present policy is pursued, will continue to dominate it. Now, I think it must be admitted, if what I am indicating has any foundation at all, that such a course of affairs will mean a consolidation of working class interests and of the struggles that inevitably follow that consolidation, especially when, as he has occasionally said, the Minister for Industry and Commerce intends that there should be an economic plan and enough concerns in this country to ensure that there will be a fair amount of internal competition. That internal competition is going to lead to conflicts and consolidations on the side of capital, with, as a corollary, consolidations on the side <Col N="1317" /> of labour.  That seems to me to be a matter very well worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>I quoted a few weeks ago, rather in an aside, a statement which I intend to quote again.  I take it from the statistical returns.  It indicates a tendency which will, I think, be emphasised year by year as the industrial processes develop.  It is a tendency for the margin&mdash;between the wages and salaries paid out in the course of production and the value of output&mdash;to grow.  Taking the years 1926, 1929 and 1931, there has been quite an appreciable decline in the proportion of the net output that is paid away in wages and salaries, notwithstanding that there has been an increase in the total sum.  The effect of that, of course, is that those receiving wages and salaries are able to buy a smaller proportion of the net output year by year, and so far as the statistical returns of the 1932 census of production have been published, they show the same tendency. Instead of a rising tendency it is a declining tendency, and it is not peculiar to this country.  I think it will be found that, as plant and capital become more intricate and more and more expensive, the disproportion will be emphasised.  That should be a warning to Ministers who are taking a long view of national policy as to whether they cannot find a means of introducing a new principle which will not be a mere principle of ownership, strongly saturated with the spirit of acquisitiveness, but one which, while retaining the principle of ownership, will introduce a new social relationship, a new purpose in industrial production.  Unless that is done, I think the future is going to be a replica of the past and the present: that there will be a continuous intensification of the conflict of interests and of the organisation of those conflicting interests, with results that we can all foresee at some time in the future of a violent upheaval.  I have made these comments in the hope that Ministers will at least take them as a matter of serious consideration or, if one likes, as a challenge to them to produce their considered views as to what is to be the future of this country in regard to economic social relations.</P>

      <P>I intend to speak and vote against this motion.  When I heard Senator Baxter move it on the last day I believed that he was sincere.  I thought that his opening remarks were very sensible, but as he developed his arguments I began to think that it was not a serious purpose that was behind it, but rather a question of gaining political kudos which, I think, have not materialised. Senator Baxter spoke of his ambition to see the maximum amount of employment given on the land.  He evidently is dissatisfied with the efforts that are being made by the present Government to provide additional employment on the land.  Senator Counihan, a short time ago, referred to people as not being conversant with rural life, but, like the Senator, I happen to have been brought up on a farm in one of the prettiest little valleys in County Kerry.  Though I have been residing in the city for a great many years, I believe that I am as conversant with rural life as Senator Counihan or Senator Baxter and of other Senators who have spoken in support of the motion.  Senator Baxter, in moving his motion, said a good many people left the land not because they had any desire to do so but because of the fact that they had to.  Senator Baxter, like most of us, knows very well that it is only one member of a family who can find a living on the land.  The other members have to make a living somewhere else.  I can assure him that it was not any desire to leave the land that made some of us do so. Indeed, if the Minister for Lands would be a bit liberal in dividing up the land of the country, I, for instance, would be very happy to go back to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like Senator Baxter to tell us, when he is concluding on the motion, how he proposes to provide the maximum of employment on the land if not through tillage.  The Senator had nothing very encouraging to say about the wheat campaign or the beet campaign, and so far as I recollect, he <Col N="1319" /> made no reference to the Government's reafforestation scheme.  How are you going to give increased employment on the land if you are not in favour of the growing of wheat and beet and wood, for which we are now paying high prices to foreign countries to meet the demands of our housing schemes?  I would be glad if the Senator would enlighten me on these matters.  He had not anything encouraging to say either of the activity of the Government in endeavouring to provide for our own wants by way of industrialisation. There is not nowadays the same opening for our people in foreign lands. They must remain at home and they must be fed while at home.  If we are paying large amounts of money for goods to other countries, I do not see how it is wrong that we should endeavour to retain this money at home, provide our wants and feed our own people from the produce of the soil.  I have read and studied something about economics in my time, but I never listened to an exposition lacking so much in economic knowledge as that to which we were treated by Senator Baxter on the last occasion. Dean Swift told us that we should burn everything that came from England except her coal.  The present Government are endeavouring to supply all our wants and, so far as coal is concerned, they are trying to produce our own coal rather than burn English coal.  We heard a lot about the comparative state of comfort on the land some time ago. Comfort on the land, mar eadh!  I remember, well over a quarter of a century ago, at a meeting of the Dublin Municipal Council, my old colleague, Senator O'Neill, referring to the working classes of the County Dublin as &ldquo;scarecrows.&rdquo;  It was a very good description of those who were toiling on the land in County Dublin then. Senator Wilson knows that a County Dublin farmer's man will go out in the morning at 4 o'clock, cut and bring a load of cabbages into the Dublin market, deliver in the City of Dublin, take a load of manure back to the County Dublin and, possibly, stop work at 7 or 8 o'clock in the evening to make ready for going out about the same <Col N="1320" /> time next morning.  If that is the comfort on the land of which Senator Baxter and Senator Counihan speak, they are welcome to it.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter referred to conditions in the counties of Kerry and Clare.  He did not refer to the counties in which there has been a campaign to prevent the payment of rates and annuities.  How do those gentlemen expect that State institutions are to be carried on if the rates are not paid?  How are those members of Grangegorman Mental Hospital Board, who happen to be members of this House also, going to keep the poor people in that hospital if the rates are not paid?  How are the poor of Dublin Union to be looked after if the rates are not paid? I wish that these gentlemen would enlighten us on these subjects, because we are anxious to get enlightenment from them.  Who are the people who are not paying rates?  It is not the poor people in the &ldquo;mountainy&rdquo; districts who are squealing.  Senator Counihan has some of the finest land between Ballyboughill and Lusk.  I knew that part of the country before Senator Counihan came there.  It would be rather interesting to learn of the comparative comfort enjoyed by employer and employed in Ballyboughill.</P>

      <P>Senator Baxter was rather unhappy in his references to County Kerry and County Cork.  A national spirit existed in the County Kerry before Senator Counihan was very many years old.  Over fifty years ago, there was an agitation there for land reform and that was, to a great extent, responsible for the Land Acts passed even by the British Parliament. It was the people there who were, to a great extent, responsible for what we heard then about fixity of tenure, fair rents and free sale.  Senator Counihan may remember something about those days, or it may be convenient for him to forget.  I do not think that any section of the community is suffering more than the people on the hill-side farms in Kerry and elsewhere.  The cattle produced there are too light to carry <Col N="1321" /> the bounty.  The land is rather poor to produce beet of the necessary sugar content.  It is also rather light for the growing of wheat, and they have not creameries, as there are in Kilmallock and other parts of Limerick.  But let it be remembered that these are not the people who are squealing.  It is the people who are comparatively well off and comfortably placed who are doing the squealing and not the poor people. We heard Senator Counihan refer to the fact that there were 300 new factories established recently by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and stating that for every one of these factories established 100 had been closed.  I think those were the words he used.  Does he take this House seriously or does he think that we are going to prepare a bed for him in Grangegorman or Portrane Mental Hospital?  I am rather pleased with the way industrial development is proceeding throughout the country.  I was around Halligan's Mill, exercising my dog, about 12 o'clock the other night, and I found that the mill was working at that time.  When Senator Counihan's friends were in office, that mill was closed down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator referred to the German people having had to capitulate because of the economic conditions in their country.  I am not going to speak here of the tremendous fight made by that great people when a considerable part of the world was united against them. But I do say that we have a lesson to learn from the German nation in connection with their position under the Treaty of Versailles.  Under that Treaty, portion of the German State was torn from the side of the Fatherland. When these people got the opportunity, within the past few weeks, to decide their fate, how did they vote? Ninety per cent. of them voted for association with the Fatherland.  They forgot Kaiserism, Karl Marxism, Hitlerism and every other &ldquo;ism&rdquo; and thought first of the German nation.  As I say, we in this country have a lesson to learn from the German people in that respect.  I have spoken against this motion because it seemed to me to be an attack on the activities of the present Government.  I hope Senator <Col N="1322" /> Baxter will give me the enlightenment I am seeking, but I intend to vote against his motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LaurenceONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>Although somewhat belated, I should like, on the axiom &ldquo;Better late than never,&rdquo; to take the opportunity of congratulating Senator Baxter on what was his maiden speech in this House.  His speech, which I looked upon as being clear and clever, denoted deep thinking, great research and showed evidence of great care in preparation.  I think that Senator Baxter was a little unfortunate, if I may say so, when he said that it was some years since he had taken part in a political debate.  Those were, I think, his words, clearly indicating what is in his mind&mdash;that this was a political motion.  As Senator Baxter proceeded, one could see the art of the old parliamentary hand asserting itself in the clever and careful way that he made thrust after thrust at the policy of the present Government.  For my old friend, Senator Counihan, I have a great regard and, as I said here on a former occasion, a great deal of sympathy, even if he does drag in the economic war at every conceivable opportunity.  As I said before, it is very hard for a man of the type of Senator Counihan to see passing away day by day the hard work of his life. I say that in all sincerity, but no war, big or little, economic, religious or political was ever fought in which some soldiers, at any rate, did not fall by the roadside.  If Senator Counihan is one of them, I am really sorry.  I should not have mentioned Senator Counihan but that he said&mdash;he will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that it is time the present Government showed some commonsense and ended the economic war.  I do not say that Senator Counihan said that with biased intent, but may I ask if we realise what the actual cause of the present economic war was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could go back over an economic war, going back for a couple of hundred years, which brought this country to the prostrate state in which it is in at present, but I am not going to do so. The present economic war, however&mdash; and let us not let it out of our heads &mdash;started when the President and his <Col N="1323" /> Government believed and honestly believed, and had a mandate from the country to strengthen them in that belief, that our Government were entitled to hold the land annuities for the benefit of this country.  Mr. Thomas, on behalf of the British Government said: &ldquo;No, you are not entitled to hold the land annuities.&rdquo; Now, I will say that there was a fair difference of opinion there between two honourable men, President de Valera on one side and Mr. Thomas on the other.  The President stated: &ldquo;Well, if you consider that our Government are not entitled to hold the land annuities, I am prepared to put the whole matter to independent arbitration.&rdquo; Mr. Thomas said: &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and then from time to time he goes on with a lot of twaddle about the open door; but the door that Mr. Thomas opened for us was the putting of an exorbitant tariff on our cattle.  There and then is the whole and sole cause of the economic war as it exists at present. Could any man, could any honourable man, any straightforward man, or any statesman as President de Valera has proved himself to be, offer anything fairer under Heaven than the suggestion and the offer that President de Valera made to the English Government and which was turned down?</P>
    <P>Then my friend, Senator Counihan, comes along and tells us, in that rather sad and agonising tone of his when he is dealing with the economic war, that our Government should have a little commonsense and finish the economic war.  I have stated here before that if Senator Counihan and those associated with him, who may have had a bigger pull with the English Government than the present Government has, had gone to Mr. Thomas and told him: &ldquo;We are still loyal; we still have Imperialistic feelings, and why, for Heaven's sake, do you not help the poor unfortunate country and take off the desperate tariffs now on cattle that have ruined so many of us,&rdquo; they might be able to show cause for what they say; but no, Senator Counihan will not do that.  He will get up here, however, time after time and he will ring the changes.</P>

      <P>Now, Sir, frankly, I did not intend to deal with any of the speeches that were made here to-day, although I must say that many of them, just like Senator Counihan's speech, have provided a plentiful supply of ammunition for a rather long speech.  Looking around me and seeing so many&mdash;or so few&mdash;Senators present, and seeing my friend, Senator Toal, anxiously looking at me&mdash; I know he has his eye on the clock&mdash; and knowing that Senators do not like long speeches, and indeed neither do I, because I do not like to take up too much time, but, Sir, I am going to deal with this motion from a very different angle from that in which it has been dealt with so far.  I am going to deal with this motion briefly as the wording appears before me and as the wording strikes me.  Meaning no disrespect whatever to Senator Baxter, to whom I will give credit for sincere honesty of purpose in the whole thing, in my opinion, it would be very unwise of the Seanad to pass that motion.  I think differently from Senator Counihan who said that the Seanad should unanimously pass it. I think that the Seanad should unanimously kick it out, and I shall tell you the reason why.  In my opinion, it is a belittling motion; it is an insidious motion, and it is a foolish motion.  It is a belittling motion, in my judgment, as it proposes to set up a select committee&mdash;whatever a select committee may be, God bless the mark &mdash;of nine Senators consisting of all Parties, who are to consider and report the opinion of the committee&mdash; and here is the little bit of honey&mdash; for the information and assistance of the Seanad on the national policy at present being pursued, with particular regard to its conseouences on the economic and social life of the people. Now, this committee of nine wise men, whoever they may be, are to set out and give their opinions.  Why, one would think, by the wording of that resolution that the other 51 members of the Seanad were all &ldquo;duds&rdquo;: that they knew nothing; that they cared less; that they were in darkness; that <Col N="1325" /> they were asleep; that they were in total ignorance as to what was going on around them?  And Senator Baxter's nine Solomons were to take them out of the slumdom of darkness and put them into the mansion of perpetual light where the orchestra would strike up to the strains of the opinions of the nine Solomons of the Seanad! Was there ever anything more belittling in the public life of this country?  In my judgment, no.  It is an insidious motion, because, no matter what way you look at it, it is a roundabout way&mdash;I do not like using the word humbug&mdash;it is a roundabout way of getting the Seanad to give the present Government a stab in the back&mdash;a deliberate stab in the back&mdash;owing to the policy they are pursuing.</P>
      <P>If this motion is passed, what joy it will give to English statesmen; what joy it will give to the English Press and, perhaps, to some of the Irish Press! Mark my words&mdash;I might as well get credit sometimes for something that I know something about&mdash;mark my words, if this motion is passed, instead of the English Government keeping back, they will pursue this economic war to its end in the hope that Ireland will give in eventually.  That is what this motion means, and that is why I speak and feel so strongly on the matter.  It is a foolish motion, and I am sorry that in Senator Baxter's first attempt in the Seanad he should put down such a foolish motion.</P>

Do these men, in their wildest flights of imagination, think that any member of the Government would elect to serve on that Committee which is designed to belittle the Government?  I have a <Col N="1326" /> shrewd suspicion also that commonsense Senators like my old friend, Senator Toal, will hesitate about acting on such a Committee either.  If the motion is passed, we will have Senator Baxter with a coterie of nine around him all looking in the one direction: &ldquo;How the devil are we going to get out President de Valera and the present Government?&rdquo;</P>

I wonder, and I am really sincere in wondering, why this resolution did not go a little further and propose that these nine Senators should be given the full control and the whole management of the affairs of the country and that the present Government should be sent up to Mountjoy and that the majority of the people who set them up as a Government should be told to go to hell or to paradise and take their choice.

      <P>No, I am always left out in the cold when the pickings are going. Here we have nine dictators set up to give their opinions.  Why, it is an extraordinary motion.  To give their opinions!  For what?  For the information and assistance of the Seanad on the national policy at present being pursued.  Some short time ago, a very prominent member of this House, holding a very prominent position, stated that in his opinion one man was travelling the road to be a dictator. Here we have nine dictators wanting to be set up so far as this Seanad is concerned. When is this kind of melodrama motion business going to stop in the Seanad?  In my judgment, it is motions like this that have made the Seanad the laughing-stock of the country.  Yes, it is.  My friend, Senator O'Hanlon, is looking very solemn; like Barnaby Rudge's raven, he shakes his head.  It is motions like this&mdash;even if the Seanad has not long <Col N="1327" /> to live&mdash;which have been the ruination of the Seanad.  Motions like this, by which the Seanad allows itself to be turned into a platform for political propaganda, have been the damnation of the Seanad up to this.</P>
      <P>It is my strong fixed opinion that if the Seanad were left alone it would do good work.  It has done good work for the country, excellent work.  You have a body of men in the Seanad&mdash;business men and all-round men in every way&mdash;who, if they were let alone, are still prepared to do good work for the country.  How can any Government stand idly by and see this Assembly at every hand's turn turned into a platform for political propaganda, for the set and sole purpose, as the motion before us shows, of giving the Government set up by the majority of the people a stab in the back?  I am not a betting man unless perhaps I get a &ldquo;good thing.&rdquo;  It usually turns out a very bad thing, but I am prepared to make a small wager.  What shall it be? Say a pinch of snuff out of my friend Senator Comyn's historic snuff-box.  I am prepared to wager a pinch of snuff that this motion will go the way of all similar motions which have come before the House.  After it has been well threshed out, after everything has been said which could be said, I am quite satisfied that you, Sir, will be asked to put it from the Chair that this motion be, by the leave of the House, withdrawn, and the whole matter will end in a bottle of smoke.</P>

      <P>I merely want to say that I think this debate has done one thing.  It has shown the enormous amount of spare time at the disposal of members of this House.  The mover of the motion and his seconder gave us full and ample reasons why it should be passed.  I would like to put it to the supporters of the motion that the many speeches in opposition must have shown them the futility of asking the House to pass this motion.  The motion asks that nine Senators from the different Parties be appointed a Committee to consider and report &ldquo;its opinion.&rdquo;  Its opinion!  We know from experience here that there is no such <Col N="1328" /> thing as a minority report.  You will get no report from these nine Senators on which they will speak with one voice.  Everybody who has heard the speeches on both sides must know that. You will come back with some sort of a report probably, and everybody who disagrees with it will get up and state their reasons for doing so.  This House will then be merely turned into a hustings for the by-elections that are pending.  You will have this House nothing more than a hustings for these two by-elections.</P>

      <P>I am sure it must be with some surprise that Senators on this side of the House find themselves in the position of being able to speak, one after another, without anybody on the opposite side standing up to support Senator Baxter's motion.  I trust that the wisdom of the House will prevail in this matter and that Senator Baxter will withdraw his motion.  I was going to deal with the motion as being an impudent one, but that point has been very completely put by previous speakers.  In my opinion it is a completely impotent one as well.  It can serve no useful purpose whatever. It is useless in the extreme.  Of course, it has given Senator Baxter an opportunity of escaping completely from the terms of his motion and of getting down, in the particular sense, to an attack on the Government's present policy and of dealing with only one phase of the nation's economic activity, namely, agriculture.  My opinion is that the bad position which existed in the country some few years ago was due to the cumulative effects of many years of bad policy.  That can be proved out of the statistics contained in Government publications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with interest to Senator Counihan making the point that there are 90,000 acres less under the plough this year than there were in the last year of office of Mr. Hogan, the then Minister for Agriculture.  If Senator Counihan will look up the latest publication, the latest statistical abstract for 1934, and go down the list of every available agricultural commodity since 1924 down&mdash;not a single commodity in a particular year&mdash;he will find that wheat decreased in acreage from 32,000 <Col N="1329" /> down to 20,000, oats from 688,000 down to 622,000, barley from 156,000 down to 115,000, rye from 8,000 down to 3,500, beans and peas from over 1,000 down to 379, potatoes from 392,000 down to 346,000, turnips from 201,000 down to 181,000, and similarly mangolds, cabbages, mixed crops, etc.  The total acreage under corn, roots, green crops, flax, and fruit decreased by 200,000 acres.  If the Senator takes up the statistics with regard to stock on the land he will find that the number of stock also decreased.  Not alone did the natural wealth of the country decrease owing to the decrease in the value of these commodities, but the natural wealth of the country decreased due to the cumulative effect of six years of mismanagement in government by the predecessors in office of the present Government.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter's motion suggests that some good would come out of the setting up of a select committee of nine Senators.  What would those nine Senators do on such a committee? One of them, I take it, would have to deputise, in a sense, for the Minister for Industry and Commerce, another for the Minister for Finance, another for the Minister for Agriculture, another for the Minister for Lands. One would have to deal with transport, another with labour problems and, yet another with fisheries.  Do not all these things fit into the economic life of the country?  Where are you going to get nine Senators who will be in a position to devote sufficient of their time to work of that kind?  Apart from the fact that they probably could never be unanimous in their findings, where could the Seanad get nine Senators who could devote sufficient of their time to bringing forward a report dealing with present national policy, &ldquo;with particular regard to its consequences on the economic and social life of the nation?&rdquo; Senator Johnson has intruded very briefly on the industrial aspect.  How would such a committee ever hope to reach any degree of finality on problems such as the following: man versus machine in industry, briefly referred to by Senator Johnson; the whole question of currency, the whole <Col N="1330" /> question of women in employment, the whole question of external trade, the whole question of whether the nation is going definitely to be committed to a policy of national self-sufficiency, or whether it is going to go back to the old wilderness of free trade?  Is it not apparent now to Senator Baxter that this motion serves absolutely no useful end apart from the one purpose of affording him a platform for making an attack on the Government's policy?  With its aspect as such, I intend to concern myself in the remaining remarks of my speech.</P>
    <P>I take it that Senator Baxter does not believe in the policy of self-sufficiency in which the Government is engaged at the present moment.  If that is his mentality, I put the point to him that all his arguments, and all the arguments raised by those who supported him, are based on untrue foundations, having regard to the present condition of economic life throughout the entire world.  Every nation in the world is committed at the moment to a policy of self-sufficiency. There is no escape from it. England, in the industrial era commencing at the beginning of the 19th century, waxed wealthy to a considerable degree by virtue of her skill in engineering, by virtue of the coal mines and iron mines which she possessed, of her ramifications throughout the entire world with her colonies and she was able to embark on the machine age.  She supplied the world with manufactured goods and in return she got from those countries food to feed her people and raw products. I am not saying that the Great War entirely changed that.  Other nations had begun to think for themselves, whereas Ireland was left out of the picture and did not get a chance or an opportunity.  Other countries decided they could do likewise, and irrespective of the world war, that condition of affairs for England would have changed.  The world war hastened that change and the volume of trade in the world for the last six years alone has, in accordance with that world-wide policy of self-sufficiency, decreased 66? per cent.  Our volume of trade has, during the last <Col N="1331" /> six years, naturally decreased 50 per cent. up to the present moment.  Any person who believes that this country is not committed to a policy of self-sufficiency, at least until the world changes, is like the ostrich with his neck in the sands.</P>
    <P>There are truer values of the condition of affairs than the values given in the statistics of external trade. External trade is based upon money values, and there has been a gradual decrease in the value of commodities of all descriptions and of manufactured articles during the last ten years. That is another reason why the volume of external trade has decreased.  But there is a very true index of the condition of prosperity in the country, one that has often been mentioned by a representative who is not a supporter of the Government.  That is the internal traffic figures.  For the first time for a number of years the traffic on our railways and on our roads has considerably increased, and the position of the Great Southern Railways is now one that gives hope to a great many.  There has been increased revenue from passengers and traffic, amounting last year to £150,000.  That is a very reliable index, the accuracy of which cannot be denied.  You can juggle around with figures, as to an increase of employment, and compare one year with another to your heart's content, but you will often find them exploded by an adversary.  On taking up the statistics for 1934 the astounding figures of 360,000 will be got, that being the number of men, boys, women and girls classified by industries in 1932 and 1933.  These figures are not a true index any more than figures which were adduced in the other House, that the number of people employed is only half that.  The figures cannot be sufficiently segregated but, in the railway returns, there is a true index.</P>
    <P>Taking the industrial position, and looking at the returns with respect to the promotion of industrial concerns, it will be found that there is very definitely greater confidence on the part of the investing public than there was for many years.  In 1926 the <Col N="1332" /> number of bankruptcies practically equalled the number of new companies formed, whereas last year the number of bankruptcies was the lowest on record for 12 years; the number of deeds of arrangement last year was the lowest on record for 12 years; the number of bills of sale and High Court judgments was the lowest for 12 years, while, on the other side, the number of new companies formed for the promotion of Irish industries was practically doubled.  Senator Baxter cannot make the point that the bad condition in which Irish farmers find themselves in in particular areas is completely due to the policy of the Government&mdash;if at all.  The accumulated arrears of land annuities up to the passing of the 1933 Land Act, was £5,000,000.  Up to the time that the Fianna Fáil Government came into power, thousands of Irish farmers found themselves unable to meet their liabilities, owing to the cumulative effect of seven or eight years of bad government.</P>
    <P>If the Seanad were unhappily to set up this select committee, I imagine that it would take at least 12 months to bring in even the semblance of a report. The present position makes for speedy and quick decisions.  Even the normal tendency is being changed as, under the special laws now enforced the Government is enabled to decide upon quotas and upon tariffs in order to meet the exigencies of present day conditions.  If the Seanad committee were to bring in a report I believe that report would be belated by months.  Decisions have to be taken every week, practically every night, so that I think Senator Baxter should rest well content and withdraw his impudent proposal and let the nation carry on.  If his main contention is to raise the whole question of the economic war, then I say let him, as a patriotic Irishman, yield to the will of the majority of the Irish people, by standing in with them until the nation has won through.</P>

    </P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am of opinion that the majority considers that this question has been debated at sufficient length, I do not intend to detain the <Col N="1333" /> House very long.  There were, however, a number of points raised by Senator Baxter to which I would like to refer.  Senator Baxter knows that most of us awaited with interest the arguments that would be put forward to show why a committee should be set up to inquire into the national policy at present being pursued, with particular regard to its consequences on the economic and social life of the people. I must say that intrigued me very much, especially in view of the fact that Senator Baxter knows that the present Executive Council, when the economic war was at its height, took the most appropriate measures to set up the most authoritative committee that could decide the question the Senator is anxious to decide.  I refer to the decision taken by the Executive Council in 1932, when the economic war was at its height, when they asked, not this body, however august it may be, but a much greater authority, namely, the Irish people, for a decision, when the Irish people gave their verdict by sending back a competent committee which consisted of 153 T.D.s. That was the decision of people affected by the economic war.  Senator Baxter, in prefacing his remarks, stated that he was more or less handicapped, one handicap being that he had not engaged in political debate for a number of years.  Instead of being a handicap that to my mind was a most valuable asset.  The Senator also stated that it was his desire that members of the Seanad should keep an open mind on the question until they heard what he had to say.  While that would be a very desirable state of affairs, I suggest that the real handicap to any Senator or, in fact, to any listener was the question whether the proposer of a motion such as this had an open mind or not.  If the Senator peruses the speech he made at the last meeting of the House I think he will agree that there are certain statements in it which indicate in the clearest possible manner that he had not an open mind.  On several occasions the House was reminded that it was unfortunate that Irishmen right down through the ages, from long before the Battle of Clontarf, had differences.  Senator Baxter is <Col N="1334" /> more or less a pessimist, although he wishes to remain an optimist.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If one has to speak the truth one can only say that it is the desire of every Irishman to decry the efforts of every other Irishman.  We have been like that, I think, all through the ages.  We have not changed one jot or title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is the case I am sure that even Senator Baxter will agree with me when I ask, what is the use in setting up a Seanad committee of nine, composed of men of all Parties, in the hope of getting an impartial verdict on national policy?  Are we in the Seanad of different flesh and blood or have we different feelings from the rest of our people?  Are we able to avoid prejudice? The Senator told us in suggesting the need for this committee that there is ample evidence and data to go before them.  I was rather interested in some of the statistics that were quoted by the Senator.  I have not had time to verify them, and I did not anticipate that the House would meet to-day, or I would have gone into the figures in detail.  There is ample evidence and ample data available for any person who wishes to inquire into and to learn the truth about the position. That ample evidence and data should have been given by the proposer of the motion.  We were given tillage statistics by him, and I did not attach much importance to them until they were repeated by Senator Counihan.  From a cursory examination of official agricultural statistics these may seem true, but, in fact, the manner in which the Senator presented them was equivalent to a gross misrepresentation. The statement was made that there are 90,000 acres of tillage less than there were in the time of the previous Minister for Lands and Agriculture. It would have been better and more accurate if in that statement he explained that included in all the classes under the heading of crops was hay of all kinds.  What are the facts?  It is scarcely accurate to include hay other than first crop hay under the heading of tillage.  In making a comparison it is well to remember that Senator Baxter urged <Col N="1335" /> the desirability of a continuity of agricultural policy.  That is agreed, if it is good and sound.  What was the position before the agricultural policy was changed?  Let us take the figures for 1930 and 1931.  In 1930, corn crops fell by 59,186 acres.  That looked hopeful! The total area under all crops fell by 71,630 acres.  As regards the actual position, comparing 1932 and 1934, the truth is that, excluding hay, tillage increased by 61,330 acres.</P>
    <P>These are the data that we should have if we are going to examine this with an open mind.  We were again told, in stressing the evils of the economic war, how we have been losing and how other nations have been gaining at our expense, probably the insinuation there being that we are making up to the Danes for the hiding we gave them at Clontarf&mdash;despite the warring factions in our nation's midst&mdash;a period to which the Senator referred in the early part of his speech.  Again, we were told by the Senator:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Assuming tastes are changing, there is going to be a very considerable market in Britain for meat. Last year they imported bacon to the value of £23,000,000; of that we sent them £798,000; Denmark sent them over £13,000,000 worth.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It would be very interesting for us to have been told if Denmark had gained what we had lost.  If we had lost such an amount through our own fault in the British market, surely to goodness the Danish exporters are acute enough to have taken advantage of our losses and to have increased their bacon exports to Britain, but such an inference from Senator Baxter's figures is not in accordance with the facts.  I have in my hand the volume of &ldquo;The Accounts Relating to the Trade and Navigation of the United Kingdom,&rdquo; and if Senator Baxter wished to give us the facts he could have verified his figures from it.  These accounts deal with each month during the year 1934.  A mere superficial glance at them discloses the following facts.  Denmark, so far from increasing her exports of bacon to the British market, suffered in respect of that commodity alone a decrease by <Col N="1336" /> £3,241,711, while as regards her exports of dairy produce its value in 1932 was £13,436,387 and in 1934, £9,558,089, showing a decrease of £3,874,298.  These two items represent a total decrease of over £7,100,000. These are data that should have been given by the Senator in what was an otherwise very comprehensive and very full statement in support of his motion.  The inference could be drawn from part of the Senator's speech that he was speaking from a non-political platform and was genuinely anxious to strengthen the hands of the Government of the country.  But I was more or less diverted from that point of view when Senator Baxter went on to tell us in advance what the findings of this impartial committee should be: the Government should immediately cease collecting the annuities, and that the spirit of restlessness which he suggested is in the country to-day&mdash;to whatever extent it may exist&mdash;is due to the policy of the Government.  That, I am afraid, more or less saps my faith in the genuineness of the Senator's arguments that he was approaching this matter with a perfectly open, unbiased mind, and that the adoption of the motion would be to the advantage of the Government, in so far as it would strengthen its hands.  Senator Baxter, in moving his motion, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I want to say right off, as far as the economic war is concerned, that, frankly, I am not looking for any victory for this country by the policy of the present Government or to the defeat of Britain in the economic conflict in which we are at present engaged.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If we are protagonists in this economic war surely it is impossible for us not to be loyal to our own side&mdash;not to wish for victory for the side that we are backing?  In this connection may I recall a statement made by the ex-Minister for Agriculture in 1931 in the course of a speech in which he was speaking of the difficulties then facing the farming community, and which are still facing them.  He told them bluntly then that the prices for their agricultural products were governed and would be governed in the future by world prices, and envisaged <Col N="1337" /> the prospect that not only were prices bad, but that they were going to become worse.  Of course, he did not try to envisage that his Government would cease to exist before many months had passed or that his prophecies would be arguments in favour of the policy of the present Administration.  Here is what the then Minister for Agriculture said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are many problems in this country very difficult to solve. That is not to be wondered at.  The world is passing through the most acute economic crisis in living memory. I should say that it is passing through the most acute crisis that has occurred during the last three or four hundred years.  The strongest countries financially are hardly able to stand up against it.  Countries with the best Civil Service, with the best traditions, the best education and the greatest institutions find it very difficult to deal with these problems.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sure the Senator remembers that debate.  In a few sentences the then Minister for Agriculture epitomised the spirit that is lacking to-day, a public spirit that is lacking in the Senator and those who support him. If they displayed that public spirit it would help the country to win the economic war.  Mr. Hogan said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What saved England on a great many occasions and saved other countries was a public spirit common to every section, to every class and to every political party.  France had &lsquo;La Patrie&rsquo; and England &lsquo;God Save the King.&rsquo;&ldquo;</P>
    <P>I would recommend that statement to the Senator when at this moment the issue is knit.  Whether the Senator means it or not, both himself and those who are supporting him in proposing to have a committee set up are simply doing something that tends to weaken the hands of the Government. I would recommend to them the advice contained in the few lines that I have just quoted from the speech of the ex-Minister for Agriculture.  I think the Senator would be well advised in not pressing his motion. Even though I differ politically from <Col N="1338" /> him, I hesitate to believe that he or any other Senator would consciously do anything that would tend to weaken the hands of the Administration during the continuance of the dispute that exists between this country and Great Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>In concluding the debate, I desire to say that I would like those who differ from me to think that I am not at all as wicked as they seem to represent me.  In putting down the motion I had none of the dishonest or ulterior motives that Senator O'Neill has attributed to me.  Nothing was farther from my mind and my thoughts in putting down the motion, than to do a disservice to the country.  I submit that I have a perfect right to put down such a motion.  Any Senator has, as well as the right to make a case for his motion.  Therefore, a member who does that ought not to be treated as if he had no rights.  I did believe that there was a case for the motion, and because I believed that I put it down in the spirit and hope that something constructive might be done by this House.  I think, in speaking to the motion, I approached it in as fair a spirit as possible.  As I said in my opening speech, I might have said a great many other things, but I did not.  The saying of them might have given offence, but, at the same time, from my point of view they might be absolutely true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Lands was kind enough to say that I approached the subject in a dispassionate, calm way. I tried to.  I believe that I was much fairer to those on the opposite side than they have been to me.  I believe that they are deliberately trying to be unfair, despite the spirit of the times, but I am not going to follow many of them over the sands of the desert that they have traversed.  They have talked but said little.  I would have preferred if they had faced up to the material that I tried to put before the House and not misrepresent the position as it is in the country. I tried to state the position as I saw it, and if I were wrong in my facts I could be controverted.  But my facts <Col N="1339" /> have not been faced up to by any of the speakers on the opposite side, except, perhaps, the Minister for Lands.  Even Senator Johnson, whom I used to know as Deputy Johnson in the old days when I heard him attack agricultural problems with great industry and after careful research, was not helpful.  With his analytical mind he did not attempt to discuss to-day the problem that I tried to put before the House&mdash;the problem of the small farmers and their place in the future economy of the country.</P>
    <P>I put down my motion in the hope that there would be some indication from the other side of the House of a realisation of the fact that there are at least honest differences of opinion: that there are some of us who are convinced that what we say is true. Perhaps it is the misfortune of every Irishman&mdash;of every Irishwoman, too &mdash;that he thinks he is 100 per cent. right.  I do not subscribe to that, and I do not urge that I am 100 per cent. right.  Perhaps I am 90 per cent., 80 per cent., 70 or 60 per cent. right.  I am quite prepared to have my point of view, my policy and my facts examined.  I am open to conviction. I did hope that there would be some reciprocity, a recognition of the fact that this is a common problem that the country and not a political party only has to face.  Even in our short life as a new State, we have seen political parties come and pass.  The spirit shown in his speech by the Minister for Lands was, I think, reasonable, but those who followed him on the same side were not, in my view, reasonable.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands delivered a speech in my county on Sunday last at a place about a mile from my own home.  He was referring to a statement that had been made by a member of my Party, and he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dealing with the recent statement of a leading member of the Opposition to the effect that if the Government settled the economic war the U.I.P. was prepared to help the Government, Senator Connolly said that he longed for the day when <Col N="1340" /> that unity would be attained, but why should the U.I.P. wait on the end of the economic war?  Why not let the whole strength of the nation be put behind the Government in its struggle for what were the bare rights of this country?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am as concerned about the rights of this country, I believe, as anybody else.  Like others, I like to give my country service, and I have gone through my share of suffering and I am concerned about the country's future.  I did hope that somebody on the other side of the House would say, &ldquo;Yes, there is a problem there to be examined, and even though this committee may not be the best method for examining the problem in a calm, impartial atmosphere there ought to be a way found.&rdquo;  How am I to accept it that, as the Minister says, he wants to see unity in the country?  How am I to be expected to give 100 per cent. loyal support to a policy in which I have not faith or confidence as being the best policy for the country?  Because I tried to reveal my mind to this House, what do we find?  One Senator after another getting up with the comment, &ldquo;Impudent,&rdquo;&ldquo;Imprudent,&rdquo; and allegations about not understanding the problem.  With all respect to these Senators, I understand that aspect of the problem as well, at least, as any other Senator here.</P>
    <P>The Senators who have spoken said very little to which I have to reply. Senator Fitzgerald made certain statements to give an indication of the prosperity that, he says, exists.  We all admit that there is an appearance of prosperity in many of our towns.  But how is that appearance of prosperity created?  I do not deny that there is a great deal of money in circulation. Old Age Pensions have been increased. Assistance is being given from the Unemployment Fund.  Money is being borrowed for building and reconstruction in every town.  Water-supply schemes and other schemes are being carried out on the credit of the State&mdash; to be paid for at a future date.  That is giving an appearance of artificial prosperity which, I believe, rural Ireland is getting no share of but towards which the people of the rural areas <Col N="1341" /> are expected to make an unreasonable contribution.  I should like to see our towns grow rich and prosperous.  I should like to see the people of the towns happy.  But I do not want to see built up here a civilisation under which no man will want to stay on the land.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in replying to my remarks, pointed to the problem that was facing the Government as regards unemployment, due to the fact that emigration had been stopped. That was a problem which also confronted their predecessors.  I venture to suggest that, if the barrier against emigration was raised now, there was never seen in our generation such an exodus from this country as there would be then.  And it is not the type of people who went before who would go.  I do not want to dwell unreasonably on that aspect of the situation but there it is and it is not going to vanish in a night.  The problem is not going to be solved by the kind of spirit evinced and the method of approach adopted by some of the Senators who have spoken.  I desire to say a few words regarding statements made by the Minister for Lands, in replying to my case.  He suggested that if the atmosphere and attitude I applied to these problems had been applied 18 months ago, things would be, in many respects different.  He went on to refer to the kind of opposition experienced by the present Government. The Minister, in making that statement, adopted, to a certain extent, the attitude of mind of Mr. J. H. Thomas when he was making his last statement in reference to the position in this country.  The Minister must think that the people here have very short memories.  In my view, that is true of Mr. J.H. Thomas, too.  He made reference at great length to the sanctity of agreements. That stands out in the forefront of his statement.  The making of such a statement obviously called for, perhaps, the only retort that President De Valera could make to such a statement.  The fact is that agreements are agreements until they are altered.  Agreements regulating <Col N="1342" /> the relationships of other nations have been altered in the past and will be altered again.  There were agreements made by this country with England in the past and they were not regarded is very sacred.  The trouble is that our memories are long memories and we think of those things when British statesmen refer to the &ldquo;sanctity of agreements.&rdquo;  It would be much better, in my view, if President de Valera forgot all about this point raised by Mr. J.H. Thomas and went and made peace between the two countries&mdash;an honourable peace, maintaining the dignity of the nations, as we believe it could be made.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when making reference to the type of opposition offered the Government, should have remembered that this Government is the fifth since the establishment of the Free State and that there was opposition to the other Governments.  I was part of that opposition and Senator Johnson was part of it.  We were a type of opposition, but we were not altogether typical of the opposition offered to these Governments in the past.  That is part of our difficulty to-day.  When the Minister made reference to the kind of opposition offered by us or our Party to the existing Government, he could very well have turned round and lectured his own benches about the type of opposition offered in the past because that, to a great extent, is responsible for the spirit in this country to day.  Our memories are too long.  It would be much better if there were a different spirit abroad.  To some people it would seem as if we had not any rights at all merely because we are an Opposition.  In other days the argument generally was that all the rights were with the Opposition.  I can look back to the days when the very same conflict was being waged between the predecessors of the present Government and the Government of Great Britain as is being waged to-day.  I remember speaking the night before the Ultimate Financial Settlement was signed in London, to a leading member of the Cabinet and a leading member of the then Government Party and saying: &ldquo;If our people in London are prepared to stand up to these people, they will <Col N="1343" /> get the backing of the country.&rdquo;  I believe that Senator Johnson said the same thing at the same time, but there were a great many people in the country who were not saying that at that time.  Had it been said then, as a similar statement was made the other day in Tipperary by one of the leaders of our Party, the history of this country might have been different.  I have no desire to dwell on these things, but I think it is right to advert to the fact that if there has been opposition&mdash; opposition that was legitimate and justifiable because it represented a very big percentage of the total votes of the people&mdash;there was opposition in the past of a different type.  I have no desire to add to fires that I would like to see burnt out, but all this antagonism has not been on one side. If Senator Connolly was courageous enough to say: &ldquo;We know that a great deal of the opposition that was offered to legitimate government in the past was not the best type of opposition; if the type of opposition offered by the Johnsons the Baxters and others had been pursued by all, it would have been better&rdquo;&mdash;if things like that were said, it would do a great deal to improve the spirit of the country.  Unfortunately, it is very difficult to get our people to say anything like that, because Irishmen always believe that they are 100 percent. right.</P>
    <P>The difficulty in which I find myself is that my statement has not drawn an argument in reply.  I traversed the position with regard to agriculture fully and fairly.  Senator Boyle made reference to the figures I gave. I did not say, in my statement with regard to the imports into Britain from Denmark and this country, that Denmark had increased her imports into Britain.  What I did point to was the colossal amount in cash which the Danes brought home for their agricultural products as against what we were getting.  I pointed out that there we had a place where we could put our people working.  I expressed the hope that the relationship between this country and Great Britain would be defined along lines that would give <Col N="1344" /> us an opportunity for continuity of policy, both agricultural and industrial, and put our farmers in a position in which they, their sons and daughters would be able to get a decent living in doing the type of work they understand and in which they are efficient. I pointed out that if the Danes are able to bring home £13,000,000 for the bacon and hams they are able to send to Britain, there is no reason why we here ought not to get a much greater share in that market.  People have to work to live.  They have to sell the products of their labour if their labour is to bring them any return.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to my point regarding the land annuities. When I raised this question and suggested that it would be good policy to cease collection of the land annuities, I saw just as clearly as the Minister the difficulty that would confront this country and the farmers in respect of their land, if the payment of land annuities was to cease altogether.  I realised that their right to hold their farms would probably be challenged, and I never sought or asked for such a concession.  I do not think that it would be wise to do so in the farmer's best interests or in the interest of stable government in the future.  What I did suggest was that there was every reason why the collection of land annuities should not only be slowed down but should cease during that period when our farmers are engaged in a type of production, as they have been for some time past, which, in many cases, is not bringing them the cost of production.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Cathaoirleach resumed the Chair.</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have no doubt whatever as to what is inevitable if the economic war continues for any considerable period, as far as the collection of land annuities is concerned.  I think it is a disastrous condition of things and a disastrous position where you have to send the sheriff to the doors of decent farmers in every county in Ireland to collect the land annuities.  There are decent men and women on the land to-day, decent men who wanted to pay their way and who <Col N="1345" /> worked hard so that they might be able to pay their way, and they brought their cattle to the fairs and markets day after day and month after month &mdash;I have seen it myself and I have done it myself, and I could not get cash for what I had to sell&mdash;and they have taken their cattle home again, and there they are and they are not able to sell them.  There is nothing unreasonable or unjust is asking that these men should be given a chance to live first.  Instead, you have the sheriff coming to the doors of these honest citizens, and there is this consideration, mind you: when the sheriff comes once&mdash;there are a great many people who do not want to see him come&mdash;but when he comes once I am afraid that they will not mind so much his coming a second time, and I am afraid that in the years to come it will not be good for the morals of our people.  Now, I think that the morals of our people are worth a great deal in cash, but I think the Exchequer could find some way of getting this money, if it is in the country, other than collecting from the farmer after the farmer has been compelled to pay so much into the English Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I have not decried either the policy of wheat or of beet.  The beet growers, as far as one can judge, are not displaying any great enthusiasm about the policy themselves.  I know that wheat growers can make money at present as against the production of other agricultural commodities, but what I am concerned with, in the first place, is whether the cost of wheat to the nation in future will be worth the money to the nation to grow wheat as against the production of other commodities when the markets are free again.  Senator Johnson made reference to something I said some years ago.  Nothing that I have said to-day or that I said on the debate a few days ago contradicted anything that I said then, and Senator Johnson, clever as he is in adapting the sayings of other days to the conditions of to-day, will admit that, bad as the conditions were then, they have been accentuated a thousandfold by the conditions which have been created <Col N="1346" /> for us since and which, in my view, were, to a considerable extent, avoidable.</P>
    <P>Now, we feel that we did not enter into a discussion on the economic war. I deliberately avoided it.  We here, on this side of the House, are very sick of the spirit displayed towards us when we attempt to give expression to our view with regard to what we think is best for the country in the future, but we have at least the right to say what we think is best.  It may not be acceptable to the majority now, but majorities have a queer way of shifting their ground, and majorities get experience and they benefit by that experience. We have no desire to see this nation put in any position other than that for which generations of our people have been striving.  We have played our part in the striving ourselves, and our aim is to preserve the rights of this nation intact for the people that are to come.  At the same time, however, we want to live in this generation or there is not going to be another generation. It is not going to be any satisfaction to us to create in our day such intolerable conditions for the people who are to come after us that nobody will be got to stay in the country or to stay on the land or work on the land.  We feel&mdash;I did feel when I was putting down the motion&mdash; that there was a possible chance that there would have been a realisation on the part of the Senators on the other side that all was not rosy in the garden and that, no matter how you attempt to pretend that it is, the cold, hard facts will stare you in the face when you go back down the country in the week-end.  We have not struck the chord.  There was none of the Government speakers as reasonable as the Minister himself.  Apparently, he, at least, is growing wiser.  The problems of land, with which he is being brought more into contact since he went into that Ministry, are perhaps a revelation to him.  I sometimes think that if, whenever this country has £500,000 to spend&mdash;which it sometimes spends rather foolishly and thoughtlessly&mdash;it were to set aside that sum year after year for a few years and give a number of its most responsible citizens here an <Col N="1347" /> opportunity of getting out of this country on a short holiday, of getting away from their island home and seeing other peoples in their difficulties and struggles and in their might, perhaps when they came back here again they would have more wisdom as to how this country's affairs might be managed.</P>

      <P>With regard to our next meeting, I observe from the Dáil Order Paper that it is probable that to-morrow or on Friday the Local Government (Extension of Franchise) Bill, 1933, and the Local Government (Dublin) Bill, 1933. will be again sent to us under Article 38a of the Constitution, the suspensory period of 18 months having expired in both cases.  I do not think we are likely to receive any other business.  In the circumstances I should like to take the opinion of the House as to whether we should meet next Wednesday in order to consider these two Bills or whether it would not be better to adjourn till Wednesday week, when we may have other work as well.  What does the House think?</P>

      <P>There is no great urgency, Senator, and they could be dealt with on Wednesday week, when we may have more work.</P>
      <P>The House agreed to the suggestion to adjourn until Wednesday week.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 6.15 p.m., till Wednesday, 6th March, at 3 p.m.</P>
