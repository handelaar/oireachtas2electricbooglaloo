    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Acting Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Boland) Acting Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Boland)">
      <NameTxt>Acting Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a temporary measure providing for the relief of rates on agricultural land in the present financial year. This financial year the amount of the grant has been raised to £1,970,000, that is an increase of £220,000, as compared with 1933/34.  Originally the Saorstát portion of the agricultural grant was almost £600,000 and it remained at that figure from the year 1898 to 1925, when it was doubled.  In 1931 it was increased by £750,000 and the total was then £1,948,022.  When the present Administration took office in 1932 the grant was increased by £250,000, but this last-mentioned increase was devoted particularly to the relief of holdings of £10 valuation and under and the first £10 of larger holdings.  The grant was then £2,198,022.  In the following year, 1933/34, the amount of the grant was again reviewed and fixed at £1,750,000, which, as compared with the previous year, was a reduction of £448,022.  I may say that the sum of £470,000 mentioned in Section 4 of the Bill is made up of a grant of £250,000, which has been voted since 1932 and the new money, amounting to £220,000, voted this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whilst increasing the grant above <Col N="943" /> last year's figure, the Bill provides for its application in a new way.  Every occupier of land not exceeding £20 in valuation gets this year the same rate of relief as he got last year on the first £10.  The rate of relief last year on the first £10 is the primary allowance rate this year and this rate of relief is extended up to the £20 valuation limit.  This costs an additional sum of £116,000.  Allowances given to occupiers, whose holdings do not exceed £20 in valuation and to the first £20 of larger holdings, are called primary allowances and it is estimated that these primary allowances will absorb £1,182,000 of the grant, and will cover land valuations amounting to £3,700,000.  Included in the primary allowances is a comparatively small sum which is transferable to certain urban districts that were formerly included in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>The part of the land valuation above £20 can get relief either by means of an employment allowance or a supplementary allowance or both.  Where an occupier of land of over £20 valuation had one or more men, whether relatives or employees, at work continuously on his holding in the nine months preceding the 31st December, 1933, he was asked to make a claim to the employment allowance.  For each man an abatement at the primary allowance rate was made on the part of the valuation above £20, provided that this was not calculated on more than £12 10s. valuation for each man. The county councils received claims in respect of about 130,000 men, less than half of them being relatives of the occupiers.  These employment allowances amount, it is estimated, to £386,000.  The balance of the new money after the additional cost of the primary allowance is met goes to meet in part the employment allowances. When the cost of the employment allowance is added to the cost of the primary allowance, £1,570,000 of the grant will be absorbed, and there will then be left £400,000.</P>
    <P>This balance of £400,000 has been applied as a supplementary allowance at an equal rate in each county over the remaining valuation, that is, over <Col N="944" /> the valuations that received no relief out of the primary or employment allowances.  The supplementary allowance is in every county less than the primary allowance; in most counties the difference is over 2/- in the £. This new scheme has already been put into operation.  It has involved a good deal of labour on the staffs of the local authorities in examining and certifying claims and making the allowances, but much of this is incidental to the first year of the new scheme and we anticipate that in future years, if the scheme is continued, it will call for less effort.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should say a few words with regard to the reasons for making a change in the method of applying the grant.  The system which had been in force since 1898 of giving relief to every occupier, whether large or small, at exactly the same rate is no longer regarded as satisfactory.  Whilst in each county a flat rate has been given to all holders up to £20, the Bill differentiates between larger holders who give employment and those that do not.  It is recognised that this year the differentiation is not very great, but it was considered that in the initial year, at any rate, it was not expedient to curtail too drastically the amount of relief to which large holders, who gave no employment, had got in recent years.  I may say, however, that it is not the intention to maintain supplementary allowances at a relatively high rate.</P>
    <P>Employment allowances, it should be noted, are confined to those who give permanent employment.  The Bill does not admit allowances in respect of casual workers or in respect of women workers.  The share of each council in the grant is determined by the Bill and is set out in the Second Schedule.  Each county was first allotted a sum equal to last year's share of the grant and the amount (if any) payable to urban districts within the county.  The whole of the additional sum required for the primary allowance was then allotted and the balance was divided in proportion to the amount of the employment allowances.  With regard to the urban districts that participate in the grant, <Col N="945" /> they get the same share from the county council as last year with whatever sum is necessary to bring the rate of relief on the first £20 in the urban district up to the county rate.</P>
    <P>The Bill allows an abatement of rates to be given either by a reduction of the amount demanded as set out on the demand note or by way of a credit note given separately from the demand note.  Some counties have demanded the net rate and some have given the supplementary allowance by means of credit notes, and some have, in addition, given part of the primary allowance by means of credit notes. These credit notes, which expire on the 31st March next, have been found an incentive to ratepayers to pay their rates within the financial year.  It has been left to county councils to decide as to the manner in which the abatement will be given, but except in the case of multiple holdings, that is, where an occupier has more than one holding, the Minister has not sanctioned all the allowances being given by way of credit notes.</P>
    <P>The presentation of this Bill has been somewhat delayed owing to the difficulty of making a satisfactory allocation of the money voted until the cost of the primary and employment allowances was known.  It is, however, only a temporary measure and it is hoped, with the fuller information now available, that it will be possible to bring forward the proposals for next financial year in good time.  It is desirable that the Bill become law at the earliest date possible.  Any suggestions made with regard to the scheme will be carefully examined, but members will understand that owing to the date we have now reached, I am not in a position to accept any radical amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill legalises the method of distributing the agricultural grant for this year.  One wonders how the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, who derives his powers from the Minister and Secretaries Act, could have instructed the county councils under his jurisdiction to administer this grant in a manner which was not in accord with the law <Col N="946" /> existing at the time.  However, this Bill will legalise his action.  The procedure in this case shows the power possessed by a Minister when he can change the law, although holding office by virtue of the law and appointed to carry out the law.  A Minister can change the law and, afterwards, come to the Oireachtas and have his action legalised.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that a change of this sort in the distribution of the agricultural grant should have been made without proper investigation.  While many people would be in favour of giving the employer of labour an advantage over the man who does not employ labour, the only advantage he obtains under this Bill is represented by the sum of 26/- per year per employed man.  That is no inducement whatever to a man to employ labour.  If the idea underlying the Minister's action was to get farmers to employ labour, he has given them very little inducement to do so.  It was hardly worth while framing a Bill and bringing in legislation to effect a change which will not be of any value in bringing about the state of affairs which the Minister hoped to bring about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I desire to make a few general remarks on the question of the rates. The time is rapidly approaching when expenditure by local authorities will have to be curbed.  There will have to be some upper limit to this expenditure. As everybody knows, notwithstanding the reliefs given&mdash;and they are very heavy&mdash;the burden of rates on the agricultural community is out of all reason in the economic circumstances in which they find themselves. It is very strange that the rates should be getting heavier year by year while the income of those who have to pay the rates is getting less.  In 1897 the rating of the whole Free State area amounted to £1,200,000.  This Bill brings in relief to the extent of £2,000,000.  In addition to that £2,000,000 the farmers will have to contribute close on £3,000,000, showing the enormous increase that has taken place in local expenditure.  I think that the Minister should consider the fixing of an upper limit to expenditure on local utilities.  We know that many local <Col N="947" /> utilities are not a liability.  A housing scheme which pays its way does not affect the position of the ratepayers, but many of the schemes for the purpose of assisting the unemployed are, in the incidence of their cost, pressing heavily upon people who cannot afford to bear the burden and whose income is not as good as we should like it to be.  We all know that when income is decreasing it is not fair to raise rates.  The original agricultural grant amounted to close on £2,600,000.  In 1925 the then Government, following a motion, moved by me as a member of the small Farmers' Party in the Dáil, drawing attention to the incidence of rating, undertook to consider the matter when framing the next Budget.  They honoured their promise and, in the following year, they doubled the agricultural grant, for which we were very thankful at the time.  Since then the grant was increased to £750,000 and that was, more or less, looked upon as a stable amount.  The new Ministry came along and reduced that £750,000 by £448,000.  We had the sums of £2,600,000, £600,000 and £750,000.  This year we are really getting £22,000 more.</P>
    <P>With regard to the allowances made for employment, I do not think that the scheme is a fair one.  Seasonal occupation accounts for a great deal. In the raising of potatoes, for instance, there would be quite a number of people working for weeks.  In County Dublin a considerable amount of labour will be given this year in that way.  I think that the Minister ought to consider the granting of relief based on the number of days' work given to men employed in this way.  Even if he only went so far as to tot up the number of days' work given and the result was equivalent to the permanent employment of one man, he should give relief in respect of that man.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could bring in some legislative change in that direction.  It is certainly necessary. Most of the tillage farmers, I think, have considerable numbers of people engaged in planting potatoes, raising potatoes, hay-making, threshing, in <Col N="948" /> which a tremendous amount of employment is given; but no credit is given to them for that.  The Minister could make an advance by totalling up the wages paid and by making allowances upon the wages paid.  I hope this matter will be very seriously, and very carefully, considered, because the question as to how land should be worked, in these times, is a very difficult question. No Minister for Local Government ought, off his own bat, to decide how the land is to be worked or not to be worked.  The owner of the land is the best judge of how it should be worked, and warning ought to be given not to enter lightly into disturbances of this sort until the matter has been very carefully and very thoroughly investigated by people who know what they are doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As farmers we are thankful for the relief given under this Bill.  I do not want to find fault with the method of allocation; so long as the farmers get relief I do not find fault with the way in which it is distributed.  But I regret the Minister has not made some provision for the farmer who holds his land in fee simple, and who is given no relief while the farmer paying annuities got these annuities reduced by half.  I think the Minister should consider the justice of placing all farmers on the same level.  Farmers paying annuities had these annuities reduced by half. They got that reduction to meet the depression in the farming community and the loss in trade.  Rates and rents were for a number of years about equal but now one class of farmers have got a reduction by half and I think it would be only reasonable that the Minister should equalise the position of the other farmers by having the rates on the man who holds his land in fee simple reduced so as to put him on the same level with the annuitant.  A good many farmers own their land in fee simple and are paying very much more in the way of interest to the banks on the money they borrowed in order to buy that land.  In many other cases the savings of the farmers went to redeem their annuities in advance. <Col N="949" /> There are thousands of cases of farmers who, when they found themselves in possession of a few pounds used them to clear off their annuities. These men are in a worse position to-day than ever; all their savings are gone.  Others who borrowed money from the bank are paying high interest on the money which they borrowed to purchase the fee simple of their land.  I think it is up to the Minister to give some relief to these classes of farmers and I intend, on the Committee Stage, to move an amendment to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I stress the matter referred to by Senator Wilson, that is as to the unfair allocation of the relief of rates in regard to agricultural labourers.  In the county in which I live farmers who employ six labourers for six months could get no relief at all with regard to the employment relief of rates.  That is unfair.  Several instances of this kind came under my notice.  Take the sugar beet industry.  Roughly speaking, extra men are employed for six months in this industry.  The labour bill is a very heavy one indeed where the farmers now are getting only a very small return.  The present year in the sugar beet industry is a most unfortunate one.  These conditions will press very hard, indeed, on the beet growers who have to employ casual labour if they are not going to get any relief.  I think if relief were given in reduced rates it would be an encouragement, at any rate, to people to continue in this industry which they may find it very difficult to do in the future.  Although the amount of relief is small still every little helps.  I think it would be fair if the Minister would consider six months for the casual labourer.  I think that would be better than the suggestion that Senator Wilson made of totalling up the amount of wages paid.  The wages vary in different districts. I think if the work of the casual labourer employed for six months is considered that would satisfy a great many people so far as they can be satisfied.  Paying only for permanent employees is not fair. <Col N="950" /> It is not fair to the tillage farmer who employs most labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>The method adopted in the Bill is at least fair to the labouring man.  It is very undesirable that agricultural labour should be casual, and anything that tends to encourage farmers to employ their workers throughout the year is a desirable thing.  For that reason I think the Seanad ought to be in favour of the proposals contained in the Bill, so far as they go, because they certainly tend to encourage people to keep their workmen all the year round.  As regards what Senator Wilson suggested&mdash;that an account should be kept of the number of days' wages paid&mdash;the only exception I see to that is that it would be impossible to check the accounts.  Senator Wilson, and all of us, are, I think, opposed to the multiplication of public servants for checking accounts.  I think that objection is sufficient to dispose of this matter. Senator Miss Browne, I think, contended that the period ought to be reduced to six months.  Well, what about the other six months?  If you employ a man for six months, why not employ him for the twelve months? Take the question of pulling the beet in the harvest time.  If you have men pulling the beet in the harvest time, you ought to have men sowing the beet in the spring time.  So, I do not think there is so very much in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>May I explain&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, we know what Senator Miss Browne will explain very well.  Of course, I agree that it is not much.  I quite accept what Senator Wilson says&mdash;that it is only about £1 8s. 0d. in the year.  It is not very much, but it is a beginning, and I think it is a very good idea to make an allowance in the rates in respect of employment given; because one of the greatest evils in this country at the present time is the fact that the agricultural labourer is not fully employed and is only a casual man instead of being, as he ought to be, a permanent man.  And he would be a permanent man if farmers would arrange their industry in such <Col N="951" /> a way as to see that employment is given all the year round.</P>
      <P>There is another matter that I would like to mention, and that is that I would like to question the suggestion made by Senator Wilson to the effect that the farmer is the best judge of how the land of this country ought to be worked.  Certainly, to a great extent, he is a very good judge; but I have seen farms worked in such a way that they gave the maximum profit to the man who rented them and the minimum employment to the people of the parish.  That is a state of affairs that, I think, cannot be allowed to exist in its entirety.  The population of this country, happily, is increasing, and we see now, as a result of the last four or five years, that the more employment that is given the more money goes round and the better it is for everybody concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the principal points in this Bill is the encouragement of labour: that people who employ labour should be encouraged to do so as much as possible and as much as their farms will allow.  Unfortunately, however, what suits one part of the country will not suit another part.  For instance, in Munster, farms are run with a great deal of day-to-day labour, as far as I know, whereas in Connacht there is practically no such thing as a labourer who is not also a holder of land himself.  The small farmer in the West works his own land and cannot, therefore, employ labour, because he is doing the work himself. It is very difficult to know how that is going to be managed.  The systems are different in different parts of the country and what suits in one part of the country will not suit in another part.  I dare say that a way out of the difficulty will be found, but we should look at it from that point of view and consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which I should like to mention to the Minister is the question of the distribution that is being made this year, and perhaps next year, of the different quotas.  There is a case, for instance, of which I am aware, in which the rates are £72 in the year.  That is about the same as <Col N="952" /> last year, taken as a whole, but the way it is divided is rather involved, in my opinion.  It is divided in this way: the first quota is £36&mdash;that is, half of the total; the second quota is only £7, and the rest is made up by donations from the Government.  The donation works out at £29 in that case.  The effect of that is that almost the whole of the rates are paid in the first half-year and only a small proportion&mdash;£7 out of £72&mdash;paid in the second half-year. You may say that it is all the same in the end, but a man may not be able to pay £36 in one half-year very easily and only £7 in the other. It may not be convenient for him, and it seems to me that it should be distributed somewhat differently.  No doubt, as I say, these matters will be worked out, but I am afraid that the question of labour will lead to a great many difficulties.  Unless my information from the West is wrong, there will be a great many people who will pretend to employ labour and it will be very difficult for the authorities to keep an exact record of how much labour any particular farmer is using. How can it be done?  The farmers, if they are human at all, will pretend to employ as much labour as possible while, in actual fact, using as little as they can.  That, of course, will have to be worked out locally, and I have no doubt that it will be worked out, but it is a point that is worth considering.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Colonel Moore has raised an important point, and that is, the question of the administration of this new scheme.  The Minister referred to the delay in bringing in the Bill, and he also referred to the difficulties experienced in working it out.  He did not give us any details of the difficulties that had been met with, but it seems to me that they would be pretty considerable and that a considerable amount of office work is going to be entailed by this new system if it is to be worked in such a way as to make it reasonably satisfactory and not to lead to well-founded complaints of mishandling of one sort or another.  From that point of view, it is questionable whether it is worth having this new system at all, because, <Col N="953" /> while somebody has said that it gives encouragement to the employment of labour, I do not think that that is so. In the case of a man who employs labour as compared with the man who gets a supplementary grant, it will not lead to increased employment of labour.  In fact, at the present rate it is like giving a medal to a man who employs labour, but it will not lead to a change in his economy.  It will not lead to his growing one crop instead of another or keeping live stock or anything of that nature.  It is purely a gesture on the present basis, and whether it is worth making that gesture at the cost of the difficulties and the extra administrative expense that is going to be involved is exceedingly doubtful.  Even if you had no supplementary grant and if the whole amount, after the primary grant on the present basis, were given by way of employment grant, it is doubtful whether it would lead to any extra employment or to any additional rewards in the way of wages to the agricultural labourer or that it would be doing anything more than the mere making of a gesture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister, arising out of one of his remarks, whether he has information that the slowness in collecting rates up to the present this year&mdash;whether the failure to get in any substantial proportion of the rates up to the present or quite recently&mdash;was due to the introduction of this new system, or whether this new system was only partly responsible, and whether or not the delay was due to the fact that there was a heavy overhang from last year, and to increasing difficulties in getting payment. The Minister says that it is a temporary Bill.  Does he anticipate that the relief that is given under this Bill will prove sufficient to make the system work next year and the year after if the handicaps under which the farmers are labouring have not been removed?  The information I have is that it is quite right to have this Bill a temporary Bill because, if the whole system of finance is not to break down, there will have to be very much more substantial grants given than are given <Col N="954" /> under this Bill, at any rate as long as the present conditions continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasToal" hpid="Mr. Toal Mr. Toal">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Toal</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister if it is expected that this Bill will continue next year.  I may say that it is very confusing to county councils; they do not know where they stand.  Last year, owing to the confusion, the rate books were not got out at an advanced period of the year. There was a great deal of confusion, with the result that additional hands had to be employed.  It would be very desirable to let the county councils know if this Bill is likely to continue next year.  Perhaps if the Minister considered this matter from another angle he might be able to attain his object in a much better way. A number of county councils have considered for a long time the advisability of making an extra allowance in the rates in respect of the amount of tillage done by each farmer.  I think that would be one way of getting increased tillage and increased employment. It would be a much fairer way than the method proposed in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I am sure it is very well known to the officials of the Department that there is a great deal of fraud and misrepresentation attempted on the county councils and the Local Government Department.  Farmers who may not be in a position to employ a labourer the whole year round are in a difficulty.  Anyone connected with the farming industry knows that there are periods of the year when additional hands have to be employed. That would apply both in the springtime, and the harvest-time particularly. No allowance is made for that and it is very hard on the farmers. I think that this Bill requires very serious consideration.  I hold that if a subsidy were given to each farmer in respect of the amount of tillage he carries out, the Government will achieve their object more rapidly; they will have increased tillage and it will be much fairer to the agricultural labourer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The presentation of such a Bill as this seems to imply that this sort of procedure will become a permanent <Col N="955" /> feature of our national life. We have nothing to maintain the agricultural industry except the system of grants and bounties and so on.  These are all very well and are very acceptable to farmers in their present condition, but it is rather disturbing to have to subsidise so many foodstuffs so as to keep the farmer in production. For instance, we have sugar subsidised at an enormous sum; we are going to have flour subsidised by the consumer, and so on.  I think we may accept it that these grants, subsidies and doles have become a permanent feature of our national life.</P>
      <P>The Government are the cause of all this and I think their policy is altogether wrong, and is leading us to a very dangerous position.  The policy of the Government with regard to protection, industrial revival and so on, and their policy with regard to the annuities have brought agricultural values, whether in respect of agricultural produce or live stock, down to the very lowest plane.  Indeed, agricultural values are so low that it is doubtful if the farmers can much longer continue in production.  I think it is time that the Government set about putting their house in order. Instead of increasing taxation at the rate of £3,000,000 a year they should endeavour to reduce it by £3,000,000 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter what may be said about necessary public services, I think the time has come when we must cut our cloth according to our measure.  The time has come when those engaged in services outside of agriculture will have to reconsider their position with regard to standards of income and standards of living.  We have reached the stage when there are the lowest prices for everything the farmer has to sell and increased prices for everything he has to buy.  There are many people in the country who will have to reconsider their position and I feel sure that they must arrive at the conclusion that the farmers cannot carry on under present conditions, and the whole national economy will have to be reviewed and put on a different plane.  If such a step is not taken <Col N="956" /> we will simply have all these grants and doles continued and nobody knows where that will lead to.</P>
    <P>There is one point in regard to this proposal that is rather deceitful, to say the least of it.  It was mentioned some time ago by the Minister, or someone on his behalf, that in order to make up the grants given to the farmers now the bounties would be either reduced or withdrawn.  In the case of younger cattle the bounties have been withdrawn and in regard to older cattle they have been reduced. The fact is that in this respect the Government are offering no relief at all.  They are merely taking money from one pocket and putting it into the other.  That is not playing fair with the agricultural producer.  The wealth of the State is dependent on the agricultural producer.  When the Government took office they offered an increase in the grant, but in the following year they reduced the grant in spite of the very acute conditions for which they were responsible.  They reduced the grant by £448,000.  Now they are offering £220,000 by way of relief.  They are playing fast and loose with the farmers.</P>
    <P>In connection with this particular grant the Minister in the other House threatened the larger farmers, differentiated against them.  That is not justified because I think the larger farmers are an absolutely necessary link in agricultural production.  They are necessary to the smaller farmers and are necessary to the State on account of their output.  It comes very badly from the Minister or anyone else to hold out this type of differentiation against the larger farmers, who are a necessary link in the national economy and in the national production.  The larger farmers have no share in the Government grants. They receive no local benefits for improvements in live stock; they receive no bounties and they receive nothing towards the education of their families.  I suggest that the Government should put their house in order. They should decide that those outside agricultural life must come down to the standard on which the farmers have to live, otherwise we will very soon <Col N="957" /> arrive at the day, if we have not already arrived at it, when the farmers will be little better than bond slaves to the other half of the nation.</P>

      <P>The last Senator said he believed that these grants will become a feature of the national life.  Surely, he knows that for the last 40 years this agricultural grant has been given.  Half the rates were actually relieved in 1898, and at the same time about 60 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1898 grant was meant to pay off the landlord's portion of the county rate.  It was not meant in any sense as a relief to farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator can put it that way if he likes, but at any rate since the Free State was established the money given in this way has gone to the relief of rates.  I might also remind the Senator that a rather large burden was taken off the ratepayers by the Unemployment Assistance Act which the Government introduced and passed last year.  Under that Act, the Government certainly gave considerable relief to the rates, though the Senator seems to have forgotten all about that. Senator Toal asked if this Bill would be continued next year.  It is hoped that it will.  It is hoped, too, to introduce it at an earlier stage and that the difficulties in the way of doing that will not be as great as they were in the case of this measure.  The Senator thought that the amount of relief given to a farmer under this Bill should be measured by the amount of tillage he did rather than by the amount of employment he gave.  To carry out the Senator's suggestion would involve administrative difficulties of a very grave kind.  In fact, I do not think it would be possible to get over them.  It would be almost impossible to check the amount of tillage done on each farm.  It is far easier and more satisfactory, I think, to check the amount of employment given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, but nevertheless we feel that the method outlined in the Bill is the better one. We think that it will give more satisfactory results.  It would be almost impossible to carry out this if the relief were to be afforded on a tillage basis.  The number of people permanently employed on the farm is, I think, the more satisfactory basis to go on.  Senator Blythe spoke of the administrative difficulties and asked whether the system was worth while. He said this was only a gesture on the part of the Government.  As a matter of fact, the Minister for Local Government said that himself on the Second Reading of the Bill in the Dáil, and expressed the opinion that in future years he hoped to make it something more than a gesture: something that would be progressively attractive to farmers to encourage them to keep people in permanent employment.  It is the opinion of the Government that, as time goes on, this measure will prove an inducement to farmers to do that.  The Senator also asked if the failure to get in the rates was due to the introduction of this system.  It is largely due to that in some counties while in others it had not that effect at all. Some difficulty arose in the way of getting farmers to put in their claims promptly.  We have not succeeded in getting them to do that as quickly as we would like.</P>
      <P>Senator Colonel Moore raised a question as regards the amount of employment given in Connacht and in Munster.  As the Senator is aware, the majority of the farmers in Connacht are small farmers.  They would come under the £20 valuation and would get the primary allowance.  It is only those whose valuations are over £20 who can get the employment grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was another point made about the demand for rates.  That is a matter for the local councils.  In Mayo they did not make any allowance for the relief of the agricultural grant in the first moiety, but gave it all in the second moiety.  That is really a local matter, and I am sure could be easily adjusted.  The Minister, I think, intends to ask the <Col N="959" /> various counties to make the allowances in the two moieties.  Senator Miss Browne and Senator Wilson referred to the question of casual employment.  They seemed to consider that farmers who give employment for six or nine months should get the benefits of this measure.  The intention is to encourage the giving of permanent employment, and not to give any extra allowance for casual labour.  However, that is a matter that can be discussed when the new Bill is introduced, but I think the Minister would be inclined to stick to his idea of getting people kept in permanent employment and of giving relief on that basis.</P>
    <P>So far as this Bill is concerned it would be impossible at this stage to make any radical change in it because, as Senators know, its provisions have already been given effect to.  The only apology that I can offer to Senator Wilson for bringing it forward in this way is that in doing so I am following precedent.  In the years 1925 and 1931, the course that I am following now was pursued by the previous Government which probably found itself in the same difficulty. I admit that it would be desirable, if possible, not to have to delay so long in bringing in the Bill. As Senator Wilson said, what this procedure amounts to is this: doing illegalities and legalising them afterwards by a Bill of this kind.  All that I can say on that is that it is a practice that has grown up, and I agree that we should try and get rid of it as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Counihan raised a matter which I do not think can be considered on a Bill of this kind at all.  This Bill only deals with the relief of rates.  The Senator wants us to consider giving relief to people who are not paying annuities but who may be paying bank interest on money they have raised to buy their farms.  That is a question that could not be considered on this Bill, which is purely and simply a relief of rates Bill.</P>

      <P>I want to raise a point on this section.  I am referring to the paragraph which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... the expression &lsquo;the Shannon fisheries&rsquo; means all fisheries and fishing rights which are for the time being vested in the Board in or over the waters of the River Shannon or any part thereof;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With that definition in mind, it appears to me doubtful, after reading a later section, whether the Bill is giving effect to what the Minister desires.  I am calling attention to the definition for the purpose of asking the Minister to give consideration to it in his own interests, and not in the interests of the plea I intend to make.  If he will refer to Section 8, it will be seen that the duty which is imposed on the Board is that of &ldquo;managing, conducting, and preserving the Shannon fisheries,&rdquo; that is to say, the fisheries which have been vested in the Board. <Col N="964" /> Then in Section 9 the duties in relation to the Shannon Board are referred to as the main function of the Board in this matter, and incidentally and ancillary to these duties are certain other provisions, which include interference with rights of fishing and otherwise, giving power to acquire, and so on.  All these, I take it, are incidental to the performance of the duties in relation to the fisheries which have been vested in the Board, so that unless the Board has already certain fisheries vested in it, it would have no power to act under this Bill, until either Section 5, which empowers the Board to purchase, or Sections 6 and 7 become operative.  It is rather a case of the house that Jack built.  Until the initial transfer of fisheries to the Board is given effect to, the Board has no power whatever, because the Shannon fisheries are defined as fisheries which have been vested in the Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with Section 6 and Section 7 together but the more important point rests on Section 7.  These two sections refer to the transfer by the Minister who has acquired certain fishing rights under the Act of 1925, that is, the Electricity Supply Act, 1925, in the first case and, in the second case, by the Commissioners of Public Works to the Board certain fisheries and fishery rights by order.  What is questioned here is whether these powers which are sought to be given are in conflict with Article 11 of the <Col N="965" /> Constitution.  That Article prohibits the alienation of rights in land and water, etc.  The point arises as to whether the Electricity Supply Board is a department of State or is a corporation, not a department of State. If it is a department of State, no doubt these two sections are in order, but if it is not a department of State, I think the proposals conflict with Article 11.</P>
      <P>While all the purposes of these two sections could be achieved under the provisions which empower the Board to lease for 99 years any rights which they have been possessed of, the sections which transfer State property to a private corporation, and particularly property which was not acquired since 1922, seems to me to run in direct conflict with Article 11 of the Constitution, which, it is pretty well known, is definitely designed to prevent the alienation to a private corporation of State properties. I think that, examining the Act of 1925, it will be agreed that it is not strictly a department of State and if that is so, it is a private corporation and these two sections should not be in the Bill because they would, I think, be in conflict with Article 11.</P>

      <P>The speech made by Senator Johnson shows how closely he has studied this Bill and, at first sight, it would appear that Section 7, subclause (1) is in conflict with the Constitution. In fact, in my copy of the Bill, I have a query to that effect, but when the matter is more closely examined&mdash;I do not know what the Minister thinks of this but I will state what I think about it&mdash;it will be found that the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland hold certain fisheries in the Shannon not as a State property.  That is the thing which, I think, was in the mind of the draftsman and it must have been in his mind for the reason, that if you refer to Clause 9 (1) (d)&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Nothing in this section shall operate to authorise the Board to acquire any property belonging to the State compulsorily or otherwise land in accordance with the law for the time being regulating or restricting <Col N="966" /> the disposition of such property&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>you will realise that the draftsman had fully before his mind Article 11 of the Constitution, so that in relation to State property provision is made that the Electricity Supply Board shall not acquire State property&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Compulsorily, yes&mdash; except in accordance with the law for the time being regulating the disposal of State property.  When we read that and then go back again to Section 7 sub-section (1) and see that the Commissioners of Public Works have the right to transfer by Order all the estate and interest of the Commissioners in any fishery or fishing right, I think we must come to the conclusion that these fisheries or fishing rights which are mentioned in Section 7 are fisheries or fishing rights which the Commissioners of Public Works hold not as State property. There are several such fisheries in the Shannon and elsewhere and the Board of Works has certain property, and a considerable amount of property, throughout Ireland which they hold as Commissioners of Public Works and not as State property coming within the scope of Article 11 of the Constitution.  I happen to know this, because for many days I argued the contrary and was overruled.</P>

The fact is that the properties held by the Commissioners of Public Works in relation to fisheries are State properties and come within the scope of Article 11 of the Constitution, but the point he raises was considered and it was held, not merely on this but on a previous occasion, that the Electricity Supply Board is a State Department for the purposes of Article 11 of the Constitution, and that the transfer of property from the Commissioners of Public Works or the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the Electricity Supply Board does not affect <Col N="967" /> Article 11 of the Constitution, the Electricity Supply Board being held to be a State Department for the purpose.</P>

      <P>Even certain property. Surely they cannot hold private property as they are a Department of State.  On the other hand, I cannot understand the Minister when he states that it has been decided by somebody that the Electricity Supply Board is a State department.  We have been told in this House, and it has been my feeling all the time, that the Electricity Supply Board is an independent Board. They come to us for money at different times; but it has to be paid back.  We have been told by a previous Minister that he had absolutely no control over the Board.  I remember that distinctly. I cannot, therefore, understand the way in which the Electricity Supply Board and the Commissioners of Public Works are getting mixed up between private property and public property.  Anyway, <Col N="968" /> I think, the less we encourage the Electricity Supply Board to go in for trading of any sort, whether we call them a Government body or a municipal body, the better.  That is the reason I should like a little more explanation than has been given by Senator Comyn or the Minister.</P>

      <P>I should make it clear that the fact that the Electricity Supply Board has certain functions conferred upon it by statute which it can exercise independently of the Executive Council or the Minister for Industry and Commerce does not make it cease to be a State department for such purposes as Article 11 of the Constitution. The transfer of property to the Electricity Supply Board as proposed in Sections 6 and 7 here, does not mean that property is transferred from the ownership of the State.  In fact, in the Bill itself the Electricity Supply Board is prevented from disposing of such property otherwise than in accordance with Article 11 of the Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. Bagwell Mr. Bagwell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Section 9, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;Shannon&rdquo; in line 51 to insert the words &ldquo;above the Shannon hydro-electric works constructed under and in pursuance of the Act of 1925 as amended or extended by subsequent legislation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two amendments in my name on the Order Paper and I would ask leave to bring forward my arguments for both amendments when speaking on the first one, otherwise, as the two matters are interrelated to a considerable extent, I should only be repeating myself and taking up the time of the House unnecessarily; so that the arguments which I shall use on the first amendment will to a large extent be concerned with amendment No. 3.  The effect of the first amendment is to confine the powers of the Electricity Supply Board in the matter of fisheries to that part of the Shannon affected by the operation of the electrical works. &ldquo;Fisheries&rdquo; is rather a misleading word in this connection, because it really means fishing and that is what I mean; not special fishing of any particular kind.  &ldquo;Fisheries&rdquo; is a <Col N="971" /> grand-sounding word; but it really affects every kind of fishing.  Those waters are affected by the works.  They have been already affected to a very considerable extent in some cases and I understand are liable to be still more affected if alterations are made in the methods at Ardnacrusha.</P>
    <P>My reasons for the amendment are that it does not appear to me that there is any justification for making such a body as the Electricity Supply Board into a fishery owner and authority any more than is unavoidable; and certainly not in the case of waters which, as far as I can see, are in no way affected by the electrical works.  An Electricity Supply Board is not a very suitable kind of body to be a fishery authority.  So far as I am aware, they have not got any particular technical qualifications in that respect, and, naturally, they would be liable to be an unsympathetic body, because the interests of the two are opposed.  That is not all out of my own head because if you take Section 8 it illustrates what I mean very completely.  Section 8 states:</P>
    <P>In addition, but subject and without prejudice to, the primary function of maintaining, working, and developing the Shannon hydro-electric works under and in pursuance of the Act of 1927 as amended or extended by subsequent legislation, the Board shall have and perform the duty of managing, conducting, and preserving the Shannon fisheries under and in accordance with this Act.</P>
    <P>That is only a secondary consideration &mdash;&ldquo;subject and without prejudice to the primary function.&rdquo;  For that reason, I do not see why it is desirable that the Electricity Supply Board should be made a fishery authority any more than can be helped.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives power to the Board to acquire compulsorily any rights and property in fisheries in the largest catchment basin in Ireland.  While the waters affected by the works may be affected in such a way as to be spoiled or deteriorated in the matter <Col N="972" /> of fishing, they may possibly be made very much better than they were before.  There, naturally, the question of compensation arises, on the one hand, or possibly what is known as unearned increment on the other. There is justification there for the Electricity Supply Board coming into the matter of fisheries.  The Board are given powers to compensate and to acquire compulsorily and in case of such waters that is justifiable, but to what extent I do not know, because I do not know to what extent all this vast quantity of water is going to be affected.  I do not know whether anybody does.  Even the Minister himself cannot say what is going to be done in the future.  I do not like the idea of the Electricity Supply Board being made into a fishing authority and owner.  It seems to be wrong in principle.  I could not draft the amendment in any other way, because I did not know where to stop, than to make it above the works.  I do not know what is or what is not the principle affected, so I shall confine my amendment to the waters below.</P>
    <P>With the possible exception of some parts of the river below the works where the course of the river has been actually altered as a result of the works, I do not really see what the Electricity Supply Board has got to do with the matter.  It does not seem to me to be the suitable authority. The less the Electricity Supply Board has to do with the fisheries affected by these works the better.  This Bill may well be used as an instrument of tyranny.  Fishing is a form of occupation and a matter of great amenity to some people.  It is a very sentimental amenity.  An enormous number of owners of the water frontage are affected in this matter, some large, some small.  Under this Bill very large powers are given to dispossess those people of their right of fishing.  The Minister may say that they are to be compensated.  They will, I expect, but no compensation would make up for the loss of these fishing rights to the owners.  More than that, men's privacy is affected. It would be easy for anyone to understand <Col N="973" /> that there are innumerable cases in which a man lives really on the bank of the River Shannon or some tributary of the Shannon.  His house is just right on the river.  Under this Bill the right to fish there can be taken from him and given to somebody else.  Other people, strangers, will have the right, not only to fish there, but to come up right to his house and garden.  It seems to me to be a very tyrannical gift to give to this body. It may be unavoidable above the City of Limerick, but surely, it is not below the City of Limerick.  Very wide powers are given in this Bill. I think that it would be much better if the Minister confined himself to the river above the works.  For that reason, I hope the Minister will accept the amendment put down by me; if not in the form in which I put it down, perhaps he would be able, on Report Stage, to bring in a form of words which would cover the points I am raising.  In this way, he would not interfere with the fisheries except to such an extent as might be made unavoidable by the construction of the works.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I do not gather what, precisely, Senator Bagwell hopes to achieve by this amendment, nor do I understand the relationship to which he referred between this amendment and the second amendment down in his name on the Order Paper.  His purpose, according to the amendment, is to confine the Electricity Supply Board to acquiring fisheries above the Shannon works. But the Shannon works, when the particular scheme now about to start will be completed, will spread from Lough Allen to the City of Limerick.  Any fishing above the Shannon works can only be for pinkeens or things of that kind.  If the Senator means the works at Parteen Villa, I might mention that a large part of the fisheries above that have been acquired.  Those above that are not important fisheries.  In the fisheries below the Shannon works, damage has been done by the construction of these works.  It is to the owners of those fisheries that most damage has been done.  It is to effect those, so as to preserve the value of <Col N="974" /> the river as a fishing river, that the Bill is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite follow that, but what I am concerned with is that the word &ldquo;fisheries&rdquo; covers fisheries above to an extent of thousands of miles.  If it is necessary for the Electricity Supply Board to deal with fisheries such as the Minister is dealing with, then the scope of the Bill is very much greater because it affects fisheries throughout a large part of Ireland.  I raised this question on the Second Reading and the Minister replied that he did give this power in the Shannon basin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, to any fishery in the Shannon and its tributaries affected by this Bill.  The purport of the Bill is to enable the Electricity Supply Board to acquire such of these fisheries as they are advised are necessary to enable the reorganisation of the fisheries to be effected, and to enable certain essential works to be constructed so that the fisheries may be preserved and developed.  The fisheries which it is essential that it must acquire before any works can be constructed or reorganised are those below the Shannon works&mdash;the fisheries particularly in the fresh waters and also those in the tidal waters.  They may or may not acquire fisheries above the Shannon works, but I imagine that it would be much less important to acquire fisheries above than below. The fisheries above, in as far as they have not been completely destroyed, have not been damaged.  The fisheries between Parteen Villa and Killaloe have been acquired.  They will be transferred to the E.S.B. when this Bill will have been enacted.  But the whole purpose is to enable the Board to acquire those fisheries below the works so that the necessary measures for the preservation and development of the fisheries can be undertaken.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that the Shannon works extend below the Lax weir?  If the owners of the Lax weir have a right to fish there and five miles down the river, then do not the <Col N="975" /> Shannon works extend into that fishery?  For that reason I think that this amendment as it stands is quite unreasonable.</P>

      <P>I should like if the Minister would take this opportunity to give us more information about the general intentions and the things that are sought to be promoted by this Bill; if he would tell us what these works are and where they are to take place. Perhaps he would tell us what fishery it is intended to interfere with or take over.  If we knew what was in the mind of the Ministry, the Electricity Supply Board, the Conservators or the Lax Weir Company or whoever else is concerned, it would enable us to understand the relations of the whole to these intentions, as we could if we knew what was contemplated in regard to these matters.  As the Bill stands, the powers that have to be handed over are so wide, according to one interpretation and so narrow with regard to another interpretation, that it is difficult to reconcile the whole with the intention of the Minister.  If the Minister would tell us the class of works to be undertaken, where these works are, and if he would tell us what are the fisheries that are likely to be acquired, I think, perhaps, it would ease the discussion and enlighten Senators, so that the Bill would be made understandable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Shannon fisheries had a very different value&mdash;I am not saying anything as to the manner in which they were worked&mdash;before the Shannon scheme was started.  There is a belief on the part of those who are competent to express an opinion in this matter that, with uniform ownership and control, the value of the Shannon fisheries can be considerably increased. Apart from that, there is the fact that at the present time the fisheries are being destroyed by reason of the works that are being constructed.  The flow of the water below the weir has been considerably diminished and the river from there to the sea has been over-fished. It is necessary to introduce a Bill of this kind which gives to the Electricity Supply Board power to acquire <Col N="976" /> ownership of all the fisheries for certain purposes.  One is to reduce the number of engines in the estuary, to reduce the number of stake weirs that are there, following their acquisition, and by constructing certain works&mdash;I cannot describe these works in any detail&mdash;in the river to secure that injury to the fisheries, resulting from the decreased flow of water, will be removed, and to mitigate the other conditions which have reacted against the success of the fisheries up to the present, knowing the tendency of the fish to go into the tail race.  It is not possible to say precisely what the nature of the work will be. That will be largely determined by experts who will have to consider the matter in considerable detail, bearing in mind that, I think, the sum total of human knowledge about the habits and characteristics of the salmon is itself limited, and that to some extent the works undertaken must be experimental. There are a number of ground sills to be constructed; a fish pass is to be put up at Ardnacrusha and screens are to be put into the head race.  There are other works of that kind which are designed to facilitate the passage of the fish up the river to spawn, and to ensure that the whole conduct of the industry will be undertaken scientifically and with the intention of producing the best results.</P>

      <P>What the Minister has said considerably modifies my views. I understand his attitude better now but we never had the information which he has given us before.  We now have it that the Board are only going to deal with fisheries with which they really must deal to correct the situation.  I still think that the powers given in the Bill for that purpose are quite unnecessarily large and touch upon a number of fishery interests which I do not think are affected by the works.  I do not think that the Electricity Supply Board is a suitable authority to deal with these fisheries.  I would ask leave to withdraw my amendment because it does not fit the case in any event.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="977" /> Section 9, sub-section (1).  To delete in line 7 the words &ldquo;fishing right, or other right&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;private fishing right or other private right.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with sub-section (1), Section 9, paragraph (d).  The paragraph gives powers to the Board to &ldquo;terminate, restrict, or otherwise interfere with, either permanently or temporarily, and either compulsorily or by agreement, any easement, way leave, water right, fishing right or other right over or in respect of any land or water.&rdquo;  Those are pretty extensive powers as I have read them. I again put this point to the Minister and the House, that that paragraph and the other paragraphs in the section from (a) to (f), have to be read as subordinate to the performance of the duties in relation to the Shannon fisheries imposed on the Board and until the Board has acquired the fisheries and can prove that those works or interferences with rights are necessary to the due performance of these duties, I question whether, in the form in which this section stands, the Board can operate the powers which the Minister desires to give to them.  I suggest to the Minister that as the section stands it may be competent for any person to challenge the Board in the courts as to whether these interferences are necessary to the due performance of the duties of the Board in respect to the fisheries which they have acquired. It may entail on the Board the necessity of proving before the Law Courts whether these are incidental or ancillary to the larger purposes which are provided for in the first part of the sub-section.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of that, there comes the question of whether the rights which may be terminated, restricted or interfered with by the Board, include any public rights.  Probably the lawyers will say that inasmuch as they are ancillary to the performance of the duties of the Board in respect of their private rights, any fisheries with these rights referred to in the paragraph are only private rights.  But there are certain public rights of fishery which are only capable of being interfered with by Parliament <Col N="978" /> and I think we should be very careful to make it impossible for this Board, under the authority given by this Bill, to take upon itself powers which are otherwise reserved to Parliament in respect of interference with public rights of fishery.  If the Minister is satisfied, on competent legal advice, that this paragraph only deals with private rights I cannot conflict with him but it seems to me that there would be no harm, even as a precautionary measure, in inserting the word &ldquo;private&rdquo; before &ldquo;rights&rdquo; so that we shall be quite sure that no public rights are being interfered with or can be interfered with by the Board and that that is something which can only be interfered with specifically by the Oireachtas.  It is for that reason that I ask that the amendment should be carried, to ensure, as I say, that public rights shall not be interfered with under the authority of this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies to Senator Johnson I should like to ask him a question with regard to the section.  I am not quite clear whether Senator Johnson wishes to deal only with fishing rights, because it would seem to me that the section would apply to other rights referred to in paragraph (d), if his case is a good one.  I should like to ask the Minister whether the section would give the Board power to remove bridges upon, say, the Grand Canal altogether. Under the definitions I think I am right in saying that the Board have control of all waters flowing into the Shannon. Their jurisdiction, therefore, would extend even to Portobello on the Grand Canal, as it does not seem to be specifically exempted, because it does not belong to a railway company.  It would seem to me that that is going further than anybody would consider necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Johnson's amendment is not necessary, because the Bill does not confer upon the Board, in any part, any power to interfere with a public right.  Section 9 defines the power that is to be conferred on the Electricity Supply Board. The section confers no power whatever on it to interfere with any public right. <Col N="979" /> The Bill does interfere with certain public rights, but that is precisely what Senator Johnson defended.  It is proposed to ask the Oireachtas to interfere with certain public rights, such as the extension of the close season, the prohibition of a certain kind of net fishing at certain times and in certain parts of the river, and so forth.  These sections will represent, when passed, the decision of the Oireachtas to interfere with certain public rights, but neither Section 9 nor any other part of the Bill confers upon the Board the power to interfere with a public right. The only rights the Board can interfere with are those which are not public&mdash; rights which they may acquire either compulsorily or by agreement.  Senator Douglas will note that sub-section (1) of Section 9 confers powers on the Board for the purpose of enabling it to &ldquo;fulfil all such functions as shall be necessary or proper for or incidental or ancillary to the due performance of the duties in relation to the Shannon fisheries.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 9, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;proper&rdquo; in line 20 to add the words &ldquo;Provided always that in exercising such power of demise or letting the Board shall give to the owner or owners from whom the Board has acquired any fishery or fisheries the option of accepting a demise or letting thereof on such terms and conditions as the Board shall, subject (where applicable) to such approval as aforesaid, think proper.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment has to do with the renting of fisheries which have been acquired compulsorily or otherwise by the Electricity Board.  The idea is to temper the wind to the shorn lamb in so far as the former owner is concerned and to enable him&mdash;particularly in cases where the fishing rights were compulsorily acquired&mdash;to resume the enjoyment of an amenity which, perhaps, he and his forebears have enjoyed for generations.  My suggestion is that the former owner should be given the first option to take the fishing rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The former owner of the fishery or fishing rights gets his compensation in the form of a cheque.  His rights are acquired either compulsorily or by agreement, and he gets their value.  It is not proposed to give him any rights in respect of the fishery in addition to the compensation paid. Once the Board has purchased for full value the fishing rights, they must, if they desire to lease or let them, be at liberty to get the best rent possible in respect of such letting.  If the former owner makes the best offer, doubtless the Board will prefer his offer to others. If, however, he were put in a position in which he would have to get the <Col N="981" /> letting in any event, then, obviously, the powers of the Board to do its business properly would be restricted. I appreciate that the Senator's amendment&mdash;though he may not realise it&mdash; would, in fact, leave the position unchanged, because the approval which is referred to in the section is the approval of the Minister for Finance.  I can assure the Senator that the Electricity Supply Board would not get the approval of the Minister for Finance to any letting unless the rent was the best obtainable.  In fact, there would be no change made by the enactment of the amendment, but the principle is wrong.  The former owner of the fishery or fishing rights is entitled to fair compensation.  If he cannot get that by agreement, he goes before the arbitrator, and the arbitrator gives him what he deems to be fair compensation.  After that the fishery or fishing right is the property of the Electricity Supply Board and, if it is to be let, the Board must be at liberty to get the best rent possible.</P>

      <P>I think that the point raised by Senator Bagwell is one which the Minister does not appreciate, though his criticism of the exact terms of the amendment may be right.  I think that nobody would maintain for a moment that a man who has been compensated at a proper rate is entitled to some specific monetary privilege in addition.  But if a private fishery is acquired, if afterwards the Electricity Supply Board find they can let that right and they fix a rent which they deem to be adequate, would it not be reasonable to offer the letting, in the first place, to the former owner?  If it happens to be adjoining his property and if it was compulsorily taken from him.  he should have the preference if he is willing to pay the rent which is determined by the Electricity Supply Board.  Beyond that, I should not be inclined to go but I think that that is what Senator Bagwell is seeking to effect by this amendment.</P>

      <P>It would be very unusual if the Electricity Supply Board were to make a letting of a fishery in that way.  I take it that the ordinary practice would be resorted to and that <Col N="982" /> the letting would be advertised.  If the former owner chose to make an offer for the letting, he would be quite at liberty to do so.  If the fishery would be of more value to him than to anybody else, his offer would probably be higher than any other offer received.</P>

      <P>I think that there is an important precedent in support of this amendment.  If I remember rightly, there is a precedent in connection with the fishing rights on rivers running through lands purchased under some of the Land Acts.  In one particular instance, the tenants got the option of renting these rights after the purchase, although the rights had been originally acquired under the Land Purchase Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that he is raising a bogey for the purpose of knocking it down.  I have not suggested that any former owner should get special treatment.  I have not suggested that he should get any monetary or other advantage.  My suggestion is that he should get the opportunity of taking over these rights but not at less money than the Board can get for them.  He should be given the option of renting the rights.  Suppose the Board had been made an offer, I think it would not be unreasonable that they should say to the former owner &ldquo;Will you improve on this offer&rdquo;? This is not a case of a man's rights being bought out with his consent. They may be acquired against his will. He might rather that he was not compensated. He may think that nothing would compensate him for the loss of an amenity which may be right in front of his house.  His house may be on the bank of the river.  It would be hard lines if he were not in these circumstances to get the opportunity of acquiring the fishery as against a stranger.  This amendment does not give the former owner a double advantage at all.  It merely provides that the fishery will not be let under his nose without his having an opportunity of his taking it himself.</P>

He <Col N="983" /> says that such an owner would make an offer for it if he got the opportunity. There is the converse case where the owner of the land and house was not the former owner of the fishery&mdash; where the former owner was an absentee, a person resident outside the country, and where the owner of the house and land might be very glad to get the opportunity of renting the fishery for the first time if the Electricity Supply Board desired to let it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 9, sub-section (2).  To insert before the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Nothing in this section shall operate to authorise the Board to acquire compulsorily until after the 1st day of January, 1938, any fishery or fishing right from any person or the successors in title of any person who during the period of twelve months immediately preceding the passing of this Act has lawfully exercised a right of fishing with nets or a net in the fresh waters of the River Shannon within the meaning of the Fisheries Acts, 1842 to 1925.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, after the 1st day of January, 1938, the Board proposes to acquire compulsorily any fishing right or rights from any person referred to in the preceding paragraph of this sub-section, the Board shall submit its proposals to the Minister for his approval and the power to acquire such fishing right or rights compulsorily <Col N="984" /> shall not operate without the sanction of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Before giving his sanction to the compulsory acquisition of any fishing right referred to in this sub-section the Minister shall be satisfied, after considering any objection made by or on behalf of the persons whose rights it is proposed to acquire, that such acquisition by the Board is necessary for the preservation or improvement of the salmon fisheries of the River Shannon or for the maintenance, working or development of the Shannon hydro-electric works.</P>
    <P>This proposed new section raises again the question of the Abbey fishermen. I thought I might have drawn from the Minister some information as to whether the works that are proposed to be set going by the Electricity Supply Board, under this Bill, will necessarily interfere with the fishing practices&mdash;I leave out the word &ldquo;rights&rdquo; for the moment&mdash;of the Abbey fishermen.  But I got nothing to enlighten me on that point, so whether they would have anything to do with the Lax weir or not I do not know.  I do not know whether the new works will interfere with the Lax weir.</P>
    <P>What I am seeking to do in the new section is to allow time to pass long enough to enable us to decide whether there has been any destruction because of the practice of the calling of the Abbey fishermen that cannot be altered otherwise than by the acquisition of their property.  The Minister said we do not know much about the habits of salmon and it is still less clear as to what are the causes of the variations or the seasonal successes or failures of the Shannon fisheries at times.  Up to date it is not clear at all to what extent the destruction of the salmon season, through the Electricity Supply Board works, has interfered with the fishery.  The reports that have been published show that the year 1927 was a very good salmon year.  The captures of the snap nets in that year were 6.5 per cent. of the whole of the fishing on the Shannon and the number of fish was 4.8 per cent.  The year 1929 was not a good year.  Again, <Col N="985" /> the fish captured by snap nets mainly used by the Abbey fishermen was only 3.5 per cent of the total fish caught in the Shannon.  In 1931 only 4.7 of the total of the fish taken in the Shannon fishery was caught in snap nets; so that the proportion of the fish caught by this form of fishing is very small as compared with the total catch every year.  It has to be proved, but it has not yet been shown to the House&mdash;whatever private Committees may have at their disposal, certainly neither the Dáil nor the Seanad has information which would prove that the Abbey fishing above the Lax Weir has had any permanent detrimental effect upon the Shannon fisheries.  The latest evidence comes from the reports of the inspectors.  I have two such reports here, one for the 14th December and one for a later date, the 11th January.  I will read those in regard to the rivers above the Abbey fishermen fisheries, and will give case after case showing where the fish are plentiful.  &ldquo;The River Mulkear and all its tributaries are heavily stocked, and in my opinion considerably exceed last year's stock.&rdquo; That is miles above the Abbey fishermen fisheries.</P>
    <P>Another report says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The general spawning season is practically at an end and has been a very successful one in many ways....</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The following are the principal districts and rivers in which the bulk of the spawning took place: The River Mulkear, from the new Bridge, Pallas, to Cappamore, fairly heavily stocked; from Cappamore to Bilboa Bridge, heavily stocked; from Bilboa Bridge to Kilcommon, heavily stocked.  The Ballyvoreen tributary to the River Mulkear fairly well stocked; the River Kilmastulla, fairly heavy stock between Killaloe road-bridge and Shalee Railway Station; the River Newport from its junction with Mulkear to the upper reaches of Killoscully is fairly heavily stocked,&rdquo; and so on.</P>
    <P>Some of the tributaries below the Abbey fishermen's fisheries are not so heavily stocked.  The facts show that the fisheries above the Abbey fishermen's <Col N="986" /> fisheries show signs of being revived considerably this year and prove that the Abbey fishermen's fishing has not impeded the course of the salmon up the river in a year which has been exceptionally dry.</P>
    <P>I am not an expert on the habits of salmon any more than the Minister, but I know enough to say that it is not possible to arrive at a conclusion regarding fisheries and the prospect of the fisheries by an experience of one, two or three years.  I am suggesting in this amendment that at least there should be time granted to enable tests to be made over a reasonable period after the Shannon works come into operation.  I am suggesting three years from now, which would be from 1927 to 1938 and would leave a space of 11 years which would enable some judgment upon competent evidence to be given as to whether the Shannon fisheries have been damaged to such an extent by these particular works or not and whether other action that would be taken by a board such as is outlined would not be sufficient to save the fisheries without interference with others or with old established rights and practices of the fishermen. Then I want to leave the judgment of that matter to the Minister or authority set up by him as to whether they are satisfied that the case for the acquisition of these fisheries has been made.  If, in that case, having sufficient evidence and having allowed a sufficient time to elapse for a proper judgment to be arrived at, the Minister is satisfied that these fisheries have to be acquired and killed, then I suppose there is nothing to be said. I do make the plea again, however, that until it is definitely proved that there is no other way to save the fisheries than destroying this very old-established right of working fishermen, the acquisition should not take place.</P>
    <P>I think that is, in outline, the whole of the case I have to make.  The drafting of this section may not be competently done but in the main it is following the drafting of the Bill in other parts.  The intention, however, is that there should be a postponement of any action regarding the <Col N="987" /> acquisition of such rights for three years, and that then evidence ought to be presented to the Minister, and an opportunity given for examination of that evidence by the persons whose rights are to be acquired, before a decision, confirming the intentions of the Board to acquire, shall be given by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of the section as drafted, because it covers much more than the operations of the Abbey fishermen.  I would not like to see postponed until 1938 measures which are necessary for the preservation of the fisheries of the Shannon, which fisheries are worth, at a low calculation, £5,000,000.  If this proposed section, as drafted, were passed, it would prevent the Board from putting some contrivance at the outfall of the Shannon Works, such as a contrivance that would lead the salmon up past the tail-race.  The reason why I say that is this: where the tail-race joins the Shannon there is a separate fishery belonging to the owners of the Lax Weir.  They have a separate fishery both at the weir itself and five miles down the river. As I understand the geography of it, the outfall of the Shannon works is below the Lax Weir and, therefore, nothing could be done to prevent the salmon from going up the tail-race, as they do now, and dropping their eggs to rot in the tail-race.  Accordingly, I think that this amendment would be very destructive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Johnson used the argument that the Mulkear river is heavily stocked and that the Newport river also is heavily stocked.  That shows me that the fisheries are interfered with, because the fish which escape the Lax Weir&mdash;a permanent structure more than half way across the river&mdash; have not enough water and run into the Mulkear and Newport rivers.  I know that there are good spawning grounds in the Mulkear river but I should like to know what are the conditions in the spawning grounds in the tributaries higher up the Shannon.  The fact that the Mulkear river and the Newport river are heavily stocked shows that the <Col N="988" /> Shannon fisheries, so far as salmon are concerned, are very much interfered with.  I do not like to say one word against the Abbey fishermen, but certainly as regards the Lax Weir, which is infinitely bigger and which is a permanent structure half way across the river and more, and other fisheries which I will not particularise, I think it would be very wrong to postpone the operation of this Act for three years more.  By that time, I think that the Shannon fisheries would be effectually destroyed, and when that is done it might be hard to re-stock the river again.  Moreover, this Bill provides for a number of things.  I should say that what the Minister has said is perfectly right &mdash;that too many fish are killed, especially in the lower reaches.  I do hope that what the Minister said will be carried out and carried out soon, namely, that a good many of the stake nets will be removed so as to give the fish a chance of coming up, and that that great barrier across the river of the Lax Weir&mdash;a permanent structure &mdash;will be curtailed to a considerable extent also.  The Abbey fishermen&mdash; 40 or 50 of them&mdash;have had a fishery there for a long time, and they are fishing very well in the three or four miles of the river that they have above the Lax Weir.  I hope that if any new leases of the fishing in that river are made they will be considered, but at the same time I think that in dealing with the fisheries of the Shannon, a very valuable national asset which, I say without hesitation, is worth more than £5,000,000 at the present time, the Board or some central authority should be given power to deal with the whole thing in the interests of the fishing of the Shannon itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that Senator Johnson's amendment could not be accepted, because it would defeat the whole purpose of the Bill, which is to permit of the immediate acquisition of the fisheries of the Shannon and the immediate construction of the works necessary for the preservation of these fisheries.  Neither do I think that the Senator would be able to sustain his argument that the construction and <Col N="989" /> operation of the Shannon works have, in fact, done little or no damage to the fisheries.  The fact that we are being pressed by a large number of complainants for compensation and that a number of them have already forced us to arbitration is proof to the contrary. The claim of the Lax Weir, to which the Senator has referred, was a huge one and, unfortunately, has been substantiated already before the arbitrator. That is, therefore, conclusive proof that very serious damage was done to the fisheries in that portion of the river.  In fact, the Lax Weir has been virtually abandoned in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator stated that we do not know a very great deal about the habits of the salmon.  There is enough known about them, however, to enable certain conclusions to be drawn. Salmon are attracted by rapidly flowing water and, where a choice is offered them, they will prefer, as a general rule, to follow the strongest part of the stream.  The tail-race in the Shannon meets it at a point below the Lax Weir, and the salmon meeting the strong current out of the tail-race almost invariably turn into the tail-race and make their way up towards the power house.  They are unable to get beyond the power house and they lie in the tail-race for an indefinite time.  In fact, it is claimed by some that they remain for the entire fishing season.  In any event, the number of salmon passing up the river during the fishing season has decreased considerably and the fisheries above the tail-race have been injuriously affected. Various suggestions have been made from time to time for dealing with the situation, including the suggestion that a grating be put across the entrance to the tail-race, the carrying out of which would present considerable engineering difficulties.  Apart from that, if there were a grating there it is doubtful whether a flow of ten cubic metres of water per second down to the old river would be sufficient to attract the salmon, and it is much more probable that they would lie in the river below the Lax Weir and in the deep pools in the Abbey fisheries.  The nets operating there would capture a very large proportion of the salmon <Col N="990" /> entering the river and very few of them would reach the spawning beds, with the result that in a few years the stock of salmon would become extinct.  The tail-race has for the time being acted as a sanctuary for the salmon.  It is problematical whether the fish will lie in the tail-race until the autumn no matter what steps are taken to improve the position there for them.</P>
    <P>The choice appears to be either to destroy these fisheries, including the Abbey fishery, immediately, or destroy all the fisheries on the river ultimately. The position appears to be that there is no choice so far as the Abbey fishery and the Lax Weir fishery are concerned, but to acquire them.  The proposal in the Bill is to acquire them and to enable those various measures to be taken which will permit the whole of the fisheries to be properly developed.  We could not afford to wait for three years to do that, because damage is being done now.  The measure of the damage is to be found in the claims for compensation already received and in the fact, about which there can be no dispute, that the spawning beds were during the periods of dry weather exposed, left high and dry, and the spawn was destroyed by birds.  The effect of that very considerable destruction of the spawn will be noticeable on the fisheries in any event during the next two or three years.  The damage is proceeding progressively, and it is necessary to take steps at once in order to prevent it recurring.  That is why the Bill is necessary, so that the works can be begun in the earlier portion of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is very little use trying to press upon the Minister the desirability of reconsidering this point.  Apparently his mind is very definitely made up, but he has enlightened us on one point, and I have been waiting for that enlightenment, and that is that it is intended also to acquire the Lax Weir.  Whether it is intended that the Lax Weir fishing shall be destroyed also, or whether that will go on as part of the work under the auspices of the Board, and that only the Abbey fishermen shall be deprived <Col N="991" /> of their fishery, remains to be seen.  I take it from what has been said that really the plan of the scheme is that the Abbey fishermen shall be deprived of their rights, and that the fisheries of the Lax Weir will thereby be benefited and that that fishery will become the property of the Board.  I take it that is roughly the intention?</P>

      <P>Section 14, sub-section (4).  To insert before the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4)  In any case where a fishery or fishing right is being acquired by the Board, either by agreement or compulsorily, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say: compensation shall be payable by the Board to every person who, for a period of not less than three months during the twelve months immediately preceding the date of acquisition, was employed by the owner of the property which is being acquired and whose earnings from such employment during that period formed the whole or a substantial part of the livelihood of such person.  The amount of the compensation to be paid under this sub-section shall be such sum as, in the case of a property which is being acquired compulsorily, the arbitrator, or, in the case of a property which is being acquired by agreement, the Minister (or a person nominated by him), shall consider reasonable having regard to the loss of livelihood suffered by the aforesaid employed person in consequence of the acquisition of such fishery or fishery right by the Board, regard being had also to the likelihood of such person being continued in the employment of the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This deals with another body of men who are interested, not the Abbey fishermen.  It is competent for the Board under the Bill to acquire fisheries which are owned, let us say, by absentee landlords or owned by persons who have merely a proprietary right, and who employ other persons to do the work.  Now it is proposed in the Bill to compensate the persons whose property is being acquired, but there is no assurance that the men who are to be disemployed as a consequence <Col N="993" /> will be compensated, will be recompensed, out of the compensation money.  This is a proposal to ensure that the persons who have been fairly regularly employed on these fishings will be compensated for the loss of their employment just as well as the owner of the property who has a profit interest in the fishery.  It also provides that where the Board is proposing to take over the work and to continue the employment of those men&mdash;well, compensation does not follow.  The general intention is that where men lose their employment as a consequence of the acquisition that the compensation will go to them as well as to the owners of the property.  This is a case that has been argued many times in other circumstances, but I put it forward again very seriously in the hope that the Minister will agree to this amendment, or some other form embodying the same intention.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The adoption of Senator Johnson's amendment would involve the acceptance of a new principle in these matters which might have very considerable reactions, namely, the principle of compensátion for consequential loss.  The Government, in cases of this kind, accepts the principle that the acquiring party should pay compensation for the loss of rights.  The Bill provides for the payment of compensation to any person who has a private right to fish in the Shannon and who is deprived of that right or may be prevented from exercising it. The right then passes to the Electricity Supply Board and will be exercised by the Electricity Supply Board. In so far as employment was given through the exercise of that right by <Col N="994" /> the previous owners to persons, there is no reason to anticipate that substantially less employment, on the whole, will be given by the Electricity Supply Board in the exercise of that and other rights although no undertaking in that respect can be given, because, obviously, the plan of operations has not yet been determined and is not embodied in the Bill.  The acceptance, however, in this Bill of that principle of compensation for consequential damage would have possible reactions upon the whole of the Government's programme and might produce an embarrassing situation in the future which would prevent useful public works being undertaken because of the necessity of acting in a similar manner in those cases as is proposed here.  Therefore, I think the amendment must be resisted.</P>

      <P>The Minister is not correct surely when he says that the acceptance of this amendment would involve the adoption of a new principle in Bills of this kind.  It would merely mean the acceptance of what is a well understood and quite ancient principle &mdash;compensation for loss of employment as a result of the acquisition of services in the public interest.  This principle has been adopted without any opposition whatever in the case of the Railways Acts of 1923 and 1924, of the Road Transport Act of 1933 and of numerous other measures.  Indeed, in the Act establishing the Electricity Supply Board itself, the principle of the payment of compensation for loss of employment was accepted.  It is a very serious consideration to acquire compulsorily certain rights or services and to accept the principle of compensation for the owners of those rights or services and throw to the winds the rights of those who earned a livelihood from the previous employers. I see no argument that could be advanced against that that could not, with equal force and with equal justice, be advanced against the payment of compensation to owners.  In the Road Transport Act compulsory powers of acquisition were given as regards certain road transport services. The Act provided for compensation to the owners of those services <Col N="995" /> by the acquiring authority, but at the same time it provided for compensation for any of the employees who were not absorbed in the new employment.</P>
      <P>I agree that, as far as the road transport services were concerned, the compensation was entirely inadequate, largely due to the fact that they were new services and that none of the employees had long continuous service with any of the employers.  But, in the case of the Railways Acts which were of a more important character, particularly the Act of 1924, we did certainly lay down definite terms of compensation and of absolute protection in all respects in regard to the future employment, prospects and rights of those employed.  The people concerned in this amendment may not represent a very influential body.  They may have no great power or influence, but these or any other fishermen who are likely to be affected in their employment as a result of the operations of this measure have the same rights as the railway men and the road transport workers had.  I do not know exactly how many are likely to be affected, but it is quite likely, in view of the suggestion that there should be less fish caught and on certain reaches of the river a curtailment of operations, that a number of men will lose their employment.  Therefore, I think that we would be doing a grave injustice if we did not make some provision for compensation to these men for the loss of their means of livelihood.</P>

      <P>Like Senator O'Farrell, I am astonished at the Minister objecting to this on principle.  The <Col N="996" /> principle has been accepted and embodied in legislation even on his own initiative and under his authority.  In fact, this Bill itself embodies the principle of compensation for loss of employment in the case of the Abbey fishermen in addition to compensation for loss of their ownership rights.  But there may be other men who are going to be disemployed as a consequence of the acquisition and probable closing down of the fishery by the Electricity Supply Board.  I cannot say where they are, but this Bill gives such wide powers that one has to take time by the forelock.  I do not know what is the position, for instance, with regard to the Lax Weir.  The Minister informed us this evening that it is practically closed down.  Supposing that it is wholly closed down, that there are some men employed by it who will not be employed henceforth, surely they have some right to consideration.  If there is going to be given to the Lax Weir owners the amount of compensation they have put in a claim for, or supposing that the property is bought by the Electricity Supply Board, surely there is some claim in respect of the men who were employed by the Lax Weir Company and who did the work, such as it was, of running the fisheries. I do not know what the position of the Lax Weir is in regard to the men who were employed there, but I can see right through this Bill very wide powers being given to the Electricity Supply Board to acquire fisheries which they may or may not use.  The exercise of such power may mean the stopping of the fisheries and the disemployment of certain men who are employed as wage earners.  I think it is only reasonable to ask that when compensation is to be given to the owners that the workmen who lose their means of livelihood should also be compensated.  I am astonished that this should be opposed as a matter of principle.</P>

      <Col N="997" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 14 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to this section, the Minister has informed us that the Electricity Supply Board is a public authority, a Government Department. If he is quite satisfied on that point the section as it stands is all right, and can be worked but, if it is not a public authority, the provisions of the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, cannot be applied because that Act can be applied only in the case of compensation payable by a Government Department or any local or public authority.  I understand there is no judicial decision that the Electricity Supply Board is a Government Department or a local or public authority.  On the other hand, I see by looking at the Shannon Electricity Acts of 1925 and 1927, that there is a special proviso that the Electricity Supply Board shall be regarded as a local authority for the purpose of ascertaining compensation under the Act of 1919.  Since that Act was passed, I presume the Minister has got advice, on which he is prepared to act, that the Electricity Supply Board comes within that definition of a Government Department or a public or local authority.  If he is satisfied on that I have nothing to say.  But I would like to call his attention to it, particularly at the present time, so that there may be no catastrophe, such as would happen if in any case it was found that compensation could not be assessed at all.  Reverting to Section 7, to which Senator Johnson called attention, the power of the Commissioners of Public Works to transfer to the Electricity Supply Board arises from the fact which I stated originally, rather than from the consideration that the Electricity Supply Board is a public authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would give some explanation of this section.  As he may have done so elsewhere, perhaps he would repeat it, dealing with the necessity for lengthening the weekly close season, or the possibility of lengthening it.  There are apprehensions on the part of drift net fishermen from some parts of the river with regard to that question.  Formerly the season was simply from Saturday morning until Monday norning.  Now it may be from Saturday morning until Tuesday morning which would be much more serious.  That is the representation, from the point of view of the fishermen, and I should like if the Minister would give some explanation as to the necessity for taking this power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The case is that those who are the expert advisers of the Government in these matters have come to the conclusion that, under present circumstances, in a long estuary like the Shannon, there is reason to believe that the existing close season is not long enough to allow a fair proportion of the fish to escape the estuary nets.  They propose, therefore, that the time be increased by 24 hours.  It is recognised at once that it may be possible to reduce again the weekly close season to the present 48 hours, when the Shannon fisheries have been acquired by the Electricity Supply Board, and the stake weirs in the estuary have been reduced.  Having regard to the run of fish at present, the general conclusion concerning the salmon fisheries has been formed that the existing close season is too short to permit a fair number of fish to get up the river. Power is taken in the section to permit a reduction of the close season again to the existing 48 hours, as soon as the Minister for Agriculture is satisfied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to give a little more explanation of this section.  It is understood that the intention for the first year is that the number of drift nets licensed to fish shall not exceed 70, and in the case of draft nets shall not exceed 25.  The explanation has been given that these are the numbers that have been fishing in the last year, and the number of licences issued.  The Minister stated that it is because the estuary of the river is over-fished that this Bill is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>That it is over-fished. I have the notion that the operation of this section, coupled with the next section, is to make quite sure that by Parliamentary action the public right of fishing will be interfered with. Hitherto licences have been issued on application and definite limitation has not been possible.  Now, limitation is specifically put forward in the Bill. In Section 22 there is reference to snap nets.  We have not merely a limitation of numbers but an actual prohibition of snap nets in the tidal waters, so that all types of fishing are intended to be maintained except snap nets.  I should like if the Minister could give some more light on the general policy involved in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole purpose of these two sections is to prevent any increase in net fishing in the estuary. The numbers set out there for drift and draft nets permit of the issuing of licences in the future to the same extent as in the past.  The number of drift net licences issued last year was, I think, 64 or 68 and the number in the previous year was the same, and there is even a slight margin there which permits of an increase in the number.  The number of draft net licences was about the same, 25 <Col N="1000" /> or under.  There have been no snap net licences issued for fishing in the estuary in recent years at all.  The most recent of such licences issued were in 1927, in which year two such licences were issued, but, since, there have been none issued, so that, in fact, nobody is being injured by the restrictions which are being imposed by these two sections.  They will permit of the issuing of licences to everybody who has been engaged in one or other of these kinds of fishing in the estuary of the Shannon in recent years but will not permit of any increase in their number&mdash;an increase which might otherwise occur in consequence of the restriction on the private right of fishing in fresh waters which the Bill imposes.</P>
      <P>Section 21 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 22.</P>
      <P>After the passing of this Act no licence shall be issued under the Fisheries Acts, 1842 to 1925, for fishing with a snap net in the tidal waters of the River Shannon within the meaning of those Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>Section 22.  To add at the end of the section the words &ldquo;provided that this section shall not apply for a period of three years after the passing of this Act to any person or the successors in title of a person who during the period of twelve months preceding the passing of this Act has lawfully exercised a right of fishing with a snap net in such tidal waters.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This follows immediately on what the Minister has said.  My information is that, as a matter of fact, the licences which have been issued hitherto to the Abbey fishermen have included licences to fish in the tidal waters.  The Abbey fishermen licences &mdash;12 in number&mdash;issued to them every year always entitled them to fish in tidal waters, and I understand that the Lax Weir people also had certain licences to use snap nets in the tidal waters.  I suspect that in this case the purpose of putting this section in the Bill has nothing to do with <Col N="1001" /> the use of snap nets because they would be affected otherwise, but that it has to do with the prohibition of the use of snap nets in tidal waters, because there has been a legal controversy between the alleged rights of the Lax Weir people to certain fishing in the tidal waters and the claim that the Abbey fishermen have put forward as to their immemorial rights to this fishing.  If this right is taken from them by this Bill in this form and if there is an increase in the compensation to be given to the Lax Weir people, because of the alleged right they have over certain tidal waters, the position of the Abbey fishermen in respect to their compensation will be detrimentally affected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been suggested that the Lax Weir people are going to get compensation for any right the existence of which they cannot prove to the satisfaction of the arbitrator.  Whatever rights they have are being acquired, but it is for the arbitrator to determine what are their rights.  This particular Section 22 has no relation whatever to the situation of the Lax Weir Company.  It arises entirely out of the fact that no snap net licences have, in fact, been issued and it is desired to prevent any increase in that form of fishing in the tidal waters of the Shannon and this section is put in in order to prevent any such increase taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The position, of course, is that the Abbey fishermen's compensation will have something to do with the possibility of their transferring their skill and labour to some other profitable occupation.  They are being deprived of their fishing rights with snap nets in the fresh waters and now in the tidal waters, and by the limitation of the number of licences for drift or draft nets, they will not be enabled to follow the occupation of fishing in any other waters of the Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they were public rights of fishing but&mdash;I do not know <Col N="1002" /> what the wording of the licence may have been&mdash;it seems to be clear that the licences that were issued entitled these Abbey fishermen to fish in the tidal waters, so that these snap net licences have, in fact, been issued to the Abbey fishermen in recent years.  That is definitely a matter of conflict between the Minister's information and the information I have, but it is clear that this particular section is directed against the Abbey fishermen's rights. They make the claim, I understand, that they have certain rights of fishing in the tidal waters&mdash;certain legal rights to fish in the tidal waters, by pre scription or otherwise&mdash;and if this Act deprives them of any other right as a matter of law, any property they may have in that right goes automatically.</P>
      <P>I may be misunderstanding the position, but what I do understand is that they claim to have certain legal rights in respect to their fishing in tidal waters in the neighbourhood of their fisheries.  If that is so, and if this is enacted, that right is removed at once by law, so that there is a treble deprivation of certain rights which these Abbey fishermen have enjoyed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the position of the Dunlop Company hardly arises under this Order, because this Order in no way confers any monopoly on the Dunlop Company.  The Dunlop Company are not getting under this, <Col N="1004" /> in the strict legal sense, a monopoly. They may have an effective monopoly, the position being that they will be the only manufacturers behind the tariff barrier.  There is no legal barrier, however, to any qualified person in the Free State manufacturing tyres if he wanted to do so.  The only arrangement with the Dunlop Company involves the calculation of the price at which their commodities will be sold on the basis of a formula which presupposes the payment of wages here corresponding to those paid for similar work done in Great Britain.  If the wages here are higher, then the price varies accordingly; if the wages are lower, the price will be lower accordingly. The intention, however, as far as I understand, is to pay what have been the recognised rates for these functions in Great Britain.  It is anticipated that production will be commenced within the course of three or four months; but it will not be until after about six months, when the full range of production will have taken place, that the imports will have been reduced to a negligible quantity in the classes of tyres affected in consequence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take the opportunity to deal with this question of conditions of employment, but not specifically or wholly in respect of pneumatic tyres.  We have a series of motions here and the question in a broader way might be raised so that the Minister can tell us if there is any definite line of policy adopted in regard to these industries which are being helped and for which most of these motions are really in preparation. I am moved to this by the publication yesterday of the census of production reports and, so far as they have gone, the census of production reports for 1932.  If the Minister will examine the figures given and compare the proportion of the net output that goes to wages and salaries he will find that there has been a progressive decline. In 1926, of the industries which are productive of transportable materials, 55 per cent. of the net output went for wages and salaries; in 1929, 47 per cent.; in 1931, 44 per cent.; and, so far as the reports have been <Col N="1005" /> published, in 1932 it was round about the same figure on the wages side, because the salaries are not published in the preliminary reports.  There is a steady decline in the proportion of net output which goes to wages and salaries, which obviously means that the people earning money by the conduct of industry are progressively less able to buy the output of that industry. That is an indication of an economic tendency which I am sure the Minister is aware of.  The more highly organised those industries are the more accentuation there will be of that tendency.  It is necessary, therefore, to counter it by some provision at the beginning of the operations of these industries.  I hope the Minister will take this to heart and at least declare a policy which will affect the proportion of net output which goes to paying the workers in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I could not at this stage undertake to discuss the conclusion which Senator Johnson has drawn from these figures.  I think the conclusion is wrong; but it would take me a long time to prove it, and even then I probably would not convince him.  The reduction in the relationship between the amount which went in wages and the net output does not mean that there has been a reduction in wages.  It really means that the process of industry has been so changed that a higher output can be secured with less labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that in certain of the newer industries the general experience has been that at the beginning the newly-trained workers cannot turn out as much, and if they were to retain the output at the commencement, you will find that most of them could not continue the industry.  It is almost natural with new industries that up to a certain point that tendency would be justified, but not perhaps continuous.  It is natural that it should be so.</P>

      <P>On the other question raised by Senator Johnson, I may say that it is the policy of the Department to encourage the fixation of wage rates by agreement, following consultation between representatives of the employers and employees.  It would be only where, through lack of organisation and other circumstances, such consultation and agreement did not appear to be possible, that other action will be taken such as scheduling an industry under the Trade Board Act.

In that way the workers would be getting better value by buying the products at a cheap rate.  Would not that be a better way of settling the wage rates than to fix rates as you propose to do?  Does the Minister agree that that would be the proper way&mdash; that the article would become cheaper on the market and then the lower rate of wages would buy more of the article? There would be no loss to labour in that way and the public generally would be benefited.</P>

I would like if the Minister when this monopoly is being given would see in a statutory way that proper safeguards are inserted&mdash;that is, safeguards as far as rates of wages, etc. are concerned.  Where in an industry of this kind a fair number of people are employed and where this concession is given, the Minister should put in a proviso that the rates of pay are such as shall be agreed upon between the trade unions and <Col N="1007" /> the employers.  In that way you ensure at once the trade union rates of pay and only trade union rates shall apply.</P>
      <P>At the present time we are conferring concessions upon employers&mdash; such concessions as are not enjoyed by employers in any other country.  We do not ask them to take any little risk at all.  What happens is&mdash;somebody comes along to the Ministry and says that if a sky-high tariff or a complete embargo in respect of some particular commodity is imposed, he will erect a factory that in one or two years will manufacture whatever is required in this country of that particular commodity.  In this case, Messrs.  Dunlops have not been asked to risk one penny in advance.  They get their protection before they even proceed to build the factory.  These being the circumstances then it is not asking too much to require these concessionaires to give conditions of employment which will be up to the standard at least of employers that have no such concession given them. We have, through our own legislation, through the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act and the Control of Manufactures Act set up here the equivalent of an economic dictatorship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have given the Government control of imports.  New duties are imposed without consultation with the Oireachtas.  When these come subsequently before the Oireachtas, they have in no case been rejected even though they might be objected to.  It is not intended that they should be rejected because when these duties or embargos have been in operation for some time, many industries are set up as a result of these concessions conferred in that way.  There is no intention of any reversal of the process.  For that reason conditions should be inserted so that these firms will pay rates of wages that are considered fair.  We know that in some cases under some of the monopolies set up rates of wages are being paid that are a disgrace. Some of these firms are employing female labour and child labour in factories where male labour and adult labour should be employed.  We are <Col N="1008" /> asking that these concessions will be given to no factories that are certainly a menace to the health and well-being of those concerned.</P>
    <P>When President Roosevelt started his National Recovery Act Campaign he succeeded really in establishing trade unionism for the first time in many industries in the United States. It is true that the unions did not approve of many things that had been done under the National Recovery Act. But that is one thing that was made obligatory upon the employers&mdash;the recognition of official trade unionism instead of the infamous company unions that were a feature of the industrial life in America.  President Roosevelt made it compulsory upon employers, having secured certain rights and certain concessions, that they should recognise the rights of their employees, and therefore by the distribution of purchasing power, enable the people of America to buy the commodities that they produce in their factories.  I hope that the Minister will, in the case of the industry dealt with in this motion, see that those who get this concession will recognise fair rates of pay and fair conditions of employment for the workers.  In most of these cases the effective limit on the exploitation of the consumer is very little.  The procedure is to pass on everything to the consumer.  There is no doubt that the cost of living in regard to many of these commodities has gone up and it is only the small purchasing power of the people that is preventing the cost of these commodities from going up still higher.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather glad that Senator O'Farrell has referred to the price of these commodities.  There is the danger, having regard to the Minister's remarks, that in these industries you may have the employer and the employee agreeing in the matter of wages but very much to the dissatisfaction of the public.  But I do not agree with the Senator in the rest of what he said.  I think he was unduly alarming on this question of the embargo on imports.  He said that the manufacturers had not taken any <Col N="1009" /> risks; that there was no risk for the companies concerned.  Senator O'Farrell while criticising the dangers in the embargo on imports and while pointing out what he called an economic dictatorship made references to which I could not agree.  I am not going into the question now as to whether we have or have not an economic dictatorship.  At all events there is no question that the Government have very strong economic powers.  But the mandate that is given under those powers will be only so long as the Government chooses. The allowing in of their main commodities&mdash;cotton and rubber&mdash;will altogether depend on the Government and the same may be said as to the output.  The quota can be taken off, reduced or dealt with in any way the Government wishes.  Therefore, the idea that the Government is giving something without any guarantee and no risk on the part of the manufacturer is a false one.  The Government have power to do what they like, subject, of course, to the fact that the industry is carried on in the interest of the public.  No Government will do anything else.  I think, however, there is an idea abroad that so long as you have a quota you are creating a privileged position for five or six people.  We are doing nothing of the kind.  We give power and authority for the etting up of these industries, but when the quota is fixed, it means that the State has power to regulate the output.</P>

      <P>We are dealing here with Quota Orders made by the Government from August and October last up to now.  One point that strikes me very forcibly is that in making those Quota Orders sufficient consideration has not been given to the whole question.  The object of these orders is to give more employment to our own nationals.  I do not want to refer to Messrs. Dunlops.  They are only numbers here to me.  I refer to tyres, boots and things of that sort and it does not matter much which of them you take.  I suppose I had better confine myself to one.  Take tyres.  Did the Executive Council consider the number <Col N="1010" /> of men employed in Dublin as agents for tyres, as wholesale distributors and as retailers, and did they consider the number of these men who will be knocked out of employment when we start the manufacture of our own tyres here?  People may say that there will be as much employment given here to the distributors of the Irish tyres as is given at present. There will not, when you have only one firm, because one firm will do the work of all the others and it will very soon cut out the wholesalers. They will go direct to the retail trade. I do not object to the manufacturer going to the retail trade if the money that is saved to the manufacturer is passed on to the consumer, but it is not.  I do not forget the money that is paid out in employment and in distribution by the other firms engaged in these industries here.  These moneys keep families going.  We used to read in our history books of the old days in Ireland when we had our kings and our princes.  Twenty-five years ago we had merchant princes in Dublin.  What the Executive Council should consider now is&mdash;are we creating a new class of manufacturing princes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well known that in many of these new industries&mdash;I am not referring to Dunlops&mdash;the wages paid are scandalously low.  They are getting the cheapest labour they possibly can while the people running these factories are all doing very well.  They are cutting out middle-men as far as they can.  They are cutting out the wholesaler, the agent and everybody else who formerly got employment. They are going direct to the retailer. After all, when you weigh matters up, are we providing more employment? Naturally we get in machines to make all these goods, but the actual employment given to Irish hands and Irish brains is what matters.  Mind you, although I say this, I do not object to the Government's policy on the question.  The only thing I would say is that perhaps they are going a little too fast.  I would certainly say also that the previous Administration went a little too slow.  I only mention this from the point of view that, if <Col N="1011" /> a monopoly or a quota is given you should carefully consider what the consequences are going to be.  Certainly anybody who gets a monopoly should be asked to pay decent wages and should, as far as possible, give employment to men rather than to machines.  They should, furthermore, see that the people working under them are getting that to which they are entitled&mdash;a living wage.</P>

      <P>This Quota Order deals with boots and shoes.  There are a number of suggestions which I should like to put forward for the consideration of the Minister in the administration of this particular Order in the coming year.  There are also some criticisms I should like to make, some of which are based on my own experience and a large number of which have been put to me by persons who are interested in the import of boots and shoes.  I am not opposing the Quota Order in any way but I do want to make suggestions, some of which I think would apply to other Orders and <Col N="1012" /> all of which would reasonably apply to this Order and, to some extent, to the next Order which also deals with a different class of boots and shoes.  The first criticism that I should like to make is that when a Quota Order is issued towards the end of the year, certainly in the second half of the year, it is not necessary to insist upon basing the quotas given to the various importers on the imports for one year up to December 31st.  It would be much fairer, I think, to take a more convenient date, such as the end of the month prior to the Order itself or perhaps six weeks before the Order. If the Order is to be fair in its application, it should deal with the actual requirements for the period up to, as near as possible, the date of the Quota Order.  Where any firm has made special arrangements or extended its business it might find itself definitely crippled by the fact that you go back almost a year in order to obtain the basis.  I put that forward for the consideration of the Minister.  There is no reason why you should go back to the 31st December of a certain year except perhaps that the Department had a number of forms with that date printed on them.  It is a definite drawback to the importers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister in connection with this Order whether quotas for the coming year&mdash;I know that we are now in the Second Quota period&mdash;are going to be based on the 1933 figures, as the first portion has been, or whether the Department is going to ask for information regarding imports during 1934.  Then again the information required in the first instance failed entirely to take into consideration the position of firms who were importing less in 1933 by reason of the fact that they had increased their trade with Irish manufacturers.  The first quotas were based, as I understand it&mdash;the Minister can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;on the imports of the particular importer during 1933, so that a man who during 1933 failed to buy any Irish manufactures was actually placed in a better position by getting a larger quota in the first instance than the person who had bought <Col N="1013" /> a certain proportion of Irish-manufactured goods.  I think that was a point that was probably overlooked by the Minister.  I think that is not fair nor do I think it is desirable.  I know of one firm, not my own, which specialised in Irish-manufactured goods and which had gone very near the correct figures. The Minister will know the figures, but let us assume for the sake of argument that they are fifty-fifty.  I think that a firm or a person who bought 50 per cent. of his stock of boots and shoes in Ireland and who had of his own free-will or through a spirit of patriotism, achieved that position, before the quota order was made, should be left to enjoy that position and should not be placed in a position under which he is only allowed to import 25 per cent. of his requirements whereas the person who imported all his requirements previously is allowed to get 50 per cent.  That, of course, is a problematical case but it goes to prove my point.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that there were many firms who had reached that fifty-fifty basis but I do suggest that according to the nature of the business done, the percentage of Irish goods purchased in some cases would be very considerable. I should say that in the case of firms who stock only men's boots and shoes a very large proportion of their stock would be purchased in Ireland, while the firm trading in ladies' or children's boots and shoes would require to import a much larger percentage.  I am possibly taking the two extremes.  I do not say that the Minister should take into consideration the fluctuations of the trade in this way in every case, but I am showing, at the same time, that a certain amount of injustice does arise and that you must go as far as you can to meet it.  I think it is beyond doubt that firms dealing in the cheaper class trade in ladies' and children's boots and shoes can get a much smaller proportion of their requirements in Ireland than those who deal in the better class.  In the case of men's boots, I understand that it is possible for a firm to get these boots and shoes in Ireland if there is a sufficient output from the <Col N="1014" /> factories.  Almost every kind is being made here.  There are certain special types such as surgical shoes and the narrow fittings which are not yet produced here, but there is a substantial production of ordinary boots and shoes.  In the case, however, of the cheaper classes of ladies' boots and shoes, worn by the working classes, the percentage made here is exceedingly small.</P>
    <P>A little later, a request came to importers of boots and shoes to state the extent of their Irish manufactured trade.  I do not know what the general experience was.  My own experience was that the percentage for the previous year would not have been nearly as good as for the later year because it was increasingly easy to buy Irish-manufactured goods.  The percentage was from 20 to 25 and the net result of sending in particulars of Irish-manufactured goods was that one got a quota for 11 additional pairs, or 22 singles, to adopt the term used by the Department.  That arrived ten days before the end of the quota period.  As the quota covered only 11 pairs, it did not really matter but if it had been for any substantial amount, it could not have been made use of so far as any manufacturer was concerned.  I am still puzzled as to why the Department insists on dealing in singles.  I can assure them, from a fairly long experience, that nobody buys a single shoe in a retail shop.  Even the few people who have wooden legs buy a pair of shoes.  For some reason I have not been able to fathom, the first licences were sent out in singles.  Quite a number of people quite genuinely believed that pairs were intended.  Others decided that they would not trouble about the matter and would take the licence as referring to pairs.  Other innocent persons, like myself, rang up the Department and were told that the licence referred to singles and that if the number were divided by two, it would give the number of pairs which could be imported.  My mathematics were equal to that and, consequently, I did not make any mistake as to the number ordered by my firm.  But a number of other people did make a <Col N="1015" /> mistake.  Fifteen or 20 smaller people in the country came to me to know what they could do about the matter. I assured them that they could not get a more sympathetic staff than that at Lord Edward Street.  I can pay that compliment to them.  That was my own experience.  How they kept their tempers and received people as courteously as they did under the conditions under which they had to deal with these quota orders, I do not know.  Nothing I say here is by way of criticism of that staff.  Although a lot of people have come to me, I have heard no criticism of the staff in connection with these quota orders.  Some of these people came back to me and said they had been treated quite fairly, as they had made a <i>bona fide</i> mistake.  They were allowed to get double the quantity in during the preliminary period.  If that be true &mdash;some people told me it was so&mdash;I suggest to the Minister that, to be fair all round, he should have increased the quantity by the requisite amount and extended the right to others.  However, that is not a very big point and I am not going to debate it at any length.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether, after experience of the first quota period or second quota period, it would not be possible to issue the licence about a month before the commencement of the new period.  The total quota for the new period is announced some considerable time&mdash; about a month, I think&mdash;before the new quota period.  If that announcement could be made a little earlier and if the allotments could be issued two or three weeks before the period, it would be a great convenience to many firms.  The principal reason for that is that the medium-sized firm, which has been in the past able to buy direct from English manufacturers, cannot get delivery at very short notice.  It lessens the time very considerably, when the quota period is only three months, if you do not get, as is the case at present, the quota licence until the first day of the new period.  There may be <Col N="1016" /> administrative difficulty in making the change.  I can understand that the difficulty would be serious in the first quota period but, as the quota gets established and the register is prepared, it should be possible to issue the licences three or four weeks before the period.  This suggestion has been put to me by several people who asked me to mention it here as a thing which would be of very definite advantage to them.  I think I am correct in saying that the Minister allots, under the Act, 75 per cent. of the quota set out.  Where it is decided to allot the remaining 25 per cent., the benefit is very much reduced if that allotment arrives only at the end of the quota period.  In the case of boots and shoes, quite a number of firms had so much on order that the allotment was useful to them at any time.  They had only to send a telegram in order to get the boots sent on.  That will not operate during the coming year.  What is likely to happen is that firms who have been buying from manufacturers direct and who have, accordingly, been able to give the public better value will, owing to the shortness of the notice, be obliged to buy from English warehouses.  That would be a great mistake and the public would suffer because the value would not be as good as if the stocks were bought direct from the manufacturer.  A trader cannot do a regular trade within the quota unless he is given time and can give an order for reasonable quantities.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another point on which, I suppose, the Minister will not agree with me.  I ask him to make the quota for six months in the case of boots and shoes.  According to their class of trade, certain wholesalers would probably prefer to take the bulk of their requirements in the earlier part of the year, but the retailers who buy direct would buy most largely during the second three months.  Probably the Minister will say that the imports for each period of three months during the year are much the same. So far as individual firms are concerned, that is not the case.  The wholesaler who must do his distribution <Col N="1017" /> at the buying period&mdash;at the end of March and the beginning of April &mdash;must have his stock in during the earlier part of the year.  The trader who is buying direct will take his stock at the later period.  The present system operates against the middle-sized man, who has either to do without his share of the quota or find capital to get a quarter of his year's supply in the first three months, when he does not really need it.  The most serious difficulty is that of buying in sufficiently large quantities to be able to buy from the best manufacturers.  If one buys in small quantities and is confined to two or three manufacturers, one does not get the best value.  When one is buying in large quantities, one can get a cut price.  The manufacturer will rarely refuse to reduce the price if the order is a large one.  It is, therefore, not only in the interests of importers but in the interests of the public that people here should be in a position to place sufficiently large orders to obtain these prices.  I should like to urge on the Minister that he should work out some scheme which would take into consideration the Irish purchases in the particular year and by which the quota would be based on the total figure and not solely on imports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Various suggestions were made by Senator Douglas which, I think, are worthy of attention and which might well be adopted if no administrative difficulty would arise. There is, of course, no clear reason why we should base the individual quota calculations upon the figures for the previous calendar year.  Any period of 12 months, concluding with the most recent date for which the trade and import statistics would be available, would probably be equally satisfactory. We have to work upon these figures because they are the only reliable figures we can get.</P>
      <P>It might be possible to devise a system of working the allocation of licences on a basis of total purchases, but that would require a considerable amount of extra work on the part of the staff in order to satisfy themselves of the accuracy of the figures supplied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is becoming more simple as the operation of the Order becomes smoother.  During the first period we did allow for some confusion, not only because a considerable number of importers mistook the figures as to the number of pairs of boots and shoes, but because of the fact that a large number failed to apply within the statutory time limit. We anticipated that that would be so.  No discretion is given under the Act.  The register is prepared and those on the register up to a particular date are entitled to get a quota.  There is a portion of the quota in respect of which the Minister has an element of discretion.  That discretion will be exercised in favour of those supporting Irish manufacture. The existence of the 25 per cent. surplus has heretofore been used to prevent hardships arising out of mistakes made by those mistaking pairs instead of singles, and to enable those who did not apply in time to get licences.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that necessary.  The reduction, in the first quota period, was only 40 per cent. In fact, I think the number admitted was quite adequate.  The first quota period was a short one.  When we came to the next, where the reduction was 50 per cent., the fact that it was a three-months period made the 25 per cent. surplus considerably greater and that is used at present in order to secure advantages to those who in the past were purchasing a higher proportion of Irish made shoes than others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As 25 per cent. of the existing quota is equivalent to about 120,000 pairs, I think it will be <Col N="1019" /> sufficient to enable an appreciable difference to appear in the licences given to traders who previously were put in a less favourable position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have this point made clear.  Can I reply to persons who have approached me that those persons who made returns of their Irish purchases at the end of last year, will find, in the allocation of 25 per cent., that will be taken into consideration in any further applications from them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I can say that without any further application the 25 per cent. will be used in that particular way. The question as to whether the future quotas will be based upon the 1933 figures is an open one.  We might be able to avail of some proportion of the 1934 figures as the more recent, but we get an entirely different situation when we come to consider the quota period when imports were abnormal. During the preliminary period of six weeks, before the quota period began to run, the imports represented abnormal quantities.  Although subject to licences, they were not restricted to any great extent.  During the quota period 40 per cent. reduction was operating. The experience of the Department at one period helps in another, and will enable us to work more smoothly.  The boot and shoe orders are more difficult to operate than in other cases.  The register here contains roughly 750 names; in others there are only ten or twenty importers and it is easy to deal with the peculiar position of any one of them on the basis of equity.  When dealing with 750 you have only to devise a general rule and apply it ruthlessly although you realise that in some cases it might be giving undue advantage having regard to special circumstances.  But the intention is to try to make good that situation by the application of 25 per cent. extra in the allocation of additional licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would prefer ourselves to have a longer quota period but in the boot and shoe trade considerable developments are taking place.  It is not possible <Col N="1020" /> to say to what extent the existing factories are going to respond to the new position, but even the existing factories, with their present equipment, could extend their production considerably and probably that will take place. But it will take three months to check up the increases of production and determine upon the quota for the following period.  In that way, if we were to have a longer period at this stage, we might get ourselves into the peculiar position in which there would be a serious glut.  As well as the fact, of course, that new boot and shoe factories can be brought into existence and full production in a shorter period than six months, when we come to look further ahead than three months, and estimate what the production will be, we will avail of the longer period and where it was possible to make a longer period than three months we have done so, apart from the first period.  The first period should be short.  People will make mistakes; they will fail to get on the register and fail to apply, but the shorter period was no disability in the second instance.  I think these are the main points raised by Senator Douglas.  I ask him not to take anything I am saying as offering a final opinion upon any of his suggestions, because I think they are all worth examining.  The decision to base the quota on singles and not on pairs was arrived at by those responsible for drafting the legislation. It is possible we might be persuaded the next time to agree to pairs instead of singles.  I agree that it would be preferable because it is the manner in which calculations are usually made in the industry.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to issue licences for a very long time before the beginning of the quota period.  Under the Act, we have, in fact, only 14 days in which to make the calculations and issue the licences.  The six weeks' period between the making of the Order and the commencement of the period is allocated under the Act in various ways.  There is a certain period within which the quota must be announced or any special quota that has to be made must be effected by Order.  Then there is the period <Col N="1021" /> during which the persons who wish to import can apply to get on the register, and then there is the period in which calculations are made as to the allocation of the quota between the persons on the register, and the issue of licences.  That takes up the whole of the six weeks.  In fact, the six weeks are hardly enough, but it is desirable that the preliminary period should not be unduly prolonged, because, as I said before, it is a period during which misunderstandings commonly take place and in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce must have more or less complete discretion in the issue of licences in order to allow of contracts being fulfilled, goods being cleared, and so on.  The period has proved to be just barely long enough to enable all the arrangements to be made without being so long as to create difficulties.</P>
    <P>The quota for the present period is 462,500 pairs and it represents a 50 per cent. reduction effected during this period.  Whether we will maintain that or not, or whether we will change it will depend on subsequent developments, but I have no information as to what they are likely to be.</P>

      <P>This is a kindred motion and I can assure you, Sir, that I am not going to make another long speech.  I just wanted to say that my criticism was not on the preliminary period at all and I do not want it to be taken as my view that it could be done any quicker.  I agree that it could not, but I suggest that it might be possible for the Minister to take powers to issue the licences earlier after the quota period.  I recognise that in the case of the preliminary <Col N="1022" /> period there could be no question of issuing it sooner; but take the case of boots and shoes.  We are now in the second period, and I think it would be a good thing if machinery could be evolved by which they might come in sooner.  I know that a great many people in the trade have suggested that once the thing is established, if instead of waiting until the end of, say, the three months' period, applications were made and the allotments made earlier, it would go a long way to facilitate ordering.  There is another point that, I think, the Minister did not quite understand. When I asked whether it could be the basis of 1934, I really meant whether he would consider allowing firms to take an exact year&mdash;to send in their figures for an exact year, up to the end of the month preceding the Quota Order.  In other words&mdash;I forget the date of the Order but I think it is September of 1934&mdash;firms had to give figures up to 31st December, 1933.  I am suggesting whether it would not be fair to allow an optional return for one year up to, say, the end of August, 1934.  I have had three cases &mdash;one in which I must confess I am interested myself but two others in which I am not interested&mdash;where a very considerable increase in trade took place as a result of heavy capital expenditure during that exact year. If you continue always on 1933 that firm will be for some years at a disadvantage, due to the fact that as a result of increased expenditure and increased employment, trade was increased during the exact year before the Quota Order.  That was done and there was no easy way of adjusting it, but I suggest that for the future it could be adjusted without great administrative difficulty.</P>

      <P>In this case I should like to make a suggestion, and that is, that I think the Minister might consider whether it would not be better to have two quotas in this connection. I think it is a mistake to include motor bodies that come in in shell form as though they were complete bodies and that it would be better to divide them into two quotas.  If you give a firm a licence at the present moment which is really for a shell form it can be used for complete bodies.</P>
