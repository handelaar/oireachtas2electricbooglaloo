      <P>I have notice from Senator Phil Hogan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to review the staffing levels immediately at St. John's infants school, Kilkenny, to alleviate the present pupil-teacher ratio difficulties.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Nuala Fennell of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Social Welfare to clarify the position in relation to the spouses dental scheme and to indicate the action he intends to take to remedy the breakdown in the scheme.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator John Connor of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to clarify the position on the future development of second level education in Ballaghadereen, County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator David Norris on the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need, especially in the light of recent tragic events, for the Minister <Col N="914" /> for Justice to consider urgently the immediate opening of the facilities at Wheatfield Detention Centre.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Hogan, Fennell, Connor and Norris as suitable for discussion.  I have selected the matter raised by Senator Hogan and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. Senators Fennell, Connor and Norris may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

I am sure they would agree with me it is a matter of some grave concern.  If the issue is true, then an institution of State &mdash; and not just this State &mdash; must be exposed to the full rigours of legal and, of necessity, public scrutiny.  If on the other hand, the issue has been raised and there is found to be no substance to it, then the position of the media must be questioned.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the <i>National Development Plan</i>, <i>1989-1993.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>We on the Government side particularly welcome this debate on our <i>National Development Plan</i> which contains the largest budget ever mobilised to modernise our economy, accelerate economic growth, provide increased job opportunities and contribute to narrowing the gap between our living standards and those in the more prosperous regions of the European Community.  As such, this plan is of fundamental importance and its success will have a critical bearing on all our people in their everyday lives in enabling us to prepare for the single market in 1992 and to reap our fair share of the significant economic benefit which will accrue from this at Community level.</P>
      <P>The plan has its origins in the decision of the European Council held in Brussels on 12-13 February 1988 when it was decided that as part of the Delors plan for the relaunch of the Community and the completion of the single European market the amount of the Structural Funds for the less-developed regions should be doubled and a special effort made for the least prosperous, including Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This plan should be seen as an extension of our <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, is consistent with its objectives and takes us further along the road of economic and social development.  <i>The Programme for National Recovery</i> has already laid the foundations of a sounder and more prosperous economy by bringing about marked improvements in key <Col N="919" /> areas such as the public finances, interest rates and inflation, the balance of trade payments and competitiveness.  The plan which we are now debating proposes to build on this progress with the support of the Structural Funds of the European Community, which represent one element, a major element, in the Community's follow-up on the incorporation of economic and social cohesion into the Treaty of Rome as a major objective of the Community as a whole.  This was, of course, one of the most significant aspects of the Single European Act.</P>
    <P>The availability of the increased resources resulting from the doubling of the EC Structural Funds represents a unique opportunity for Ireland to raise the whole country as a region of the Community on to a new plane of development and to overcome the structural deficiencies that are holding up back and without putting at risk either budgetary stability or our balance of payments.  The under-utilisation of our resources, including the talents and abilities of our people, is the biggest challenge we face today.  It is imperative that we tackle this challenge successfully.  In facing it, we can be armed with the confidence which should inspire us from our proven capacity to master modern industrial and service technologies and to sell our products and services in the markets of the world, as evidenced by the fact that we now have a trade surplus with all our Community's partners.  Nevertheless in order to improve our performance as a modern economy and reach the standards we desire, it is urgently necessary to bring our economic infrastructure up to the highest possible standard of provision and efficiency and also to expand and strengthen the productive capacity of our economy.  The plan is concerned with both of these.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal briefly with the situation in the Community to which our national plan will relate.  This Government have been very active and effective in ensuring for this country the full benefits of our membership and in protecting our national interests in the Community. <Col N="920" /> The outcome of the negotiations on the reform of the Community's Structural Funds, which were of vital importance and significance for this country and other less-developed regions of the Community in the context of the completion of the internal market, represents a major achievement by the Government in ensuring a meaningful follow-up on the cohesion provisions of the Single European Act and provide us with major opportunities resulting from the doubling in the level of the Structural Funds resources for the less-developed regions, the commitment to a special effort for the least prosperous of these regions which, at our insistence, will also include this country and the provision that for these regions the rate of assistance from the funds can be up to 75 per cent.</P>
    <P>In addition, we were also successful in obtaining agreement that certain infrastructural projects with private sector funding will be eligible for assistance &mdash; a provision which will be particularly helpful to us, given our budgetary constraints, in ensuring that we will be in a position to maximise our take-up from the funds and, through partnership arrangements with the private sector, ensure that certain projects can proceed much more rapidly than would otherwise be the case.</P>
    <P>In this context, Senators will note that a special feature of the plan is provision for funding from the private sector where such private funding can be regarded as similar to public expenditure and thus, under the regulations qualify for Structural Funds' assistance.  This is particularly so in the case of roads where we have already identified a number of projects such as the Dublin Ring Road, the Newbridge-Kilcullen by-passes, the Lucan-Kilcock Road and the downstream crossing of the River Lee as suitable for such private sector input.</P>
    <P>Another area is that of tourism facilities and amenities where substantial investment by the private sector, with assistance from the European Regional Development Fund, is envisaged in the plan in line with the high priority we have <Col N="921" /> given to tourism development since our assuming office.</P>
    <P>Because of the still precarious state of our public finances and the massive overhang of Exchequer indebtedness, I need hardly emphasise the constraints which we face in regard to expenditure by the Government here.  Against this background and the need for a continuing reduction in the Exchequer borrowing requirement, which was again underlined in the recent Community's Annual Report on the Economic Situation, the increases in the Structural Funds and their deployment in enhancing our economy's potential output assume critical importance in providing a firmer basis for our economy to continue on a higher but sustainable growth path.</P>
    <P>Deeply conscious of the crucial importance of this plan, the Government made careful and effective arrangements in its preparation.  First, we acknowledged the vital role to be played by the Commission both in approving the plan to be submitted and in its subsequent implementation. It was clear to us that full and close co-operation with the Commission was essential in order to make a success of our preparation for the completion of the Single Market and in particular to ensure that the plan meets all the necessary requirements.  We arranged, therefore, at an early stage to establish the closest possible degree of co-operation and co-ordination between the Government and the Commission and the Administration here and the services of the Commission.</P>
    <P>For this purpose, on the Commission side a task force of relevant Commissioners and Directors General was established, headed by President Delors. On our side this was paralleled by a Committee of Ministers and Secretaries over which the Taoiseach presides.  The objective is to ensure that the Government's policies and Community policies are fully co-ordinated on an ongoing basis and that as the plan took shape it would be with the full knowledge and understanding of the Commission at every stage.  We developed what was, in fact, a novel partnership between us and this co-ordination <Col N="922" /> and co-operation will continue in order to ensure the successful implementation of our plan.</P>
    <P>The plan covers the State as a whole and this is in accordance with the Community's regulations under which Ireland is one region for the purposes of the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>In preparing the plan, the Government carried out an unprecedented level of consultation at both national and local regional level.  At national level the Central Review Committee under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was consulted: this is, of course, representative of the major national economic organisation, including farmers, industry, employers, trade unions and cooperatives.</P>
    <P>This was complemented by an important regional input from the working and advisory groups in the seven sub-national areas designated by the Government. The working groups represented the relevant Government Departments, State bodies and local authority management. the advisory groups included elected representatives of the local authorities such as the chairpersons of each county council and corporation within the area and of the larger urban district councils as well as representatives of a wide range of vocational groups with an interest and involvement in local development such as the CII, CIF, chambers of commerce, FUE, ICTU, ICMSA, ICOS and Macra na Feirme.  Criticisms that the views of local elected representatives were ignored are, therefore, totally without foundation.  Indeed, specific arrangements were made to ensure that the views and suggestions of the advisory groups were taken into account by the working groups.</P>
    <P>The Government adopted these arrangements against the background of their strong commitment to regional development and their desire to have a regional contribution in planning the best use of the increased resources from the Structural Funds.  We believe that these arrangements struck an appropriate balance between, on the one hand, representation of central Government which <Col N="923" /> will have to provide the great bulk of the matching national finance and which has to assess the expenditures involved in the total national budgetary context and, on the other hand, representatives from the areas themselves who brought to the task their knowledge of the needs, assets, weaknesses and resources of their areas together with a spirit of local enthusiasm and enterprise.</P>
    <P>This is the first time that regional participation of this kind has been instituted in this country.  We did this on our own initiative, because we firmly believe in the strength and vigour of our regions and local communities and their indispensable role and contribution to our overall development efforts at national level.</P>
    <P>Criticisms of our arrangements in this regard are, therefore, devoid of any substantive content and are a bit hard to take, especially from those who participated in the previous Government which consistently refused to introduce any regional or sub-national dimension into the operation of the Structural Funds in this country.  Under the new regulation, given that Ireland remains a single region for structural fund purposes, we could have adhered to the position established up to now that the national Government was the single regional authority to be involved in the process. Instead, and in line with the stance on consultation and involvement which we have adopted at national level on domestic economic and social matters, we introduced these new arrangements to ensure that regional and local knowledge and experience were drawn on and utilised to the full.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Government introduced the regional dimension as an afterthought and only under pressure from the Commission.  This is nonsense. Let me remind Senators that I announced the Government's intention to introduce this regional dimension as early as October 1987 when the negotiations on the Commission's proposals were only in their early stages.  There was no pressure from the Commission and <Col N="924" /> could not have been since we had already spontaneously announced our intentions to proceed according to the spirit of the approach we had advocated in successive elections.</P>
    <P>Those Senators who think there would have been a basis for pressure from the Commission are also misinformed.  I refer them to the new regulations on the funds adopted in June and December 1988. They will search these in vain for any provision that would provide the Commission with a legal basis for pressing us to adopt a regional dimension within Ireland.  Instead, it was left to each member state concerned to designate the competent authorities and it was completely optional whether these included regional or local bodies.</P>
    <P>Moreover, in Irish terms, since we are one region for community purposes, the reference to a regional authority refers to the national Government.  The language of the regulations has to cover varying situations in all the member states concerned and the reference to regional authorities is primarily relevant to countries like France or Spain, which are divided into regions, most of which have large populations than that of the entire State here.  For example, in France, the average population of the 22 regions is 2.4 million and the most populous has 10.2 million people.  In Italy, the populations of regions are also, in general, quite large by reference to the population of Ireland, ranging, in fact, up to 8.9 million.</P>
    <P>It has been claimed on the one hand, that the programme documents drawn up by the working parties were subject to a rigid pattern imposed from Dublin: on the other hand, there were complaints that, as summarised in the national plan, they varied and showed differences in approach and style.  Our detractors cannot have it both ways.  Of course, while there were general guidelines from the centre, no rigid pattern was imposed and the approaches and priorities of the different working and advisory groups did show differences, as is only to be <Col N="925" /> expected, in view of the varying natures and needs of the sub-regions.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested that the sub-regional breakdowns in the plan had, as their point of departure, figures that were predetermined at national level, without reference to the inputs from the regions. This is also wide of the mark.  Precisely because we had the central Government Departments, as well as the local authorities represented on the working groups, we had a constant feedback from these groups in the process of preparing the national plan.  Due to the time constraints, the two exercises had to proceed in parallel but they did not proceed in sealed compartments.  As a result of a process of interaction, the sub-regional breakdown set out in the national plan matches quite well with the results emerging from the working and advisory groups, all of which have, incidentally, essentially completed their reports.</P>
    <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity publicly to thank all the representatives on both the working and advisory groups for their commendable efforts which facilitated the significant regional input to and dimension of the national plan and the operational programmes.  The results of their work were taken into account and incorporated, as appropriate, by the Government in the national development plan which, for the first time ever, contains planned total expenditure, including the amounts which we are putting forward for EC support from the structural funds in each of the seven sub-regions in response to the assessments of needs and objectives made by the groups.</P>
    <P>As Senators will have noted, Chapter 6 of the National Development Plan contains a summary of the objectives and strategies which were identified for each region together with financial tables outlining a detailed sectoral and functional breakdown of the planned expenditure over the period 1989-1993 in each region.  It is clear from these tables that each region will benefit substantially in the developments planned.  Given the substantial role of the Exchequer in funding the expenditures involved, the decisions on the allocation of resources <Col N="926" /> as between the different regions had to be taken by the Government, but let me emphasise that these decisions took fully into account the needs and priorities as identified by the groups.  It also needs to be clearly understood that within the constraint of the limit on the resources available, increases in the share of any region could only be at the expense of other regions.</P>
    <P>Apart from their input into the preparation of the National Development Plan, the work undertaken by the groups has also provided a valuable input into the formulation of the operational programmes which will set out in greater detail the development measures which are set out in outline form in the national plan.  Most of these programmes, the coverage of which is set out in Chapter 5 of the national plan, have already been submitted to the Commission and the remaining ones will be forwarded very soon.</P>
    <P>These programmes will be examined by the Commission in parallel with its examination of the national plan and we expect that they will be approved at the same time, or, possibly, in some cases in advance of the six month maximum period set in the regulations.  Indeed, by acting quickly in this area we are ahead of nearly all our Community partners and are, therefore, well positioned to ensure that projects can go ahead and that the assistance from the structural funds can flow as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>For the information of Senators, I should mention that a provision in the co-ordinating regulation, dealing with the transition from the old to the new regime for the structural funds, permits approval of programmes once the plan has been submitted, but before the Community support framework for the five-year period is agreed with the Commission &mdash; a provision which we wish to see availed of to the fullest extent possible to ensure that there is no interruption or undue delay in our take-up of assistance from the funds this year.</P>
    <P>Responding to recent criticisms on the future role envisaged for the consultation <Col N="927" /> structures, I should mention that the coordinating regulation provides that, within the framework of the new partnership, the member states and the Commission are to ensure effective monitoring in the implementation of programmes which are assisted from the funds.  Such monitoring is to be carried out by way of jointly agreed reporting procedures, sample checks and the establishment of monitoring committees set up in agreement between the member states and the Commission.</P>
    <P>The manner in which these provisions will be applied in our case has yet to be discussed in any substance with the Commission and it is, therefore, too early at this stage to comment on this particular aspect.  However, as we pointed out in the national plan, our present system of ongoing co-ordination and integration between the various State agencies and local authorities is efficient, cost-effective and practical and this will continue to ensure that particular developments planned for each area are implemented in an integrated way which will ensure coherence and complementarily between the individual measures and programmes. An additional consideration to bear in mind also is that the work of the groups at sub-national level will be important, and to a large extent, the guiding factor which will influence and will be taken into account in the detailed implementation at regional and local levels of our operating programmes.</P>
    <P>We do, of course, welcome any constructive comments and suggestions for improvement to the plan.  While there is no real scope for significant changes in the fundamental provisions, the Government will be flexible as regards the more detailed aspects of the particular sectors and in the timing and implementation of particular projects.  Thus, the procedures which we are following are as open as possible in the circumstances to receiving submissions and proposals from any quarter or particular interest groups.</P>
    <P>A vitally important aspect of this National Development Plan is the <Col N="928" /> manner in which the expenditures envisaged in the plan are fitted into and made compatible with the strict budgetary discipline being pursued under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>The economic recovery policies that we have implemented since March 1987 have the approval of the European Commission. Indeed, the recent annual report of the EC stresses the continuing importance of the process of budgetary adjustment, stabilisation of the debt-GDB ratio, a continuing reduction in the Exchequer borrowing requirement through cuts in public expenditure, with a greater emphasis on current than capital. The degree of improvement in the public finances achieved to date has been remarkable.  The debt-GNP ratio has been stabilised ahead of schedule as a result of renewed economic growth and associated revenue buoyancy and the reduction of Government expenditure by 9 per cent of GNP since 1986 but further adjustment will be necessary, even after this year's targets have been achieved. The reduction in the level of borrowing achieved in recent years, the improvement in the rate of growth in the economy, have done no more than ease the problems of budget management to a limited degree.  The recognition in the programme that &ldquo;a fiscal policy which faces the financial realities is the key to putting the economy back on the path to long-term sustained growth&rdquo; must still remain a major guiding principle for policy over the next five years.</P>
    <P>The size of the Exchequer deficit is the primary determinant within our control of the environment for investment and sustained economic growth &mdash; through its impact on financial markets and interest rates, and on stability and confidence generally.  For this reason, and in view of the scale of outstanding debt and the large amount of resources this pre-empts, it is necessary to proceed beyond stabilisation over the medium-term.  At the same time, there is good reason to believe that, with a positive response to the development programmes set out in this plan, the economy can move reasonably quickly on to a higher growth path.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="929" /> Growth in the Irish economy over the period to the mid-1990s could exceed the average of the EC, given continuing implementation of a responsible domestic policy strategy.  Key elements in this will be the maintenance of a good management-labour relations climate, low inflation and interest rates, a stable rate of exchange and a constant emphasis on competitiveness.  Given a consistent adherence to the right policies and attitudes, we could prudently anticipate real economic growth of the order of 3.5 per cent annually over the medium-term which, on current forecasts, would be better than the EC average.  Such growth should lead to a modest reduction in the burden of debt over the coming few years.  However, to fully re-establish sustainable growth in output and employment a more substantial reduction in the real level of debt is clearly necessary.</P>
    <P>The progress made under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the prospects of further major progress under this plan, however, could be endangered if we allow inflation to rise significantly again in relation to our trading partners. Thus, to keep prices and the rate of inflation down is one of the most important tasks we face in maintaining economic progress and in ensuring the success of this national plan.</P>
    <P>The plan we have adopted is, despite the demands for additional capital expenditure, consistent with the financial policy goals we have been adhering to and, in fact, improves on them.  The plan envisages a reduction in the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement to 3 per cent of GNP in 1993, and in the debt-GNP ratio from its current level of 133 per cent to 120 per cent by that date.  It is possible, if the experience of the last two years were to be repeated, that financial progress could be faster than that.  The Exchequer returns for the first quarter of 1989, in so far as they give any valid signal for the year as a whole, are encouraging. It is not possible accurately to predict the course of events for many years ahead but our responsibility is to set realistic, achievable targets and implement consistently and courageously the policies <Col N="930" /> necessary to achieve them.  If conditions warrant, we will raise our sights higher as the implementation of this plan brings the desired results.</P>
    <P>The targeted reduction in indebtedness should, in turn, lessen by about one-tenth the annual burden of debt-service, thereby releasing resources for other desirable purposes, including a reduction in taxation.</P>
    <P>One of the purposes of the plan is to secure a substantial increase in private investment.  We do not propose to make economic growth and employment dependent on increased domestic Government expenditure.  There has been substantial progress recently in streamlining the economy, and we have the capacity to absorb the additional funds now available and to use them for productive purposes without difficulty.  It is not legitimate to criticise this plan for what it does not contain.  Neither taxation policy nor social welfare policy, which are in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, feature as such in <i>The National Development Plan</i>, because they are not directly relevant to the increased Structural Funds.  The title of the plan is <i>National Development Plan</i>, and it is essentially an expansion in depth and an elaboration of some key development aspects of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>The plan envisages total expenditure of £9.1 billion over the five year period 1989-1993.  This includes £3.6 billion of public and similar expenditure, £2.1 billion of private sector expenditure and £3.4 billion from the EC Structural Funds.  Full details of these expenditures are set out in the plan.  For 1989, the plan provides for expenditure of £1.5 billion, including £0.4 billion from the Structural Funds.  The 1989 budget has already taken this expenditure into account so that the development measures could go ahead as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>The plan is geared to maximise the amount of Structural Fund aid which will be made available to Ireland and to use it to best advantage in developing the economy.  The amount being sought from the Structural Funds goes beyond a strict doubling for Ireland over the period and <Col N="931" /> represents what the Government here would regard as a fair allocation of the available funds in the light of our development needs.</P>
    <P>The public finance position limits the Government's room for manoeuvre in providing domestic resources to develop the economy.  What the plan sets out to do is to maintain domestic public and similar expenditure on structural development somewhat above its 1988 level and on top of that to invest the additional Structural Fund resources in additional development.</P>
    <P>This is in line with the &ldquo;additionality&rdquo; provision in the Community regulations. This provision requires &mdash; and I suggest Opposition Senators take careful note of this &mdash; that the increased appropriations from the funds should result in at least an equivalent increase in the total volume of official or similar structural expenditure, including the Community assistance, in the member state concerned, taking into account the macro-economic circumstances in which the funding takes place.</P>
    <P>In our circumstances, given the level of the national debt and the continuing need to reduce the level of Exchequer borrowing, the scope for increasing the level of Government investment in the economic infrastructure is of necessity limited, but the higher intervention rates now available from the Structural Funds are very great value in this regard as they will mean that the increased Community assistance will greatly increase the return that can be procured in improved infrastructure from domestic expenditure, public and private.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, the Government intend to pursue a further reduction in Exchequer borrowing over the medium term.  This reduction must be sought primarily on the current side, that is by reducing the budget deficit.  This will require continuing strict financial discipline. In fact, since 1986 the greater burden of adjustment has been on the current side, which has been reduced by 4.3 per cent of GNP, compared with a reduction of 3.3 per cent in Exchequer <Col N="932" /> capital borrowing.  For the first time since 1982 the Public Capital Programme in 1989 showed an increase of £80 million over the outturn for 1988, an increase that was, however, achieved without resort to additional Exchequer borrowing.</P>
    <P>The reformed EC Structural Funds provide for an increased maximum rate of Community contribution of 75 per cent of eligible expenditure involved.  The precise contribution rate which will apply to particular operations will be a matter for negotiation with the EC Commission. Factors which are to be taken into account include the seriousness of the specific problems to be tackled and the financial capacity of the member state involved.  Other factors, such as the extent to which an investment will generate revenue, will also have a bearing.</P>
    <P>Since Ireland has been classified as one of the least prosperous regions, it would be appropriate that the highest contribution rate should apply in Ireland as far as possible under the regulations and this is reflected in the plan.</P>
    <P>In determining the development priorities, the Government looked first at the main features of the economy which needed most attention, and where there are serious structural deficiencies which need to be remedied.  We have to overcome low income and output levels, where quite insufficient progress has been made since we joined the EC.  We have problems arising from our population structure, which has meant we have had to face both a rapid growth in labour supply and a high dependency ratio.  This has also undoubtedly exacerbated our financial problems.  The persistently weak demand for labour has led to high unemployment and emigration.</P>
    <P>We face difficulties in finding necessary development funds, because of continuing budgetary imbalances and high indebtedness.  Access costs and serious gaps in our infrastructure hinder investment and development.  We are still relatively heavily reliant on agriculture. There are weaknesses in our industrial structure and investment levels have been low in recent years.  Many of these <Col N="933" /> problems arise in part from our position on the periphery of Europe.  The completion of the single market and the parallel cohesion measures must aim to reduce the scale of these difficulties and begin to close the gap between Ireland and the central regions of the Community.</P>
    <P>It was clear that two types of action were needed: action to improve the competitiveness and efficiency of the Irish economy, taking account of our geographic position as an island on the periphery of Europe, inadequate infrastructure and low population density and action to strengthen the productive capacity of the economy.</P>
    <P>Improving the competitiveness and efficiency of the economy requires investment in transport facilities such as roads, rail and bus, seaports and airports.  It also requires investment in telecommunications, postal services, the energy network, sanitary services and waste disposal facilities.  All of these were identified as sectors where steps need to be taken to improve our position.</P>
    <P>As regards strengthening the productive capacity, the areas identified for development are industry, services, tourism, agriculture, fishing, forestry and rural development generally.  Action on these sectoral areas must be complemented by the development of human skills through improved educational and training resources and particular measures to facilitate the occupational integration of young people and to combat long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>Now that the development plan has been submitted, the Commission will assess it and proceed to draw up what is called the Community Support Framework. This Community Support Framework will be prepared in consultation with the Government here.  In effect, it will set out the development measures which the structural funds will assist over the period and the level of assistance which will be provided.  This will be a crucial document since it will establish the overall financing position for the five-year period.  The process of consultation and dialogue with the Commission, which <Col N="934" /> has worked so well in expediting the preparation of the plan, will continue to operate during the examination of the national plan, the operational programmes and the support framework.</P>
    <P>The regulations require the Commission to take a decision approving the Community Support Framework not later than six months after receiving the plan.  However, I am confident that the process can be completed earlier than that.  In discussions which we have had with President Delors and the Commissioners involved, we have stressed the need for early decisions so that all the development operations can get under way as early as possible.  They have assured us that the Commission will complete its work as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The plan sets out the overall strategy which will be followed in each of the relevant sectors.  The operational programmes will spell out in more detail the precise measures to be undertaken. These will be chosen in a way which will maximise the development effect and deal with the main deficiencies in each sector.  These programmes will show the specific developments and projects in each sector.  They will have to be agreed with the Commission and, in fact, will form the legal basis for the commitment of funds by the Community.  The programmes involved are set out in the plan and are as follows: industrial development; tourism; roads; transport, including air and sea freight, sea ports, airports, rail and bus; energy; sanitary and other local services; telecommunications and postal services; human resources, education, training and employment; agriculture and rural development.</P>
    <P>As we have highlighted in Chapter 2 of the national plan, the role of the Community in terms of the pursuit of a common macro-economic strategy at Community level designed to ensure that the Community economy expands at a rate in line with its potential and that the potential benefits of the internal market are fully realised, and the implementation of the internal market programme and the development of Community policies in accordance with the spirit of the <Col N="935" /> cohesion provisions of the Single European Act is of crucial importance in ensuring that the objectives which we have set in the plan are realised.</P>
    <P>The co-ordination of economic policies within the Community has now been given added significance and impetus with the requirement in the Single European Act that member states shall conduct their economic policies and shall co-ordinate them in such a way as, in addition, to attain the cohesion objectives of the Single Act.  By way of followup on this, the new co-ordinating regulation and related entries in the minutes of the Council provide that the assessment of programmes assisted by the funds shall take account, <i>inter alia</i>, of macro-economic effects and performance and the extent to which programmes complement national policies.</P>
    <P>This provides a strengthened basis for the pursuit of the Community's cooperative growth strategy whose importance was again underlined in the research results described in last year's Cecchini Report on the internal market.  Its effective implementation would provide major benefits in tackling more effectively the still unacceptably high level of unemployment in the Community and in maximising the gains from the internal market.  Senators will recall from the debate which we had here at the time of its publication that the Cecchini Report identified that, coupled with an appropriately growth-oriented economic policy, the benefits at Community level of the internal market could be as high as an increase in GNP of up to 7 per cent &mdash; additional to the economic growth which would otherwise occur &mdash; while the increase in net new jobs would be five million.</P>
    <P>In short, given the limited size of our domestic market and with the Community market accounting for three-quarters of our exports, the realisation of our economic potential is critically dependent on growth conditions in the markets of our Community partners.  In this context and viewed in historical perspective, it is notable and striking that <Col N="936" /> between 1960 and the first oil crisis in 1973 when the Community economy was at its most dynamic, economic convergence improved fairly steadily with cross-country deviations of GNP <i>per capita</i> narrowing substantially.</P>
    <P>Indeed, during that period the four poorest countries now in the Community &mdash; Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain &mdash; managed on average to reduce the gap separating them from the four richest member states by about one-third. However, since 1973 the convergence process has not only halted but has even gone into reverse and the gap between the four poorest and the four richest member states has widened by 5.5 percentage points.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to quantify fully the overall employment impact of the plan, embracing both the direct job content of the measures themselves and the wider implications for economic performance of strengthening the economic base and the development strategies.  The Government are, nevertheless, satisfied that the rate of job-creation will be stepped up progressively as these measures take effect.  It is considered that the pace of new job creation, estimated at 29,000 last year, can be accelerated to at least 35,000 annually by 1993.  This would represent the creation of more than 150,000 jobs over the five years.  It would accommodate the natural growth of the work-force, and, if job losses can be contained, it would enable a continuing significant reduction in unemployment.</P>
    <P>In assessing this plan, it is important to bear in mind that it concentrates principally on the essential development priorities over the next few years.  The increase in the funds, while substantial, does not represent any kind of abundant largesse, nor is it a chance to indulge in unrealistic attitudes and pursue projects not relevant to the funds or their purposes.</P>
    <P>Achievement of the targets in the plan will be of particular significance, therefore, in narrowing the gap between living standards here and those in the more prosperous areas of the Community.  To the extent that the Community succeeds <Col N="937" /> in fully exploiting all the opportunities which the internal market will create, our prospects and opportunities would, of course, be all the greater.</P>
    <P>The plan and supporting programmes which we have formulated provide this country with an unprecedented opportunity, in partnership with the European Commission, to consolidate the solid progress which the Government have already achieved under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and thereby opens up a new horizon of higher growth, increased employment and higher living standards for all our people.</P>
    <P>In the process, the Community will have demonstrated in a very practical way its commitment to the achievement of the cohesion objectives in the Single European Act of greater convergence in living standards and, in turn, this country will be better positioned to contribute to and participate more fully and effectively in the prospects which are opening up towards further steps in the Community's development.</P>
    <P>The Government are determined to ensure that the benefits of the National Development Plan and complementary operational programmes will be distributed equitable and on a balanced basis throughout the country which will set our economy and society on a course of increased prosperity and justice for all. I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>I really must protest.  I cannot understand why you do not feel it is not covered by Standing Order 29.  It is extremely urgent.  In view of the fact that it comes into effect on 15 May it means that, as and from now, people wishing to export from the port of Waterford will be considering other options, namely, Dublin, Cork and perhaps Belfast.  They are engaged in forward planning and Waterford is extremely vulnerable in this situation and there is tremendous local concern and anxiety.

    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>May I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, for her extensive and lengthy presentation here this afternoon which was very valuable because the National Development Plan interests every thinking person in the country and is of extreme importance.  It is probably the most significant and important measure which will affect the livelihood, the wellbeing and, of course, the economy and the infrastructure of this country this century and, of course, into the next century. The Minister, in explaining, outlining and giving an analysis of the plan, also engaged in an eloquent rebuttal of many <Col N="940" /> of the criticisms of the plan which surfaced both from the time the process got under way and also following the publication of the plan.  I listened with interest to what she had to say and her arguments, although they had merit, nevertheless will not deter me from making those criticisms and from engaging in a counter-rebuttal of many of the points which she made.</P>
      <P>At the outset I would like to express my extreme disappointment that the <i>National Development Plan, 1989-93</i>, was not debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas prior to its submission to Brussels.  It would have been possible to do this if the Government had wished it to be so and it would have meant that Members of the Dáil and Seanad from all sides could have given a valuable insight and input into the plan and, as such, when it was presented to the Commission in Brussels it would have been more truly democratic.  I intend to make the argument that, in fact, it has failed in the area of being truly democratic and truly reflective of all strands of public opinion in this country and, as such, this gives cause for concern.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister must answer an important question.  She did advert to it in her speech but I would like her, if she is responding to this debate, to say if at this stage there is any room for dissent, any room for constructively and rationally voiced inputs, any room for change or amendments or improvements.  She did say that these kinds of inputs would be listened to, but I just wonder at this stage if they would actually affect issues such as the timing of the implementation of any particular measures in any special region.  Will such inputs be invited?  There is an important distinction to be made between saying we will take inputs and we will accept criticisms or constructive suggestions, but will such be invited by public advertisements in the national press and will they be actively sought?  I think it is important to make that distinction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that there would be an attempt at giving a veneer of democracy to an exercise that, in my view and in <Col N="941" /> the view of my party, has lacked real democratic input from day one.  Many people who care about local democracy and who believe in the necessity of making the regions active and dynamic and working feel that this Government have made a mockery of local democracy in the manner in which they have dealt with the <i>National Development Plan</i> which has now been submitted to Brussels.</P>
    <P>Seven regional working parties and advisory groups were set up and it emerged this week that the national plan was completed and forwarded to Brussels incorporating proposed regional plans prior to some of these seven regions actually submitting their final reports.  The Minister in her speech refers to the fact that the working groups &ldquo;had essentially completed their reports.&rdquo;  I would like to know what &ldquo;essentially&rdquo; means.  Have they completed their reports or have they not and were these reports part of the submission that was finally submitted to Brussels?  I think there should be no pussy-footing on this issue.  I want a plain and unequivocal answer as to whether this has been the case.</P>
    <P>We urgently need informed debate, and to do this would have been so helpful to everybody, particularly people in the regions, if they had got the reports of the regional groups and if they had been able to debate them in their local fora, be that their local council, the chamber of commerce or any other area where people congregate to debate infrastructural requirements and something as important and as significant as this national plan.</P>
    <P>As an illustration of what has happened I would refer to the fact that at this month's meeting of Waterford City Council the national plan came up for discussion.  In fact, due to pressure of business we adjourned the discussion on it until next month, but we were going to do this in the context of not having the final report of the working groups laid before us for debate.  This concerned our area.  This was about out infrastructure, this was about major projects which were going to receive funding in our region and <Col N="942" /> I think it is only a most basic requirement that the fruits of the advisory groups and of the working parties should be laid before the local authority.  I am extremely disappointed that this has not been the case.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister when she is replying to indicate if these final reports from the working groups will ever see the light of day, will they be published and will we have an opportunity to digest them even at this very late hour.</P>
    <P>I think it is important at this stage to make a plea for the regions.  The Minister said that when my party was in Coalition Government it did very little in this area. I do not intend to develop that particular point, but I think we did not quite have the opportunity which the Minister's Government have to involve the regions in such a valuable and important exercise. I am sure they regret now that they abolished the regional development organisations which could have been so very valuable indeed in giving data and inputs and information when establishing regional and local priorities.  These regional development organisations had a tremendous wealth of expertise and information and indeed statistical data garnered over a long period of time.  It seems a very great pity that their premature demise meant that they did not have the significant and important inputs which would have helped this <i>National Development Plan.</i></P>
    <P>I may be accused of being provocative, but I am going to proceed in any event. The effectiveness of regional development programmes must involve a strengthening of the role of the local authorities. I am going to briefly advert to Denmark, which currently earns the second highest national output per head of population in the EC after Luxembourg. I praise the fact that Denmark has followed the pattern of administrative decentralisation and I would wish to see such a move in progress here.  I do feel that we missed an opportunity to do this.  In fact, Denmark and its recovery from fiscal problems is often held up as an example to us here in Ireland.  What <Col N="943" /> they have done with their local government and regional structures could be similarly held up as an example and we could well examine what they have done and seek to emulate it.</P>
    <P>The programme of change in Denmark was introduced on a gradual basis throughout the seventies.  It began with boundary changes and new local authorities in April 1970.  There are now 273 local authorities and 14 regional authorities for a country with a population of just over five million and where the authorities below the level of central Government levy and collect about one-third of all public revenue.</P>
    <P>The question for Ireland might well be whether or not the advocates of balanced local and regional development are willing to accept the reality of a fundamental restructuring of public revenue as well as of public expenditure.  In other words, will the people accept the return of broadly based taxing power to the local authorities?  All of these issues were very meaningful in the context of our EC Structural Funds.  There should have been public debate about this at the time and we should have moved in the direction of giving more autonomy and power, dignity and status to the regions, who craved this.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for the Minister to talk about the taskforce and the excellent relations between the taskforce on the one hand and the Taoiseach and the Commission and the Ministers and everybody involved in the National Development Plan.  What about the grassroots? What about where it all begins?  Why were they not given more real ability to take part in this tremendous debate?</P>
    <P>I was really rather sad to see a list of local communities in, I think, the Dublin area who has put together an alternative set of priorities and proposals to the National Development Plan, and who published their report recently.  I am not cynical.  I do respect the rights of groups of people to come forward.  However, I really did feel that in this event it was a classic demonstration of the powerlessness of people.  They had, in fact, <Col N="944" /> been reduced to this powerlessness by the unthinking centralised attitude of the current Administration who virtually ignored the wishes of such groups and such people to come forward.</P>
    <P>The publication of this plan has been a major disappointment to such groups of people.  The European aspiration of getting local communities to identify their own priorities and involving them in the planning process has been neutralised by what I believe to be an arrogant attitude on the part of Government, a Government who have little faith in and no commitment to local democracy, as evidenced by the structures under which this plan proceeded.  The failure of the Government to provide within the plan the establishment of both local and regional monitoring mechanisms, such as those proposed by my party, Fine Gael, to review the progress of the plan and to assess whether its specific objectives are being attained is a clear indicator that this Government have little faith in their own proposals and are unwilling to be truly accountable both locally and nationally for their implementation.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the Government have dealt with the national plan in the past two weeks has confirmed all the worries raised by Fine Gael and concerns expressed in the months leading up to the publication of the plan were clearly proved to be correct.  It is quite obvious that the consultative exercise the Government are engaged in has been merely a cosmetic affair to try to convince the Commission that the plan genuinely contains a regional input.  I know the Minister explained that in the language of the plan the word &ldquo;region&rdquo; means Ireland as one region, but nevertheless a sensitive, caring Government would have ensured a greater regional input.  I think it is hiding behind words, it is a convenience and it is an excuse to refer to the fact that the language of the various documents surrounding it when they use &ldquo;regional&rdquo; in fact mean the national Government because Ireland is a region.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that a party like Fianna Fáil, who pride themselves on their strong grassroots affiliations, would have <Col N="945" /> been so insensitive to the regions.  I have heard criticisms voiced and whispered from Fianna Fáil public representatives at local level who are dismayed and who dislike the fact that they have been made to appear so compliant at local level and that their inputs have largely been ignored.</P>
    <P>From discussions I have had with many of those who have been involved in some of the regional groupings, I know there is a great feeling of frustration and annoyance at the manner in which they have been treated and their contribution at regional level disregarded.  We must remember that very many of these people, members of the Confederation of Irish Industry and the chambers of commerce and all the other worthy groupings who were considered for invitation to be on the advisory groups and the working parties gave up their time freely and voluntarily.  They were enthusiastic, they were committed, they wished to make meaningful inputs to the plan, but even many of them at this stage feel that it was largely a cosmetic exercise and something of a veneer.</P>
    <P>The plan as published does not contain any real new contribution of Government policy to the development of our economy and it fails to provide a basis for tackling the major problems of unemployment and emigration with which we are confronted.  In its central analysis the plan acknowledges that &ldquo;the most significant reason for high Irish transport costs is the deficient state of the national roads and the access roads to the principal ports and airports&rdquo;.  The Government in the plan state that to bring our road network up to European standards an investment of £3.27 billion is required.  Over the five-year programme period from 1989 to 1993 the plan provides for an expenditure only of £755 million for the national road network and that is only 23 per cent of the needs to be met by the end of the Government's projected programme.</P>
    <P>It is clear therefore that, on the basis of the Government's own figures, major road infrastructural improvements required to enable us to compete on equal <Col N="946" /> terms within a Single European Market will not be completed this side of the year 2000.  While I recognise the fact that certain major routes were specifically mentioned by name, I feel there is an obsessive secrecy about letting everybody know what the roads priority is and I contend that this secrecy and this unwillingness, stated unwillingness, by the Minister for the Environment to show his hand on this is directly related to the economic points I have just made about the funding.</P>
    <P>An essential prerequisite to the obtaining of Community funding is the principle of additionality, that is, funds coming from Europe cannot be used as a substitute for domestic expenditure.  It appears from the detail of the roads programme that the Government may have considerable difficulties with the European Commission in this area in the context of the inadequate provisions made for roads, whereas the State's own contribution to national roads from capital expenditure will be a sum of £76.2 million in 1989 under the terms of the plan.  In the year 1990 it reduces to a sum of £39.4 million; in the year 1991, it will be a sum of £40 million; in 1992, it will be £43.9 million; and in 1993, £49.2 million.  In each of those years it is projected that increased sums for road building will come from the European Regional Development Fund and, having regard to the reduced national contribution for national roads from the year 1990 onwards, considerable doubt must arise as to whether the level of funding the Government are seeking for road building from the European Community will be made available to us.  I would like the Minister to expand on those points when she is replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>While the plan states one of its objectives to be &ldquo;to stimulate the growth needed to reduce unemployment&rdquo;, it contains no specific details of any Government provision to tackle the problems of youth unemployment or long-term unemployment.  No attempt is made to compare the effects on employment of economic activity which may result from different types of investment options.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="947" /> I have already referred to the inadequacies of the roads programme.  Even if we stay within the parameters of the Government's projected financial contribution to the structural programme, it is possible by a rearranging of allocations to increase the potential funds that could come from Europe and which would contribute to tackling employment problems. For example, if one-third of the State moneys allocated to each of the years 1989 to 1993 for FÁS temporary employment schemes were taken out of that subhead and put into the national roads programme the resultant addition of £80 million to that programme would create the potential of an additional £240 million being made available for roads from the Regional Fund.  This would only result in a reduction from the European Community Social Fund contribution of some £13 million.  Not only would this make a further contribution towards bringing our road infrastructure up to the necessary standard; it would be an investment in the creation of real jobs as opposed to temporary employment schemes, which we all know have certain major disadvantages and which are largely a palliative exercise.</P>
    <P>The roads proposal cannot be left without commenting on the extraordinary refusal of the Government still to publish its blueprint for road development, and I have already referred to this.  As I have said, it is part of the obsessive secrecy which has surrounded the whole process and I hope that the Minister can come clean on it at the conclusion of this debate.  People want to know.  For example, in the south-east and in Waterford we are planning major port development and it is vital for us to know about funding for routes to and from the port to enable the development to have any real meaning in infrastructural terms. Whereas the plan states the projected capital expenditure on roads programmes from 1989 to 1993 and reveals some details of the major road infrastructural works to be undertaken, the exact specifics for proposed roadworks in each of the seven regions still remain a secret. <Col N="948" /> We are entitled to know.  I see no valid reason why there should be such secrecy about something so vital, so necessary and so unworthy of keeping secrets about.  It seems the Government believe that in some way the security of the State might be endangered if the roads plans are revealed.  The blueprint for road development should immediately be published and should have been published last autumn, when I believe it was finalished in the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>I would like to make some references to the enormous gaps that occur in the plan with reference to environmental issues and problems.  It does give a tacit recognition to the protection and conservation of the physical environment as being &ldquo;an essential ingredient of the Irish tourism product&rdquo;, but it fails to acknowledge the essential need for a clean environment for all of us who live on this island.  This notion of equating environmental improvement with tourism, quite frankly, makes me feel ill.  In the first instance, it is important that we tackle all our environmental problems on the basis that we, the Irish people, who live here all the time want to do so in a clean, healthy, environmentally satisfactory way.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed that the emphasis in the plan should be on tourism rather than on the importance of the clean environment for its own sake, Whereas European Community legislation requires environmental impact assessment reports to be prepared for major development proposals, such as the building of pharmaceutical or chemical plants, this Government still do not realise that many local authorities sadly lack the necessary expetise to validate and adjudicate on environmental assessment reports when they come before them.  Of course, this was raised and debated very strongly indeed in relation to the pharmaceutical plant in east Cork.</P>
    <P>Although the plan refers to the fact that Dublin suffers an air pollution problem, no mention is made as to what steps the Government propose taking to tackle the serious smog problem experienced in <Col N="949" /> Dublin.  Those of us who visit Dublin, because we must do so, are in no doubt as to the reality of the smog and its deleterious effects on the health and wellbeing of many people, particularly the elderly and those with allergy and chest conditions.  The current approach adopted by the Minister for the Environment means that it will take decades before the problem is resolved.</P>
    <P>The need to tackle inner-city problems is acknowledged in the plan, but no specific proposals are contained in it to do anything about this problem, although considerable details on this appear to be contained in the Dublin consultants' report, which leaked report got into the press and gave all of us who are interested in this some idea of the actual, as opposed to the presentational, aspects of the national plan.</P>
    <P>The question must be asked; is this a national development plan?  Is it, as has been stated by the Taoiseach, a detailed multi-annual development budget?  We in Fine Gael believe it to be a predictable, pedestrian, unimaginative projection of the public capital programme over the years 1989 to 1993 involving £3.8 billion of expenditure by public and local bodies in this country, £3.7 billion of projected or expected expenditure from EC Structural Funds and the expectation of £2.1 billion of expenditure from the private sector.  In fact, the expenditure as set out in this document implies a more or less static level of capital expenditure by the State or public bodies at around the amount provided for this year.  In reality it implies a reduction in real terms in the level of the State's contribution to capital formation over the five years.  The projected increases come from the EC Structural Funds and from the private sector and, therefore, the plan does not incorporate any Government initiatives or fresh thinking of a developmental nature.</P>
    <P>I would like to make reference to the area of jobs and employment, which is surely perhaps the most pressing problem which we are confronting.  The Government project a gross increase in jobs available in Ireland over the five years of between 29,000 and 35,000 per annum. <Col N="950" /> There is an in-built assumption in this, there is an acceptance that the present high levels of emigration will continue. This is assumed and built into the plan, and it horrifies me to think that this is the case.  There is also an expectation of a continuance of a high level of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The most recently published unemployment figures for all 12 member states, based on an internationally recognised standard definition, relate to April 1987.  These show that Ireland has an unemployment rate of 19.4 per cent, which is significantly more than six times that of the country with lowest unemployment, that is, Luxembourg, at 3.1 per cent.  Ireland's unemployment is not far short of twice that of the EC average and surely the plan must indicate more clearly what it is going to do on the jobs front and how it is going to proceed.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a brief reference to my own area of the south-east and, in particular, Waterford.  I urge the Minister and those in her Department to take careful note of the Waterford Economic Board's commissioned report by Reid, McHugh and partners, which sets the priorities for Waterford and which will be presented to the Commission in Brussels, I understand, at some future date. Much of what is in that report has, I hope, formed part of the proposals which have gone to Brussels already because they would have been part of the working group and the advisory groups' inputs.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see that the <i>National Development Plan</i> recognises that the port of Waterford is of significance and that our airport, which is the only such regional airport in the south-east, is to be considered for funding.  I am also pleased to see mention of development of educational facilities, in particular third-level educational facilities, and to technology parks.  That concept of a technology park appears to becoming more and more diffuse and I am concerned about that.  I have noticed a certain change in language surrounding it; it is now being referred to as a technology complex and there are certain suggestions that elements of it <Col N="951" /> might surface in, for example, Wexford or Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>We need a technology park in the south-east and the best possible place to site it is in Waterford where we have a third level facility, the regional college in which is the biggest regional college in the country and the one giving the most number of degrees and diplomas to students. It has the highest growth level and the obvious logical place to site a technology park is in Waterford city, the capital of the south-east region.  I would be very interested to hear what the Minister has to say when she comments on the debate here.</P>
    <P>One of the things we need to know &mdash; I have mentioned it already &mdash; is which roads in our area will receive funding under this plan.  We have a £15 million port development project which has gone to Brussels and quite obviously we need to ensure that the roads servicing this port are up to standard and will take the heavy burden of traffic which they must undoubtedly bear.  I understand why Governments, and indeed bureaucrats, do not like getting into specifics; it rather ties the hands and in the context of a Euro election I suspect &mdash; and I hope I am proved wrong &mdash; that certain announcements about roads and certain specifics like that might just be made gradually, dripped out over a period in the run-up to the European election.  I hate to see politics having something to do with something as important as the National Development Plan and I hope the Minister will indicate that there will be an announcement or, indeed, no announcement perhaps until after the European elections to allay my, perhaps unkind, suspicions in that area.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister, coming from the west, would be interested to know that Comhdháil na hOileán, the Federation of Islands, have expressed their deep unhappiness about what they consider to be brief, vague and ambiguous references to off shore islands in the National Development Plan, which has been submitted to the Commission.  Comhdháil na hOileán stated that they just got a mere <Col N="952" /> one mention in subsection (5) of the plan, covering Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, and that it virtually ignores the tourist potential of the islands in this region and the fact that the Government have a commitment to their populace.  I will leave it to other members of the Fine Gael Seanad group to take up this issue, Members who come from the west, and who can perhaps more adequately than I, voice the obvious dismay and unhappiness of Comhdháil na hOileán on this ignoring of their vital contribution to tourism.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Community support framework and I was interested in getting the information on that.  There is a case to be made for explaining more to the people what will happen now that the plan has been published and, of course, submitted to Brussels. Everybody should know what the Community support framework is, they should be aware of it and they should know how it will operate.  My understanding is that when the development plan is submitted to the EC Commission, the Commission will draw up the Community support framework in consultation with the Irish authorities and the Minister has dealt with that in her contribution.  The system will indicate the level of assistance which will be available from the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>Those people who have, in fact, inserted particular programmes and plans into various elements want to know how soon they will have an indication as to whether their particular project will be funded.  Many of them have invested large sums of money in obtaining consultants' reports and in laying very detailed specifications before the advisory groups and the working parties.  They are all eagerly and anxiously looking to Government and Brussels, wondering how speedily they will get a response as to whether their particular projects will be favoured with funding so that they can harness their dreams to reality or go away and lick their wounds and think of something else.  Basically it amounts to that. People are entitled to know, not necessarily the answer at this stage, but at least <Col N="953" /> when the answers will be forthcoming. That is extremely important.</P>
    <P>I think I have just about used up my quota of time.  I will end by saying that I do not make my criticisms in any churlish or negative fashion.  I want to be constructive. My party recognise the significance and the importance of this particular development, but the plan is short on substantive detail and there is not need for the obsessive secrecy about which I have spoken.  I look forward to hearing what other speakers have to say about this.  I am sorry that the worries and the concerns of the Fine Gael Party have, in fact, been justified, as I have pointed out.</P>
    <P>There is one other thing I would like to have answered in the reply to the debate, that is, in the monitoring and follow-up groups, will those who took part in what I consider a sham consultative process be given any role to play in the monitoring situation, or who is it envisaged will be involved in that?  I think the Minister said it was a bit too early to say, but even at this stage some indication would be useful and helpful.  I thank the Minister and conclude what I wish to say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I welcome to the House the other Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and will comment on the address which we have had from Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn. I have heard her speak many times on this particular issue and certainly she is an expert in her field.  We have heard today another outstanding contribution from her on this plan.  Indeed, as the introduction to the plan states, it sets out the structural measures which Ireland proposes to implement over the next five years in conjunction with the European Community Structural Funds with a view to achieving the national and the Community's greater economic and social cohesion, to which the Minister of State referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Single European Act clearly recognised the need for greater and more active cohesive policies in the EC.  The consequence of this was the reform and the expansion of the Structural Funds as <Col N="954" /> one of the ways towards greater cohesion in the future.  Some of those decisions included the doubling of the fund's contribution to the less developed regions by 1992.  The needs and objectives of each individual sub-region are noted and in this way, despite what Senator Bulbulia indicated, every part of the country will benefit in the planned development.</P>
    <P>I welcome and I have been impressed by the fact that there is a regional input in the plan and that the needs and aspirations of the various different regions are addressed.  Quite honestly, in Senator Bulbulia's contribution I was somewhat surprised to hear her comments regarding her own city corporation because in my county council we have had many meetings with out county manager.  He was a member of the working grouping and our chairman was a member of the advisory committee and after each of the various regions meetings our manager reported back to the council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Senator see the final working plan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the county and the city managers were all part of the working groups.  They were asked specifically by the Minister of State, when she addressed their inaugural meeting to report to their elected representatives and to keep them informed during the preparation of the south regional programmes.  I know that many other local authorities acted similarly to us.  Not alone was there a submission from Westmeath County Council, there was also one from the Westmeath VEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, my plan did not refer to anything prefinalisation of the final report.  There was consultation in Waterford at that level but it was the publication of the final report and the lack of action in laying it before the council that I objected to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mrs. Fallon Mrs. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I continue to make the point that we were allowed an input in the plan at a certain stage.  Certainly the <Col N="955" /> development objectives for each sub-region &mdash; they are referred to in the various chapters dealing with each of the sub-regions &mdash; are all addressed quite clearly in the plan.  While there may be some changes in emphasis from one sub-region to another, having read the plan and examined the development objectives from my own sub-region, which is sub-region 7, midlands east, I would like to think it is quite typical of the other regions.</P>
      <P>It states that the principal development objective is to promote the economic and social development of the sub-region in a balanced way, both sectorally and geographically, so as to increase economic growth and employment levels, stabilise population and reduce the gap in relation to average EC living standards while protecting and improving the physical environment. It subsequently goes on to talk about the development strategy and the various ways that this development can be identified.  It also refers to agricultural and rural development, industry and internationally traded services, marine and inland water resources, tourism and forestry, areas of importance in my own region.  As I said, each region had the opportunity of putting forward their own proposals and they were all somewhat similar.  Obviously, there is a change of emphasis from place to place but nonetheless the aspirations and needs are recognised within the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This whole process is repeated throughout the plan and the aims and objectives are identified for each of the seven sub-regions.  The general aim coming through is to ensure that Ireland takes her place in an increasingly cohesive Community providing a better economic, social and cultural life for all its citizens.  The plan must also be seen as an historic document and an agreement between the Irish Government and the European Commission to work together over the next five years to accelerate the development of the Irish economy.  The plan envisages a strategic deployment of Irish and Community resources totalling £9.1 billion over five years.  This total will <Col N="956" /> consist of £3.6 billion of public and similar expenditure.  We will have £2.1 billion of private sector expenditure and £3.4 billion from EC structural funding.  What is important here lies not in the extra investment it will generate &mdash; much of the £9.1 billion will be spent anyway &mdash; but in the co-ordinated effort it will produce to prepare our economy for the real rigours of 1992 and beyond.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism of the plan, mostly by politicians who are opposed to the Government.  I hope it is not just opposition for opposition sake. If so, that is regrettable because we are dealing with a plan of great national importance and interest.  Some of the criticisms suggest that private funding of the £2.1 billion would not be available, forgetting that private funding has been an on going process for many years.  For example, the IDA have been working exactly in this way for many years.  There are grants from Government through the IDA to encourage larger funding from outside industrialists and entrepreneurs. It is the same principle really.  I see no reason for it not working in the future through this plan.</P>
    <P>As far as the Opposition criticism is concerned, I suggest that they are very much out of touch with the widespread public approval for the Government's achievement in formulating this very positive plan for economic and social progress. Their statements, are not in line with the very favourable reception by the business and financial community and many professional commentators.  Much more important, they are at variance with the very favourable reception of the plan by the Commission.  The approach of the Irish Government has been complimented at all levels.  We have had plans in the past, <i>The Way Forward</i> in 1982 and <i>Building on Reality</i> in 1984.  These plans have not been successful and have not been milestones in terms of economic planning in this country.</P>
    <P>Critics have also called this a so-called plan, as indeed they called the Government plan of two years ago &mdash; the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>&mdash; but the consensus forged in the <i>Programme for <Col N="957" /> National Recovery</i> between the Government and the social partners has brought a prolonged period of industrial peace. Last year, for example, we lost only 132,000 man-days through 72 strikes of which only six were pay-related.  In addition, we have had the lowest number of strikes and days lost for something like 25 years.  This &mdash; and indeed other factors &mdash; arguably have laid the basis for the current economic confidence that abounds in the country.</P>
    <P>It is vital in the national interest that a similar consensus be achieved on the latest plan which probably represents Ireland's last great chance to benefit dramatically from European largesse.  In all this debate one must examine the sincerity of the EC.  I have no reason to doubt their sincerity but our performance will indeed be the acid test of the EC's self-proclaimed objectives of bringing small underdeveloped nations such as ours in line with the rest of Europe.</P>
    <P>The plan we are talking about refers to many areas of our way of life.  It is worth examining in detail some of those proposals. For example, in the area of industry and jobs, the strategy for industry calls for the creation of 20,000 new jobs per year in manufacturing and international services over the period of the plan.  In addition, there will be further spin-off jobs in the services sector.  The Minister of State, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, referred to a total of 35,000 jobs annually in 1993, that is overall general employment.  More than £3,000 million will be spent on this sector over the coming five years, of which £1,800 million is expected to come from private sources. The Government and the EC Structural Fund money will make up the remainder. The job target of about 2 per cent is actually higher than was achieved through the eighties.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the plan that industrial development policy generally is being redirected to take account of the implications of 1992.  Overall, the target set for Irish industry will be to double our market share in Europe by increasing our sales there from £2.5 billion to £4.5 billion by the mid-nineties.  Certainly that is a <Col N="958" /> daunting task but, with goodwill, it is capable of being achieved.</P>
    <P>There are major proposals for agriculture in the five year plan.  Briefly there will be £750 million investment in the food industry, including at least £300 million from the EC.  The western package as we know it is to be extended to the rest of the country.  Aid will be provided to encourage farmers to diversify into new areas of growth.  There is an emphasis on rural tourism and rural development work, all practical proposals for the farming community.</P>
    <P>The plan to generate an extra £300 million for tourism is the most significant support ever provided in this area.  The Government rightly believe &mdash; and they have being saying so for more than two years &mdash; that the cornerstone of the tourism development strategy over the period of five years will be capital investment, backed up by a new marketing scheme to promote the amenities developed with the £300 million.  In addition, the private sector are being asked to provide £130 million over the next four years.  It is expected that something like 25,000 new jobs will be created from an improving tourist scene.  Certainly the extra money will allow many hotels, for example, to improve facilities and to build leisure complexes which clearly will attract tourists to Ireland who might otherwise be put off by our weather.</P>
    <P>The development of bus and rail transport will cost £45 million of which £25 million will be from the EC.  It is important that the whole development of the fast sea freight shuttles which are talked about should be a priority for quicker and cheaper access to Europe.  In addition, £5 million is being provided for additional work on regional airports.  The seaports at Dublin, Rosslare, Waterford and Cork will receive an extra £72 million which will be very important in the Europe of the future.</P>
    <P>A sum of £9.1 billion is being provided for education of which almost £2 billion will come under the heading of social spending, half of which roughly will be paid for by the EC.  The Department of Education will continue to be the main <Col N="959" /> beneficiary under this heading, with the Government spending £300 million and the EC contributing £581 million to various projects up to 1993.  In addition, of course, there will be many training programmes.  FAS will receive a figures of £879 million and other industrial promotion agencies will receive figures in excess of £100 million.</P>
    <P>The most important feature is that our roads network is to be improved, which is good news for the motorist.  It is also good news for the construction sector due to the fact that over the five year programme a figure of £985 million will be spent.  We cannot deny the fact that we have a substandard road transport system which indeed the CII estimated is costing Irish industry some £300 million each year in extra costs.  To bring all our road network up to European Standards would, I understand, cost something like £9 billion, equal to the amount being spent under this five year programme but it is a pipedream to think we can achieve that.  Even with EC assistance and investment of the scale which we are receiving it would be a massive task.  The bulk of the sum of £775 million will be spent on upgrading the national roads network. Immediate priority, I understand, will be given to the Euro-route road from Rosslare to the Border which includes the Dublin ring road.  The road from Dublin to Galway as far as Kinnegad is to be upgraded which will be welcomed by the many people who travel from the west.  The whole emphasis on the improvement of our roads network is vital.  The opening of the Channel Tunnel makes it vital that both our internal and access transport systems should be modernised and upgraded to the highest possible standards.</P>
    <P>This plan is basically for investment which will integrate the infrastructure with the productive capacity of the economy. It will strengthen our industrial base.  It will develop comprehensive, fast and efficient transport links to our markets abroad.  It will ensure that we have modern and competitive energy, telecommunications and postal links.  It will <Col N="960" /> develop the tourist industry.  It will improve agriculture efficiency and structures with an emphasis on rural development. In addition, it will further allow for development in the fisheries, mariculture and forestry areas.  It will improve education and education training.  It will provide measures to combat long term unemployment and facilitate the integration of young people into the work-force.</P>
    <P>Despite what Senator Bulbulia said, there are no secrets in the plan.  I believe that as it moves along it can be improved. There can be criticism of the plan as it goes along if that is necessary.  I have no doubt that the Government will be only too happy as the plan moves forward to change direction and emphasis as they see fit.  That would be only right and proper.</P>
    <P>I welcome the plan as it has been well prepared and well thought out.  Fast acceleration in our economic growth is essential if we are not to become the peasants of Europe in the years ahead. The infrastructural investments will lay a foundation for faster economic growth. My sincere hope is that this will be sufficient for the Ireland of the future.  I am certain that it will usher in a period of major economic expansion for our country.  I wish the plan well and hope that it will prove very successful in the years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to discuss the <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993</i>.  As these types of Government plans go, it is quite well prepared within the particular brief of the European Community commitment and, in particular, the Council regulations for the Structural Fund.  I say &ldquo;quite well prepared&rdquo; because it is the kind of plan that the Commission in Brussels can begin to relate to in regard to Ireland.  Further down the road there will be considerable refinement of what is in the actual plan itself.  It is not a plan prepared for Irish purposes but prepared to maximise the possibilities of gaining the Community support through the <Col N="961" /> Structural Funds for Ireland's development. That is perfectly fair.  That is the business we are in.  It is the role of any Irish Government to try to prepare a plan which will achieve that objective to the greatest extent, one which seeks to redress the increasing imbalance between the better off developed central areas and the less developed more peripheral regions, such as Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that in preparing a plan for Brussels, we had to be more honest about ourselves than we had been in many Government plans and programmes in the past.  There is probably room for more honesty but, in fact, there is a grain of genuine realism and honesty running through Chapter 1, in particular in the overall analysis in Part 1 and in the sectoral analysis in Part 2.  I will just refer to a couple of examples of our willingness to point up our weaknesses.  We have to do this if Brussels is to appreciate the special case we wish to make for a higher proportion of the Structural Funds, but in doing so, we also have to realise that these are precisely the weaknesses which we, as a people, must address.  The Community can help us but these are essentially our own problems.</P>
      <P>For example, on page 17 of the plan, there is reference to the traditional sector of industry.  Let me quote the first sentence: &ldquo;The performance of the traditional sector of Irish industry has, in general, been extremely poor over many years&rdquo;.  The figures in relation to employment and so on bear that out.  On page 21, the plan refers to the fact that transport costs for Irish exporters to Europe are approximately twice those incurred by Community countries trading with one another on the European mainland and sets out our concerns, in particular, in relation to the Channel Tunnel and so on.  On page 23 of the plan, there is reference to the problems of our inner cities and I quote:</P>
      <P>Ireland has in recent years experienced serious economic and social decline of its inner cities and towns with a marked population decline and loss of economic activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="962" /> The plan refers to these places as being characterised by derelict sites and so on: in other words, it points up that problem.</P>
    <P>One of the areas of most concern to us, and the Government refer to it in the plan, should be the Irish education system.  We often pride ourselves on our education system.  We say we have a great education system and that we are preparing our young so well, even if they have to go abroad for jobs, but the plan is a bit more honest about the fact that we are not preparing our young all that marvellously well for competition in the European context of the Single Market. I think it is worth putting the two relevant paragraphs, 1.2.40 and 1.2.41, from page 23 of the plan on the record in that regard. I quote:</P>
    <P>The Irish education system provides a high level of general education.  On average, however, students leave secondary school at a relatively young age compared with other EC countries. Relatively few apprenticeships are available to school-leavers by comparison with some other Community countries.  In addition, upper secondary educational in Ireland is lacking the vocational emphasis evident in the more advanced Member States.</P>
    <P>Findings from recent labour-force surveys point to the serious lack of training and re-training of employed persons in Ireland.  This is partly attributable to the small size of businesses. The Cecchini report indicated that most small companies lack the necessary resources to acquire the skills and qualifications that will be needed in the Single Market.</P>
    <P>The plan necessarily, tactically and properly begins with an identification of the very serious and significant weaknesses, drawbacks and problems in the Irish economy and environment generally for which we make a case for Community support to create a genuine European Community where the problems of a particular region are in some part, at least, the problems of the Community as a whole.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="963" /> In specifying, in the subsequent chapters, the approach which will be adopted in relation to the various sectors, again, the plan does stick close to the objectives set out in Council Regulation 4255/88 in relation to the Structural Funds.  I think the officials dealing with the particular sectors &mdash; at the Commission end certainly &mdash; will be able to relate the relevant provisions of the Irish development plan to the relevant objectives of the Structural Funds' regulations and any allocations from the European Regional Development Fund, but that is an achievement on paper.</P>
    <P>A much more important follow-through will be to convince not just the Commission but also the Council of Ministers, which will have a very significant role in deciding on overall allocations under the Structural Funds, that not only are we able to identify our problems but that we are very realistically addressing them.  The weakest part of the plan is the analysis of the sub-regional plans &mdash; what is set out as being the seven sub-regions &mdash; and the socio-economic analysis and the proposals in relation to them.  It is much more superficial and less authoritative whereas, in fact, it should be more authoritative because it should be more possible to be authoritative than specific when you get to a sub-region.</P>
    <P>This bears out the major criticism of the plan.  It is a politicised criticism but I think it is a genuine and worrying criticism of the manner in which this plan has been prepared.  We have identified new regions for the purposes of this plan because we wanted a sub-regional component in it.  I think the Government are perfectly right in wanting a sub-regional component and that is undoubtedly important, not only at the Brussels level but also at an Irish level, but I do not think the manner in which the regions have been identified and the advisory and consultation process that has been established is at all adequate.  That does not mean it cannot be improved and strengthened at this stage.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take on board the criticisms made in this House and <Col N="964" /> in the other House about the lack of a genuine input of an authoritative sort from the ground in those regions, from the local and elected representatives, from those who normally put forward for their regions proposals that carry weight and whose views and whose knowledge of their regions must be tapped and harnessed and who must come in in support of this plan.  I do not think that has happened and is the major defect.</P>
    <P>I would certainly urge the Government to take stock of the major criticism of this plan.  What is the major criticism?  The major criticism is that at the sub-regional level there has been genuine consultation with those who are normally, through their local authorities and other regional existing bodies, in a position to have an influence and to exert that influence.  It is extremely important that the sub-regional plans set out in Chapter 6 be used as drafts to be discussed further in the regions with a view to refining and gaining broad-based support for genuine sub-regional plans.  I submit that is perfectly feasible both in the context of this overall <i>National Development Plan</i> and within the timescale provided.</P>
    <P>It would be important, if there were to be a more open and democratic debate at the sub-regional level about the development plan now that the initial plan has been published, that there be more openness about specific proposals. It is very important that the elected representatives of the regions be made fully aware of each step in the further development of the plan at Community level and, in particular, have an opportunity to participate in any monitoring and follow-up groups that may be established.</P>
    <P>As I said, this is not an Irish plan, purely for Irish purposes, it is primarily a plan prepared to gain the maximum support and advantages from the European Community Structural Funds.  Page 10 carries an enormous <i>caveat</i> as to what the plan is going to entail.  It is clearly stated that commitments to spending on structural measures of the nature and scale envisaged in this plan will be dependent on the volume and phasing of Community aid and on the rate at which that <Col N="965" /> aid will be made available for particular programmes or projects.  It is also stated that the Government look forward to a productive dialogue with the Commission on these matters in settling, by agreement, the Community's Support Framework, as provided for in the Structural Fund regulations.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Government being in dialogue with the Commission on that front, it is extremely important that there be open lines of communication with the representatives of the sub-regions and that a better structure of participation be developed for the more important stage, implementation, once an overall framework has been agreed and once an overall figure under different sectors has been placed on what the Community level of support will be.  That requires full and broad-based participation and support at sub-regional level.  Because this is a plan for the purposes of availing of Europeans Community Structural Funds, it is very important that it receives broad-based support and participation, particularly at sub-regional level, in order to attain one of the objectives which is to improve the social face of the Community sometimes summarised as being social Europe. Implicit in any concept of a social Europe is participatory Europe, that regions and sub-regions know what the plans are and have effective opportunities to participate in their implementation.</P>
    <P>I would welcome receiving some further commitment from the Minister, when replying to the debate, to outline what the programme of follow-up will be, the participation in any monitoring groups that may be established, the information flow which will be available, and what steps may be taken at this stage to involve elected representatives and local authorities in the sub-regions directly in the further fleshing out and development of <i>The National Development Plan.</i> Although the focus of the plan is on identifying areas which can look for support, partly from Irish sources but also importantly from the Community Structural Funds, it is also important that this development plan be matched with a national awareness of the need to be <Col N="966" /> more efficient in implementing the other commitments of the Single European Market for 1992.  I am thinking in particular of the need to ensure that our legislative programme, for example, is one which matches the commitment of being prepared for 1992.</P>
    <P>There is concern that we are already falling behind quite seriously in significant areas of the legislative programme for 1992.  Let me mention a couple of examples, some which have already been debated in this House.  For example, we have not implemented the directive on product liability although we were obliged to do so by the end of July of last year.  An important regulation will come into force this July on the European economic grouping, a new legal entity which particularly fosters joint ventures across borders, between Irish industry and industries in other member states. We have made no step to implement it. I do not know whether a Bill has been prepared or what the plans are but it comes into effect at Community level on 1 July.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other areas where we do not appear to be equipping ourselves to be ready for the legal and technical changes which are being brought about by the internal market programme. That is a slightly different focus from the focus of the <i>National Development Plan</i>, which is on the allocation the Structural Funds, the objectives to be achieved and the amounts which it is envisaged will be sought.  It is all part of preparing ourselves for the immense challenge this country will face.  All the component should go together in a parallel way, and we should ensure that we are ready to face the extraordinary and, indeed, very worrying challenge of the Single Market.</P>
    <P>I was very interested when somebody whose views I respect very much said to me in relation to the Irish Centre for European Law, which I have been much involved with, as the Cathaoirleach is aware, that there is a great deal of discussion at the moment, along with a number of conferences, about the Single Market of 1992, that everybody is talking <Col N="967" /> about 1992 in some way or other, but we are not scared enough yet.  This person said that until we are really scared of 1992 we will not have understood it.  That was a rather chilling point to make.</P>
    <P>This plan is trying to cover us to some extent, perhaps in the realisation that we have good reason in a number of areas to be very scared, but if we are scared enough we will run faster and try harder to compensate for the dislocations and chellenges of the wider market on a small country like this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the <i>National Development Plan</i>, which sets out the structural measures Ireland proposes to implement over the next five years.  Its aim is to improve the economic and social life of this country and get us ready for 1992.  The Single European Act recognised the need for more active cohension policies in the European Community. Subsequently, the European Council took the decision on the reform and expansion of the Structural Funds as one of the steps towards cohension.  The decision included a doubling of the funds to the less developed regions by 1992, together with the special efforts to be undertaken for the least prosperous regions, which include Ireland.  This decision will make it possible to provide a real injection of funds to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been agreed that the operational programmes will deal with industrial development, tourism, roads, transport, including air and sea freight, seaports, airports, rails and bus, energy, sanitation, telecommunications and postal services, educational training and employment, agricultural and rural development.  The country has been divided into seven regions.  Country Derry had the unique distinction of being divided into two parts on the formation of the new regions.  The constituency of Kerry North has been included in the Shannon development region, better known as the mid-west region.  This region has a population of 400,000 and a very high unemployment rate.  In the past the Kerry North constituency was included in the south-west <Col N="968" /> region, comprising countries Cork and Kerry.  Despite criticism from some people outside the area we in north Kerry are delighted that the area is to be included in the mid-west region as we feel we will fare much better in that region, which&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That leads me on to another part of the Cathaoirleach's area, the Shannon estuary.  The IDA have never encouraged industrialists to set up along the Shannon estuary.  Now that the area is to be included in the Shannon development region we are very hopeful that there will be great development along the Shannon estuary, especially along the Kerry senction.  In the Kerry section of the Shannon estuary, from Ballylongford to Tarbert, the IDA and the Shannon development company own 700 acres of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deepest waters in the Shannon estuary, the deepest estuary in Europe, are along this section.  It has one of the best and most sheltered ports in Europe, with plenty of room for ships to turn and anchor.  In some of the European ports there is very little room for big bots to do that and as we are all aware there is great congestion in some of the ports there.  There is great potential in this area for heavy industry and properly developed ports.  Harbours and jetties will be essential in order to attract big industries.  I am delighted to note that the south-west region have drawn up a very complete plan, having taken great notice of the Shannon estuary, with a view to developing ports and industry.  As I said, there is great potential in the area for fishing, deep sea fishing drift netting, draft netting and rod fishing.  I notice a Chathaoirligh, that you are smiling; you <Col N="969" /> know the Shannon estuary area as well as I do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>Structural Funds will be needed to our ports and harbours for fishing and industry and the tremendous potential of marinas in that area has to be tapped.  We are hoping to develop marinas at Kilrus, where work has just commenced, at Salins pier, at Ballylongford, Fenit in the north Kerry area and Dingle.  It should be possible to go from one marina to another and they should also help to attract many tourists to the area.  The development of marinas has been mentioned in the plan.</P>
      <P>This region is a natural for developing our tourist business.  We have the best beaches in the world and we will have to get Structural Funds to develop our outdoor recreation centres and outdoor pursuit activities.  I know quite well that SFADCo were actively involved prior to the plan being drawn up, with a view to developing the tourist business in that area and getting Structural Funds from Europe.  We also have some of the best golf courses in the world which will have to be properly promoted and developed for the future.  The golf course in Ballybunion and the new one in Tralee, my home town are two of the best golf courses in the world and have attracted many tourists.  With further development they will attract many more tourists in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We has some tremendous historical monuments in this region and I am glad to say that £500,000 was allocated recently to preserve the very historic abbey in Ardfert.  Kerry is one of the few countries in Ireland with tremendous <Col N="970" /> horse-racing facilities.  It is one of three countries with three courses, Listowel, Tralee and Killarney.  It is tremendous to have such facilities in an area as they attract many tourists.</P>
    <P>The rular environment has takes, forests plus many forest walks.  These are a tremendous tourist resource.  It is the intention to increase the number of tourists visiting that area from 400,000 to 800,000 thereby increasing revenue from £60 to £135 by 1993.</P>
    <P>The national plans states that there will be substantial investment in agriculture. The anticipated investment is £1,428 million &mdash; £416 million from our Governnment, £344 million from the private sector and £688 million from the EC.  We are hopeful that these funds will be made available from the EC from the structural Funds.  The western package measures for farmyard pollution, animal housing and fodder storage will be extended to all the country.  A new agricultural-tourism grants will be made available to farmers to encourage them to get into agri-tourism This development will be welcomed by most of the agricultural community in the country.  The plan requests substantial grants to be made available for marketing and processing and an increase in the FEOGA grant.</P>
    <P>Quite recently in Country Kerry the IDA invested £4.5 million in Kerry Coop. This is the type of investment in agriculture we like to see and we are hopeful that extra money will be made available for agriculture in the mid-west region, especially for the north Kerry, which is a great dairying area.  This investment marked the first occasion on which the IDA took out equity in as agricultural co-op, £1.5 million in equity along with a grant of £3 million.  The rates of headage payments are to be increased gradually over a period and there are plans to diversify into horticulture, horses and on-farm food processing.</P>
    <P>In the plan our national primary roads and second national primary roads get considerable mention. Road development is very important to our nation, especially the national primary roads and <Col N="971" /> the second national primary roads.  They need a big injection of capital.  Indeed, this has been mentioned in the National Development plan.  We are seeking further substantial funds for the development of the roads I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I also notice in the plan that there is provision for an air channel.  This is something that is very important and something that is very dear to my heart. Shannon Airport is in the region and in my area we have Kerry Country Airport, which is now being extended.  We are very hopeful than in the future Structural Grants will be made available to improve that airport.  We hope it will bring any more tourists from the Continent into County Kerry and visitors who will do some fishing in County Kerry or play golf.  We are also hopeful that the airport which is being extended will be very beneficial to freight exporters.  Strange as it might seem, an industry came to a town in County Kerry just one week ago and they said the reason they came to County Kerry was because there was a substantial airport being developed there.  For industrial purposes it is important that we have airports in all our countries, or at least in most of our countries.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised at Senator Bulbulis and Senator Robinson saying there was lack of consultation.  I do not know about that.  They are living in different regions to me.  In the south-west region of which you are familiar, a Cathaoirligh, in country Kerry we had two specially, convened meetings of Kerry and they had dis-Council to discuss the national plan.  The Shannon development company came down to north Kerry and they had discussion with the two urban councils in that area.  They had discussions with the boat club members with the chamber of commerce in each of the towns and with all the development associations with a view to development of north Kerry.  I am rather surprised at people standing up and saying there was no prior consultation. Perhaps in their region there was a lack of consultation because they did not ask for it or because their local authority members were not active <Col N="972" /> enough to ensure that there was adequate discussion.</P>
    <P>There was a adequate discussion in County Kerry about this development plan.  I think that is as it should be.  I attended many of the meetings with the Shannon development company when they met Tralee and Fenit Harbour Boards.  We discussed projects which might be included in the plan delighted to say we got a very good hearing from them.  We are all very happy in my constituency.</P>
    <P>I am also delighted to say that I heard the mid-west region that is, the region of the Shannon development company, had a better plan submitted than any of the other six regions.  Indeed, I suppose that is why I can talk so eloquently on the way the Shannon development company handled the north Kerry constituency.  To my mind this is a tremendous plan.  It is very well thought out.  It was very well received in Europe and generally, it was well received by the general public and by the business people of this country.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how some of the Opposition parties are so critical of it especially when some of those parties, that is the Fine Gael Party and Labour party, were in power just two years ago and made a mess of running the country. They did not draw up any plan for us. They did draw up a plan for us all right &mdash; a plan which nearly bankrupted the country.  At that time they increased our borrowings from £11up to £25 billion.  Unfortunately for us we had to face a repayment of £2 billion in principal and interest last year on those loans taken out by the Coalition Government.  We had to pay back £244 million of that loan. I cannot see why they are cribbing about a plan which we have drawn up to get more funds from Europe, which I think will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>This is an excellent plan drawn up to get extra funds from Europe for the next five years, funds which are urgently needed to develop our country and to get us ready for 1992.  The plan is also anticipated to create 35,000 jobs per annum.  I am quite there will be a lot of promoting from the senior people in <Col N="973" /> Government to encourage the European Community and the people in Brussels to give us extra funds.  I am also quite sure we will get the funds which we anticipate. The plan was sufficient to encourage those people in Europe and to attract extra funds for the next five years.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the <i>National Development Plan</i> is the correct title for the document.  I would prefer to regard it as a document rather than a plan.  It is a document with aspirations and ideas of what might happen rather than a plan of what is going to happen.  It is not clearly spelled out that any of this is going to happen; we have to assume as we go along that what is set out in the document, as published, will happen.</P>
      <P>It is rather strange that we are here today debating this in the Seanad because this is the first opportunity we have had at this level to make an input into the plan that was submitted to Brussels on 31 March.  That date was the deadline for the submission of the plan.  Perhaps it is a case of bolting the stable door when the horse has gone.  I do not know what input we can have now or whether we are only talking about the plan or document, as published.  I do not know what effect we can have.  Various Senators, including the last speaker, mentioned today projects that should or could or might be included in the plan.  I do not know what effect our deliberations here today can have and perhaps the Minister of State, whom I welcome, might spell that out.  I am sorry the two previous Ministers of State, who are from my own area have left the House.  I wanted to have a few words with them but perhaps I will have the same few words with my good friend, the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard it and read it but I am not clear about it.  It should <Col N="974" /> be spelled out more clearly.  A deadline was set for 31 March.  If that plan has gone to Brussels now, how can we have a further input into it?  I would like that clarified.  In fact, I fail to see how the Government were so badly caught out for time.  It was obvious from the date of the Single European Act that a plan would be necessary but it was only last October or November that the regional advisory bodies were set up, dividing the country into seven regions.  They were asked to meet a deadline of 31 March to report back.  That was giving them inadequate time for the necessary preparation and for the involvement of communities in arranging projects for inclusion in the programme.</P>
      <P>The Government apparently did not set up those advisory bodies until the end of last year, which left very little time for any proper input.  At that stage the country was divided into seven regions. The region which I represent included Counties Mayo, Galway and Roscommon. The advisory body in that area was made up of the three county managers, five or six heads of semi-State bodies in the region, and four or five officials from the Department of Finance.  That was the advisory body set up in our region to advise on the projects that might be included in the overall programme. Despite what other Senators said, not one elected representative was in sight. There were of course, advisory bodies set up also to advise this working body, as it was called.  Those advisory bodies did have representations.  They had the chairmen of the local authorities on them but from the reports which came back it is quite clear that those bodies had very little input in the plan.  They realised that after a short period of time.</P>
      <P>I notice the speech of the Minister of State, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, that she referred to exactly what I am talking about myself.  She said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In preparing the Plan, the Government carried out an unprecedented level of consultation at both national and local regional level.  At national level the Central Review Committee <Col N="975" /> under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was consulted: this is, of course, representative of the major national economic organisation including farmers, industry, employers, trade unions and co-operatives.</P>
    <P>They were represented on the second tier, if you like, but from the direct reports which I got from those bodies, they felt they had no input whatsoever into the programme being presented.  In fact, those bodies were a cover up, if you like, although I do not like to use that word.  They were bodies that were set up to give the impression that there was a local input into the plan eventually adopted but I do not think this was the case.  This is relevant to a question asked in the Dáil by Deputy Alan Shatter, our spokesman on the environment, on 12 April 1989.  He asked the Minister for Finance what working groups and advisory groups in each of the seven designated regions of EC Structural Fund have submitted their regional reports, if such reports have not yet been submitted, the date by which it is anticipated that such reports will be received, and if he will ensure that each such regional report will be published.  The reply he received was:</P>
    <P>Interim reports, which contained all information relevant to the preparation of the National Development Plan, were submitted on behalf of the seven sub-regional working groups and advisory groups prior to the completion of the plan.</P>
    <P>The completed reports of five of the sub-regions have now been submitted. The report of a further sub-region will be submitted by the end of this week. Completion of the consultancy report on the Dublin area is continuing and is expected to be finalised later this month.  No decision has yet been taken as to whether the sub-regional reports will be published.</P>
    <P>I think it is essential that those sub-regional reports be published: otherwise how can we know what was contained in them?  How can we know whether any <Col N="976" /> account was taken of those sub-regional reports if they are not published?  It seems extraordinary to me that on 12 April two of the sub-regions had not submitted their reports.  The Government had to have their submission in Brussels before 31 March.  All that seems to indicate to me that there was no real benefit in the sub-region reports.  They could not have been taken account of because they were not submitted in time to be included in the programme that was presented.</P>
    <P>I believe from the reports I have received that the sub-bodies on the advisory groups understood that their submissions were not going to meet the target and were probably on that account not going to be taken into account. Unfortunately, the people throughout the country who were drawing up plans in various communities, community councils, etc. were not aware of this. They were drawing up plans in good faith for various projects and programmes in their areas.  Many of those community councils spent a lot of money preparing elaborate plans and brochures.  They were genuine plans for the development of their areas.  Some of those community councils spent £10,000 and more in preparing reports.  From assurances given to them by various Ministers and Ministers of State of the Government, they believed that unlimited funds were available for those type of projects.</P>
    <P>Those communities have been seriously misled.  They submitted those programmes to the working groups and to the advisory groups in the belief that they would be seriously and genuinely considered as part of the programme. Many of them will be very disappointed when they find out eventually that no finance will be available for their well thought out, well-researched, well-planned and well documented projects.  An atmosphere was created in which those community councils believed that this type of money was freely available and that their programmes would be fully taken into account.  That is a pity.</P>
    <P>I do not know when those companies will be informed of the success or otherwise of the projects submitted.  I presume <Col N="977" /> it will not be before 15 June and the European elections.  I do not know if that will have any effect on it one way or the other, but I think in fairness to those communities that they should be informed as soon as possible about the outcome of the genuine, voluntary and professional work which they put into drawing up and submitting their programmes. It is a duty of the Government to let them know as soon as possible whether they have any chance of being grant-aided.</P>
    <P>We had in our own constituency the spectacle of the Minister of State &mdash; not the Minister of State who was here this morning but the other Minister of State &mdash; attending a meeting in the Aran Islands and promising the people that they would get a roll-on roll-off ferry service.  A campaign has been going on for that for a long time in the Aran Islands.  I quote here from <i>The Irish Times:</i></P>
    <P>Comhdháil na nOileán, the Federation of Islands, has criticised the Government for its one &ldquo;brief, vague and ambiguous&rdquo; reference to the offshore islands in the <i>National Development Plan</i> submitted to the European Commission.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;one mention&rdquo;, in subsection (5) of the plan covering Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, virtually ignores the tourist potential of the islands in this region and the fact that the Government has a commitment to their populace. Mr. Coley Hernon, chairman of Comhdháil na nOileán told <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday.  Three of the seven offshore islands covered by the subsection &mdash; the Aran Islands off Galway &mdash; had 100,000 tourist alone in 1988.</P>
    <P>That is the potential that is there for tourism and development of that sort in the islands.  The tourist potential has been recognised by Board Fáilte with the appointment of a full time officer to promote the area.  However, Mr. Hernon said that it was very difficult to do this when only six of the 15 islands they represent have registered ferries.  He said that since the recent decommissioning of <Col N="978" /> the <i>Naomh Éanna</i>, the State ferry service out of Galway to the Aran Islands has been discontinued for the first time in 85 years.  That is the sorry situation of the Aran Islands.  It is an area that can freely, and without effort, attract more than 100,000 tourists in one year.  It is essential that proper services be provided for those islands and it would be a laudable and worthy project to include it in a programme. I recommend that this be done.</P>
    <P>Another project submitted from the Galway region for inclusion in the programme was the Kilbeg-Knockferry Bridge.  The Minister of State is very familiar with this.  She has been involved in the support of this project in Galway, a campaign that has been going on since I became involved in the local authority some 14 years ago.  The communities on both sides of the Corrib &mdash; on the Headford side and on the Oughterard side &mdash; are campaigning for a bridge to be erected across the narrowest point of the Corrib between Kilbeg and Knockferry, a distance of about 300 yards.  This would save a round trip by road of about 40 miles.  This has been submitted as a project for inclusion in a programme.  It would be a most ideal project for the region as it would be beneficial to Counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.  It would open up vast new areas of Connemara, linking Mayo and Galway on the east side to Connemara on the west side. It would have great potential for tourism, agricultural development and other projects.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that the Minister of State, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, would be here when I was speaking on this but I know she will take heed of what I say.  I hope she will press to have this scheme included in the programme and I will give her the honour of announcing it.  I will be the first to congratulate her when she announces that this project has been grant-aided under the programme of EC funds.  This would help enormously in the development of this under-developed area of Galway and Mayo.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost of this bridge is £2.5 million and this is small in terms of the overall plan.  Of course, there would be <Col N="979" /> the further costs of approach roads which could be dealt with separately, as there are programmes submitted for that also. For an investment of £2.5 million there would be considerable benefit to the area.</P>
    <P>On page 115 of the document there is a reference to airports.  In Galway we have the fast developing airport at Carnmore, an ideal project for grant-aid and a project which I fully recommend. There is also a proposal submitted for grant-aid for a new airport at Clifden, which is 55 miles west of Carnmore.  This project is very deserving of support.  The grant would cover the infrastructure.  It would greatly assist tourism as it would open up a whole new area.  In fact, this is a very serious project as the land has already been acquired.  Hotels, guest-houses and business people in the area have subscribed and committed themselves to 25 per cent of the cost of this project.  This airport would be very near the site where Alcock and Brown landed between Clifden and Ballyconnelly, where their Atlantic crossing ended in a bog.  This project would be very beneficial to the Connemara area.  As most people are aware, this site is adjacent to the very fine championship golf links in Ballyconnelly and would be of tremendous benefit to that area if it was included.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker spoke about the wonderful potential of tourism in his area.  The Ballyconnelly, Clifden and Roundstone area is a very well known area for tourists with its lakes, beaches and scenery.</P>
    <P>Tourism was mentioned in the plan.  I am conscious of this because I represent an area greatly dependent on tourism.  A figure of £300 million has been mentioned as the potential extra earning from that industry.  I must ask if the Government are serious about tourism promotion when they continue to persist with the stupid rod licence dispute which has cost us £20 million in tourism earning in the west?  That does not equate with the idea of trying to promote tourism through this plan and saying that another £300 million could be earned from it.  I appeal to the Minister of State, and to anybody who <Col N="980" /> can to bring an end to that farce to do something.  It is legislation which is causing much bother in the west.  An end to the rod licence dispute would be the greatest advance for tourism.  It would end the tension, division and hardship being experienced in the Galway Mask-Corrib region as a result of the imposition of the rod licence.  I make that appeal genuinely because I see the grave damage that is being done in communities.  I will not go into that now.  I do not want to make any political capital out of this if that matter is resolved by the Government.</P>
    <P>I would also pose the question: were these sub-regions put in only because it was a condition of the Commission?  It seems to me, seeing how late they were set up, that they were only put in because they were necessary.  It was not as a recognition of their real potential but to qualify because that was a condition.  It should now be clarified whether the community councils and other groups should still be following up their applications and it should be made clear when they will know if any of the projects submitted will be grant-aided.  Irrespective of any political considerations, the Government should, as soon as possible, announce the specific programmes to be grant-aided. That is the least the communities concerned deserve after the effort, time and finance they put into drawing up very extensive plans, projects and brochures for the development of their areas.  The very least those people deserve is to be told as soon as possible that they are being grant-aided or they are not being grant-aided.  I appeal to the Minister of State to give some indication of when this could be spelled out.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the reply of the Minister of State to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  Initially, in passing, I refer to some of the comments Senator McCormack has made defining the facts in relation to the sub-regions and the fact that they were set up in a rather hasty manner and that many <Col N="981" /> people were going to be extremely disappointed because many of the proposals they had made were not going to be included.  Senator McCormack proceeded then to elaborate on a number of areas where he felt developments would be very welcome and areas that should be included in the plan.  It is important to point out that with an overall plan of this nature it would not be feasible to include absolutely every single thing that would be relevant to each sub-region and each area.  Everyone would have to recognise and accept that.</P>
      <P>This plan is an overall strategy over a five year period and as such it would change the economic and social scope of development with a budget that would have been unheard of and, indeed, unimagined not all that long ago.  It is a blueprint to bring this country into the 21st century and it will enable us to put in place the mechanisms and developments that will ensure that the country will get the maximum benefit from the huge European market of 320 million people.</P>
      <P>The plan is unique in a number of ways and specifically in that it does not concentrate on one particular sector or section of the country but is comprised of a strategy for, as I have said, seven sub-regions, and is interlinked.  It provides a planned programme of development for the country as a whole and every area as a result will benefit enormously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People have questioned the huge sum of £9.1 billion and they are critical of the fact that certain suggestions and proposals will not be included.  One would feel, listening to some of the Opposition speakers talking about this, that nothing was going to be included.  I would ask a simple question: where do they think that £9.1 billion is going to be spent if all of those things are out that they are suggesting will not be included?  The plan in itself is a tripartite programme between the Government, the private sector and the European Community.  The spending of £9.1 billion of Irish and EC resources over a five-year period is proposed in the plan, which sets out the agenda.  That the Government are confident of the success of this plan can be determined by the <Col N="982" /> huge success they have had in the past two years in turning the economy around and giving the necessary confidence that we need to look forward to the challenge of 1992 with enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>The plan envisages the creation of 35,000 jobs a year and, indeed, would appear on the face of it to be somewhat conservative in this projection.  The plan has five central aims: first, the development of the entire country as a single entity but with specific planning geared towards the seven sub-regions; second, the reawakening of areas of industrial decline; third, the tackling of long-term unemployment, which I think is one of the crucial and central aspects of the whole plan; fourth, the provision of education and training to integrate young people into the workforce; and fifth, the acceleration of agricultural and rural development.  Each of those aims is in its own right extremely important.  Since we joined the European Community the quality of the Irish workforce has improved by the investment of substantial Exchequer and European Social Fund resources, but we have to acknowledge that the basic weaknesses still exist compared with other workforces.  Not many apprenticeships at present are available to school leavers by comparison with other countries and second level education should have more vocational emphasis as in the case of the more advanced EC countries.</P>
    <P>There will be a major expansion in the number of short-term unemployed people over 25 who will be given enterprise training and the plan, as has already been mentioned, envisages a total of £344 million for FAS up to 1993 for training. A public investment of £105 million in buildings and equipment in the training sector is also planned, with £3 million going to CERT in 1990 and 1991.  The existing facilities, one would have to recognise, are totally inadequate and a programme of buying equipment needs to be expanded to meet recognised deficiencies in the area of science, technology and business studies.</P>
    <P>The workforce in the future faces many changes which include the considerable <Col N="983" /> flow of young people on to the labour market and the movement from agricultural employment to industrial services employment.  Increased competition and changing patterns in demand and production caused by technological advances are huge changes that will take place as we move into the 21st century.  The objectives of education and training programmes in future will be to ensure that skilled requirements of economic development are met, to contribute to the process of job creation including self-employment, co-operatives and community enterprise.  In all, over £2 billion will be spent in education and training areas in the five years of the plan.  It is essential that our third level sector of education improve its ability to support industry in bridging the technological gap between this country and the more developed regions of the Community.</P>
    <P>In summary, the plan envisages the creation of 100,000 extra jobs in manufacturing and international services by 1993, the spending of almost £2 billion in expanded training and employment programmes, a massive £1,800 million programme for road improvements, a £1,400 million development package for farming, forestry and fishing; a £478 million investment in energy; a £369 million infrastructural investment in telecommunications by Board Telecom and a £300 million boost for tourism, as was mentioned already and welcomed by Senator McCormack.  I do recognise the great potential there is in the west for the development of tourism but I would have to say that I do not think the increase in revenue as proposed in the plan of £500 million is unrealistic because not alone in the west, but in every other sector and area of this country the potential for tourism and increasing our tourism trade is absolutely enormous.  It is a market that at the moment is wide open and the potential for increased revenue from tourism is one of the most outstanding features of the future as we move into the nineties.  There is £236 million for forestry and £72 million for the revitalisation of sea ports.  This is an <Col N="984" /> ambitious plan and the Government have delivered their part of the bargain in setting out this plan to the European Commission.</P>
    <P>I ask the Opposition parties to accept this plan as a realistic attainable programme for the next five years and to recognise it as the most important blueprint ever produced by this country.  I take this opportunity to congratulate the Taoiseach and his Government for producing such an outstanding plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBromell" hpid="Mr. Bromell Mr. Bromell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bromell</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa freisin fáilte a chur roimh an phlean náisiúnta. I ndáríre is forbairt é an plean ar an bplean eacnamaíochta a thosaigh an Rialtas nuair a tháinig siad chun oifige dhá bhliain ó shin.  D'éirigh go maith leis an Rialtas sa phlean eacnamáochta agus éireoidh go maith leo sa phlean náisiúnta chomh maith ach is gá go mbeadh ár dtacaíocht uilig acu.</P>
      <P>In welcoming this plan I will say that it really complements the National Development Plan introduced by the Government two years ago and which, to all intents and purposes and by the recognition of all, is working extremely well at present.  I think it is important that at this time we should look at the objectives of this plan.  They are set out very clearly in Chapter 2 when it says that the fundamental aim of this plan is to advance the national and Community aspiration towards greater economic and social cohesion.  To this end the plan seeks to prepare the economy to compete successfully in the internal market when it is completed in 1992, to stimulate growth and to begin to increase the <i>per capita</i> income towards the average Community levels, to improve further the state of the public finances and to accompany economic growth by a greater social dimension in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are very few who could quibble with these aims and objectives of the plan.  Indeed, at this stage it should be emphasised that no longer is this a Fianna Fáil plan; no longer is it a Government plan; it is really the plan of the Irish people and the plan of the Irish nation being presented to Brussels.  In this <Col N="985" /> regard the same consensus that we have in politics today with regard to the plan for development should exist with regard to our approach to Brussels and to Europe.  It is important that we show a united front to Europe so that this £9 billion between private, national and European funds will be got and that the implementation of the projects in the plan will be brought to completion.</P>
    <P>In a way, this is the easiest part.  This is only the beginning.  The plans, aims, objectives, desires, aspirations are all laid down here but then this has to be negotiated. It has to be negotiated as the Irish plan and by a united Ireland in Europe saying that we are behind it, that we want this plan to work, we want to bring it to conclusion and we want the benefits to accrue to our people.  The negotiations have to be brought to a successful conclusion and then the real hard work takes place with the implementation of the plan.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the Labour Party, this is probably what they had in mind in their amendment that there would be an involvement, locally as well as nationally, in the implementation of the plan.  I look forward very much to this also.  When we are talking in the context of Europe we could be on to something very good.  On the other side, we have certain disadvantages. We are on the periphery of Europe where in almost all developments the central areas get most out of economic planning.  This will be detrimental to us.  This will be like going back to the Act of Union in a way if the central areas &mdash; Brussels and Luxembourg &mdash; were to continue to improve, if the standard of living in these areas were to continue to soar while we on the periphery were left with all the disadvantages and none of the advantages of the Single European Act and of the Structural Fund.</P>
    <P>Many of the disadvantages we have are listed.  For example, being on the periphery of Europe, our GNP is only 58 per cent of the average national GNP of the European regions; our age dependency group &mdash; this is a very vital and important statistic &mdash; is 60 per cent whereas in the rest of Europe it is only 50 <Col N="986" /> per cent.  Even with a decreasing young population and decreasing birth rate, a large number of people will be going into the other side of the bracket, and the higher age limit and the greater life expectancy means we will continue to have a high dependency rate which, again, is out of line with our European partners.</P>
    <P>One of the most greatest difficulties we have, of course, is that the national debt is about 133 per cent of GNP as against the European average of something like 60 per cent.  This is one of the awful millstones around our neck, not only the debt itself but the servicing of this debt. Over the past few years, for example, efforts have been made by the Government to redress this &mdash; and a successful effort is being made &mdash; but unfortunately that £24 billion is still there and the interest accruing yearly has to be met. All the money going to meet the interest and to pay the debt could be put into development of the many projects that are listed here.  Hopefully, with help from Europe, from our Government and from private sources, we will be able to implement effectively the programme before us.</P>
    <P>Another disadvantage we have is transport costs.  These are going to increase, unfortunately, and make us even more peripheral with the tunnel between Britain and France.  It is important that we take advantage of all the various good things we have on our side and that we do our best on a national basis to make sure that this plan &mdash; well thought out, well-resourced, taking in the seven regions that have been covered, and with an input from people of diverse backgrounds and views in these regions &mdash; is brought to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    <P>I am interested in all areas but I am particularly interested in the sub-region of the mid-west.  Indeed, it gives me great pleasure that that region has been put down for over a £1 billion worth of investment in redefined developmental projects. One of the great advantages we have in the mid-west is the fact that we have SFADCo.  This body has already published &mdash; and was instrumental in <Col N="987" /> doing the spade-work for the national plan &mdash; its framework for the development of the Shannon region.  This is a document of which SFADCo should be proud and which we as public representatives from that area are very proud.  We are proud not alone of SFADCo but of the great work they are doing and of the development plan they submitted to the Government and which the Government has incorporated in its national plan.</P>
    <P>In that area if we look at the natural resources we have &mdash; we have disadvantages as well &mdash; at the resources that have been built up over the years and particularly if we look at the resources that have been put into the area, particularly in Limerick city over the past two years, we can see the signs of the optimism people are feeling at present with regard to the development of the economy.  The whole outlook is more progressive and more helpful than we had quite a short time ago.</P>
    <P>There have been many reports on the Shannon region &mdash; the Lichfield report, the McCarthy report, RDO report and various other reports.  The amazing thing about it, expecially the Lichfield report, is that it has been proved correct.  Its estimates and numbers, generally speaking, have been accurate.  The McCarthy report was a little too optimistic, perhaps, but from all these reports we have built up a certain expertise which is going to stand us well in the developments now foreseen and about to take place under the national plan.  These developments and reports were based on the Limerick-Shannon-Ennis region but they also mentioned the sub-regions; for example, Thurles, Tralee, the tourist attraction of the Clare area and so on.  The report said that in the Limerick-Shannon-Ennis area there was the nucleus of a rural area with high industrial potential which could be developed as a counterblast to the oversized and over-growing population of the Dublin area.  This goes back to the Lichfield report and it is contained in the McCarthy report as well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="988" /> This is something that has to be carefully looked at in our whole approach to the development of the country.  We should pick out centres, for example in the mid-west, south and west, etc., that can be developed.  The infrastructure in the areas can be brought to a high standard. The tourist potential of the areas can be developed and the educational standards, in particular, brought to the highest possible level.  We have in the Limerick area now, for example, what will be the new university of Limerick, what has been and is at present the National Institute for Higher Education. This has been one of the most successful projects proposed by any Government; it was introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government and continued by the Coalition Government.  It was one of the most successful investments made in any area. It has proved its worth because not alone have we the very high technological establishment &mdash; which will be a university very soon &mdash; in Limerick but also there is a very high level of all types of education from primary to post-primary to the new university, to Thomond College, to Mary Immaculate College, to the College of Art, Technology and Design. They are all working together giving a very comprehensive educational background to the industrial, commercial and other developments in the area.</P>
    <P>Together with the NIHE, there is the Plassey Technological Park.  It was the first in the country.  It is good to see that other university colleges are copying what happened in the NIHE and are now seeing the benefits of having industry and higher education aligned.  You have that, together with an urban infrastructure but an infrastructure that needs capital investment especially for the roads.  After many many years a new bridge was built in Limerick.  Anybody travelling on the Ennis Road will see the difference between what we have now and what we had three years ago.</P>
    <P>It is important that money be channelled into making our transport costs competitive with our partners in Europe. To import or export to or from the mid-west or to or from the west needs road, <Col N="989" /> rail and air infrastructure that will enable us compete on equal terms.  This has to be hammered home with regard to the implementation of this plan when the Taoiseach and the various Ministers are negotiating in Europe.</P>
    <P>One of our most important assets in the mid-west is Shannon Airport.  It has been an important asset since it was first launched.  It continues to be one of our greatest assets in the mid-west.  It is most important that there should be no downgrading of its international status, its situation between East and West which has been enhanced by the visit recently of Mikhail Gorbachev and his meeting with the Taoiseach in Shannon.  It shows the potential of the area, for example, as an international conference area, and so on. It shows that Shannon could become the central area not only of Europe but the central area of the world where people from all sides and shades of political opinion could meet in peace and harmony. That would correspond with a development by SFADCo with regard to their idea of holding peace conferences, both North and South, not alone confined to Ireland but also covering Europe and the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>Shannon is our main transatlantic airport and should continue to be so.  This does not mean that other airports should not build up their resources or that they should not be well financed or that they should not expand.  That is not the question. We depend on Shannon as a show piece, both for east-bound and westbound traffic.  The east-bound traffic from Moscow to Havana is one of the great moves we have seen over the past number of years.  Air transport will continue to increase.  This is important particularly as we will be cut off completely from Europe.  It is up to us to see to it that air transport, both for passengers and freight, is expanded so that we will not be at a disadvantage, either tradewise or passengerwise, in dealing with Europe or the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on the expansion in air traffic and the reduction in air fares.  Reductions in air fares have come at the expense of certain people.  This is <Col N="990" /> something that should be looked at.  For example, in our national airline, Aer Lingus, and in the very successfully competing airline, Ryanair, it is incumbent on the unions and on the Government to look at the type of wages and salaries being paid to very competent, well-educated people &mdash; air hostesses, ground hostesses and so on.  There was a great clamour at one time with the Bank of Ireland when they brought in a different wage structure for some of their clerical officers.  The wage structures in some cases, especially in the newer recruits over the last two years as hostesses and ground hostesses to the national airline and to Ryanair, provide a mere pittance. That cannot continue.  Highly qualified people should not be insulted by the wages they are receiving at present.</P>
    <P>A second great advantage we have in the area is the Shannon estuary.  It is interesting to read a report commissioned by the RDO and carried out by An Foras Forbartha in 1983 where it states:</P>
    <P>The study confirms that the Shannon estuary is a prime natural resource with potential for siting of major manufacturing industries requiring maritime locations.</P>
    <P>It goes on to list the type of industries that should be located on the Shannon esturary: oil-related, steel manufacture, pharmaceuticals, chemical, heavy chemicals, lead smelting, steel production platform construction and this type of industry.  The Shannon estuary, as my colleague Senator McEllistrim will confirm, is one of the finest deep water harbours in Europe.  Some heavy industries are sited there already and it is ready now for greater development.  While developing that side of it, there is the tourist potential and especially there is the environmental aspect.  If we site heavy industry there, and I would be in favour of that, we must take care of the environment. The two things can take place together.  It is important that any heavy industries located in the Shannon estuary would stand up to the most stringent environmental tests and obligations.</P>
    <P>It is most important that the tourist <Col N="991" /> potential of the area be exploited to the full.  I was rather amazed when reading the SFADCo report to see that the <i>per capita</i> income in the mid-west area in 1985 was only £250 whereas in the Donegal and the north-west it was £371 and in the west £351.  There is great potential in the mid-west area.  There is a great build up there with Bunratty, the Burren, Lough Gur and the various other areas. There should be no difficulty in achieving the aim of the national plan of at least doubling the tourist potential and doubling the employment in that area.</P>
    <P>Roads and sanitation are very important in the building up of the infrastructure of the whole area.  Basically, the mid-west is very much dependent on agriculture.  Indeed, in the national plan it gives me great pleasure to see a firm commitment by the Government to the family farm.  This is the bedrock of our economy and of our agricultural economy.  I compliment the Government in having put it in here because even though the Government are committed to it, it could have been overlooked in talking about infrastructure, tourism, industry and so on.</P>
    <P>Munster has always been looked upon as a very prosperous farming area.  The mid-west is very much dependent on dairy farming and is very vulnerable due to difficulties with regard to the CAP.  On that matter, we should be more vehement perhaps in Europe because we have to cut back while there have been imports of dairy produce from countries outside Europe.  If Europe is to expand and do its best to have greater cohesion, both social and economic, then it must respond by allowing us to develop what we can produce better and not import dairy produce from countries outside Europe to the detriment of our own prime industry.</P>
    <P>The Munster area, and particularly the mid-west area, is looked on as a very fertile area.  There are areas there &mdash; the Taoiseach was brought on a tour of, for example, the Mulcair area last year &mdash; which are subject to flooding.  Areas such as this which are probably under water for three months of the year should be <Col N="992" /> brought into the disadvantaged areas category and even brought into the severely disadvantaged areas category so that the grants that would be payable under these definitions and under these denominations would be available to them.</P>
    <P>All in all, it is important that this plan &mdash; a national plan, as it is now &mdash; be negotiated in Europe successfully and brought to a successful conclusion.  Of course, the real work starts then &mdash; in other words, the go-ahead from Europe, the input of European money, the input of national money, the input of private money.  This is very important in that it brings together the three communities &mdash; the private, the national and the European Community &mdash; which shows that there really is a unification, a unification between Ireland and Europe, a unification between all the people within Ireland to bring this plan to a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the time when the Government are successful in their negotiations and can then come back and say to the various bodies they had working for them in producing the plan: &ldquo;We have been very successful; now is the time to implement the plan&rdquo;.  Again, it is there, you will want the consensus.  It is there, where people will sit down together and say: &ldquo;We have five, six, seven or eight plans before us, we must take them in sequence, one, two, three and four and we must get this done in our five-year period&rdquo;.  If we all work together, if we all back the plan, if we all give our support to the Government, I think the plan can be implemented, implemented very successfully, and bring us at least on the way to achieving the European average both of income and of social standing and so forth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the need to review the Gaming and Lotteries Acts, 1956-1979 to ensure that proper control is maintained in the area of gaming.</P>
      <P>I believe the 1956 Gaming and Lotteries Acts need to be updated.  I do not know how, but I would hope that with a discussion here this week and next week we would come up with some ideas and views that would be of help to the Minister in drafting new legislation.  Prior to 1956 we had the Gaming Act.  There was a lot of tolerance in that Act.  It was all right when the gaming machines were in seaside resorts for three months of the year and then closed down, or when they were at one-night roadshows and carnival entertainments where they had the old penny machines.  There was no harm in them but in the mid-fifties it became a lucrative business.  Big arcades were set up, operating seven days of the week over long hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government then introduced the 1956 Act, but that Act needs updating. A number of sections in that Act have already been challenged in the courts on various occasions and at present sections of the Act are being challenged in the High Court and the Supreme Court.  For those reasons we need to do something to update the Acts.  Originally the stakes were fixed at two-and-a-half old pence with a pay-out of 50p.  Now we know those limits in many cases are exceeded. We should have a look at that.  We should particularly look at Part III of the Act, because it authorises local authorities, county councils and corporations to decide whether an area should be <Col N="994" /> included as a gaming area, and then you have to go to the courts.  There seems to be duplication here: either the local authorities or the courts should handle the situation.  I am not saying which; I am simply putting those ideas forward.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also consider setting up a gaming board.  Many people would say we should stop the whole gaming business altogether.  People get emotional about it.  Gaming of all kinds, whether it be horse racing or dog racing, can generate emotion and can be addictive. All gaming seems to be addictive. Anything people get seriously interested in, whether it is going to a football match on a Sunday or playing a game of golf, can become addictive.  But gaming seems to be a very intensive addiction.  Perhaps people may say it should be abolished but I would not think that would be right.  If we were to try to get rid of all the vices in our society, we would have a worse society, because those things would be run illegally and behind locked doors and the aims we would try to achieve would not be achieved.  Therefore, we cannot abolish it, but we should control it and put tighter constraints on it.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the gaming boards in England and Northern Ireland which work very successfully, I understand. Perhaps it might be wise to have a look at how they work, and see if we can learn something from their experiences and see if they have as big a problem as we have. As one who does not gamble but who visits towns in England and Ireland from time to time, I see there a greater number of gaming machines in shops, pubs and clubs.  I do not know how they control them.  It might be wise to see how the gaming boards deal with gambling in England and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>According to media reports it would appear that our law is being violated, bypassed and flouted in many ways; but it is difficult to get evidence to prove that. The Garda are doing their best to check on all those things but it is very difficult to get evidence to stand up in court.  You have to be positive that you have got a case.  With modern technology you can have machines playing illegally and, <Col N="995" /> when they see a garda coming in, with one flick of a switch in a certain location they can switch all the machines back to being within the law.  It is difficult to deal with all those electronic gadgets and technology.  I do not envy the Minister when he tries to amend the law; he will have a difficult job.</P>
    <P>We must look at the nature of the machines.  Nowadays there are machines where people do not spend money but yet lose a lot of money.  They can buy credits and they win credits.  They recash their credits.  In that way there is a question as to whether they are violating the law, but they are achieving the same aims.  This is an aspect of the law that will have to be examined.  Gaming is a problem for some people but, on the other hand, if we did not have gaming machines it would not stop anyway.  We have only to look at the liquor business. They still make the old drop of mountain dew and many people would tell you that if it was licensed there would be less abuse.  You will not stop it so the only thing you can do is to control it.  I would much prefer to see it run under controlled rules and regulations than to force it underground, which would be a very serious situation.</P>
    <P>The seaside would be a very dull place if there were no fun machines.  In Sligo there is gaming in a very limited way in the seaside resort of Enniscrone and it is rigorously controlled but gaming machines are not allowed in Rosses Point, Mullaghmore or Strandhill. Unfortunately, we do not get the volume of tourist because no matter how we condemn gaming, from a tourist point of view, if there is a wet day the people from Mullaghmore will go to Bundoran because there is something for the children to do there.  You do need something to liven up a seaside resort and gaming machines have been part and parcel of seaside resorts.  Unfortunately, when it became big business and ran all year round it became a problem, indeed a bit of a menace.  There should be some way that we could have fun machines but very tight controls.  Only over 16s are allowed <Col N="996" /> into arcades but any child can go in and play a fun machine and it is very hard to determine whether they are in the archade for gaming or to play the fun machines.  Fun machines should be in a separate area from gaming machines so that children could drive their fun cars, tractors or bicycles.  If the gaming machines were in an entirely different place the children would have no excuse for going in which would help to control the situation.</P>
    <P>We all remember being at the seaside when our children were small.  It would have been very dull for the children if they had to sit playing with sand all day and then come home and go to bed. However, in the evenings they could go into the amusement arcade and spend a few pence playing the machines.  They never made money and their parents were the poorer for it but there is no point in bringing children on a holiday if you do not give them a holiday.  You cannot have home rules and tough rules on holidays.  If you go with a family on holidays you should make the holiday enjoyable to them and make a few sacrifices yourself because that is the way it should be.  Tourist and seaside areas would be very dull if there were not arcades with fun machines and such type of entertainment because children get great enjoyment from driving cars <i>et cetra</i> in these arcades.  All these things are part and parcel of what children like on holidays and I would not like to see that type of entertainment taken from them.</P>
    <P>The 1956 Act allowed for only £10,000 to be paid out on national draws.  This is covered by the Gaming Act.  In 1956, £10,000 was a lot of money but that sum should now be updated as people running that type of draw have to send evidence each week by way of the winning ticket to the Garda authorities that they paid out only £10,000.  I do not think the Garda want to handle all these things.  Perhaps they could do spot checks.  It is a waste of time for all concerned.  A sum of £10,000 was a lot in 1956 but it is not very much today.  There may be other such figures within the Act which I did not notice which may also need to be looked <Col N="997" /> at.  Amendments and changes could tighten the gaming laws.  It is difficult fully to control the gaming laws but I hope that when the Minister updates the 1956 Gaming Act he will bring in water-tight legislation.  The £10,000 and other prizes should be updated as they are irrelevant today.  People get around the law by putting in five ten penny pieces to spin the wheel or pull the lever.  The Minister should meet casino operators and owners and get their views because most of them wish to run their business strictly within the law.  There are unscrupulous people in all businesses.  Some pubs would stay open until morning to sell drink but others have very strict rules and regulations. It would not be right to take this business away from people who have been in it for years but we should look at it in a new light and bring in the necessary checks and balances.  I know it will not be easy but the debate in this House will assist the Minister in drafting legislation which will be 100 per cent water-tight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. S. Haughey Mr. S. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally second the motion that Seanad Éireann notes the need to review the Gaming and Lotteries Acts, 1956-1979 to ensure that proper control is maintained in the area of gaming.  As Senators will be aware, local authorities throughout the country now have the power to adopt or rescind Part III of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956.  Indeed, some local authorities have already rescinded the adoption of Part III of the Act.  I understand that some local authorities in County Donegal have done so or certainly it is under discussion with particular regard to Donegal. Senators will be aware that Dublin City Council have also rescinded the adoption of Part III of the Act and this has done in January 1986.  This action was taken after a long hard-fought debate with intense lobbying from both sides by local authority members.  Indeed, some of the lobbying was unfortunate and became particularly intense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the city council in their wisdom eventually decide to rescind the adoption of the Act and I, as a member of Dublin City Council, supported that <Col N="998" /> decision.  It was supported in the chamber by the Fianna Fáil alderman and councillors and since then has won widespread support in the community in general.  It has won the support of many members of the Catholic Church and many residents' and tenants' associations.  Indeed in more recent times we have had delegations from the Irish Countrywomen's Association to our chamber to congratulate us on our decision.  I believe it was the right decision and I am glad I supported it.  As I have said, other local authorities are now considering this issue.</P>
    <P>Senators will no doubt be aware that Dublin County Council are now about to discuss this issue and take a decision on it.  I understand that decision will be taken on 28 April this year.  So, it is a very timely and lively debate and I am delighted to second the motion.  I am also satisfied, while the city council took the right decision &mdash; I refer to Dublin City Council that the ban should remain, while the existing legislation remains in place, we have an obligation to work the existing legislation and while the current situation is governed by the Gaming and Lotteries Acts, 1956, this ban should remain in place in Dublin city for many reasons.  I have no doubt that Senators are aware of many of these reasons.  Gaming machines cause widespread hardship and suffering in many cases and cause misery for certain people, particularly young people.  That is an area where gaming needs to be looked at very carefully, particularly in relation to the whole area of addiction.</P>
    <P>Addiction among young people with regard to these machines is a very serious situation and there is no doubt that these gaming machines represent the worst form of gambling.  It is different from other forms of gambling.  You can lose a lot of money in a very short space of time in gaming machines and that is what makes them different from other forms of gambling.  You can become addicted to this form of gambling more quickly than to any other form.  We are dealing with a very particular and difficult situation. There is no doubt also that the machines are fixed and loaded in favour of the owners rather than the users of the <Col N="999" /> machines.  The simple fact, and nobody would deny this, is that in the long term the user cannot win on these machines, the odds are stacked against the user and the regular user has to lose when playing these machines.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem with regard to young people stealing to feed their addiction habit.  That must cause social problems in certain areas of the country and it is a matter that needs to be looked at.  The media in general have highlighted many different situations with regard to these gaming machines.  There is documented evidence to show that on some occasions the entire social welfare packet of some people is fed into these machines within the space of one hour.  These situations do occur &mdash; I just do not know how regularly &mdash; they must be examined very carefully and tackled.</P>
    <P>Another reason that Dublin city took the decision to rescind the adoption of Part III of the Gaming and Lotteries Act is with regard to O'Connell Street.  The premier street in the capital city had become a honky tonk street because of the proliferation of gaming arcades on it. There was a general desire that O'Connell Street should be improved and that that situation was not good enough for the premier street.</P>
    <P>I was personally involved in a campaign in the Darndale area of Dublin which has very particular problems.  There was an application about two years ago for a gaming licence by a particular snooker hall owner in a premises adjacent to Darndale.  A campaign was launched to prevent gaming machines being provided in this building because of the serious social consequences which it would have had.  Every organisation and every towns and residents group in the Darndale area got together to tackle the situation and to ensure that this socially undesirable building would not be provided for the purposes of gambling.  In fact we succeeded, with the help of the city councillors, in having the ban on gaming in the city area extended to new areas of the city which had come into the administrative area of Dublin Corporation after <Col N="1000" /> the original decision of Dublin City Council in January 1986.  There was no doubt that the people of Darndale breathed a sigh of relief when that battle was won.  It is just a particular case in point which is helpful in illustrating that gaming in particular areas of the country and city is totally undesirable.</P>
    <P>The ban on gaming machines where it exists at the moment is being flouted on a large scale, according to media reports. This has happened since the Supreme Court decision of April 1988 which laid down the law with regard to the power of local authorities to ban gaming machines. The Garda now have a major role to play in the enforcement of the law.  It is a great new challenge to the Garda and one which they will have to face up to.  I appeal to the Garda to take tough action now that the law has become clear and to prosecute those people who are breaking it.  Other people also have a role to play.  The general public have a responsibility to report to the Garda places where they know that the law is being flouted because the Garda have to rely on reports and information that they are given.  I also appeal to the Minister for Justice to ensure that the Garda are encouraged to take the decision to uphold the law and to give them every encouragement in that regard.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, I am a realist and know that something has to be done in this situation.  As I said, local authorities in many areas have rescinded the adoption of Part III of the Act in an attempt to bring about new legislation in this regard. One of the major reasons I supported the ban in Dublin City Council is that new legislation is needed and this was one way in which local authorities could make known their views about new legislation which they wanted with regard to gaming and lotteries.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt now that there are major anomalies both within counties and between counties and that situation is totally unsatisfactory.  Some areas have the ban and other areas do not.  It is not suitable in an Irish context to have different laws and different regulations <Col N="1001" /> both within counties and between counties. The demand now is as stated in the motion, that new legislation is necessary. At the end of the day, and although this is difficult for me to say, the power will have to be taken away from the local authorities.  It is one of the few powers local authorities have but national Government must now step in.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult task for the Minister for Justice to bring forward new legislation on this issue and I wish him well. It will be a very difficult task; I suspect he is thinking of bringing in new legislation and I hope that he takes on board the contents of this motion.  While I very much dislike to see gaming machines allowed, particularly in parts of Dublin and other urban areas, I recognise the fact that a case can be made for these machines in other areas of the country. Indeed Senator Farrell referred to holiday resorts and most sensible people believe that there is a case for gaming machines in holiday resorts and such places.  That is just one example.  We have to have a very careful balance of the areas where we want to see gaming.  I hope that this matter is dealt with in the new legislation.</P>
    <P>Any new legislation will have to be examined very carefully by Members of the Oireachtas and all interested groups. If and when new laws are brought forward, the need for proper control is absolutely essential.  Tough controls and regulations are needed in regard to many issues.  The whole area of designation needs to be looked at very carefully and where exactly we want to see gaming machines operating, if indeed we want to see them anywhere.  At the end of the day a case will be made to have gaming machines operating in certain areas and the whole question of designation will have to be looked at.</P>
    <P>The whole area of age will need to be examined carefully.  At what age do we want to see people using gaming machines?  The question of a licensing system and opening times will also need to be looked at in some detail.  When should they be allowed to open and what <Col N="1002" /> times should they be allowed to do business? That is very important and needs to be examined very carefully.  The winnings which will be allowed and how the machines are loaded will need to be looked at from the point of view of bringing in tough regulations and tough controls.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Minister has a very difficult task.  He has a fine balancing act to perform and I wish him well.  New legislation is necessary, as the motion said and strict control is necessary.  In the meantime we have to operate the current legislation and the current law as it has been decided in the Supreme Court.  The bans that have already been declared have to remain in existence and enforced because once a law is passed it must be enforced.  We should enforce the current legislation but look forward also to new legislation in this very difficult area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed &mdash; with no disrespect to the Minister, Deputy McCarthy, that the Minister for Justice is not here tonight to listen to this debate because it is very obvious from what Senator Haughey said that the Minister is preparing legislation to deal with this problem.  He will certainly have a very difficult task in preparing this legislation because Senator Farrell and Senator Haughey have made a great case against gaming machines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Farrell spoke of addiction and that is the first thing we should address because some people become addicted to gambling of all kinds, horse racing, greyhound racing and slot machines.  Why do some people become addicted?  Usually it is because they suffer from a personality defect and they use the form of addiction of gambling or drinking or whatever as an escape.  Once they get hooked on it they are in a very serious situation.  Of all addictions, the most potent seems to be the gaming machines because they catch people from a very young age which can have very serious problems, as outlined by Senator <Col N="1003" /> Haughey.  They can steal and do a lot of anti-social things to get money to feed the habit and, as we know in Dublin, there was a tragic case where a young man took his life because of this problem.</P>
      <P>People with an addiction can receive help and there are organisations which cater for them.  They have to overcome a defect of personality and in doing so they can build on a foundation for life of a stronger personality which allows them to avoid the temptation of the addiction in the past.</P>
      <P>Senator Haughey mentioned Dublin Corporation having designated areas zoned for gambling.  It was our policy in the past to do that and the extraordinary thing was that we had hoped to succeed in achieving it.  Every applicant has to apply for planning permission to the local authority and for a certificate to the courts.  A judge in the Dublin District Court, who was a licensing judge for many years, took the view that an applicant approaching him for a certificate and who had not got planning permission, should be rejected.  It was our policy in Dublin Corporation after a certain stage not to grant planning permissions for these premises because basically the problem had spread not from the middle areas of the city where we hoped to curtail it but to the residential areas of the city next to schools and it became a real problem for young children and a great anxiety for parents.  I remember going to the courts on many occasions and opposing an application but then that particular judge resigned and he was replaced by a new licensing justice in the District Court.</P>
      <P>I well remember the day when a senior counsel and he had a legal argument about the fact that the planning function was a matter for the local authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis of the legal argument was that planning permission was a matter for the local authority and that the judicial function was the granting of a certificate.  Even if they did not have planning permission, the justice felt they were entitled to a certificate.  Certificates were given out over a period of time like confetti and it cause a real problem.  That was one of the issues that brought the matter before Dublin City Council where the city council, after the passing of the Act in 1956, adopted the Act but then rescinded it.  That decision was challenged all the way to the Supreme Court as Senator Haughey said.</P>
      <P>It is very interesting to look at the decision of the Supreme Court because they came out very strongly in favour of the decision of Dublin Corporation, that members of the city council thought they were acting quite legally within the Act. We have to look at the existing situation.</P>
      <P>Gaming is now illegal in Dublin.  That being the case it should be free of gaming centres but recently, following good investigative journalism, the <i>Evening Herald,</i> highlighted the fact that a number of gaming centres are still in existence in Dublin.  I ask the Minister for Justice to outline what steps the Garda are taking in enforcing the law. Have any of these machines been confiscated? We are asking here tonight that the enforcement of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956 be reviewed.  If we cannot enforce the legislation that we have, how are we to enforce some new Act?  Is it not possible to enforce that kind of mechanism?  Is it beyond the Garda and everybody else to do so.  They are not doing it at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been shocked by the response of the public to the banning of gaming in Dublin.  As Senator Haughey pointed out, a number of people have said that this is the kind of society they want.  It is very important that we recognise that but <Col N="1005" /> I do not think we can back-track now.  I have not always held this view, rather I have been converted to it.  I once held the view that abolition was not the solution to the problem.  I was worried about the addicts and I knew that if the problem went underground then the addicts would be more vulnerable.  They had some protection under the law when gaming was legal but they have no protection whatsoever now that it is illegal.  For that reason I ask the Minister for Justice to enforce the law as it stands, to close all the gaming halls in Dublin and confiscate the machines.  I hope he will respond to this request next week and outline the up-to-date position.</P>
    <P>It has been proposed &mdash; Senators Haughey and Farrell mentioned this &mdash; that a gaming board be set-up.  What would that mean?  It would mean taking from a local authority their functions under Part III of the Act and giving them to a gaming board.  To whom would a gaming board be responsible?  To whom would they be answerable?  At least, a local authority are answerable to the electorate.  Also, they have the interests of the community in mind.  The setting up of a gaming board is an option the Minister should consider.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, even if a gaming board were set up and given strong powers, including the power to decide on the location of a premises, power to ensure that premises were of a high standard and well maintained, power to control and remove certificates at any time, power to inspect machines, power to stipulate that the minimum pay-out should not be below 90 per cent, power to set the age limit at 18 years and the power to set the maximum and minimum stakes to be won, I would still believe &mdash; Senators Haughey and Farrell have made the case &mdash; that it would be impossible to enforce that kind of system.  For that reason I ask the Minister to review the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956 with a view to banning gaming on these gaming machines because it is in the public interest to do so.</P>
    <P>Finally, the County Dublin amusement proprietors have requested that a public <Col N="1006" /> inquiry be held on this issue.  I would welcome the holding of such a public inquiry because it would settle the matter once and for all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for giving me the opportunity once again to speak about this very important school in Kilkenny.  It is regrettable that I have to raise this issue on the floor of Seanad Éireann for the second time within a year.</P>
      <P>The situation in St. John's infants school has deteriorated somewhat since the last occasion on which we discussed the matter with the Minister for Education in this House.  Up to recently teachers on the panel continued to teach in the school.  Their inability to get a transfer or the opportunity to take up other employment &mdash; vacancies arise only rarely in other parts of the area &mdash; has helped to prevent difficulties arising. However, in recent weeks, changes have occurred in that school.  A teacher has left to take up employment elsewhere and this has led to a very difficult problem in the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the last occasion on which I raised this matter in the House the Minister promised to carryout a very detailed <Col N="1007" /> examination of the pupil numbers, to examine the need to provide special educational facilities and to create a remedial post in the school.  However, I have failed to get any significant information from the Department of Education as to the progress that was made in the review since then.  The boards of management and the principal of the school have tried to alleviate the difficulty but without success. I hasten to add that it is one of the few schools that suffered the traumatic loss of two posts for the 1988-89 school year.  Most of the schools in the area suffered the loss of one teacher arising out of the changes in the pupil-teacher ratio announced by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The teaching requirement for this school is one principal and nine assistant teachers.  They will be seeking the appointment of a permanent, ex quota, remedial teacher to the school.  They would be justified in doing so.  This requirement is based on the findings of very intensive research carried out by community in their catchment area and on the findings of survey carried out by the inspector and board of management, which reveal very alarming results.</P>
    <P>The number of children attending the school who live in disadvantaged housing is 62; 35 children come from single parent families; the parents of 51 children are separated, the parents of 76 children are unemployed, seven children are of no fixed abode; 99 children avail of school meals and 11 children are under assessment by local clinic psychological services. Twelve children are awaiting assessment with 36 children having a disturbing or disruptive influence in the classroom and playground.</P>
    <P>The results of that survey, which have been sent to the Department of Education, backed up by various reports from the social workers attached to the local authorities and the South Eastern Health Board, by the chief medical officer in the South Eastern Health Board and by various interested professional groups in the area, add weight to the case that a remedial post, apart from the existing teaching requirement, is a necessity <Col N="1008" /> rather than essential.  We should bear in mind that there are other schools in the same city with three remedial teachers. This, of course, is as a result of the various amalgamations of schools which have taken place over the years.  The board of management of this school cannot understand why there is such a discrepancy as between one area and another.  This case certainly requires further consideration in view of the findings of the survey I have just outlined.</P>
    <P>Another reason for my raising this matter once again is that it has come to my notice that there are schools &mdash; Scoil Mhuire, Marino in particular &mdash; that have received favourable consideration in recent times in the area of special education through the intervention of the Taoiseach.  If the Taoiseach is able to secure special consideration for schools from the Minister for Education and the Department in the allocation of extra teaching posts, I do not see why this school, St. John's infants school, cannot receive similar consideration.  If it becomes widely known that there are schools that have received favourable consideration when providing figures in an effort to gain extra teaching posts, then I think the Minister will face an avalanche of applications for extra teaching posts.</P>
    <P>The school I mentioned, Scoil Mhuire, Marino, succeeded in gaining an extra teaching post in the special education category following the personal intervention of the Taoiseach.  Such behaviour, and the decision of the Minister for Education, is despicable in view of the fact that many national schools throughout the country have suffered the loss of several teachers.  These schools did not receive the same sympathetic consideration when their cases for the retention of teaching posts were put before the Department of Education.  I call on the school authorities to appeal to the Minister once again to have their applications reviewed in the light of this new development.</P>
    <P>I would have to conclude that there is an element of &ldquo;stroke&rdquo; politics involved, <Col N="1009" /> in view of the constituency which a particular member of the Government represents receiving favourable considerable over another area.  I hope that is not the case, but I would certainly have to come to that conclusion if a school such as St. John's infant school in Kilkenny does not receive the type of consideration it merits and deserves.  Based on the information I have submitted on a number of occasions to the Minister's Department and on the results of the survey, on the conditions in the school and the background of the children, an extra teaching post in the special education area is required.  I call on the Minister to give more sympathetic consideration to this particular school than it has received to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say at the outset that it is not true to suggest, as the Senator has done, that the appointment of a teacher at Marino was as a result of the personal intervention of the Taoiseach.  I am sure the Senator knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State knows it is true.</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Bradford)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State to continue without interruption.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unworthy of the Senator to make such an accusation.  I want to assure him that it is not true and that all cases dealt with by my Department are dealt with on their merits.  I can assure him that all Members of the House &mdash; including the Taoiseach &mdash; have been informed on many occasions of our inability to accede to their requests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It might have been a slip.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no slip.  I want to make it very clear that that allegation is simply unfounded, and indeed rather unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The staffing arrangements in the school in question have been determined in <Col N="1010" /> accordance with the agreement between the Government and the INTO under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Under these arrangements it would not be possible to make an exception in the case of this school at present.  The staff of this school for 1987-88 was a principal and nine assistants and a shared remedial teacher.  The posts of eight and ninth assistants were discontinued from the end of the 1987-88 school year due to falling enrolments and the teachers' names were placed on the diocesan panel.</P>
    <P>Following the allocation of teaching posts to the school for the 1988-89 school year the school made a strong appeal for the retention of the two teachers concerned. With regard to the school's appeal, very careful consideration was given in the Department but, having regard to the agreed arrangements for the appointment and retention of teachers in national schools, a concession on staffing could not be granted as classes can be arranged within the appropriate guideline on class size with the approved level of staff, that is, a principal and seven assistant teachers.  It is not possible to depart from the terms of agreed staffing arrangements in the case of individual schools.</P>
    <P>The question of the allocation of an additional teacher to this school under the scheme of an additional teaching assistant for schools serving disadvantaged areas will be considered should additional posts be allocated for this purpose in the future.  It is not possible at present to allocate additional teaching staff under this scheme.</P>
    <P>With regard to the school's request for an allocation of a post of a remedial teacher, the position is that there is no provision for additional remedial posts at present.  I understand that the ninth assistant in this school was offered a post recently in another national school and has accepted and that the management of St. John's infants school is seeking approval for the appointment of a temporary teacher for the remainder of the school year.  I regret it is not open to my Department to appoint a temporary <Col N="1011" /> teacher where a post has been discontinued due to falling enrolments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most disappointed with the Minister's reply but I suppose it was not unexpected.  I am sorry but I will <Col N="1012" /> have to ask the Taoiseach to personally intervene.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 20 April 1989.</P>
