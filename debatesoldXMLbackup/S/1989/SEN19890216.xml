      <P>I have notice from Senator John A. Murphy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The recent large increase in the number of experiments on animals.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Maurice Manning of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The serious situation in the National Library where gross understaffing has led to a drastic reduction in service and security which has now reached crisis proportions.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Gerry Reynolds of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs in view of the joint statement following a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference to state what steps are being taken to proceed with the restoration of the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore Canal.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator John Connor of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to intervene to stop the precipitate closure of St. Patrick's Psychiatric <Col N="98" /> Hospital, Castlerea, at any time during the coming year and that the Minister make a statement on the future of this hospital.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Murphy, Manning, Reynolds and Connor as suitable for discussion.  I have selected the matter raised by Senator Murphy and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator's Manning, Reynolds and Connor may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>Two weeks ago I asked the Leader of the House if he could convey any information to the House about the setting up of the Anglo-Irish parliamentary tier and he undertook to do so.  I read in today's papers that it is about to be established next week.  I think it would be better if Members of the House were told directly of developments which affect them rather than having to learn of it through the columns of <i>The Irish Times</i>, however estimable <i>The Irish Times</i>.  Perhaps the Leader of the House might be able to confirm the reports in today's newspaper on this development?</P>

It is impossible to give an exact time for the matter on the Adjournment.</P>

    <P>On the matter raised by Senator Manning, may I say I have not read <i>The Irish <Col N="99" /> Times</i> yet so I cannot say if what is in it is true or false, but I will have a chat with him later on when I confirm what is in the paper.  I will also talk to the Minister.</P>

      <P>Before Committee Stage begins I would like to inform the House that the following amendments have been ruled out of order &mdash; amendment No. 4 as it involves a potential charge on the revenue, amendments Nos. 6 and 7 are not relevant to the Bill as read a Second Time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point I would like to raise on this is the question of what happens on summary conviction.  I would like some clarification from the Minister because all we have here is a penalty on indictment.  On the general issue of sexual assault, even assuming for the moment the Bill's provisions on aggravated sexual assault are retained, which I hope is not to be the case&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>To be helpful to Senator Ryan, I think the point he is raising is more appropriate to section 15.  Perhaps he might have a quick check with section 15 and see if I am correct on that.  Section 15 provides for the District Court with jurisdiction to trial summarily a case of sexual assault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I then go on to my second question under section 2, which refers to whether you call it indecent assault or sexual assault?  Has the Minister given any thought to the possibility <Col N="100" /> that the general area of sexual harassment could, or ought to be, covered under the general heading of &ldquo;sexual assault&rdquo; or &ldquo;indecent assault&rdquo;?  I refer to section 3 of the Bill &mdash; aggravated sexual assault means the sexual assault that involves serious violence or is such as to cause injury, humiliation or degradation of a grave nature to a person.  It is perfectly reasonable, therefore, to argue that the general activity of sexual harassment, particularly within employment, is calculated to cause some degree of humiliation or degradation to a person in such a fashion.</P>
      <P>In terms of the objective of this Bill, which is to further indicate society's disapproval of sexual attacks on women, the whole question of the use by an employer, or anybody in authority, of their position to imply sexual demands as was highlighted in a recent Labour Court hearing, to imply sexual ambiguity or to make sexual innuendoes, in my view quite clearly is calculated to humiliate people.  I would suggest to the Minister that perhaps we ought to think about extending the whole idea of sexual assault and indencent assault since it does involve not just physical threats but humiliation and psychological threats as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say to the Senator that I understand the Minister for Labour is paying attention to this particular issue as of now &mdash; the issue of sexual harassment at a place of employment.  There have been a number of court cases in the recent past that have highlighted this particular issue.  If there is an assault in the sexual harassment, then that would be covered by sexual assault.  The area generally is being looked at by the Minister for Labour.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing the <Col N="101" /> section and the Minister knows the reasons.  It is because I believe it is the wrong approach.  This section starts off by having the wrong approach to this Bill. As I will discuss in debate on the later amendments, I feel we should have an extension of the concept of rape to include the aspects dealt with under this new section concerning aggravated sexual assault.</P>
      <P>Many reasons for this are given by competent people who have knowledge and information about the whole area of rape law and the treatment of rape victims.  The overwhelming weight of opinion suggests that we should have the approach to this Bill which has been suggested by the Law Reform Commission, the Rape Crisis Centre, the all-party Committee on Women's Rights and by most of the people who have spoken on this side of the House.  The Minister is going against this very strong tide by pursuing the approach taken in this legislation. This is the reason I am opposing this section.  I believe that the matters dealt with in this section should, more rightly, be dealt with under the extended concept and definition of rape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With due respects to Senator Fennell, I cannot accept that I am going against a strong tide of thinking in this particular area.  The Senator's primary concern in this matter is the question of an extended definition of rape.  As she knows, I do not share her views on that issue and we will be discussing that matter in detail when we get to her amendments later on.  The deletion of section 3 could have serious detrimental effects, irrespective of whether or not the definition of rape is extended.  This is a point we must bear in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, the Law Reform Commission, both in their consultation paper and their final report on rape and allied offences, recommended the replacement of &ldquo;indecent assault&rdquo; by the offences of &ldquo;sexual assault&rdquo; and &ldquo;aggravated sexual assault&rdquo;.  The Government accepted that the existing offence of indencent assault, which carries a maximum penalty of ten years' <Col N="102" /> imprisonment, did not adequately reflect the seriousness of certain types of sexual assaults.  In the light of the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission, the Government decided that the name of the offence &ldquo;indecent assault&rdquo; should be changed to &ldquo;sexual assault&rdquo; and that a new offence of &ldquo;aggravated sexual assault&rdquo; should be created.</P>
    <P>The maximum penalty for sexual assault is set at five years' imprisonment under section 2 of the Bill.  This was done on the premise that less serious forms of indecent assault would be prosecuted under section 2, while the more serious forms of sexual assault would be prosecuted as &ldquo;aggravated sexual assault&rdquo; which, under section 3 of the Bill, carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. If section 3 of the Bill were to be deleted it would mean that the maximum penalty which could be imposed for an indecent assault which did not constitute rape would be five years' imprisonment.  We would be reducing the term of imprisonment as this would be less than the existing maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment for indecent assault.</P>
    <P>It can be seen then that the effect of deleting section 3 of the Bill would be to reduce the maximum penalty which could be imposed for serious sexual assaults other than rape and I am quite sure that would not be the intention of Senator Fennell.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we should scrutinise sections 1 and 2 separately.  There is no definition there of what we are talking about regarding indecent assault.  There are very clear definitions in section 3 of the kind of assault we are talking about. In the context of the act of rape &mdash; this is probably more appropriate to my later amendments &mdash; it is really a very fine point.  For example, if a 70 year old woman is forced to have oral sex with violence, does she believe she has not been raped?  I suggest that most people would agree that that was rape.  Under the proposals and the changes the Minister wishes to make, that is aggravated sexual assault.  I have talked at a number <Col N="103" /> of meetings since we were last here discussing Second Stage of the Bill.  There is very definitely a gender gap here &mdash; I am not suggesting that I wish the Minister was a woman but it might be helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how I should react to a suggestion like that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to convince the Minister of the kind of feelings the majority of women have about this. The Minister is bringing all the traditional, patriarchal attitudes to women into this.  His rigidity does not enable him to be a little more liberal and open, to think about this and to understand what I am trying to say.  This is an issue on which women feel very strongly.  They ask why does the Minister take this stance when the crimes are so awful, so abhorrent and equal to rape.  Why are we niggling about this, whatever the Minister might feel about the other sections and the penalties for indecent assault?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very wrong if we were to reduce this debate to an issue of men versus women.  I am satisfied, and I am sure the Members of the Seanad would be satisfied also, that this matter must be decided on its merits.  It should be obvious that the whole thrust of this legislation is to afford the best possible protection, for both men and women, against sexual assault, no matter what form it takes.  The protection in respect of anonymity and restrictions on cross-examination will apply equally to men and women victims.  I am very happy that the Bill will achieve this primary purpose in this very difficult area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, the Law Reform Commission, both in its consultation paper and in its final report on rape and allied offences, recommended the replacement of the offence of &ldquo;indecent assault&rdquo; with the offences of &ldquo;sexual assault&rdquo; and &ldquo;aggravated sexual assault&rdquo;.  We can argue, discuss and debate, as we will <Col N="104" /> when we come to other amendments tabled by Senator Fennell on section 11, but I honestly believe at this stage that if the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill, 1988 did not have section 3, as it now stands, the situation would disimprove to such a degree that it would be clearly seen as going backwards rather than going forward, as we are all trying to do.</P>
    <P>I take the Senator's point.  I know she has a case to make and she gave me fair notice of this during the course of Second Stage.  I respect the Senator's viewpoint but I do not share it.  That is no secret and she is aware of that.  I have very good reasons, which I gave in reply during the Second Stage debate, as to why I cannot share the Senator's views.  It is more appropriate that we debate the issue again on Senator Fennell's amendment. I say, in all earnestness, that if this section is opposed and if that opposition is carried, we will not be going in the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I indended to speak on the Second Stage of this Bill but, unfortunately, I was late and it concluded rather quickly.  Reading the papers from the Law Reform Commission, it is very obvious that they agonised at some length on this very point which we are discussing and they came to the conclusion that they were not anxious to extend the definition of rape.  However, having listened to people giving evidence to them and having read submissions by a number of people they changed their minds.  This is the kind of evidence Senator Fennell is now bringing to our attention.  That is the view of people she has met and consulted with.  Certainly, that changed the view of the Law Reform Commission.  They recommended &mdash; which the Minister has not accepted &mdash; an extension of the definition of rape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am rather surprised that in discussing rape the possibility of pregnancy is always mentioned.  The Minister made this reference in his closing speech and it was mentioned in a Supreme Court judgment also.  I do not think there has to be a <Col N="105" /> possibility of pregnancy to have the crime of rape described as rape.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the Minister's speech before me.  I do not think he said that the possibility of pregnancy had to be present, but he did refer to the possibility of pregnancy as one of the distinguishing characteristics of rape, which is arguable.  If there are more or less offensive forms of rape, some of those have been committed against elderly women where the possibility of pregnancy does not arise.</P>
      <P>I came in here fully intending to support this amendment, but I have to concede that the Minister has a point. Subsection (1) of section 3 ought to remain as a definition of aggravated sexual assault.  The remainder ought to be what we discussed, namely, whether those particular forms of aggravated sexual assualt, as referred to on the top of page 4, should or should not be included in the definition of rape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite right that a general section which refers to aggravated sexual assault &mdash; a sexual assault which involves serious violence or the threat of serious violence or such as to cause injury, humiliation or degradation of a grave nature to the person assaulted &mdash; is a worthwhile addition to our legal definitions.  Any such attack ought to carry the penalties the Minister is suggesting.  That is why I have a difficulty with supporting the amendment because of the fact that it would take out of the legislation a definition of aggravated sexual assault separate from the two specific categories referred to at the top of page 4 which is penetration of the anus or mouth of the person assaulted by the penis of another, which I believe should be defined as rape. Similarily, penetration of the vagina of the woman assaulted by any object held and manipulated by any other person, I also believe, ought to be defined as rape. There is a generalised category of offence <Col N="106" /> in subsection (1) which deserves to be distinguished from what used to be called &ldquo;indecent assault&rdquo;.  That is the point the Minister is making.  Most reluctantly, I have to concede the point to him that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Not reluctantly, surely? On its merits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>You have to be gracious about all these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of the qualities of politics I have not learned yet.  It is probably for the price of perpetual opposition. May I draw the Minister's attention to some phraseology in section 3 because I am acutely conscious of it myself in my own use of language.  It portrays this male-female conflict quite graphically, in the way that it is implied that there are two categories of people &mdash; a person and a woman and, of itself, that implies a slight subordination.  It states on the top of page 4:</P>
      <P>penetration, however slight, of the anus or the mouth of the person assaulted by the penis of another person.</P>
      <P>It is only men who have penises.  We use the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; allegedly generically, but in fact we mean men.  Then we use a sub-category of people to describe women.  There is no particular reason why the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; should be there rather than &ldquo;man&rdquo;.  We do it because we men particularly, have only begun to understand our language and to understand the extent to which it is actually full of stereotyping, categorisation and implications of a difference which implies a slight inferiority.  Why otherwise would one refer to the penis of a &ldquo;person&rdquo;?  Half of humanity does not have a penis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept &mdash; more graciously than the Senator accepted my point of view earlier &mdash; that he has a point there, and I certainly bring it to the <Col N="107" /> attention of the parliamentary draftsman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which deals with the abolition of the marital exemption in relation to rape.  The treatment of the case is going to be different from other rapes in that criminal proceedings against a man in respect of rape by him of his wife shall not be instituted except by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I am a little concerned that this might be a delaying tactic or could prove to be difficult in this very important area which, again, has been seen for many years as a necessary change.  I wonder if the Minister could elaborate a little on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (2) means that criminal proceedings in the case of a rape by a man of his wife can only be instituted by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The purpose of this is to prevent private prosecutions by a wife or a third party being brought where they might be vexatious or where there is not sufficient evidence to warrant prosecution. The existing law is that Article 30.3 of the Constitution prevents a person prosecuting a criminal offence except in the court of summary jurisdiction, that is, the District Court.  In the case of a serious crime such as rape, it effectively <Col N="109" /> means a private prosecution could only reach the stage of the preliminary hearing of the District Court and go no further. Subsection (2) proposes that even this preliminary stage could not be initiated without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>

      <P>Could I say there was an oversight on my part?  I will be introducing an amendment on Report Stage on the matter of consent.  I am not entirely happy.  I read the Minister's response.  It was a fair response to the question I raised about the Law Reform Commission's definition of consent, to the issue that has been raised by the Law Reform Commission.  However, I simply want to give notice now that I will be introducing an amendment on Report Stage on the matter of consent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a small question. Under section 6 (1) of the Principal Act, as amended, at the end of that paragraph: &ldquo;...and such other persons as the judge, the justice or the court, as the case may be, in his or its discretion permit to remain&rdquo;.  That effectively means that the judge, the justice or the court may effectively ignore this section completely if they see fit.  That is how it appears to me.  Is that because of a constitutional necessity not to interfere with the independence of the Judiciary, or is there a <Col N="110" /> particular reason for it?  That is the first question.</P>
      <P>The second question is on section 6 (3) of the Act, as amended.  &ldquo;Parent&rdquo; is singular.  It appears to me there should be no good reason why a complainant in a rape case should not have the right to have both of his or her parents present and it should not be a matter of discretion for the judge or the court.  I would ask the Minister to consider substituting &ldquo;parents&rdquo; for &ldquo;parent&rdquo; there.  I do not know why it should have to be a matter for pleading to the court for a child, for instance, who is giving evidence or who is a complainant in a rape case, to have a guarantee that she, in particular, or he, which is less likely, could have both parents present.  I would ask the Minister to consider changing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point which Senator Ryan has raised, that subsection (3) of section 6 of the 1981 Act, as substituted by section 10 of this Bill, might be interpreted in such a way that only one and not both parents of the complainant or the accused, where not of full age, could attend the trial, a similar provision to this was contained in section 6 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, and in the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, and no problem has arisen as a result of this.  In practice, the court takes a common sense approach when applying a provision of this nature and allows both parents to attend.  I would point out that, even if a court did decide that it was bound by the provisions of subsection (3) to allow only one parent to attend the full trial, it still has the power to allow the other parent to attend under the provisions of subsection (1).  That subsection gives a general discretion to the court to allow such persons as it considers appropriate to remain for the main proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all proceedings, other than where applications are being made under section 3 or 4 of the 1981 Act, officers of the court, persons directly concerned in the proceedings, the press, a friend or parent or complainant and of the accused, if under 18, will have the right <Col N="111" /> to be present.  However, there may be circumstances where persons other than those just mentioned may wish to attend the proceedings and have a valid reason for doing so.  For example, they may be persons involved in research of a legal or scientific nature, or it may be desirable to have a medical person present if a person involved in the proceedings is unwell.  It would not be feasible to foresee and list every such circumstance and therefore the court is being given this discretion to decide what other persons may attend in the light of the circumstances of the particular case.  This follows the pattern provided for in section 20 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951.  It is to give that little bit of flexibility.  If we were to list, as I have already said, all the instances, we might not cover all situations that might arise and it is best to leave it to the discretion of the judge. This has worked well as we see from examination of the situation of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's explanation makes perfect sense as far as the discretionary element contained in subsection (1) goes.  I am still not clear why we cannot say &ldquo;parents&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;a parent&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is a certain symbolism in the Oireachtas discussing an issue like rape and trying to make it quite clear how abhorrent an offence it is; and in that symbolism is contained also our feeling for the victim.  In that feeling for the victim we ought to make it crystal clear that particularly a victim who is under age, or indeed any victim who might wish it, is entitled to the full support of both parents.  I accept that it would be a very unreasonable judge &mdash; though, dare I say it, there may be one or two about &mdash; but it would be a very unreasonable member of the Judiciary who would not agree to both parents being present.  That is not the issue.  The issue is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is one of the very important new sections dealing with rape hearings.  I have to say that, even though I disagree with the Minister on very fundamental points in the Bill, it is a good piece of legislation, and in many instances as good as I expected.  It is great to think that all of the consultation and all of the discussions, seminars and all the rest of it have borne fruit.  However, this is a very basic need.  We must consider the history of court cases for rape in which you had the complainant, the witness, in court &mdash; mostly, I would say almost entirely, for the first time &mdash; in the witness box being grilled in many instances very aggressively, very brutally by defending counsel and having to cope with this dreadful trauma.</P>
      <P>Now one of the main complaints over the years has been that there were not enough people there, that there were not people there who could help her.  This, again, is the subject of a later amendment of mine but it was also the case that there were strangers in the court, people who, whether they came for vicarious reasons or not, one perceived and believed that they did; and the whole environment of the court was a very alien and frightening place for the witness.  I am very pleased that this section is dealing with that.  It means that the sightseers, or people who come to a rape trial as a spectator sport, as it were, will be barred and in future will not be allowed in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that this section will clarify the position of counsellors &mdash; a rape centre counsellor who would have been helping a woman prior to her court case and in preparation for it, should be allowed in. I also agree with Senator Ryan that there should not really be any ambivalence about this section because in many instances the witness concerned could be under age; and, even if they are not, I <Col N="113" /> think somebody of 18, 19, 20, 21 or 22 in many instances would want to have both parents at the hearing and at the trial.  If possible we should take the ambivalence out of that and make it quite specific. May I ask the Minister if there is any other comparable area in criminal law where cases are held in camera, or will this be the first of its kind, and will there be rules of court determining it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 48 to 50 and substitute &ldquo;&lsquo;sexual assault&rsquo; has the meaning assigned to it by the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1988;&rsquo;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Again, this is the basic and important aspect of this legislation.  I stress the need to have the sections dealing with aggravated sexual assault taken as defined as rape and included in the Bill as part of the rape Act, given that it carries the same penalty as rape, is dealt with in the in camera hearings as rape and dealt with in all other aspects as rape.</P>
      <P>In making this case again I have to harp back to the consultations, submissions and the points that were put forward by the various groups dealing with rape. They wanted to have the definition extended and this is in line with thinking abroad.  The Law Reform Commission, having considered this very deeply indeed &mdash; having had a one day seminar bringing in all the interest groups to consult with them on all the proposed sections for a new Bill &mdash; state in their report on rape:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We conclude, accordingly, that the <Col N="114" /> case has been established for extending the definition of rape to encompass any non-consensual sexual penetration of the vagina, anus or mouth of a person by the penis of another person or of the vagina or anus of a person by an inanimate object held and mainipulated by another person.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will continue with the quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An appropriate model is to be found in the definition contained in the Crimes (Sexual Offences) Act, 1980, in Victoria which is quoted in our consultation paper.  We think it worth pointing out in this context that the Law Reform Commission of Victoria in its review of rape and allied offences (Discussion Paper No. 2, August 1986) was of opinion that the 1980 reforms were satisfactory noting that there was something important and distinctive about sexual penetration of body orifices. The common law crime of rape was restricted to vaginal penetration by the penis.  In 1980 rape became an offence involving various bodily orifices and the use of objects as opposed simply to the penis.  It also became a gender neutral offence.  These changes would appear to have received community support.  There has been no obvious signs of opposition and we accordingly recommend that the crime of rape should be defined by statute so as to include non-consensual sexual penetration of the vagina, anus and mouth of a person by the penis of another person or of the vagina or anus <Col N="115" /> of a person by an inanimate object held and manipulated by another person.</P>
    <P>The commission qualify that, but that is the main thrust of the argument I am putting forward here and on which the amendments are based.  That is the kind of thinking that has been brought into rape legislation abroad and the Law Reform Commission saw fit to accept that.  The Minister mentioned in his speech on Second Stage that the Garda were opposed to the definition.  However, in their submission opposing the extension of the definition, they refer again to pregnancy:</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána and the Law Society argued against the broadening of the definition of rape.  The Garda authorities indicated that they were satisfied that sufficient legislation existed to deal adequately with other forms of penetration as distinct from sexual intercourse and they made the point that the possible consequence of unlawful intercourse, i.e. pregnancy, makes rape a unique crime.</P>
    <P>That is the kernel of the whole matter. They say that the instance of pregnancy makes rape a unique crime.  I am saying to you that that may have been the case 40 or 50 years ago, but it is not the case now.  I do not believe there is any special place for the penis as an implement in the context of the kind of outrageous crimes that have been committed and about which we have all read in the papers in recent years.  Let us not take the risk of pregnancy as the main factor in this.  Other implements are equally as damaging, cause the same psychological problems and, therefore, I would ask the Minister to get away from the traditional concept on which he has based this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that as a member of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights, I have great sympathy with this amendment.  In fact, the Minister will recall that I asked him during Second Stage, in the light of the views of <Col N="116" /> the committee to reconsider this.  I want to pay tribute to the Minister for the forthright manner in which he has dealt with all the problems which have arisen in this respect, particularly in relation to the work of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights.  I cannot speak for all the Members but I believe the general view is that everybody is satisfied with this legislation, as Senator Fennell has already said.</P>
      <P>I am convinced by the argument which the Minister makes because although the Minister has stated that we should not view this legislation in terms of men and women, it is inevitable that this will be so.  Te extend the definition of rape to cover penetration, however slight, of the anus or mouth of the person assaulted by the penis of another person or the penetration, however slight, of the vagina of the woman assaulted by any object held or manipulated by another person could be justified because under present legislation the punishment for that crime is the same as for rape and the procedure through the court is exactly the same.  Therefore, from that point of view it must be satisfactory.</P>
      <P>The only major problem I see is that society will say that this problem has been dealt with and that the correct punishment has been meted out.  However, for the victim Senator Ryan spoke about, the woman involved, is there a difference between rape or aggravated sexual assault?  I am sure we would all agree that a victim subjected to that type of degrading treatment would have suffered to the same extent as a rape where sexual intercourse took place.  The woman concerned, whatever her age, would feel psychologically and in other ways the same as if she was raped, as defined and as we understand it at the moment.  As the Law Reform Commission has said, it is simply a matter of language.  I am not convinced that it would be possible in legislation to deal with that aspect of it, to cover the psychological injury to the individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have read through all the reports of the Law Reform Commission.  Indeed, we could spend the whole afternoon here <Col N="117" /> going through and quoting from these reports.  To some extent the original report, which was already quoted by Senator Fennell, is somewhat unclear, in my view.  It says in one sentence &ldquo;While some of us remain unconvinced, this latter argument is entirely logical&rdquo;.  Some of us.  How many?  How unconvinced? Can something be 50 per cent logical or otherwise?  We could go into that aspect of it.  But, basically, with regard to the specific amendment, it is the view of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights that the definition should be extended.  However, I must say that, for my own part as a committed member of the Joint Committee, I feel I must accept the logic of the Minister's argument.  The punishment for this specific crime is on a par with that for rape and I think that is as far as the legislation can go.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not get an opportunity to speak on Second Stage of the Bill.  In any case there was not very much else for me to say because, like my colleagues, I would have welcomed the Bill and, like my colleagues, I would have expressed certain reservations.  I am totally in favour of the amendments being moved by Senator Fennell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I had spoken on Second Stage of the Bill I would have made one point and, if you would bear with me briefly, I would like to make it now.  As a man, I have a certain unease about some of the attitudes being expressed by certain of my male colleagues on this matter.  I get the impression somehow that because this is mainly a male crime against females, then somehow all males need to beat their breasts as it were.  I do not accept this new version of events which says that because society is structured in a certain way, because it is a male structured society, therefore our culture conditions people to commit these dreadful crimes. I think there are very large and loose assumptions in this argument.  What I am saying is because on the accident of gender I am a man, I certainly do not accept that there is a universal male collectivity of guilt in this matter of the heinous crime of rape, anymore than <Col N="118" /> because I am an Irishman I should feel guilty because IRA terrorists are doing awful things in my name.  I just wanted to make that point clear.  As far as I am concerned, this is a heinous crime.  It should not necessarily involve unnecessary, to say the least, male attitudes.</P>
    <P>On the matter of the amendments, the reason I support Senator Fennell's amendments is because aggravated sexual assault simply does not convey the disapproval of society for this uniquely horrendous crime.  It seems to me that the variations of the crime which were defined here are only variations as it were.  To call them something else is to put them in another category.  I do not think that is good enough.  If you look at the Oxford English Dictionary you will be surprised how comprehensive the term &ldquo;rape&rdquo; is.  The OED does not go in for physiological definitions.  Perhaps they felt there was no need to; perhaps they were too prudish.  I think the main thrust of the dictionary definition of rape is forceful violation.  If forceful violation is accomplished in other than, shall we say, the conventional way, is seems to me that it still conforms to the definition of rape. I would suggest indeed that these actions are, in addition to being forceful violations, also additionally perverse and sadistic.  There are extra reasons for including them under the hitherto restrictive definition of rape.</P>
    <P>I have read the report of the Law Reform Commission.  I have read the debates of the Seanad on Second Stage and on balance certainly I am inclined to support Senator Fennell's amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that Senator Fennell complimented the Minister at the end of his Second Stage speech, and may I say that his reply on Second Stage was comprehensive as well.  I reread a few times the Minister's arguments for preserving a distinction between rape and aggravated sexual assault in so far as that encompasses penetration of the anus or mouth by the penis of another person or penetration of the vagina of the woman by an object held or manipulated by another person.  In so far as aggravated <Col N="119" /> sexual assault is extended to include those, and those are excluded from the definition of rape, I have read the Minister's arguments and I think it is fair to say that he does mention the possibility of pregnancy.  He also mentions the fact that one of the distinguishing characteristics of rape is that it consists of an act which is of itself criminal but which becomes criminal because of the lack or absence of consent of one of the partners.</P>
      <P>I do not want to get involved in a long wrangle about what is or is not appropriate sexual behaviour but I did not know, first of all, that oral intercource was illegal <i>per se</i>.  I personally cannot find any reason to distinguish between forced oral intercourse and forced sexual intercourse as is conventionally defined. Therefore, I am not sure about the simple argument of one being something which of itself &mdash; it is an awful way to describe sex as being not illegal &mdash; is not an act which is criminal.  That falls down for a number of reasons.  Secondly, not enough attention has been given by the Minister, or indeed by the minority view of the Law Reform Commission, to how the victim feels.  I do not think we can operate a distinction which does not make any sense to the victim of a crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have read the dissenting view of the Law Reform Commission.  I have read the Minister's arguments.  The Minister went on to argue that the problem of the presence or absence of consent will always be argued for rape as it is up to now defined, whereas in the case of a number of the other actions &mdash; those that would come under the Minister's definition of aggravated sexual assault &mdash; such an argument would not arise.  I am not sure that that would necessarily be the case &mdash; in some cases it would be the case, in some other cases it would not be.  That seemed to me to be the most convincing of the reasons the Minister put forward &mdash; the question of the absence or presence of consent and the fact that, of course, by separating these offences from the definition of rape you might spare the victim the agony of having a long and probably very rough <Col N="120" /> cross-examination on the question of consent. I am not sure that that would be the case and I would like the Minister to elaborate on the area of consent, particularly in the case of oral intercourse, for instance.  Where is the basis for believing that the question of consent would not arise if a person was charged with aggravated sexual assault?</P>
    <P>In regard to the other arguments the Minister used, I could not find it in his speech but I think he mentioned &mdash; and I was surprised because I heard it over the monitor &mdash; somebody who was convicted of sexual offences involving, I think, buggery and saying that this person should not be branded as a rapist.  I think he should.  I do not think there is any reason why he should not.  I want to be very careful because I may have misunderstood it; I could not find the reference just now.  Perhaps the Minister can tell me I am wrong, in which case I will be happy to withdraw the remark, or else I can sit down and find it.</P>
    <P>The other matter in the Minister's reply which bothered me was his argument that public odium for rape would be diluted by extending the definition of it.  I think the opposite would be the case. Public odium would see no difference in terms of the appalling nature of the crime, the appalling humiliation of the victim, the appalling physical imposition on the victim and the appalling psychological shock on the victim in all of these offences.  I do not think any person in the community would accept that the experience of the victim if he or she were subject to rape as currently defined.</P>
    <P>There is another overwhelming reason that has not been mentioned yet.  Over the past seven or eight years the possibility of something much worse than pregnancy resulting from rape has arisen. I would suspect that if a woman were to be raped by an intravenous drug user she would now have two great fears, the first would be pregnancy, the scond would be the appalling possibility of the transmission of the AIDS virus.  AIDS is a real fear.  It is something that has to affect the <Col N="121" /> values of every citizen in western society. It is not something we can put off out there affecting other people and it is as real a fear for the victim of rape as it is for the young person who is being counselled to change his or her sexual habits. The frightening reality is that some of the activities which are separated from rape in the Minister's proposal for example, anal intercourse are more likely to result in the transmission of the AIDS virus than sexual intercourse as conventionally described because of the greater likelihood of the intermingling of blood and semen or blood and blood which is the basic, fundamental requirement for the transmission of the AIDS virus.</P>
    <P>In terms of the threat to the victim, anal intercourse is a more frightening threat now because of the increased risk of the transmisison of the AIDS virus which is a far greater threat to the woman than even the appalling fear of pregnancy. Society has got to get used to the fact that all of these activities are equally reprehensible and heinous and however good the basic principle of not changing the law until there is a good reason to do so, I think the perceptions of women, the fear of the transmission of AIDS, the view of society, all point in one direction and that is that society would regard all of these offences as the same thing &mdash; a violent violation of the body of a victim by a criminal &mdash; all of which should be treated in the same way.  That is why I support these amendments and I appeal to the Minister and the Government to undertake to rethink this issue.</P>
    <P>The question of AIDS was not mentioned in the Minister's reply.  It is an important consideration and a frightening one.  It transforms the fears of rape victims in a more frightening way.  It extends a life-threatening element to the consequences of rape that did not exist before.  It is not unreasonable to believe that those who would perpetrate crimes like rape are more likely to be the carriers of the AIDS virus.  It is not unreasonable to believe that those who are involved in intravenous drug use will be involved in other unpleasant and offensive crimes. There is a good case for the Minister to <Col N="122" /> undertake to have another look at this issue between now and Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a very interesting contribution from Senator Ryan and I am glad he accepts the fact that the Minister in his reply quoted from a Supreme Court judgment stating the distinctive features of rape, including the possibility of pregnancy. I was in the courts some years ago on jury duty and there was a case of rape before the courts.  The defendant pleaded guilty.  It was a most horrific case: the victim had been violated on two occasions by the accused.  After listening to the submission made on behalf of the accused, the judge asked what I felt was an extraordinary question &mdash; was the girl pregnant?  That had little to do with the crime of rape because it was the violation of her body that was the real crime before the court.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment 2 (a) which covers penetration of the mouth or the anus this can be a very serious offence and can be as horrific as the conventional type of rape as we understand it.  For that reason I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that we are at one on all sides of the House in supporting the Minister in much of what is being discussed here today.  We are here as a committee trying to arrive at a definition and it never works.  It always means finding some sort of a compromise position that takes into account the various valid views being put forward.  This debate should be unnecessary if we had a wider understanding of what rape was. Despite what Senator Murphy said about the collective guilt of the male sex &mdash; I would agree with him but that is not the point &mdash; it is also clear, however, that attitudes have been formed and law has been formulated through the imposition of male-dominated opinion for centuries. That is the way the understanding of rape has come through legislation but the Acts described in the amendments which are being proposed here today by Senator Fennell have to be seen as rape.  Any of the acts described in the proposed amendments constitute forceful violation <Col N="123" /> and this should be the criterion we should apply to a definition of rape.</P>
      <P>One of the great difficulties in having this discussion concerns the use of language. I hesitate to use words like &ldquo;perverse, unnatural or abnormal&rdquo; in describing sexual acts for the reason that normality is defined by what the majority believe to be normal and no more than that.  It is a useless definition to us at this time and what might be seen as abnormal or perverse or unnatural in one culture might be totally acceptable in another. There is plenty of evidence for that around the globe.  It seems to me that the person who has been the victim of the sexual act and forcefully violated in the way described in amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3 has been raped in the literal sense of that word.  It is not a matter of getting into semantics but I think we would all agree that this form of forceful violation has to be seen as a rape of the body, a forceful violation and intrustion of the body, and would have to be included.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister in his response to take the arguments we have put forward and see how far he comes along the road with us.  I hope that his objection &mdash; if there is going to be one &mdash; would be along the lines of the framing of the wording and perhaps he could indicate how the core of the arguments we are putting forward might be included in the Bill. There is no doubt in my mind that the public would agree that this type of forceful violation would certainly be rape.  I do not know of any woman who would think otherwise.  It sounds quite a sexist thing to say but I think that as a man I would defer to the woman's perception of the act on this occasion.  It is not something I would do without thought but the experience of women in this matter is a vitally important part of the argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In supporting the amendments I would ask the Minister to indicate how, if the amendments as framed and worded are not acceptable, the core of the arguments and the essence of what we are saying can be encompassed in the Bill.  As it is written at the moment they are not <Col N="124" /> covered and the Bill is inadequate without extending the definition of rape to cover the amendments proposed by Senator Fennell.  Other countries have had experience of having to change the legislation with regard to rape.</P>
    <P>With reference to the point Senator Ryan made about the new additional risk arising from the AIDS virus which now attaches to rape, I am aware that it has now become necessary in some American states to extend the legislation covering rape in order to deal with rape perpetrated by someone who is HIV positive or has full blown AIDS.  This is being created as a new offence with most severe penalties attaching to it.  I refer to it as an indication of the way other legislatures have dealt with this matter.  I ask the Minister if in the drafting of the legislation it was considered that a rape committed by someone who was aware that he was HIV positive or suffering from AIDS should be given special attention.</P>
    <P>Finally, I fully support Senator Fennell's proposals.  We have a duty to see that the definition of rape is extended to cover the point she makes.  I appeal to the Minister to respond to these arguments in the most positive way possible.</P>

      <P>In relation to the points made there, perhaps we are looking at this the wrong way around.  I see aggravated sexual assault as a much more horrific crime even than rape.  Rape is a horrific crime but to be penetrated by a knife is surely more horrific than to be penetrated by a penis.  There are some crimes which are so horrific in the whole area of these perverse, sadistic sexual attacks that they can only be described as aggravated sexual assault and even the word &ldquo;rape&rdquo; does not cover them.  I would like to look at it the other way around.  The word &ldquo;rape&rdquo; has certain connotations in the public mind and it does not sufficiently cover some of the horrific crimes that can be committed and perpetrated against another, male or female.  It is just another viewpoint and it is one of the reasons I agree with the Minister's wording.</P>

      <P>I want to make one point in relation to contributions by Members who have already spoken.  I am not conscious of that collective feeling of guilt on the part of male Members that Senator Murphy referred to.  Of course I am very concerned with the offender.  As other Members said on Second Stage, I would hope that some proper treatment would be given to offenders to enable them to resume their proper place in society.  Even if I felt that I should argue for the amendment tabled by Senator Fennell I would argue for it because this would be normal practice in the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a tremendous amount of goodwill going for him with regard to this legislation.  Without exception everybody feels it is worthwhile legislation and will take us a considerable distance along the road to the first bend.  When we consider that the Law Reform Commission changed their view with regard to this matter, it underlines that it is not a cut and dried case under any circumstances.  I am not sure if that was normal procedure with the Law Reform Commission or if it was unusual but it seems rather unusual to me that something considered at great length by the Law Reform Commission and taking in the deliberations of committees concerned principally with women's rights &mdash; which was a proper course to take &mdash; should be changed.</P>
      <P>With regard to what Senator Brendan Ryan said, I want to make this specific point with regard to the effect on society of extension of the definition of rape.  I quote from page 34 of the Law Reform Commission's Report on Rape.  It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A pragmatic, indirect, argument in favour of extending the definition of rape runs as follows; The Community at present stigmatises rapists and rape, and &ldquo;rape&rdquo; is a highly stigmatic word. Other forms of demeaning conduct are perhaps not so highly stigmatised. Nonetheless they should be as highly stigmatised as rape.  Therefore the argument runs if we extend the name &ldquo;rape&rdquo; to these forms of demeaning conduct, there is a likelihood that the community, on hearing the word <Col N="126" />&ldquo;rape&rdquo; applied in this new context, will carry over some of the stigma from rape as meaning vaginal sexual intercourse, so that the overall effect will be to increase the stigma for those who engage in these other demeaning forms of conduct.</P>
    <P>However, it is not clear to us that potential offenders will be significantly deterred by any such change in nomenclature.  They are more likely to be deterred by a law which operates efficiently and punishes such offenders with appropriate severity.</P>
    <P>That is the type of logic that influences my approach to this matter.  They may have changed their view with regard to the extension of the definition but surely they cannot have changed their views with regard to the effect that would have. That still remains the same and in that sense it will have no effect.  As far as I can see, from the point of view of legislation it is a question of language and from that point of view I subscribe to the logic of the Minister's argument.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>During the debate on Second Stage of the Bill I listened very carefully to the various arguments put forward for extending the definition of rape.  In my response to that debate I explained in very great detail why I was not convinced that an extended definition of rape was justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of the argument for extending the definition of rape is that there are forms of sexual assault which do not involve sexual intercourse but which are equally as horrific for the victim as rape.  It is accepted that there are such assaults and for that reason the Bill provides for a new offence of aggravated sexual assault which has the same penalty as rape.  In addition the procedures which at present protect victims of rape will also apply to victims of aggravated sexual assault and indeed to victims of sexual assault also. Therefore, when one talks of extending the definition of rape we are talking of nomenclature and not about a substantive issue.  My view is that the existing concept of rape is well known and has <Col N="127" /> been well settled for hundreds of years. It is a distinctive offence and is known as such by the general public and to change the definition could only confuse matters.</P>
    <P>There was disagreement even within the commission as to whether the definition of rape should be broadened.  While three of the five commissioners were in favour of extending the definition of rape, two, including the President of the Commission, High Court Judge Mr. Keane, put forward strong arguments against extending the definition so that there is no clear consensus, whatsoever that the definition should be extended.  The creation of the new offence of aggravated sexual assault and the extension to that offence of the provisions dealing with anonymity and evidential matters meet all the objections to the existing law identified in the Fourth Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee.</P>
    <P>The proposal to extend the definition of rape does not offer any material benefit in the prosecution of offenders, in the legal protection afforded to victims or in deterring potential future offenders from committing offences.  Indeed, there is the danger that I referred to on Second Stage that a broadening of the definition of rape could work against the interests of women; that danger is there.  The perception of rape by the public could well be changed to the extent that the stigma and odium which the public attach to rape would be reduced, thus bringing about the opposite result to that desired.  I have heard no new arguments that would justify change in the Government's position on this issue.  The deficiencies in the existing law which give rise in the first place to the proposal to extend the definition of rape are, I am fully satisfied, being remedied in this Bill.</P>
    <P>As to the amendment itself, it proposes to include certain specified acts within the definition of rape offences for the purposes of the Criminal Law Rape Act, 1981.  The amendment would not extend the existing definition of rape which is set out in section 2 of the 1981 Act.  In practice, it would probably not have any effect other than to create a certain <Col N="128" /> amount of confusion and uncertainty. The term &ldquo;rape offence&rdquo; was defined in the 1981 Act so that the provisions dealing with anonymity and restrictions on the introduction of evidence on sexual experience would apply to offences ancillary to rape.  The definition lists these offences with the result that even if the charge is not rape itself but a related charge, for example aiding and abetting rape, the anonymity and protective measures of the 1981 Act will apply to that charge also.</P>
    <P>The literal effect of Senator Fennell's amendment would be that where a person was charged with one of the acts referred to in the amendment the evidential and anonymity provisions of the 1981 Act, as amended by this Bill, would apply. However, on the basis that these acts constitute aggravated sexual assault, that purpose is already achieved by the provisions of the Bill as it stands which extend the anonymity and protective provisions of the 1981 Act to victims of all sexual assaults.</P>
    <P>In regard to AIDs, this adds an extra dimension to the crime of rape. However, the fear of sexually transmitted disease has always been a very important element in the crime of rape.  I have no doubt that if a victim of rape were to be infected with AIDs, that is a matter which the court would obviously take into account in handing down its sentence.  As Members know, the penalty for rape is a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. I am not sure that any Member of the House is suggesting going further than that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for his detailed reply and to say how pleased I am to find that the contributions from the other side of the House and behind me were so consistent with the general approach to seeking this amendment.  To take up one of the Minister's points about the attitude or general thinking with regard to serious sexual offences as defined by aggravated sexual assault as against rape, the Minister must know that the women to whom these things happen at present say, and their <Col N="129" /> relatives say, and it is generally accepted, that they have been raped.  If there is forced oral sex, that woman says she was raped; she does not say indecently assaulted or, as it will be, subjected to aggravated sexual assault.  In her mind, in her thinking, in her whole concept of it, she has been raped.  I coped with a number of these women when I was involved in the battered wives' home. This was a common feature.  Women came in who had broken bottles and screwdrivers used on their vaginas and it was a very unpleasant notion and sight. They were raped as well and that is what I am trying to say.</P>
      <P>This is one of the strongest points that the rape crisis centres all over the country have made.  I will read their view on this out of their submission to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Women's Rights.  They said:</P>
      <P>In seven years working with victims of rape and sex assault we can find no evidence that penile penetration is any more disturbing than other forms of vaginal penetration or violation.  Many women found forced oral sex to be the most degrading form of sexual attack while others found forced anal intercourse more debasing.  The Act ignores the seriousness of forms of sexual attack other than penile penetration and makes the false assumption that one particular form of sexual attack is more serious than another.</P>
      <P>That is their view and it was the view of the Joint Committee.  Eventually it was the view of the Law Reform Commission. As some other speakers said, we can talk around this for hours and hours and I can read out my quotes and the Minister can do the same.  I can say what I think and he can say what he thinks and at the end of the day I certainly know what I want and the Minister is obviously determined to have what he wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While Government decisions were taken on all aspects of this legislation, and I have already said I think many of them are commendable; it is not a case that you cannot go and rethink and that the Government might not have a change <Col N="130" /> of mind.  We had this in the legislation I dealt with in the Status of Children Bill. It came out as one piece of legislation with a very definite approach but by the time it was finally passed it was fundamentally different from the original Bill.  I think that is a good thing.  I hope that trend will continue and that on reflection and further debate there will be a positive approach to proposals that are seen as a consensus of important views.</P>
    <P>I am not surprised about the minority report of the Law Reform Commission. It is a typical legalistic approach.  All the other people who want the changes I am proposing in the amendment are people who have dealt with victims, women themselves, many of them social workers, doctors and so on.  The legalistic approach of the minority group in the Law Reform Commission is one which says: &ldquo;Let us not make it uncertain.  We have cosy law books which say this is rape and that is not rape.  We have a clear definition that we know that and let us not get away from it&rdquo;.  That is what is wrong.  Legal opinion is, of course, conservative; traditionally they do not want to move away from what they have been used to and the <i>status quo</i> is always easier. I think they are reluctant to shift.  I would not want to think that our laws were made by people who had a firm and rigid legalistic vision.  I think in this instance we should be dictating the form to those who would hold that kind of traditional and rigid point view.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on what Senator Murphy said.  It is wonderful that he is supporting the amendments. In regard to his statement that he should not feel a sense of collective guilt abut rape, I absolutely agree with him.  I am not one of those people who believe that only women should be concerned about rape.  Indeed, some years ago there was a march by women's organisations in Dublin which must have been one of the biggest marches on a single issue ever seen in O'Connell Street.  Approximately 5,000 women came out for it.  The organisers banned men from the march and <Col N="131" /> this caused a lot of ill feeling and it was something I did not agree with.</P>
    <P>This very violent crime, which is a crime by men against women, can only be dealt with if men confront it and challenge it, for men to say: &ldquo;we have to have some concern about what is happening&rdquo;. For women today the crime of rape is a petrifying fear.  Women of all ages are fearful of being out alone at night.  They lock themselves into their cars.  If their car breaks down they are afraid to get out of the car and walk for help if it is late at night.  They come home early. Why should half of the human race have to be subject to a curfew because of this fear?</P>
    <P>Somebody told me recently that in the fifties there was a particularly bad spell of rape attacks on women in Israel.  Golda Meir was Prime Minister at the time. Requests were made to her that she should put a curfew on women.  It was suggested that all women should be in by 10 o'clock.  She said: &ldquo;Curfew is a good idea but I am going to put it on men&rdquo;. She issued a curfew order that all men were to be in by 10 o'clock or 10.30 p.m. As far as I am aware that reduced the number of rapes.  However, I am not suggesting that that is the solution.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that this area of male violence &mdash; which is something similar but, of course, worse than wife battering, the domestic violence which came to our awareness in the seventies &mdash; would be questioned, confronted and challenged, that in some way men would say: &ldquo;we are the sex that perpetrates this violence and we feel that in the interests of society and ameliorating this position we will try to see what it is in men that makes them commit these terrible crimes&rdquo;.  It is a crime in which men use their strength, their muscle and their superior position to oppress women.  It is as primitive and as basic as any oppression anywhere in the world.</P>
    <P>I have very strong and definitive views about rape and how it affects all of us and that is why I am taking such a strong position on this amendment.  I am aware that we will not get further legislation for <Col N="132" /> a long time on this.  Therefore, we should make it as up-to-date and as reflective of present-day society as we possibly can.  I am pressing this amendment and I would ask the Minister to seriously consider it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally agree with every sentence which Senator Fennell has uttered so eloquently.  I also believe that Ministers should be amenable to suggestions that the primary duty of a Minister is to bring in the best legislation.  I have no doubt but that this applies to the Minister in this particular issue.  I have also the particular concerns expressed by Senator Fennell.  We are all concerned about our children.  I remember a poem in the old school books which was probably before Senator Fennell's time: &ldquo;She is somebody's mother, boys, you know, although she is feeble and old and slow&rdquo;.  When we become parents we think of our own daughters, the society they have to live in and how difficult it is.  I agree also with Senator Fennell when she says that men to a large extent are responsible for some of the terrible conditions we have at the present time.  Probably the primary responsibility rests on men.</P>
      <P>With regard to this amendment, I have to ask myself if this Bill would be better legislation if this amendment is accepted by the Minister and I honestly have to answer I do not think so.  I am not a lawyer and I do not think in terms of a lawyer.  I believe that perhaps to have the qualifications of a lawyer would be a great asset to Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am an ordinary individual looking at this with a particular concern for victims, which the Minister also has and I have no doubt that he is as anxious as we are to bring forward the best legislation possible.  If he believed the amendment would improve the legislation he would accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of the day the person who commits the crimes which are covered in section 3 of the Bill will be given the same punishment as for rape.  In my view the important aspect is that society will be protected, as far as possible this problem will be eliminated and the perpetrators of these crimes will be locked away or <Col N="133" /> medically treated to allow them to be taken back into society.  I do not think the legislation will be better if this amendment were accepted.</P>
    <P>I accept, as I stated earlier, that from the victim's point of view, and indeed as Senator Lydon has pointed out and as accepted by the Minister, the forms of assault we are speaking about may be more vicious than the crime of rape. There is the problem that the victims of aggrevated sexual assault may have <Col N="134" /> suffered as much damage, or perhaps more, than the victim of rape.  That is a psychological problem with regard to the victim and I cannot see that that is improved to any extent by the acceptance of this amendment.  I believe the Minister has been very forthright with regard to dealing with this particular problem and I accept the logic of his arguments totally.</P>

      <P>One of the important things about legislation like this is that the language in it should be very carefully chosen.  I am just a little unhappy with section 12, the purpose of which we all agree with.  It states, in lines 21 and 22:</P>
      <P>... No evidence shall be adduced and no question shall be asked in cross-examination at the trial, by or on behalf of any accused person at the trial, about any sexual experience (other than that to which the charge relates)</P>
      <P>It is not the happiest of choices of phrase to describe a violent sexual assault on a person.  The words &ldquo;sexual experience&rdquo; are not the words I would chose.  I do not have an alternative word and would ask the Minister his opinion.</P>

      <P>Section 8 of the Principal Act provides for the anonymity of the accused.  Restrictions on the publication or broadcasting of matter likely to identify the accused as having been charged with a rape offence may at present only be lifted (a) on the application of the accused himself or another person charged with a rape offence at the trial or (b) after he has been convicted. Section 13, by inserting a new subsection (8) in section 8 of the 1981 Act, provides for another circumstance where the <Col N="137" /> restriction on publication or broadcasting may be lifted.  That is on the application of the Director of Public Prosecutions. This is to cover a situation where, for example, a person charged with a rape offence escapes before the conclusion of the trial and the publication of his identity is necessary to assist in his apprehension. No situation has yet arisen where the restrictions on publication and broadcasting led to difficulties in apprehending a person charged with rape but that is not to say that such a difficulty might not arise in the future.

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 7, before section 19, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;.&mdash;Section 4 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935 is hereby amended by the deletion of &lsquo;an idiot, or an imbecile or is feeble-minded&rsquo; and &lsquo;an idiot, or an imbicile or feeble-minded&rsquo; and the substitution of &lsquo;suffering from mental disorder or is otherwise so mentally incapacitated&rsquo; therefor.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the other area where I mentioned on Second Stage I would be seeking amendment, again reflecting as far as I could the views and feelings of some of the groups involved.  I am aware that the Law Reform Commission are not in favour of this recommendation and they give very detailed reasons in their final report.  For me to put forward the case for allowing for separate legal representation for the woman I cannot do better than again refer to the Rape Crisis Centre's submission to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights.

      <P>&ldquo;.&mdash;Section 4 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935 is hereby amended by the deletion of &lsquo;an idiot, or an imbecile or is feeble-minded&rsquo; and &lsquo;an idiot, or an imbecile or feeble-minded&rsquo; and the substitution of &lsquo;suffering from mental disorder or is otherwise so mentally incapacitated&rsquo; therefor.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the last amendment. I wanted to deal with a section on legal representation but I see that is a new section and I cannot so, I will have to take that up at a different time in a different way.</P>
      <P>This amendment No. 5 is self-evident. This is a point that many people made. The Law Reform Commission made a recommendation that it should be changed.  I would hope that after all our discussion and disagreement this would be something we would not have any difference of opinion on because it stands by itself and if we have the opportunity to change this perhaps we could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to start off by saying I fully agree that the words &ldquo;idiot&rdquo;, &ldquo;imbecile&rdquo; and &ldquo;feeble-minded&rdquo; are no longer acceptable in present-day legislation.  I am concerned that this amendment in its present form will cause some serious problems.  When the Bill was being prepared consideration was given to amending section 4 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935 but it <Col N="140" /> soon became apparent that it was not as straightforward as was suggested by the Law Reform Commission and the question involved medical, legal and social problems.  When it became evident that lengthy consultations with the various experts and interest groups concerned would be required and as the Law Reform Commission had indicated they intended to address the question of sexual abuse of the mentally handicapped, it was decided to defer consideration of the issue rather than delay this Bill.</P>
      <P>I would very strongly urge that we await the detailed consideration of the issue before proceeding with any change to section 4 of the 1935 Act.  I say to Senator Fennell that we agree but on examination of it, in an effort to try to do what the Senator suggests, we started running into such serious problems, medical, legal and social, that it would have taken us a very long time to come up with the type of solution we would require.</P>
      <P>An examination of the amendment put forward by Senator Fennell reveals the type of problem I am talking about. Section 4 of the 1935 Act, if amended as suggested by Senator Fennell, would in effect provide that it would be an offence for a person to have sexual intercourse with a woman suffering from a mental disorder or who is otherwise mentally incapacitated.  The problem is, what does mental disorder mean?  Does it include a woman suffering from a psychiatric problem as well as women suffering from mental handicap?  As the terms &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo; and &ldquo;mentally incapacitated&rdquo; are used in the amendment without any qualification or without being defined, it would seem that it would be a criminal offence to have sexual intercourse with a woman who is suffering from any type of mental disorder, no matter of what type or how mild.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I accept that women or girls suffering from severe mental handicap or infirmity must be protected by the criminal law, the question is how far does one go?  The term &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo; is far too broad.  It would include people suffering from mild mental handicap <Col N="141" /> who, though handicapped, still have sufficient mental capacity to lead normal lives but the question is, could it also include persons suffering from disorders such as anorexia nervosa or dyslexia which have no effect whatsoever on a person's ability to consent to sexual intercourse? To draft a provision in the proper terminology which will adequately protect persons who need protection from sexual abuse but which, at the same time, does not interfere with the personal lives of people suffering from a disability, which does not affect their capacity to consent to sexual intercourse, is certainly no easy task.  As I pointed out in my reply on Second Stage, it is fraught with complex legal, psychiatric and social issues.  It is, as I have already said, something that cannot be rushed and full consultation with all relevant parties and medical experts will be required before a decision can be reached on the issue.</P>
    <P>While I accept the intention behind the amendment and fully appreciate the concern which the Senator has and which I share, we are not in a position to accept the amendment for the reasons I have given.  I would hope that Senator Fennell, assured of my sympathy towards what she is attempting to accomplish, will understand my predicament and will withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his answer.  Is the Minister saying that at present there is no definition to cope with the needs we have?  Where is Senator Lydon now that we need him?  He is the one who has the expertise in this area. Surely a less offensive definition could be used to describe the severely mentally handicapped?  Perhaps the amendment I put forward is a little loose and could be tightened up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no definition readily available to us.  When we were talking about amending section 4 of the Criminal Law Act, 1935 we unearthed a whole lot of problems and that law would have to be amended as well to do what the Senator, and I too, would like to do. The Law Reform Commission have told <Col N="142" /> us that they intend addressing the question of sexual abuse of the mentally handicapped.  I think we would all be best advised to wait.  We are all in agreement. The Law Reform Commission are turning their attention to it and it would be wise to wait and suffer a little longer with terminology that none of us wants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I had thought, as soon as the debate in both Houses is completed, to convey directly to the President of the Law Reform Commission the views of the Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas there should be unanimity in what we are trying to do.  We should allow these people as the technical people to help us to get out of the difficulties I know we will find ourselves in if we do it here and now.  There is only one other alternative; to leave this on ice, and I do not think anybody would want me to do that either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise fully with the Minister's dilemma, but I think it is also necessary that parliamentarians should raise these issues to push others whose technical job it is to find a solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the spirit in which the raising of these issues is intended. There must be existing legal definitions for these awful terms, &ldquo;idiot&rdquo;, &ldquo;imbecile&rdquo; or &ldquo;feeble-minded&rdquo;.  I have the 1935 Act in front of me.  I did not check the definition; but they are only words and <Col N="143" /> they must have a meaning somewhere in the law as well.  I am not trying to trip people up but perhaps if we knew the meaning of the words, in terms of interpretation, it would be easier.</P>
      <P>The second thing, and this is more specific, is that section 4 of the 1935 Act deals with circumstances which do not amount to rape but involve unlawful carnal knowledge or attempting to have unlawful carnal knowledge of women who are in these unfortunate conditions. The penalty under that Act is two years. How does that fit in with the attempts to extend the law under this Bill?  Would engaging in sexual activities with a mentally retarded person which did not amount to rape be covered by the provisions of this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>How?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be covered under the Act as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act says a man commits rape if he has unlawful sexual intercourse with a woman who does not consent to it.  A person who is severely handicapped may not be aware of what he or she is consenting to so the question of what is consent arises.  What the Act of 1935 says is that in circumstances which do not amount to rape which could involve the question of consent, the maximum penalty is two years, which seems to me to be out of line with the severity of penalties we have in mind for a range of other offences against women. I do not expect the Minister to have an answer now.  I just think it is an important question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an answer.  In the case of a person who is not in a position to give consent, say through mental illness, that is regarded as rape.  Taking into account that the person might not have the ability to consent or not, it would be regarded as rape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the definition of <Col N="144" />&ldquo;idiots&rdquo;, &ldquo;imbeciles&rdquo;, &ldquo;feeble-minded&rdquo;, &ldquo;moral imbeciles&rdquo;, I have a whole lot of things here which I am not sure will readily meet the points raised by Senator Ryan and I do not think it will help the situation if I just read them all out.  I am advised that we do not have readily available to us a definition in Irish legislation and that is our difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to trip people up.  We were talking about this question of the Criminal Law Act and I had read something about this before, going back to the 19th century.  Section 4 refers to &ldquo;a person who in circumstances which do not amount to rape...&rdquo;.  By definition, under section 4 of the 1935 Act, rape is excluded.  This definition may well have been amended in the 1981 Act, but it appears to refer here to a person who in circumstances that do not amount to rape unlawfully or carnally knows or attempts to have unlawful carnal knowledge of any woman who is an idiot, an imbecile or feeble-minded.  It is not clear to me &mdash; maybe it is my fault &mdash; that an activity which does not amount to rape but which could involve a very severe sexual abuse of somebody is not considered rape because rape seems to be based on two things, unlawful sexual intercourse and consent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically my problem in dealing with the query raised by Senator Ryan is that it is in the 1935 Act and I do not think it has a direct link-up with the legislation we are dealing with at present. I will have the matter inquired into fully and I will communicate with the Senator.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">

    <Title>Garda Síochána Bill, 1989: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Garda Síochána Act, 1924 and the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925 to enable members of the Garda Síochána to serve outside the State with peacekeeping forces of the United Nations.  As Senators will be aware, Ireland has been called on to supply in the next few weeks a national <Col N="146" /> contingent of members of the Garda to serve with the United Nations forces in Namibia where they will, it is proposed, assist in the peaceful transfer of power in that country to its own population.  The Garda Síochána Acts preclude members of the Garda from serving outside the State and therefore, amending legislation is required to enable us to respond to this request from the United Nations and indeed to be enabled to meet any future such request.</P>
      <P>Ireland has taken a prominent interest in Namibian independence over many years.  Indeed, since we joined the United Nations in 1955, successive Irish Governments have spoken out against South Africa's occupation of the territory and have urged the international community to bring pressure to bear on South Africa to withdraw from the territory so that its people could exercise their rights to self-determination.</P>
      <P>One Irishman's name in particular will always be associated with the establishment of an independent Namibia.  The late Seán MacBride served as the United Nations' Commissioner for Namibia from 1973 to 1977.  As Commissioner for Namibia, Mr. MacBride's achievements included the establishment in 1976 of the United Nations Institute for Namibia in Lusaka, as the major training institution for the policy-making and administrative needs of an independent Namibia.  The late Mr. MacBride was a champion of the international effort for Namibian independence and it is sad that he will not be around to see its achievement.  There is no doubt that he played a major role in mobilising international support behind the quest for the independence of that territory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like at this stage to recall the main outlines of the history of the Namibian question.  In 1920, South Africa was entrusted by the League of Nations with a mandate over the territory of South West Africa, now called Namibia.  After the demise of the League, South Africa, unlike other mandatory powers, declined in 1946 to place the territory under UN trusteeship.  It declined also in 1949 to continue submitting reports to the UN on <Col N="147" /> the territory as it was obliged to do under the UN Charter.  Moreover, in 1950 it refused to accept the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice which held that the functions of supervision under the mandate should be exercised by the United Nations.  Throughout the 1950s and 60s, while South Africa consolidated its position in Namibia and applied to the territory many of its apartheid policies, the UN continued with its efforts.  In 1966 the General Assembly declared South West Africa to be henceforth a direct responsibility of the United Nations and the following year called on the Security Council to take effective measures to ensure the removal of the illegal presence of South Africa from the territory.  In 1969, the Security Council reaffirmed the termination of South Africa's mandate by the Assembly, called upon South Africa to withdraw its illegal presence and stated that if South Africa failed to do so the Council would decide on necessary measures in accordance with the Charter.</P>
    <P>Ireland fully supported the decision of the General Assembly to terminate the mandate and welcomed the Security Council's decision to assume its responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The legal position was clarified beyond any doubt in an advisory ruling of the International Court in 1971 which held that South Africa was under an obligation to withdraw from Namibia immediately, and that the member states of the United Nations were under an obligation to recognise the illegality of South African presence there.  This opinion was accepted by the Security Council and its efforts since then have been directed towards giving effect to these decisions.</P>
    <P>These efforts have crystallised around two important Security Council Resolutions which provide the basis for the present settlement of the long running dispute over Namibia.  Resolution 385 in 1976 declared it imperative that free elections under the supervision and control of the United Nations be held for the whole of Namibia.  Resolution 435 in 1978 endorsed an independence plan for <Col N="148" /> Namibia based on settlement drawn up the previous year by five members of the Security Council, the USA, Britain, France, the Federal Republic of Germany and Canada.</P>
    <P>Following several abortive attempts by the UN to persuade South Africa to accept the UN settlement plan, the United States Government in May 1988 initiated a series of talks with Angola, Cuba and South Africa to consider possibilities for a settlement to the conflicts in both Namibia and Angola.  These negotiations finally bore fruit in December 1988 with the formal signing in New York of a series of agreements which paved the way with respect to Namibia for the official establishment of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG).  The role of the group is to oversee the transition of Namibia to independence.</P>
    <P>The proposed programme for UNTAG, which is currently under review by the UN, envisages the establishment of a group comprising a military component of 7,500 of whom about 4,500 would be deployed initially, a police component of 500 and a civilian staff the number of which has not been determined. The functions of the police component, which will be required for a period of up to one year will be essentially to prevent any intimidation or interference in the electoral process and to oversee the conduct of the existing police force in Namibia during the transition period.  A high point in the transition process will be the holding of free elections which is planned for November of this year.  The UN police force will be organised in units drawn from national contingents from the following countries: Austria, Barbados, Fiji, Ghana, Jamaica, Netherlands, Sweden and, subject to the passage of this legislation, Ireland.  Contingents may also be drawn from Bangladesh, Egypt, New Zealand, Nigeria and Senegal.</P>
    <P>The Government have already agreed to a UN request to provide 20 military observers for Namibia and these will be drawn from the ranks of the Permanent Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="149" /> The United Nations has requested that the Garda contingent to serve with UNTAG should consist of up to 35 members of the 500 strong force.  The numbers and ranks of those it is proposed to send is as follows: one chief superintendent, two superintendents, two inspectors, seven sergeants and 23 gardaí.  The financial arrangements are likely to be similar to those for UNIFIL, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon.</P>
    <P>Senators will, I am sure, be conscious in discussing this issue that Namibia is the last major colonial issue before the United Nations.  A peaceful transition to independence there will represent a major success for the United Nations Organisation and, indeed, for the rule of law and for the principle of settling international disputes by negotiation. Our commitment to Namibian independence and our peacekeeping record with the UN in many parts of the world suggest that we should agree to help the United Nations in resolving one of its longest outstanding issues and one of its largest ever undertakings.  I am confident that our gardaí can play a distinguished and honourable role in the historic task of helping to bring independence and self-determination to Namibia and peace and security to a troubled region.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to the contents of this short Bill.  Section 2, subsection (1) empowers the Government to send a contingent of the Garda Síochána for service outside the State with an international United Nations Force and subsection (2) of section 2 enables the Government to determine the number and ranks of the members of the Garda Síochána who would be included in such a contingent.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill ensures that all the members of such a Garda contingent would be volunteers and that, ultimately, the decision about whose offers to serve would be accepted would rest with the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for registration, in this State, of the death outside the State, of a member of the Garda Síochána, his spouse or other relative while such a <Col N="150" /> member is on service overseas with the United Nations.  The section also provides for the registration of the birth outside the State of a child of such a member.</P>
    <P>In moving Second Stage of this Bill in Dáil Éireann yesterday, I remarked that the former Taoiseach, the late Seán Lemass, acknowledged on a similar occasion that our adherence to the UN Charter imposed substantial obligations on this country.  He referred on that occasion, which in fact was the Bill enabling Army contingents to serve on UN missions abroad, to the relevance of Article 29 of our Constitution, Bunreacht na hÉireann.  Senators will doubtless recall that that Article affirms Ireland's &ldquo;devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation amongst nations, founded on international justice and morality&rdquo;.  As Seán Lemass saw it, it was not only our moral duty but also in our national interest to support the United Nations to act in any situation in any part of the world that might endanger peace and to be prepared, where necessary, to contribute from our resources to the fulfilment of the UN's responsibilities in such event.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the sentiments expressed by Seán Lemass on Irish involvement on UN peacekeeping activities are as valid today as when he voiced them almost 30 years ago.  Our experience and proud record in this respect confirm me in commending this Bill to the House today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because it highlights the importance of this country as a peacekeeping force in the United Nations.  Ireland has an excellent record in the UN.  Our Defence Forces have done tremendous work as a peacekeeping force in many countries all over the world.  However, this is the first time that serving members of the Garda Síochána will be able to participate in this type of exercise and the Garda Síochána Bill, 1989, is drafted to enable this to happen.  Prior to this members who wanted to participate in the United Nations peacekeeping force had to resign from the Garda first and then apply as <Col N="151" /> ordinary citizens.  This Bill allows serving members to apply and that is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that 35 members of the Garda will be selected to become part of a 500-strong contingent to travel to Namibia.  Their function will be to liaise with the existing security forces to oversee and monitor the elections which will be taking place in that country in November next.  Of the 300 or more applicants for the job, there is now a short list of approximately 70.  The 35 finally selected will be chosen in the near future.  I will not be surprised if some of those finally chosen will withdraw from the mission, principally because each applicant had to apply by 3 February not knowing what the rates of pay would be or what conditions were applicable to the post.  It was a question of getting in the application first and getting all the details later.</P>
      <P>It is very laudable for anyone from any organisation to become part of a peacekeeping force for the United Nations but we have an obligation to make sure that this is not done at a financial cost to that person.  There are lots of questions to be answered.  After meetings between the Garda associations and the Assistant Commissioner these questions are still unanswered.  The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors are very concerned for their members because of the lack of information.  For example, it has not been stated how many hours per week they will have to work.  Will it be the standard 40 hours per week?  If they have to work more than 40 hours, will there be overtime paid?  Will there be Saturday and Sunday allowances?  In the event of personnel being in Namibia this time next year, how will annual leave be decided? Will they be allowed time off in that country?  When the Defence Force go abroad in a peacekeeping mission they are allowed to bring out their wives at certain times.  Will this be allowed for the Garda Síochána?  At the moment there appears to be complete lack of information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about a country which <Col N="152" /> is approximately ten to 12 times the size of Ireland, with huge variations in temperatures, going from very cold in the mountainous regions to extreme heat in the plains.  This will give rise to the question of different types of uniforms to be worn.  Transport or the lack of it will be another issue because of the size of the territory to be covered.  This is the kind of information that should have been available to members of the force before they made their applications.</P>
    <P>We have information on the allowances applicable to the post.  I have some questions in this area.  A married chief superintendent and superintendent will have an allowance of £23.30 per day; a single chief superintendent and superintendent will have an allowance of £19.95 per day; a married Garda, sergeant and inspector will have £17.02 per day; a single Garda, sergeant and inspector will have £15.33 per day.  Why should there be any difference in the allowance between ranks?  I am sure the cost of accommodation and food for all personnel in Namibia will be the same.  How can the Minister justify a differential rate of allowance between a single and a married man doing duty in that country, irrespective of rank, whether a garda or chief superintendent?  What would the daily allowance be for members of the Defence Force in a similar situation, and would the differentials I have mentioned apply to them?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take note of the points raised and reply to them in his closing speech.  When a member of the Garda Síochána goes abroad on official business, whether it is to a conference or to a seminar, there is a huge difference between the rate of subsistence applicable for that and the rates now proposed for Namibia.  I hope we are not sending a cut-price police force to the UN.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say what I have to say without interruption.  You had your few minutes on the introduction of your speech and I did not interrupt.  I do not propose to interrupt you in your reply, so I would like to continue my speech without interruption.</P>
      <P>In the make-up of the 500 contingent &mdash; and again I am getting back to something similar &mdash; there are eight countries supplying personnel, countries like Australia, Ghana, Barbados and some others.  I would like to pose the question: why are personnel not from countries like the UK, Germany and France in the make up of this contingent?  Is there any reason for it?  If there is, perhaps the Minister would inform the House in this regard.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt it will not be any picnic for our personnel in that country.  There will be at least 13 different dialects.  Their position will be difficult and it is up to us to ensure that these people are treated properly and have proper conditions when they are representing this country abroad.  My party have always supported our involvement in the peacekeeping role of the United Nations and will continue to do so.  I am quite certain that the Garda Síochána when they take up duty will not only make us proud of their efforts but will do much good for the Garda force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in addition to playing a peace-keeping role we have a responsibility to see that people in this country retain their freedom.  The Government must face up to the fact that crime is growing and that subversive activities are on the increase.  We need more gardaí. The number of gardaí is on the decline, particularly in the past two years.  The Garda strength two years ago was 11,400. Now it is approximately 10,600, which is a drop of 800 people.  It is currently <Col N="154" /> expected that this will drop even more. The new input of applicants under the new training system will take approximately 15 months to reach recruitment stage and it will take three years or more to put 1,000 gardaí on the streets.  Of the 300 recruits being taken on this year we will finish up with fewer gardaí because natural wastage will exceed 300.</P>
    <P>We are being asked to pass legislation here involving 35 members of the Garda Síochána.  The issue is much broader than this.  In the future the Government will have the power to dispatch personnel to take up United Nations duty without getting an assurance from the Minister that there will be no further reduction in the strength of the Garda Síochána.  In this country we seem to differ from other countries.  While we have a declining police force other countries have increased theirs.  In England and Wales the strength of the police force has increased since 1979 by over 13,000 people and now stands at 124,737.  They have recognised the need for sufficient numbers of police to safeguard democracy and the ordinary person.</P>
    <P>The rural Garda stations, as we know them, have provided an invaluable service over the years for the community. These stations are now dying because under the Government the run-down in manpower and the refusal to make promotions will eventually result in such a scarcity of personnel that doors will be locked on stations and the local community will suffer as a result.  The first step in the eventual closing of a station is the refusal by the Department to reappoint a sergeant to a rural station on the retirement of the incumbent.  This, of course, reduces the status of the station, making closure an easier task in the short term.  This type of policy will be welcomed by the criminal and those with subversive tendencies but it is abhorred by the ordinary law-abiding citizen.  If the policy of running down the supervisory ranks in the Garda Síochána is not changed, more rural communities may lose a vital service which has been of much benefit to them in the past.</P>
    <P>Morale in the force is low at present. <Col N="155" /> The embargo on promotions has had major implications.  It has eliminated the opportunity for promotion virtually everywhere.  The scrapping of the sergeants' and inspectors' promotional list was unprecedented.  It never occurred before within the force and was all the more ridiculous and damaging to the Garda when there are over 200 vacancies for the position of sergeants, and approximately 30 vacancies for the position of inspectors throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The knock-on effects of the embargo are considerable, with damaging effects on morale.  It has brought about total ridigity in the force and it is now virtually impossible to get a transfer, regardless of one's personal circumstances, because one cannot get a transfer unless there is a replacement.  As time is moving on, the situation is getting worse as more members are retiring or seeking career breaks, again reducing the availability of manpower.  Perhaps the Minister should consider extending the retiring age from 57 to 60 years?  I would welcome the Minister's comment on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to enable the Minister for Justice to send a number of gardaí to Namibia.  Our country was requested by the United Nations to send a contingent of gardaí to assist in the process of transition to independence in that country.  The function of this United Nations Transition Assistance Group is to assist in the peaceful transfer of power in that country to its own population. Other functions of the police force will include monitoring of law enforcement by the existing policy force in that country during the period of transition.</P>
      <P>This Bill had to be introduced because the Garda Síochána Act precludes members of the Garda from serving outside the State. Therefore, it was necessary to introduce amending legislation.  Since we joined the United Nations our country has spoken out against South Africa's occupation of the territory of Namibia. We have urged the international community to bring pressure on South Africa to withdraw from Namibia and let the people of that country exercise their right to self-determination.</P>
      <P>The history of Namibia and its independence goes back to 1920.  The Minister for Justice has given us that history today and the history of the occupation of Namibia by South Africa.  That country applied its objectionable apartheid policies to that country.  Several abortive attempts were made by the United Nations to bring about a settlement between South Africa and Namibia.  The USA initiated talks in May 1988.  These negotiations finally reached a successful conclusion in December 1988.  They came to an agreement that the United Nations would set up a force to observe the transition of Namibia to independence.  The group is to consist of military personnel and a police force.  Our country will also be providing military personnel and this legislation is being enacted to allow our country to send a police force there as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="158" /> I believe there will be 35 to 40 gardaí sent to Namibia.  I am delighted we are sending a Garda force and also some Army personnel as observers.  I hope they will be successful in their mission.  I welcome the fact that our country has been selected to send a police force to Namibia. The members of the force have to volunteer for service abroad.  Knowing the Garda force in Ireland, I am sure they will acquit themselves very well when they go abroad.  I hope they will benefit very much from their experience and that when they return they can let their colleagues in the Garda force know about their experience.  I am sure therefore that the Garda force in general will benefit from this expedition to Namibia.</P>
    <P>As regards Senator Kelleher's comments, I think some of his speech would have been more appropriate to the Estimate for the Department of Justice.  I think that our Government and all parties, both in the Dáil and in the Seanad, welcome the fact that we have been requested to send a police force to Namibia. I welcome the Bill and I hope that our force will be very successful there.</P>

      <P>To carry on from where the previous speaker finished, I would like to say that I have not the slightest doubt but that the force we send to Namibia will be a credit to this country. To that extent, and as somebody who has been closely associated with the Garda Síochána over the years, I would like to distance myself from the remarks made by Senator Kelleher.  Perhaps we are misinterpreting what he said, but nevertheless the reference to a cut price police force I find objectionable.  I think that perhaps he might clear the record on it. I would certainly go along with him if he says an underpaid police force, like most of the public service, if that was the meaning of it; but in the sense of a cut price force being not the full product or in any sense lacking&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that is the case.  I would like to look at it from the very broad view.  First I compliment the Government on involving themselves in this initiative.  It is a proud moment in international history.  We see ourselves taking a pivotal role in the emerging statehood of a new nation which has suffered more than its share for a long period.  It is significant as well to consider the countries with which we share those duties &mdash; Austria, Barbados, Fiji, Ghana, etc.  The question was asked by Senator Kelleher why did we not have police forces from countries like the UK or France, etc.  I can recall earlier debates in the UN, years ago, when they were putting together peacekeeping forces. The main reason which we should be proud of, is that countries like ourselves are trusted more by the Superpowers to carry out this kind of activity than those playing major influential diplomatic roles in international affairs.  It is simply a matter that countries like Namibia, Cyprus before that, Lebanon, the Congo and other places, will trust the forces of States like Ireland, Fiji and Ghana who had the same type of history in a previous century, or in previous generations, who understand what it is about and who therefore can bring something to them.  I would not be at all happy with what I would refer to as the Superpower states sending out their police forces.  I am much happier with the make-up of the countries that are providing personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sort of international peace initiative which I have called for time and again since being elected to this House, is the kind of activity that brings honour to the country and in which we may take a justifiable pride.  I have not the slightest doubt but that the gardaí who go abroad to Namibia will do us proud.  They are following in a long line of international interaction that goes right back through our history.  It could probably well be <Col N="160" /> said that the earlier roles of our foreign travellers to places like Africa, Central America, South America and elsewhere was a role of proslytisation which has now been overtaken by events and by history. In recent times we have seen that role develop into one of education and the building of social infrastructure in developing countries.</P>
    <P>More and more over the last 20 years we have seen our police and Army personnel play a powerful, influential and important role in peacekeeping. However, questions are raised, and without in any sense opposing the Bill &mdash; I support the initiative of Government; I think it is a progressive move and it is something which I welcome &mdash; I would like clarification on a number of issues. To take the first point, I see this also from the narrow view of how it affects the remaining police force at home.  What I see is 35 fewer in the police force.  I would like an assurance from the Minister that this is also a job creation exercise in that there would be 35 more recruits taken into the force.  I think we are entitled as a House to get a commitment from the Minister on that point &mdash; for a whole lot of reasons &mdash; that it is gainful and good employment and also in the best interests of peacekeeping etc. at home and the work of the Garda at home.  I would welcome a commitment from the Minister that this will lead to additional recruitment.</P>
    <P>What I welcome about the Bill is that it is not in any sense narrow: it opens the way for the Government to participate in similar initiatives in the future.  I believe this is something that will be developed over the years.  This leads to the need for additional recruitment into the regular Garda force and therefore I would welcome such a commitment from the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am not going to dwell on the whole area of conditions of service because, by the very nature of it, if you move people from one hemisphere to another there is not going to be an immediate translation of the same conditions of service.  Anybody who has worked overseas in developing countries or otherwise knows <Col N="161" /> the key word is flexibility.  However, I would ask the Minister to put on the record the fact that there will be no exploitation.  I am not interpreting from the Bill any intent by Government to exploit the Garda but it would be important to place on the record that the conditions of service for the people who go out there will be the very best that can be negotiated.  I am referring in particular to matters such as recognition of service for incremental purposes, for pension purposes and for leave entitlement. These are important matters.  I am aware that certain transport arrangements are made for getting to and from that country. I would ask the Minister to outline what arrangements have been made for family contact and interaction during that period.</P>
    <P>I am not familiar with the other Garda Síochána Acts.  Perhaps the Minister when replying would indicate that the term &ldquo;garda&rdquo; in the Bill also extends to banghardaí.  I would like an assurance that we are not in the business of sending an all male contingent by definition to Namibia.  I have many reasons for that. First, because it could very easily happen unthinkingly.  Secondly, because it shows development, progress and social awareness to have an international police force that would include women.  I would ask the Minister to clarify that in his response.</P>
    <P>I would worry slightly about the phrase in section 1 of the Bill &mdash; again I am speaking from recollection &mdash; where, I think, the words are &ldquo;duties of a police character&rdquo;.  This phrase worries me and I want certain assurances from the Minister as to what precisely that means.  I would like to expand somewhat on it. From travelling around the world one thing one notices, even in European countries, is that the work of the police varies considerably from country to country. I want to know precisely what is meant by this.  In this country we have a very clear understanding &mdash; more than most &mdash; about the importance of the police force for police activities and that they are very definitely not part of the Defence Forces, for instance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="162" /> On that basis I want to ask about the question of armed or unarmed police. We have a proud tradition of an unarmed uniformed police force.  The question of arming the police was a matter of major debate at the foundation of the State.  We came definitely to the conclusion that what we wanted was an unarmed police force.  I want to know how that fits with this UN peacekeeping force.  During the time when we had troops in the Congo perhaps one of their most major initiatives was carried out when they, as I recall, laid down their arms and showed their metal, without carrying arms, in the Congo at that time, in a gesture which made an international impact.</P>
    <P>Namibia has seen enough of arms. What happened there has not really come out into the open.  It is quite clear that much of the happenings in Namibia for the last couple of years have never made the international limelight.  Therefore, I am delighted that we have a presence in Namibia &mdash; I want to extend now slightly &mdash; and not just as a peacekeeping force. As the Minister will be aware, one of the earliest requirements of the local police force was to expand and increase local knowledge.  The effectiveness of the good garda was dictated by the local knowledge he had at his disposal at times of difficulty.  Therefore, by sending a police force from here to Namibia I would also see them as the eyes and ears of democracy and the eyes and ears of the UN, not just in the narrow field of peacekeeping but also with a view to ensuring that civil political liberties are protected. In a very real sense that is something that can be offered by our police force.  I also think that the recent extension, and to my mind improvement, in the course of training, the pre-appointment course, in Templemore will prove very useful to these gardaí going abroad.</P>
    <P>I would like also to raise the question of the Garda Compensation Act.  The House will be aware that the very nature of a garda's duties leads him or her into some precarious and often very risky situations. Because of that it has been found necessary over the years to enact legislation which protected in a special way <Col N="163" /> gardaí going about their duties, particularly an unarmed force.  To that extent it has been seen as necessary time and again &mdash; it is dealt with in courts on a regular basis, as people will see from newspapers &mdash; for gardaí to be entitled to claim under the Garda Compensation Act for injuries, risk or whatever arising in the course of their duties as gardaí.  It is quite clear, as Senator Kelleher said earlier, that there will be an additional risk involved in the work of the gardaí when they are based in Namibia.  With additional risk will come the need for additional compensation.  I certainly would like to be assured and reassured that those gardaí who will be serving as part of the UN police force in Namibia will have access to the same or similar protection as is there at the moment under the Garda Compensation Act.  I am not sure if that is the proper title of the Act.</P>
    <P>In terms of accountability, the fact that we have an international force of gardaí serving abroad is worrying in one sense &mdash; isolation from the authority of the State.  There is a clear line of accountability through the gardaí on the ground here right through to the elected representatives of the State.  Elected representatives are aware of the work of the police force as they are going about their day-to-day duty.  If there are any problems people are very quickly made aware of them.  They are quite regularly a feature of questions and debate in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It worries me somewhat that that little check or balance may not be there when our police force are in Namibia.  I ask the Minister to give me some sort of indication of how the authority or the responsibility of the State will stretch to those gardaí serving in Namibia.</P>
    <P>On regular occasions throughout the year we send Oireachtas Members to various parts of the world to attend conferences and various other functions.  I say, with the greatest sincerity, that we should bear in mind that at some stage in the future it might be considered important to send a small delegation of <Col N="164" /> Oireachtas Members to see how our police force are working abroad.  That does two things.  I am not talking about sending Members out in any kind of an inspectorial role.  I am asking that they would be there to recognise the work that is being done, to see for themselves the conditions the gardaí are working under and the effectiveness of the people out in Namibia.  It would also show a sense of solidarity and concern and involvement with the people of Namibia or wherever the place happens to be.  I feel it would be an important consideration.  It is not a matter of any urgency and it is not a matter which would be dealt with under the Bill, but there might be more recognition in this way for people doing work like that.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the proposals in this legislation for another reason.  The work of a garda is, by its nature, stressful. There are many aspects of the work of the gardaí which are very stressful. One of the things we are learning more and more about in stress is that, whereas people can bear a certain amount of it and can live with it, it does eat away at people over the years and does take its toll.  One of the great old sayings, that a change is as good as a rest, is certainly brought to bear on this kind of activity.</P>
    <P>We have seen in the past three to four years the effectiveness of the career break scheme in the public service, and indeed in parts of the private sector as well.  This to me is an opportunity for a small number of the gardaí to work abroad in new circumstances, in a new situation, and therefore they will be able not just to bring something out to Namibia but also to bring something back. There is not the slightest doubt in my mind but that those members of the Garda who are working in Namibia will also be able to bring something back to Ireland.  I have this very clear view of Third World and developed world so-called interaction &mdash; it should be two-way traffic.  It is not all give; it is also receive. We can learn a lot from them.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we will see this particular initiative as also something that will be a certain morale boost to our Garda at a <Col N="165" /> time when they need it very badly, because their job has never been more difficult, the pressure on them has never been greater and certainly, as I said at the beginning, they are an underpaid police force.  There is not due recognition in kind, in terms of wages, salaries and allowances, for the work they do, the risks they take and their commitment to the State.  It also raises for me something which has to be considered by the Minister. We are talking here about a UN peacekeeping force which by its nature will more than likely take place outside European countries.  I am talking now about further cases and not just the present one in Namibia.</P>
    <P>We have extended this Act and it will allow for the involvement of gardaí in other UN police force duties in other countries.  This raises the question of mobility between police forces.  I ask the Minister if this has any implications for mobility and exchange between the countries of the European Community.  We will be aware of the requirement under the Treaty of Rome for mobility of labour and free movement, etc.  Most professions and jobs are working towards the mutual recognition of qualifications and so on.  Does this have implications under the Treaty of Rome?  In other words, are we moving nearer a situation where a member of the Garda could exchange with a member of a police force in a European country, again under a properly organised scheme?  Many other professions are doing it.  All the professions I am aware of are seeking to allow for the free movement of personnel between different countries.  The first into the field have been lawyers, and certainly most lawyers now are able to interact and work in different European countries.  Does this have implications for the Garda?  I would welcome some response on that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill. I see it as a morale-boosting initiative.  I hope the questions that are being raised by the speakers will be responded to and outlined in detail by the Minister in his response.  I have raised a number of specific queries.  First, the question of recruitment.  Can we now look forward <Col N="166" /> to additional recruitment in the police force at home in order to compensate for those who leave?  Secondly, will the Garda Compensation Act be available to those members of the police force who will be working abroad, or will they have similar cover under some other arrangement with the UN?  Thirdly, will the Minister guarantee or indicate or give some kind of a commitment that this will also be open to banghardaí?  Indeed, he may request that it would include banghardaí as well as gardaí.  Fourthly, will the Minister also give assurances about the conditions of service, recognition of service for incremental, pension and leave entitlement purposes?  Fifthly, will the Minister explain in some more detail what is meant by &ldquo;duties of a policy character&rdquo; with particular reference to the fact that our police force is an unarmed police force and the implications that this will have for our members working abroad?  Sixthly, will the Minister also give consideration to the fact that there might be at some stage in the future a monitoring group from the Oireachtas who would have an interaction with these members of the force who are working abroad?</P>
    <P>Finally, will the Minister indicate to us in response to a number of the points raised both by myself and Senator Kelleher that he will have discussions with the Garda Representative Association and the Garda Sergeants and Inspectors with a view to clearing up the details of the conditions of service so that everybody's mind will be at rest on this particular issue?</P>

      <P>I intend to be brief.  First, I would like to congratulate the Minister. This Bill is typical of the progressive legislation he has introduced since he took up office.  It is an exciting Bill.  It is innovative and it is an idea which has done a lot to enhance the standing of the Garda Síochána.  Our Army have distinguished themselves abroad and I am sure the Garda Síochána will do likewise.  Certainly, the experience of travelling abroad and working abroad will do no <Col N="167" /> harm as we prepare for 1993, when we become a united Europe.</P>
      <P>I am not quite sure of the actual quotations referred to by a previous speaker, but it was something to the effect of a cheap Garda Síochána.  May I say that I do not look at it this way at all.  If we go back to January 1988, we see the announcement by the Minister of a multimillion pound renovation plan for the training centre in Templemore.  The Minister also announced at that time that a number of new gardaí would be recruited over the next three years, and that is progressing.  Three new Assistant Commissioners were appointed, plus one Deputy Commissioner, Mr. Eugene Crowley, who has since become Commissioner on the retirement of that very wonderful and famous man, Mr. Éamonn Doherty.</P>

It was made in the context of the subsistence and allowances being paid to our police force, which I felt were not sufficient.  I was not maligning the police force in any way.

We will leave that for the moment. There are many things I could say in favour of the Garda Síochána as a force.</P>

      <P>Article 29.1 of our Constitution, <i>Bunreacht na hÉireann</i> states:</P>
      <P>Ireland affirms its devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation amongst nations founded on international justice and morality.</P>
      <P>Article 2 (5) of the United Nations Charter obliges all members to give the United Nations &ldquo;every assistance in any action it takes in accordance with the Charter&rdquo;. Under Article 43 of the United Nations Charter all members undertake to make available to the Security Council armed forces and other facilities necessary for the purpose of maintaining international peace and security.</P>
      <P>It is in the context of these worthy objectives, as outlined in our Constitution and in the United Nations Charter that I welcome the Garda Síochána Bill, 1989, the purpose of which is to enable the Government to send an appropriate contingent of the Garda Síochána for service outside the State with an international United Nations force, to be known as UNTAG, the United Nations Transition Assistance Group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions in our Constitution and in the Charter provisions of the United Nations are most pertinent and relevant to the purposes and spirit of this Bill and to the request now addressed to the Government and to this country.  Various Garda Síochána Acts preclude members <Col N="170" /> of the Garda Síochána from serving outside the State.  This amending legislation will empower and enable the Government to respond quickly and urgently to the request from the United Nations. Following the successful conclusion of negotiations between the parties concerned in the dispute over Namibia in South West Africa, Ireland is now called upon to supply, within the next few weeks, a national contingent of members of the Garda Síochána to serve with UNTAG.</P>
    <P>As has been outlined by the Minister for Justice, Namibia is about to gain independence and, with this, elections will be held in November 1989.  In order to ensure fair and equal opportunity for all to vote unmolested, the United Nations are forming a police unit of some 500 personnel from eight different countries, including Ireland, Australia, Fiji, Jamaica, Netherlands, Ghana and other countries, to prevent any intimidation or interference with the electoral process and to monitor and supervise the activities and conduct of the local police force, SWAPO, during the transitional period. Our contribution to the total police complement of 500 personnel will be up to 35 members, consisting of one chief superintendent, two superintendents, two inspectors, seven sergeants and 23 gardaí, all under the control and supervision of ex-Assistant Commissioner, Stephen Fanning.</P>
    <P>The request to Ireland is especially relevant because of the very special position we occupy in relation to world and international affairs and because of the policies which we and successive Governments have been able to pursue since we became a member of the United Nations in 1956.  In the words of Seán Lemass, when he moved the Second stage of the Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1960, which enabled Army contingents to be sent on United Nations missions abroad:</P>
    <P>We have tried to deal with world problems and issues on their merits and to arrive at fair and impartial conclusions with regard to them in the light <Col N="171" /> of our obligations under the Charter of the United Nations and of our own national traditions and outlook.</P>
    <P>That quotation is as relevant today as it was then.</P>
    <P>In July 1960, the first Irish unit to serve overseas arrived in the Congo.  We in this country will be forever proud of the 30,000 personnel who have served as wonderful ambassadors overseas ever since.</P>
    <P>Like the Minister for Justice, I am confident that our Garda Síochána will enhance the outstanding peacekeeping record of the Defence Forces and that they will play a distinguished and honourable role in the historic task of helping to bring independence and self-determination to Namibia and peace and security to that troubled region.</P>
    <P>It has been said in the Conroy Commission report that &ldquo;the primary function of a policeman is to maintain law and order and to protect the person and property of the general public; to befriend any person who needs help and to assist in any emergency which may arise.&rdquo;  It is in that context that I join with the other Members to pay public tribute to our police force at all levels, for the excellence of the service which they have rendered down through the years since they were set up many years ago, in protecting vulnerable and unprotected people from criminals and in advancing peace and security in our country.  Indeed, I think that our police force have carved out a very special niche in the hearts and minds of our people and I have no doubt that they will carve out a very special niche for themselves as they travel overseas.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate on an occasion like this that we remember members who have been brutally killed in the course of duty; our hearts go out to their families. It is our earnest hope that none of our personnel serving with the United Nations overseas will suffer death or injury.</P>
    <P>However, this service in Namibia raises several questions which perhaps have not yet been answered and I would <Col N="172" /> be grateful if the Minister would deal with some of them when he is replying to this debate.  From reports it appears that accomodation may be varied for the various personnel who have travelled.  For example, members attached to large centres will probably reside in superior type of accomodation whereas those in the bush may well have to live in the rough and may have to look after their own cooking and so on.  It is also not very clear what type of transport, if any, will be available and what allowances will be paid to those who are volunteering.</P>
    <P>An article in <i>The Guardian</i> newspaper dated 24 January 1989 has outlined certain difficulties about the size of the security forces.  It appears that even with the United Nations cutbacks are very much the norm of the day.  At this moment the United Nations Secretary General is battling against demands from the Security Council that he make cuts in the cost of this independence operation. The five permanent members of the Security Council want this force cut from approximately 7,500 to 4,500.  This raises the question of what hours of duties will the members of our police force have to work and what will be their conditions and terms of employment.  I support the views of Senator O'Toole and Senator Kelleher who raised the whole question of additional and appropriate compensation for the additional risks that will be involved.</P>
    <P>Finally, I share with the Minister for Justice the view that the three decades which have elapsed since the Houses of the Oireachtas first agreed to our participation in international peacemaking missions have not changed the validity of our commitment to such work.  Therefore, we should now help the United Nations in resolving one of its longest outstanding issues and one of its largestever undertakings.  I share the view of Senator O'Toole that there should be the fullest consultation with the various police associations, particularly the Garda inspectors and sergeants and the Garda Representative Association.  The Minister has an excellent working relationship with these bodies.  I also have <Col N="173" /> confidence in the Minister and I would ask him when replying to outline for us any appropriate or additional compensation that will be available to these personnel who undoubtedly will be facing additional risks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole ended his contribution by listing a series of questions on which he needed reassurance from the Minister.  I will begin what I have to say by putting my questions first, the points which I am not very clear about.  One is to echo Senator O'Toole's hope that any vacancies will be made good, that the ranks will not be depleted at home while this worthy task is being carried out abroad.</P>
      <P>I am not clear how these recruits are to be selected.  It is to be expected that there will be a very large number of applications because, in spite of the reservations expressed by Senator Kennedy about possible rough service, this is an adventure which any full-blooded young garda would like to be engaged in apart altogether from nobler motivations of service to the country in the United Nations.  I think we will have a large application.  The Bill does not specify anything beyond saying it will be at the discretion of the Commissioner.  I would like to know something about the criteria which the Commissioner will use to select the successful recruits.</P>
      <P>Finally &mdash; this is echoing a sentiment which I noted briefly in the press this morning in relation to the other House, &mdash; there is the concern about the financial underwriting of this enterprise, that the State will not be at the loss financially for its participation in this peacekeeping enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, all the rest of my sentiments are totally positive.  This is indeed an historic Bill and for that reason alone I want to go on record as welcoming It.  Whatever disappointments this State has had in its experience since Independence, the performance of the Garda Síochána has not been one of those disappointments. Without being unduly flowery in my expression, the Garda Síochána have been one of the glories of <Col N="174" /> the State.  I may say it is doubtful if the State in its turbulent days of infancy could have survived without the help of the Garda Síochána &mdash; those days when, as the late Kevin O'Higgins reminded us so lyrically, they had to transact the business of Government with wild men screaming through the keyhole.  In those emergency situations the Garda Síochána proved their loyalty to the State and helped the stability of the State.  Since 1969 with the State under pressure from renewed violence from the outside, with its inevitable repercussions inside, the role of the Garda Síochána has been absolutely admirable.</P>
    <P>In short, the role played by the unarmed Garda Síochána has been one of the things which refuted the British black propaganda in the 19th century that &ldquo;Paddy could not govern himself&rdquo;, that in the light of the turbulent temperament of the Celtic spirit and so on one could not expect there to be proper self-government in Ireland.  The performance of the Garda Síochána has helped very much to refute that libel.  This is an historic occasion because now we are to see them taking up peacekeeping operations.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister paid tribute to the role of the late Seán MacBride in the Namibian story.  On the death of Seán MacBride I made an assessment of him in this House which I felt was a fair and honest appreciation of his overall services. Whatever doubt I had about his domestic role, certainly he was one of our most distinguished international statesmen and it is a fitting posthumous tribute to his memory that this development should take place.</P>
    <P>I echo the hopes of other Senators that in the course of time this new kind of peacekeeping at police level will in itself merit the award of an Nobel Peace Prize. I welcome in the broader sense the easing of international tension which has led to this development in the first place and the fact that there has been this quadrilateral agreement to bring about peace and self-determination in Namibia.  That is widely welcomed.</P>
    <P>Finally, I note with great interest the <Col N="175" /> composition of the proposed peacekeeping force.  As far as I can see, it would seem that we are the only member of the European Community supplying a contingent to this police force.  Am I right in that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>That still does not dilute too strongly the point I am going to make.  What I am saying is that it reminds us that when our Garda Síochána go to Namibia they will be joining a great international band.  They will be part of that great tradition of service to the wider world from this small island, the missionaries, the teachers, the business executives in the Middle East, the nurses, the soldiers and so on.</P>
      <P>It should point up to all of us that our role in the world is a truly international role.  Of course we are Europeans and 1992 is looming ahead and all that but one of the things that this Bill and all that is behind it spells out to me is that we should never make the mistake of thinking that our only contribution is to be subsumed within the relatively narrow boundaries of the European Community, that our role in the world and the perception of us in the world as a small independent and &mdash; dare I say it?  &mdash; neutral country brings about this kind of tribute to the role we can play and, for other fora, other assemblies, other policies, that should be kept in mind, that we are a non-European as well as a European State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>All my colleagues in the Seanad have welcomed this move and indeed, I think it is a glorious opportunity for us to show off our Garda Síochána.  I am certainly extremely happy that this opportunity has arisen to provide so many of the 500 who will be going abroad. I understand, as the Minister said earlier, the number is 35, which is a considerable proportion.  I am sorry it is not more but I still think that it is a considerable share of the 500 and I have no doubt that they will be able ambassadors of this country. <Col N="176" /> Certainly the Garda force have served our country and, indeed, our citizens extremely well since they were formed, irrespective of what Government were in power.  They gave of their best and they are a force we can always be proud of.  I would say they show a standard of professionalism second to none in Europe, perhaps in the world.</P>
      <P>All of us are at times critical of certain little actions that go wrong and critical sometimes of the way they handle things, but then we are not always in possession of all the facts.  Certainly in my book they show a professionalism second to none in Europe and it is great to have a body of 35 people going from the Garda Síochána to this distant land, Namibia.  I regret that such occasions do not arise more often and that perhaps we could send them somewhere a little nearer home so that we would get even more benefit from this force going abroad.  It will be a wonderful experience for them and I have no doubt that on their return they will share with their colleagues throughout the force their experiences and perhaps our force at home will benefit from the knowledge that will be passed on as a result of this exercise.</P>
      <P>Every year we have visits from various police forces in other countries.  We are all familiar with the visits on St. Patrick's Day of a number of police forces, particularly from America.  In April of last year we had here students from the Exeter University Police Studies course.  I hope the Minister has taken note of this and that he got a briefing from those people who visited us here last April and that he will consider sending some of our men over to do that course.  I understand it is an exceptional police course, attended by police force representatives from many parts of the world and great experience can be gained there.  I hope that the day is not too far distant when our own Garda Síochána can take part in that course which is not so far away.  I am sure many benefits will accrue from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also had for the Dublin Millennium last year a visit of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.  I think all of us will remember their colourful display in the <Col N="177" /> city of Dublin.  They paraded through O'Connell Street and were received by the Lord Mayor in the Mansion House and gave displays at the RDS.  They were here for 10 or 11 days and created quite an amount of excitement.  I think from those visits we should be able to judge the benefit of sending our people abroad.</P>
    <P>I regret very much that our Garda Band has not been abroad for a number of years.  I think there was quite an amount of publicity here a year or two ago when because of costs they had to cancel some visits that were proposed to some part of the world &mdash; I am not sure where.  The last time the Garda Band was abroad was in Switzerland in 1983 and five or six years is too long to have the Garda Band confined to our shores.  They certainly do a great public relations job with our own people here in Ireland in so far as the Garda force is concerned.  I am always glad to see them whenever they appear.</P>
    <P>I also believe that they could do an excellent job for tourism for this country and I would like to see them going abroad more often.  They have not been to America since 1965 and they have been to Switzerland twice in recent &mdash; well, not so recent times: 1983 was the last occasion and 1977 was the previous occasion.  That is the extent of their foreign trips in late years and I would urge the Minister to look into this matter.  I am sure the Minister would be delighted to go abroad with them also and I would be delighted to see him do so.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to have some person in his Department investigate the opportunities that exist, not alone for the band to travel abroad but for other members of the police force.  Perhaps an interchange could be arranged.  It is probably not an easy thing for a police force in a State to have somebody from another country come in and help out but certainly they could come in and see how things are done.  I am sure many police forces in Europe would welcome an opportunity to have Irish police, not so much partaking in but witnessing the way they do things.  There could be a useful <Col N="178" /> exchange of views and I think it would be extremely helpful</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister's Department are looking into the possibility, now that this legislation is being passed, of it being availed of as often as possible.  As a matter of fact each year I would like to see some members of our police force going to see how policing is done in other countries, perhaps not as far away as we are sending them on this occasion.</P>

The Royal Agricultural Show &mdash; it sounds a strange choice to send the police band to &mdash; is held at Easter of every year in Sydney and it is an occasion for participation by police bands.  It is a great window of the world, I believe.  They get extensive television and press coverage on that occasion and it would be well worthwhile for us to be represented because more and more people are now travelling between this country and Australia.  We get many Australians coming here on holidays and I believe, no matter what the cost, we would be amply rewarded in the tourists it would bring from Australia.  I urge the Minister to have somebody in his Department briefed to see where we can use this legislation as often as possible and, if possible, to have members of the Garda Síochána travel abroad on an annual basis and, indeed, have members of other police forces come here also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Members who gave a very gracious welcome to this legislation, I fully appreciate the views expressed by them.  On a personal basis I want to say to Senator Kennedy that his remarks struck an unusual chord.  It is not often that one hears a member of an Opposition party quote one of the founding members of an opposing party as he quoted Seán Lemass, indeed with such approval.  The non-partisan contribution <Col N="179" /> of the Senator reflects great credit on him.</P>
      <P>A number of matters were raised and I will try and respond to them as best I can.  At the end, in reply to Senator McMahon, I will deal with a number of matters which one could say are associated with what we are dealing with in the Bill because there is a lot of merit in what he said.  I have a lot of common ground with him on a number of matters which I will come to at the end.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators asked that the gardaí, even though they are very small in number &mdash; in fact I think it is one-third of 1 per cent who are being sent abroad &mdash; would be replaced.  Of course, any discussion on the level of this country's commitment of Garda manpower to UNTAG must acknowledge from the outset that it is an honour to the Garda Síochána and to the country as a whole that we have been asked to contribute to this international force, which will play an important role in the transition of Namibia to an independent state.  This 35-member Garda contingent will represent about one-third of 1 per cent of the total strength of the Garda Síochána. I am satisfied that the advantages to be gained from participation in this historic mission outweigh the loss to this country of the services of these members during their absence in Namibia.</P>
      <P>On the issue of replacements for those members who are sent to Namibia, I want to reiterate for the information of the House that the Government have decided that vacancies in the promotional ranks involved in the Namibia contingent &mdash; some 12 posts in all &mdash; will be filled forthwith.  The vacant posts at garda rank, which is the basic recruitment rank in the force, will be filled by gardaí returning from career breaks, which number 20, and redeployment as necessary within the force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the dispatch of the Garda contingent to Namibia overall numbers in the force available for duty at home will decline even though there will be a special round of promotions in the rank <Col N="180" /> of sergeant to chief superintendent. However, following consultation with the Garda Commissioner I have arranged for an increase in garda recruitment this year from a planned figure of 300 to 335.  The first batch of these trainees, some 85 young men and women, will be starting their training in Templemore in about six weeks time, about the time when their colleagues will be taking up their posts in Namibia.  A further 700 trainees approximately will be taken into the training centre over 1990 and 1991.  In fact, it is wrong to suggest that resignations or retirements from the force in the present year will outstrip recruitment.  Those who have been told that that is so should check it out.</P>
    <P>The selection of members of the Namibia contingent is at an advanced stage and the Commissioner has indicated that the members likely to be chosen will be drawn from a geographical spread of Garda divisions throughout the State. Senators can be assured that the dispatch of a Garda contingent will not result in any substantial reduction in Garda services in any area in the State.</P>
    <P>In relation to that, of course, when the Government were making up their minds on this matter consideration had to be given to the situation that exists at home. That is an important factor at all times and it can never be overlooked.  There is a crime problem at home but not anything as rampant as was suggested by the first speaker for Fine Gael, Senator Kelleher. Never in the history of our State has there been a more successful onslaught on organised crime than there has been over the past 18 months.  There is a problem but it is very wrong for Senator Kelleher to suggest that subversive activities are increasing.  The Garda have never been more successful in their efforts in counteracting subversive activities than they have been in recent times and the figures are there to show that in the first six months of last year there were more finds of ammunition than there were in the entire ten year period previous to that six month period I am talking about. Furthermore, in the same six months of last year there were more guns, weapons <Col N="181" /> and explosives found than in any six month period for the previous ten years. It is wrong to say that subversive activities are increasing.  I want to say that, because if statements are allowed to go unchecked they may be believed by others.</P>
    <P>I was asked a question on the allowances that will be paid in respect of United Nations service by gardaí.  One of the reasons for this Bill is to ensure that in future gardaí who volunteer for United Nations service do not have to break their service with the force in order to do so. Their pay and pension entitlements will remain intact and the members of the Garda contingent going to Namibia will have a continuing entitlement to their basic pay, rent allowance and boot allowance. Overtime and unsocial hours allowance will not be payable while in Namibia but instead a special daily allowance will be paid to each member of the contingent at a rate to be determined.  This allowance will be on the same general lines as the allowance paid to soldiers serving with UNIFIL in Lebanon.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators, and rightly so, raised the question as to whether banghardaí will be included in the Namibia contingent.  I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that every member of the force was circularised about this service, including the women members. The United Nations has placed no obstacle in the way of women members in the police contingent.  It will be up to the Garda authorities to select the membership of the contingent from among the volunteers who have come forward, whom I understand include a number of banghardaí.  The decision as to who goes on this mission rests totally with the Garda Commissioner who must have regard in selecting members for Namibia to the nature of the duty involved in the country.  It is he and his colleagues who will determine the suitability of volunteers for service in Namibia and, as of now, I cannot say who will finally be selected.</P>
    <P>Senator John Murphy asked me a specific question on what criteria the Commissioner might use for selection.  I am advised that the following criteria are <Col N="182" /> taken into account by the Commissioner: maturity; self-reliance; a very high level of fitness; a high disciplinary record and interview performance.</P>
    <P>I was asked about the length of time service in Namibia will involve.  The length of service of the UNTAG has yet to be finally fixed by the United Nations. It will certainly last from April until after the free elections which are scheduled to take place in November.  At this stage the information available to me is that a period of about eight months in all will be involved.  It is likely but as yet unconfirmed by the United Nations, that they would wish the police contingent to remain without a rotation or significant change of personnel until after the Namibian elections.</P>
    <P>A number of Members asked about the role of the Garda in Namibia.  The present police force in Namibia, the South West African police service, is effectively controlled by South Africa.  In the period coming up to the Namibian elections, many people who have been actively involved in the long running conflict in that country will be returning to their homes and their villages.  Some of these people will have been &ldquo;on the run&rdquo; from security forces in Namibia in the past.</P>
    <P>In what must be a time of tension in Namibia, the United Nations police force will be deployed in the police stations around the country to monitor the law enforcement work of the local police.  If breaches of police discipline of a serious nature occur, these will be reported immediately to the United Nations commanders who will intervene at a senior level with the South West African police service to bring about an end to the abuse or abuses in question.  It is felt that the active presence of United Nations policemen in the local stations will be an inhibiting factor in relation to any such problem.  It is also anticipated that the police contingent will have a role in relation to ensuring that the election process is not interfered with.</P>
    <P>On the question of costs and reimbursement by the United Nations, while the precise reimbursement terms have <Col N="183" /> yet to be notified to us, it is likely that payments will be made by the United Nations at a similar rate and on the same basis as applies in the case of the Irish Army personnel in Lebanon.  This would involve reimbursement of some US$1,020 per member per month for extra and extraordinary expenses, full reimbursement of travel costs and the provision of free accommodation, meals and medical care for members of the contingent.</P>
    <P>I understand that for the present, United Nations reimbursement at the rate of 60 per cent of amounts due were made monthly in arrears.  The balance of 40 per cent is not being paid at present because of financial difficulties in the United Nations caused by arrears of contributions by certain member states.  I am not in a position at present to estimate the cost of uniforms and items of equipment that will need to be supplied to members serving in Namibia.  Arrangements for the equipping of the gardaí are being made by Garda GHQ with the co-operation of the Army Quartermaster General's branch.</P>
    <P>On the question of conditions in Namibia and the deployment of the Garda contingent, I understand that a small number of the Garda contingent will be based at the headquarters in the capital, Windhoek, and that other individual gardaí will be attached to police stations throughout Namibia but mostly in the more populas northern tip of that country. The gardaí are likely to be in the company of other UN police force members at most times and a significant number of these are already likely to be English speakers at least at second language level.  The Fijian, Swedish and Dutch police contingents will be serving there.</P>
    <P>Parts of Namibia are desert country but the inhabited areas are more temperate in climate though generally a good deal warmer than in Ireland.  Namibia is roughly ten times as big as Ireland, bigger than Germany and France combined and distances, as were expressed by a number of speakers, between UN posts will be <Col N="184" /> considerable and the use of the country's network of airfields at times will be necessary as the UN Headquarters in Windhoek keeps in touch with its contingents in the countryside.  It is important to stress that all the parties to the dispute over Namibia have officially welcomed the presence of the United Nations transition assistance group and have undertaken to co-operate with it in its work.</P>
    <P>I understand that the United Nations intend that the police monitors in Namibia will be an unarmed force and in general that members of the force will not carry arms while on duty.  However, small arms will be available to members to equip themselves with in situations of personal danger, that is travelling in small parties in the wilderness etc., if that takes place.</P>
    <P>On the question of medical arrangements, the United Nations will look after the medical requirements of members of UNTAG while in Namibia.  In cases of serious illnesses, members will be transferred to hospital or will be brought home to Ireland by the United Nations.  As part of the selection process, volunteers who are otherwise suitable for Namibian duty will undergo a rigorous medical examination by the Garda surgeon.  The members selected will undergo a course of inoculations to protect them against a number of diseases they could possibly encounter in Namibia, including typhoid, cholera, polio, malaria and yellow fever.</P>
    <P>I have been asked what would be the benefits payable to the estate of a member killed on duty in Namibia.  In the event that a member of the Garda Síochána is killed on duty in Namibia special superannuation will be payable as follows.  First, a death gratuity of not less than the members' annual pensionable remuneration will be payable to the personal legal representative of the deceased and in the case of married members, a special pension up to a maximum of two thirds of the members' pensionable remuneration will be payable to the spouse.  It would be open to the spouse and other eligible relatives of such a member to seek compensation in the High Court under the Garda Síochána <Col N="185" /> Compensation Acts and there would be an entitlement to compensation under a scheme operated by the United Nations. Contributory benefits under Social Welfare Acts would also be payable by virtue of the member's social insurance record.</P>
    <P>I was asked about members who are injured on duty in Namibia.  The United Nations will pay for medical attention for any member of the Garda Síochána who is taken ill or injured while on duty in Namibia.  In the case of serious illness or injury, the member will be hospitalised or if necessary flown home to this country.  In the event of a member being injured on duty to the extent that the Garda surgeon certifies that the member is so incapacitated that he is unable to perform his duties and that such incapacity is likely to be permanent, such a member will be entitled to benefits under the Garda Síochána pensions orders.  In addition, the member would qualify for compensation under a scheme for compensation operated by the United Nations.  It would be open to the member to seek compensation in the High Court under the Garda Síochána compensation Acts.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators queried the number of applications for participation in the contingent going to Namibia.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that he is most pleased with the response to his request for volunteers for duty with the UN in Namibia.  In spite of the shortage of the notice involved, which was unavoidable, almost 600 members of the force made themselves available for selection.  The readiness of these members to put themselves forward for an assignment, which will involve a fair deal of hard work in an unfamiliar environment, is further testimony of the devoted service the Garda have given to this State down the years.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators have already paid tribute to the commitment of the Garda Síochána.  I am sure the members chosen for service with the United Nations in Namibia will equit themselves with distinction in the same way as members of the Defence Forces have <Col N="186" /> done and are doing on other United Nations missions.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other items I will try to deal with as best as I can. Senator Kennedy is right in saying that there will be variations in the type of accommodation that will be there.  That is so.  They will not be roughing it to the extent of being out in tents for weeks.  I am advised by people who have been there and who have reported to the Commissioner that there is bunk house style accommodation there and that there will not be a two-class situation or anything like that.  The gardaí will be properly looked after.</P>
    <P>Senator Lydon said that members of a high calibre should be going to Namibia. I am happy to say that the Commissioner has a large number of very well qualified and motivated volunteers to choose the 35 from.  It will be, as the Bill provides, a matter for the Commissioner's discretion. I am quite certain that there will not be a mass withdrawal from the volunteers who are most anxious to go.  In fact, the opposite is the case.  There was a genuine point raised about the lack of information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>That was what I was worried about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a problem with lack of information.  Members must recognise that negotiations for Namibian independence concluded unexpectedly at Christmas, less than two months ago, and since then that information has been passed on to the Garda Associations as it come in and the Commissioner has directed that his Deputy Commissioner, Mr. JP McMahon, would be available at all times to keep the associations up-to-date with matters as they are developing. This is satisfactory from the members' point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The working hours of the Garda contingent have not been finally decided by the United Nations.  However, the United Nations have assured us that the welfare of members of UNTAG will be of priority concern of the United Nations <Col N="187" /> commanders in Namibia.  Any requirement for members to work long hours over the short-term will be balanced by compensatory leave.</P>
    <P>With regard to hepatitis B, the position is that any member of the force who is genuinely at risk &mdash; this has nothing to do with Namibia &mdash; in this area will be provided with the vaccination.  This information is well known to the Garda associations. There is a legal requirement to sign a waiver in relation to this vaccine with which the prison officers had no problem.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole said that the word &ldquo;Garda&rdquo; is the statutory name of the rank.  That is so and it includes banghardaí. I understand &mdash; I am sure Members of the House will be glad to know this &mdash; that a number of banghardaí are at present undergoing medical examinations while consideration is being given to their applications for membership of the contingent.  It is a matter for the commissioner to decide bearing in mind what has to be done.</P>
    <P>On the question of family contacts and given the anticipated duration of the Namibian duty, eight months from April, no immediate provision is being made by the United Nations for home leave for family visits for members of UNTAG. The United Nations have assured us that in the event that the Namibian mission is prolonged, the normal arrangements for home leave will apply, but in special compassionate circumstances members will be sent home.  Those circumstances will be indicated to members before they leave.  Circumstances I would envisage would be death of a close relative, spouse, parent, child or serious illness of same.  These are normally the circumstances that would be taken into account.</P>
    <P>There were one or two other matters mentioned that I will put at rest.  It is said that a little knowledge often can be a very dangerous thing.  For fear that that little knowledge that is not based on fact might be taken as gospel by others, for the enlightenment of Senator Kelleher and those who have been advising him, I feel <Col N="188" /> I should say that the restrictions on the public service recruitment do not apply to the Garda Síochána since October 1988. One in three of promotional vacancies can be filled in the force as against one in ten in other areas of the public service.</P>
    <P>I come to Senator Larry McMahon, I fully recognise the value, as the Senator does, and importance of interchange between members of our police force and others.  At all times as far as I could I have encouraged it.  We have had gardaí as students in a number of other police academies and colleges at different times. We have had them in England and Scotland. I remember in 1981 the Commissioner at the time sought my permission to leave the country to preside at the passing out parade in the Scottish College of Police.</P>
    <P>We have had a number of gardaí selected by the Commissioner to attend specialist courses at the FBI college outside Washington.  This is something we would encourage.  At present we have members of other forces in this country helping and advising with regard to training methods and specialist courses.  It is intended that we will have interchange shortly between members of our force and the Dutch and Danes.  We will be seeking their help and advice on a number of matters and they have graciously agreed to help us.</P>
    <P>Senator McMahon mentioned the most enjoyable occasion we all remember in recent times, the visit of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to Dublin. About 18 months ago we had a special session there for four of our chief superintendents who were selected by the Commissioner to do a very specialist course from which they benefited considerably. It is no secret, and Members will know, that three of those four already have reached the rank of assistant commissioner in the force and have brought specialist expertise with them as a result of this interchange the Senator mentioned. I am most anxious that we would at all times keep in touch with what is going on in other areas.  We are very active in Interpol.  Deputy Commissioner McMahon recently represented the force <Col N="189" /> at the international conference of Interpol held in Bangkok before Christmas. We play a full role there and it is to our own advantage that we do.  We give and we receive.  That is what it is all about. There is no competition between police forces, except to do the job better at all times in an effort to defeat the criminal.</P>
    <P>Something near and dear to my own heart is the Garda Band.  I have helped them every way I can during difficult times.  I have never said this before, and I probably would not say it now but for the fact that the outgoing conductor, Superintendent Boyle, said it publicly in my absence at a farewell concert for him in the National Concert Hall around Christmas, but I agree with Senator McMahon that they are an excellent public relations unit for the Garda.  They help the public to have a better relationship with them.  One only needed to stand in Denny Street in Tralee at the Rose of Tralee festival to see 100,000 people cheering, encouraging and acknowledging everything the Garda Band did.  I would love if they could go abroad more often but we are in difficult times.  It is steady as it goes for a little while.  Perhaps when the economy improves, as I am sure it will, we may be able to start off what was put aside in 1983.  I remember one very good summer evening in Brussels in the early eighties coming down the Grand Platz and in the place of honour were the Garda Band.  I was very proud that they were performing there with a large number of Europeans listening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost could be repaid tenfold.  It is false economy not to send them abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  The regard we have for the Garda Band can be clearly seen.  Despite all the harsh measures that have taken place recently on many fronts the Garda Band are still there &mdash; there was a time when they were not there &mdash; and it is my intention that they will be there for the reasons Senator McMahon has outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not want Senator Kelleher, any Senator, or any Oireachtas Member, <Col N="190" /> to think I would ever lecture anybody but I feel strongly on one point.  Before people with the best intentions use phrases like &ldquo;Garda morale is rock-bottom&rdquo; they should think twice.  Garda morale, in my view, was never higher. They are so proud of their recent successes on all fronts of Garda activity in dealing with criminals that morale is high. Of course, there are complaints.  Naturally there would be with cutbacks in overtime, that is very human but the reality as far as Garda morale is concerned is that the Commissioner &mdash; present and past commissioners &mdash; has publicly on a number of occasions spoken most highly and favourably of the level of Garda morale that he has found, as has his deputy and assistant commissioners and the chief superintendents who are the divisional commanders of the force.  Any harm that might be done to Garda morale comes about by throwing around loose phraseology about things that may not be fully understood.  The Garda force is a wonderful force.  I totally agree with Senator John Murphy and others when they talk about the proud tradition of the force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">

      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh for allowing me to take this motion this evening.  Some of my friends have been teasing me about this subject.  They wonder about this newfound concern for animals that was not apparently part of my agenda up to now. In recent times we have all become more and more educated as to the interdependability of creation in the universe. According as the environment is threatened, we are coming to realise more and more how much the universe hangs together, as it were, and there is a <Col N="192" /> genuine increase in people's concern for animal welfare.  While I am aware of the extremes to which this can lead, nonetheless I am very happy to be a voice for those who most certainly have no voice at all so that when I go home tonight, if I do not gain any more graduate votes, I can look my cat straight in the eye.  I am proud also to be president of the Irish Anti-Vivisection Society having succeeded the late John O'Donovan of RTE in that office.  It is at their behest that I raise this matter.</P>
      <P>I would like to outline to the House what is involved here.  The Minister has responsibility for administering the Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876, which is the one governing painful scientific experiments on animals.  When that Act was passed originally over 100 years ago there were very few animal experiments, perhaps a few thousand a year in what was then the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.  In 1987, the last year for which figures are available, there were over three million animal experiments in Britain.  In this country over 37,000 animals were used in experiments that were, according to the Act, calculated to give pain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is very little else forbidden under the 1876 Act.  It gives the Minister very wide discretion.  There is almost nothing that cannot be done to a live animal in a laboratory if a senior scientist says so and the Minister for Health accepts his view that it is done in the course of useful research and necessary for the success of that research.  The Minister has a great deal of discretion under this long-standing Act but it has to be said that Ministers in our country have used their discretion in a very responsible way, as have their officials.  There is no general complaint with the Department of Health on that score.  One does not find here the kind of pointless, repetitive, cruel experimentation which one hears about in other countries and which one sometimes sees referred to on television.  One does not hear of experiments being done, for example, for frivolous reasons such as testing cosmetics, brake fluid or household cleansers.  Perhaps it is that it is not <Col N="193" /> commercially worthwhile to do such tests here since most of them are done abroad. It is also true, to give the Department their due, that the Minister and his predecessors have applied the 1876 Act, inadequate and outdated as it is, in a very humane and conscientious fashion.</P>
    <P>The real reason I bring this up this afternoon is that there is reason to believe that things are changing.  In 1987, the last year for which we have figures, for the first time in several years the number of experiments on animals in the Republic of Ireland went up substantially &mdash; 37,178 animals were used in experiments in 1987 compared with only 31,315 the year before.  This is an increase from 1986 to 1987 of over 6,000 animals, nearly one-fifth. That is one cause for concern.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that is puzzling and that is that the number of experiments in which no anaesthetic was used has gone down substantially whereas there has been an enormous increase from under 3,000 to nearly 16,000 in the number of experiments that were conducted completely under anaesthetic. One might ask what is the grievance there; this is an apparently more humane development that more and more animals are being put under anaesthetic. However, it is not as obvious as it seems. The majority of experiments consist of animals being injected with substances which are to be used in the manufacture of drugs and other therapeutic preparations to find out whether they contain any impurities.  These tests were not normally particularly painful or distressing so for that reason they were done without anaesthetics but also because, if one uses an anaesthetic, the value of the test can be called into question and its accuracy compromised.</P>
    <P>The great increase in experiments conducted with anaesthetics in 1987 suggests that something of a different kind is happening, the kind of test that would have caused severe pain or distress if no anaesthetic had been used.  So is there research of a significant scale of a different kind now being done that was not being done before?  That is one of the things I would <Col N="194" /> like the Minister to explain to the House. What lies behind these statistics?</P>
    <P>There is also another point.  In the previous ten years the number of experiments seems to have decreased but when there is a drop in the figures it may well be that some largescale research programme is being phased out or that money is not available because of the recession.  So we are not sure that the drop in figures over a number of years is a real turning away.  It now turns out that there was not a real reduction and that there was a substantial increase in numbers.</P>
    <P>Real reduction in animal experiments will come only when researchers methodically turn to alternative methods of research and eliminate gradually the use of animals in their work.  I am not an extremist in these matters.  I do not believe that animal experiments are always wrong but I do believe &mdash; and I think every humane person believes &mdash; that they must be justified.  The question arises as to whether scientific research on live animals is an old-fashioned laboratory tool, whether the best research is not conducted by alternative methods and whether the Minister is committed in principle to the replacement of animals in scientific research by alternative methods.  That is something I would be glad of his informing the House about. There is no public indication from the Minister of his support for the development of non-animal alternatives.  Admittedly, this all costs money.  Experimental procedures have to be validated very carefully.  Throughout the world it is the small animal welfare groups who have very little resources but who are backing the non-animal alternatives.  Even if we have the right to use animals for purposes of life and death, we still have a moral duty to look for alternatives.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to ask the Minister whether it is intended to look again at the 1876 Act.  All this area is governed by an Act which is well over a century old, which was drafted in very different times.  The world has moved on.  I understand that the question of amending the Act may arise shortly anyway because <Col N="195" /> the country will have to implement the Council of Ministers' directives on the care and treatment of laboratory animals. So, as in so many other areas, we may be told what to do by the Community. Pending that, I would urge the Minister to think about restricting animal experimentation in this country to <i>bona fide</i> medical research and to allow it where there is no non-animal alternative available and to put that by way of amendment into the Act.  The Medical Research Bureau and the Irish Cancer Society have already accepted the principle that there should not be experiments on animals where there is an alternative available. The public in Ireland would, I am sure, overwhelmingly approve any such humane advances.  Because of our particular cultural conditioning as a country we are not noted perhaps for our tender consciences about animals which is why I raised the personal point about myself in the first place; but at the same time our people are a decent people and would approve progressive and humane legislation and amendment of the law in this respect.  In a way what the society I represent are asking is that the Minister put into law what is the humane practice in his Department already.  The Irish Anti-Vivisection Society are appreciative of the co-operation they have had from the Department over the years.  They pay tribute to the genuine humane attitude of the Department.  What they are now asking is why can the existing good practice not be consolidated in law.  It would be greatly to our credit in Ireland if we did not have to wait to be told to do this, if we gave the lead ourselves.</P>

      <P>First, I am sure Senator Murphy will be pleased to note that I have been delegated responsibility under the 1876 Act by the Minister for Health so I suppose I am the appropriate person to answer in the House on this occasion.</P>

    <P>Data in relation to animal experimentation licensed by me under the Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876 is collected <Col N="196" /> by my Department on an annual basis. The most recent period for which complete data is available is 1987.  In that year a total of 252 persons were licensed to perform experiments and a total of 37,178 animals were used in these experiments. The number of animals used in 1987 shows an increase in the number used over the preceding two years, 1985 and 1986, but is comparable with the numbers used in the years prior to then. The position year by year since 1983 is as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The overall increase in the 1987 figures over those for 1985 and 1986 is accounted for by an increase in the number of rabbits and rodents &mdash; mainly mice &mdash; used for the development of products used in medicine.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="197" /> In 1986 a total of 8,696 rabbits and rodents were used for the development of products used in medicine.  In 1987 a total of 13,659 rabbits and rodents were used.  Most of this increase was accounted for by an increase in the numbers of mice used in the pharmaceutical industry for the acute toxicity testing of new materials used in the manufacture of medical devices.  These procedures involved injection only.  Surgical procedures were not involved.</P>
    <P>I should mention that despite our developing pharmaceutical industry the scale of animal experimentation in this country continues to be very low in comparison with, for example, our European neighbours.  In 1986 in the UK the number of animals used was in excess of 3 million.  In The Netherlands for the same year the number of animals was in excess of 1.2 million.  In Belgium approximately 1.2 million animals are also used annually.  In Germany between 7 and 10 million animals per year are used.  I quote these figures to put animal experimentation in this country into some perspective. Moreover, about 70 per cent of experimentation in this country consists of an injection only involving no surgical procedures.</P>
    <P>This is not to say that we can be complacent at any stage about animal experimentation in this country.  No experiment should be carried out on any animal unless it is justified.  We are fortunate in that animal experimentation has always been tightly controlled under the Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876.  This legislation &mdash; although a measure dating from Victorian times &mdash; has stood remarkably well the passage of time and the controls on experimentation under the Act are in advance of the controls in many countries where experimentation takes place on a greater scale.</P>
    <P>Under the 1876 Act no person may carry out an experiment where pain is caused unless he has been licensed by me to do so.  No place may be used for the carrying out of experiments unless it is registered by me.  Applications for licences must, in the first instance, be supported by the signatures of the holders <Col N="198" /> of certain offices prescribed in the Act. There are safeguards built into the Act in relation to the use of anaesthesia and for the killing of the animal if the effects of the anaesthesia wears off where pain is likely to continue or if serious injury has been inflicted.  Each application for a licence is subject to scrutiny by an inspector appointed for the purposes of the Act. Medical officers of my Department and a number of veterinary officers of the Department of Agriculture and Food have been appointed as inspectors.</P>
    <P>The inspector makes a recommendation to me on the licence application. Experimental facilities are also subject to inspection by the inspectorate. Experiments must be for <i>bona fide</i> purposes and no experiment is authorised where an alternative method is reasonably or practicably available.  Where possible the licences granted are for clearly defined purposes and for the use of specific types and numbers of animals over a particular time.</P>
    <P>The balance of medical and other informed opinion is that animal experimentation contributes to advances which lead to the protection of life and alleviation of suffering.  Animal experimentation will therefore continue to be necessary in the public interest subject to proper safeguards.  Alternative methods to the use of animals in all cases are not likely to be available for the foreseeable future.  My objective, therefore, is to keep animal experimentation to a minimum consistent with my overall objective to protect public health and to ensure that where experimentation is necessary the animals do not suffer any unnecessary pain or discomfort.</P>
    <P>As the Senator and the House may be aware, there is in existence a Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and other Scientific Purposes. There is also a Eurpean Community directive due for implementation by 24 November, 1989 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provision of the member states regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="199" /> In so far as this country is concerned the positive features of the directive are as follows: it broadens the definition of experiment and includes some procedures on animals not subject to control under the 1876 Act; under the 1876 Act State control was exercised only over user establishments i.e. the experimental laboratory. Under the directive establishments which supply and breed animals for experimental purposes must be registered and a proper level of housing, care and accommodation of the animals must be observed; it is explicit as to the circumstances in which anaesthesia may be dispensed with in animal experiments. No authorisations to dispense with anaesthesia may be granted in the case of serious injuries which may cause severe pain.  If an animal is in considerable pain once anaesthesia has worn off and if it is not possible to treat it with pain-relieving means the animal must be immediately and humanely killed; it makes provision as to how an animal is to be treated and cared for after the experiment and the extent to which an animal may be used in further experiments. Stray animals of domestic species must not be used.  The directive seeks to <Col N="200" /> encourage research into the development and validation of techniques which could provide the same level of information as that obtained in experiments using animals.</P>
    <P>My Department are currently taking steps to implement the directive. Implementation of the directive will also enable this country to become a party to the Council of Europe Convention.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would like once again to reassure the House of my concern to strike the correct balance between the need for animal experimentation and the need to keep such experimentation to a minimum and to protect experimental animals from any undue pain.</P>
    <P>I would like to express my appreciation to Senator John A. Murphy for raising this matter in the Seanad and giving me an opportunity to explain the current position in my Department in relation to experimentation on live animals and in relation to the preparation of legislation which will be necessary to comply with the EC directives.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 22 February 1989.</P>
