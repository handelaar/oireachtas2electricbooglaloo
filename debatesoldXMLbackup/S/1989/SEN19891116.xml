      <P>I have notice from Senator Pól Ó Foighil that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>An gá atá leis go dtabharfadh an tAire Oideachais aird ar dhrochstaid an Chórais Bus Scoile atá ag freastal ar an scoil chuimsitheach, an Cheathrú Rua.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Joe O'Toole of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The administration of the payment of cheques to substitute teachers in primary schools and the need to modify it to ensure that substitute teachers are paid promptly and regularly by arranging to have the cheque posted from the Department directly to the teacher.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Pat Upton of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to provide adequate funding for the Multiple Sclerosis Centre in Bushy Park Road, Rathgar, Dublin 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senator Ó Foighil, O'Toole and Upton as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matter raised by <Col N="462" /> Senator Ó Foighil and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators O'Toole and Upton may give notice another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I call the Order of Business, I wish to refer to a matter raised yesterday in connection with the speakers.  I am not sure exactly what the technical problems are but I believe that it is the people who are in front of the Cathaoirleach who dictate which speaker is on and apparently if two speakers are on at the one time there is a problem around the House.  Perhaps I could direct the attention of the people who have control of the speakers to this matter.  It is not an issue of grave importance but if there are two speakers on at one time there is a distortion around the House. It is up to the people in front of the Cathaoirleach to control what happens with regard to the speakers and it is not a matter for anybody else.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Order of Business, it is proposed to take items Nos. 1 and 2. Item No. 1 will commence now and the Minister will come in at 1 o'clock.  Item No. 2 will commence at 3 o'clock.  We will not sit later than 5 p.m. this afternoon but we will not conclude the debate unless the business has been concluded at 5 p.m. Next week we will have the Trustee Savings Banks Bill and the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Bill and there is a maritime Bill from the Minister, Deputy Wilson, next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>My impression was that it was agreed yesterday that we would not conclude item No. 2 today.  I ask that it not be concluded as there are some speakers who want to come in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the speakers which the Leader of the House <Col N="463" /> referred to, I do not think there are difficulties with the microphones: the difficulty is with the speakers.  There is one speaker pointing to the Press Gallery, there is one speaker pointing to the Visitors' Gallery, but there is no speaker bringing the sound back down here.  That is the problem.  It has nothing to do with the microphones or the people</P>
      <P>On the debate which is now beginning I suggest that it would be appropriate to restrict speakers, other than the Minister to 15 minutes each.  There is a fair number of people who wish to speak before 1 o'clock and this would allow everyone in.</P>
      <P>Would the Leader of the House clarify a matter which was discussed here yesterday and again at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges last night?  I understood he would clarify it this morning; that is, the question of the pairing of Ministers on Seanad business who may be required in the Dáil.  I am happy with the developments, the Independents are really pleased, but I think it should go on to the record of the House.</P>

      <P>I would like to add to what Senator O'Toole has said.  I also think it is the speakers but I do not think it is the speakers in the mechanical sense.  I think it is the human speakers, some of whom mumble and cannot be heard and could not be heard no matter how much electronic amplification was made available. I do not wish to join in criticism of the technical resources in this House.  I simply appeal to people who wish to be heard to ensure, by using their vocal chords that this is the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>And Senator Honan.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he can give me some information which would enable me not to seek an amendment to the Order of Business to take item No. 41.  I am hopeful that he may have some information for me.  I am not sure if it is to be given to the House publicly &mdash; that was my understanding &mdash;<Col N="464" /> or whether it is to be given privately to me.  I would welcome it if it was to be given publicly on the Order of Business. I would also like to know if he can give us an indication of when the Prohibition of Incitment to Hatred Bill, 1988 will be coming before the House because in the light of the positive developments in the Dáil it looks as if the Leader of the House may have some interesting news for the House on item No. 41 for us today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the amplification, if somebody is not capable of projecting themselves it is their fault but there is a technical problem with the monitors.  Let us get the technical aspect sorted out and then sort out the other things.  On item No. 41, I will talk to Senator Norris privately about that afterwards.</P>

      <P>What about the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, the pairing of Ministers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a guarantee that Ministers will be paired in the House. Senator Norris can be assured that from now on the Minister will be paired with an Opposition person and we will not have to have a break in business in this House.  This is an excellent advance.  For too many years we have had disruption of debates because Ministers had to go to divisions.  I want to thank the Leader of the Opposition for the work he did and also Deputy Higgins, a former Member of this House who knows the problems, has agreed and the Government have agreed that Ministers will not have to leave this House when there is a vote in the other House.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann &mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> (1)  Concerned to ensure that the Cambodian people are given the right <Col N="465" /> to self-determination through participation in free and fair elections in peaceful conditions.</P>
    <P>(2)  Concerned at the continuation of civil conflict in Cambodia.</P>
    <P>(3)  Noting the efforts that have been made at international level to bring about a peaceful settlement in Cambodia.</P>
    <P>(4)  Urges the Government to make every effort to:</P>
    <P> (a)  bring an end to the civil strife in Cambodia,</P>
    <P>(b)  ensure the non-return to power of the Pol Pot Khmer Rouge regime, which has been guilty of heinous crimes against the people of Cambodia,</P>
    <P>(c)  encourage the resumption of international efforts aimed at creating the conditions under which the Cambodian people can exercise their right to self-determination through participation in free and internationally-supervised elections.   </P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to make a statement on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me thank the Seanad for giving me this opportunity to outline the Government's position on the motion before us.  The issues raised in the motion are serious ones, which are of deep concern to the Government.  The Government fully realise the depth of feeling on the subject of Cambodia among Members of this House and of many ordinary Irish people. The Seanad's concern that Ireland be seen to behave honourably, and in accordance with the principles that Ireland stands for in the world, is laudable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me first set out some of the fundamental principles that Ireland &mdash; as a small, democratic country &mdash; upholds in the international community.  I am sure Senators will agree that first among these principles is the right of every nation to <Col N="466" /> self-determination.  A first requirement of this principle is that a country be rid of foreign invaders.  A second principle is that a country, once independent, should be allowed to live in peace and to run its affairs without outside interference.  In supporting these two principles, we are part of an international consensus because the Charter of the United Nations spells out clearly the right of every people to self-determination and clearly rejects interference in a country's internal affairs.</P>
    <P>There are other principles which, though not shared by all the countries of the world, Ireland upholds as a modern parliamentary democracy.  First among these is the principle that the rulers of a country should be chosen by the people in free and open elections.  Second is that universal and fundamental human rights &mdash; above all, the most basic right to life &mdash; are a matter of legitimate international concern, and an exception to the general rule of non-interference in a country's internal affairs.  Having outlined these general principles which we uphold, let me now explain how we have applied them in the tragic case of Cambodia.</P>
    <P>Cambodia is a small country with a larger and more powerful neighbour, Vietnam.  It obtained its independence from France in 1953, and from then until 1970 was governed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who combined the functions of monarch and head of government. Arising from the upheaval in the region caused by the Vietnam war, Prince Sihanouk was ousted by Lon Nol in 1970.  Lon Nol was in turn ousted by the Khmer Rouge in 1975, following a lengthy guerilla campaign against his US-backed administration.  Prince Sihanouk was briefly restored to power but was later ousted by the Khmer Rouge.  As we all now know &mdash; but, sadly, did not know at the time &mdash; the Khmer Rouge, in the name of a fanatically distorted ideology, engaged in a programme of mass collectivisation and population dislocation, using methods so indescribably brutal that over a million Cambodians died.  Among the many victims were close family members of Prince Sihanouk.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="467" /> Border clashes between Cambodia and its larger neighbour, Vietnam, culminated in Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia early in 1979, the ousting of the Khmer Rouge, and the installation of a government, first led by Heng Samrin, and subsequently by the current incumbent, Hun Sen, both of them former Khmer Rouge commanders.</P>
    <P>In this very brief account of the recent history of this tragic country, the issue that I am sure Senators are most disturbed about &mdash; and I fully share this concern &mdash; is the massive and flagrant violations of human rights which took place under the Pol Pot régime.  Sadly, it was only after the Vietnamese invasion &mdash; itself a violation of a fundamental principle of the United Nations Charter &mdash; that the full horror of the Pol Pot &ldquo;Killing Fields&rdquo; were revealed to a shocked world.  Unfortunately, we were also up against the &ldquo;non-interference&rdquo; doctrine which despotic governments continue to use to avoid international scrutiny of their human rights records.</P>
    <P>Applying the principles I outlined earlier to the present situation in Cambodia, the Government firmly believe that a just, lasting and comprehensive settlement must be based on the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cambodia.  It must include the withdrawal of all foreign forces under United Nations supervision.  We also insist on the absolute right of the Cambodian people to determine their own destiny free from outside interference. The exercise of this right must find expression in the holding of internationally-supervised, free and fair elections. And, of course, any settlement must ensure that the people of Cambodia are never again subjected to the inhuman barbarities which they suffered under the Pol Pot régime.</P>
    <P>The Government have been deeply concerned at the recent intensification of hostilities in Cambodia in the wake of the announced Vietnamese withdrawal of troops.  I say &ldquo;announced withdrawal&rdquo; since, unfortunately, the withdrawal was not effected under the supervision of the <Col N="468" /> United Nations, which has given rise to controversy regarding the extent of the withdrawal.  It is regrettable that the Hun Sen Government and Vietnam did not agree to UN supervision of the troop withdrawals &mdash; if they had, doubts on this issue would not be entertained.  We have been particularly concerned by the reported successes of the Khmer Rouge forces on the ground, since a central plank of our policy on Cambodia has always been that everything must be done to prevent the return to power of the Pol Pot Khmer Rouge régime which is guilty of so many terrible crimes against its own people.</P>
    <P>Let me now address a question which &mdash; as I know from comments made by Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas and by private representation to me &mdash; has been seriously misunderstood. This is the issue of the representation of Cambodia at the current session of the General Assembly.  I repeat again here &mdash; as I stated in the Dáil on 2 November and as the Minister repeated in the Dáil on 14 November &mdash; that the issue of the representation of Cambodia at the General Assembly is not due to be voted on during the current session of the Assembly.  In the past, this issue has been raised in the form of a challenge to the credentials of the delegation of the coalition government of Democratic Kampuchea.  Such a challenge has not been made at the current session of the General Assembly.  The assembly decided on 17 October last &mdash; without a vote &mdash; to accept the credentials of all delegations, including those of the delegation of the coalition government of Democratic Kampuchea.  This issue is therefore closed for this session of the General Assembly.  It will in no way be affected by the outcome of the vote on the resolution on the situation in Cambodia, which is to take place later today in New York.</P>
    <P>Whenever the credentials of the Cambodian delegation have been challenged in the past, Ireland &mdash; in accordance with the general principles I outlined earlier &mdash; has abstained in the vote, on the grounds that neither the Democratic <Col N="469" /> Kampuchea coalition, nor the government of Mr. Hun Sen in Phnom Penh, has received any form of endorsement from the people of Cambodia.  The last time that such a challenge was mounted was in 1982, when Ireland was one of the minority in the Assembly who did not vote in favour of the credentials of the delegation of Democratic Kampuchea.  It is our sincere hope &mdash; and I know that I speak also for all parties in both Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; that, at the next session of the General Assembly, the Cambodian seat will be held by a delegation which truly represents the people of Cambodia, following the exercise by them of their right to self-determination through participation in free and fair elections.</P>
    <P>The issue that the General Assembly is facing is the general situation in Cambodia and especially the urgent need for a settlement to the conflict.  The Assembly has been debating the question of Cambodia since yesterday.  It is due to complete its consideration of the question later today, with a vote on a resolution which will set out the Assembly's view of the situation.  I have already arranged to circulate a copy of the resolution, which has been tabled by the ASEAN countries, with the co-sponsorship of 75 countries &mdash; about half the membership of the United Nations.  I hope that Senators will have had an opportunity to examine it, particularly its operative paragraphs.  I should add that our delegation to the United Nations has been actively involved in efforts to persuade the ASEAN countries to table a resolution which would embody the fundamental principles for which Ireland stands, as well as being even-handed in its presentation.</P>
    <P>The draft resolution of the situation in Cambodia has been carefully examined to ascertain the extent to which the fundamental principles espoused by Ireland have been included in the text.  I hope Senators will share my view that the draft resolution contains all of the points which Ireland should regard as fundamental, notably: withdrawal of all foreign forces under UN supervision; restoration and <Col N="470" /> preservation of the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and neutral status of Cambodia; the right of the Cambodian people to determine their own future through internationally-supervised free and fair elections and the incompatibility of a return of the Pol Pot Khmer Rouge regime with the achievement of lasting peace in Cambodia.</P>
    <P>As a result of the inclusion of these fundamental points in the draft resolution, our delegation at the United Nations will vote in favour of it when the voting scheduled for later today takes place.  However, our ambassador has been instructed not to co-sponsor the resolution &mdash; despite having co-sponsored the corresponding resolutions in previous years &mdash; because there are some points in the draft resolution with which we are not entirely satisfied.  For example, we would have preferred a stronger emphasis on the need for an immediate ceasefire and a return by all parties to the negotiating table.  We also believe that the references to the non-return of the Pol Pot Khmer Rouge regime could be more explicit.  Therefore, in voting in favour of the draft resolution, our ambassador will deliver a statement in explanation of Ireland's vote, which will state clearly the fundamental principles on which our policy is based and which will particularly emphasise our total opposition to a return to power of the genocidal Pol Pot Khmer Rouge régime.</P>
    <P>The occupation of Cambodia by foreign forces was a fundamental stumbling block to progress towards a settlement, as well as being a transgression of one of the basic principles of the United Nations Charter which Ireland fully supports.  The Government consider that the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces provides a valuable opportunity to move towards a comprehensive political settlement.  We therefore strongly urge an immediate end to hostilities by all sides in Cambodia, as well as an end to all foreign military aid to the parties to the conflict.  Our delegation at the United Nations has already made a plea at the General Assembly, as recently as last month, that all sides to the conflict resist the temptation to seek <Col N="471" /> to advance their objectives by force of arms and instead devote themselves to the search for a solution by peaceful means.  Our ambassador will repeat this in the course of the debate on the situation in Cambodia later today.</P>
    <P>The window of opportunity provided by the Vietnamese withdrawal must not be allowed to be closed by the forces of intransigence.  The Government believe that the recent international conference on Cambodia held in Paris in August, under the chairmanship of France and Indonesia, managed to make worthwhile progress towards a settlement.  The conference had to be suspended before a number of important issues could be resolved.  It is now time to resume the conference and tackle these issues in a spirit of flexibility and compromise.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's sincere wish that the suffering of the people of Cambodia be finally brought to an end and that they be given the opportunity to put the past behind them and to elect a government which can lead the country on the difficult path to national reconstruction. To achieve this aim, the international community must prevent a return to power of the discredited and barbarous Pol Pot Khmer Rouge regime but it must also assist the government of the new Cambodia, which we hope will be elected in the near future, in the major task of recovery and development which faces it.</P>
    <P>As the Minister announced in the Dáil on 14 November, the Government have decided to make available the sum of £50,000 for emergency humanitarian relief inside Cambodia.  While such emergency relief is the immediate priority, we hope that, when peace has finally been restored in Cambodia, the international community will join in assisting the democratically-elected government in the massive task of reconstruction which they face.  I can assure Senators that Ireland will fully support such an international effort to assist the people of this small and long-suffering country.  Because, in the final analysis. we must remember that, in this case it is <Col N="472" /> the Cambodian people who matter to us in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I again thank the Members of the Seanad for their interest in this vital issue and to say that the Government fully endorse the motion that is before us.  I hope all Senators will unite around this motion which expresses the deep feelings of all of us on the tragic situation in Cambodia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I was delighted with the news brought to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges by Senator Michael Lanigan, the Leader of the House, concerning the pairing arrangements for Ministers on business here.  It is an enormous contribution to the efficient running of this most important Assembly and we welcome it heartily.  I would like to thank both the Leader of the House and, through the Leader of the Opposition here, the Fine Gael Whip in the Dáil, Deputy Higgins, who co-operated 100 per cent with our suggestion that this should be the case.</P>
      <P>I would also like to thank the Minister of State here present this morning, and through him the Minister for Foreign Affairs, for forwarding us a copy of the statement that will be made today explaining our voting position in the UN Assembly later on today in New York. We will be commenting on that and perhaps our views will be slightly different from those of the Minister but I thank him for his courtesy.  It certainly makes this debate more relevant when we know exactly what is being said on behalf of all of us in the UN Assembly today.  It is another sign of efficiency and it is the way I believe this House should be treated.  I thank the Minister, and also for his very considerable contribution this morning on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion before us today is an <Col N="473" /> extremely important one.  I do not believe any words from us on any side of this House this morning heaped upon this issue will really do justice to what is a most complex situation in the small country of Cambodia.  The whole issue of the advancement of the democratic procedures in Cambodia and the right of those peoples to self-determination really demands a national response from us in the Houses of the Oireachtas rather than a party political response of any kind.  It underlines the urgent need for an all-party Oireachtas committee on foreign affairs.</P>
    <P>There have been differing views within parties as well as among parties in relation to our stance, how we will vote today and the way this matter has been handled.  If we could set up an all-party Oireachtas committee on Foreign Affairs, that would be the forum for all of us, no matter from what political stance we approached this issue, to thrash it out and come to a national view as to what our representatives and ambassadors and what the Community should be doing and should be saying in relation to the whole Cambodian issue.</P>
    <P>At the outset I make a plea that Senators from all sides support the case for an all-party Oireachtas committee on Foreign Affairs, and let us use that as our forum to debate our views and to come to an unanimous view in terms not only of the issue of Cambodia but the many other complex issues in the foreign affairs field which will be coming before us and which I feel we should approach from a national perspective rather than a party political perspective as far as Ireland is concerned.  We will not do much justice to the complex Cambodian situation but we must try to influence the outcome of the vote later on today in New York at the UN General Assembly, as best we can.</P>
    <P>As we talk, the UN is preparing to debate yet again today this issue.  At the end of that debate there will be a vote by the General Assembly on a draft resolution tabled by the ASEAN countries, as the Minister has pointed out to us.  The <Col N="474" /> Minister detailed the main points of that resolution.  As far as it goes we would appear to be able to support the points as he pointed out.  However, it is rather startling that, notwithstanding the points in the motion that will be before the UN Assembly today, a Save Cambodia press conference issued a different statement on 3 November last.  That press conference was representative of TDs from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, The Workers' Party, the Labour Party and there were probably some Independents represented also and it also represented the views of Oxfam, Trócaire, Christian Aid and individual academics.  Their views differ considerably from those of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and indeed the news of the Minister of State's views expressed this morning in relation to the motion that will be voted on later today. We have a very representative view of Oireachtas Members and notable people outside the Houses who feel that we should not support the motion today. Yet, the Minister is pleading with us to understand the reasons why we are supporting it.  Having said we are supporting it, we perhaps heap more confusion when we say: &ldquo;We are supporting it but we must make a statement of explanation in case we are misunderstood&rdquo;.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs circulated that statement of explanation last night.</P>
    <P>The views of the all-party press conference on 3 November last was that this motion must be rejected by Ireland, as it is, in fact, allowing support for the Prince Sihanouk led force which speakers in the other House referred to as &ldquo;a puppet for the Khmer Rouge&rdquo;.  We have used that expression before.  The benefit of a Foreign Affairs committee must be obvious, with such different views as to what is in the best interest of this small country. Cambodia is a country that has endured much suffering, and we must ensure, above all else, that whatever we say or do will help to bring about an end to the civil strife and the non-return to power of the Pol Pot Khmer Rouge régime, to allow the Cambodian people the right to exercise their own self-determination and, as the Minister said today &ldquo;to get on <Col N="475" /> with living their lives in peace, free from outside interference&rdquo;.  So say all of us. Ultimately that is the whole objective.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to UN recognition of the present Cambodian coalition which will not come before the UN General Assembly today or in the immediate future.  Perhaps we could ask the Minister for assurances &mdash; I refer to his speech this morning &mdash; that the Irish delegation will initiate a challenge at the next session of the UN Assembly in relation to the right of these people to be seated at the UN. The Minister said: &ldquo;The issue of representation of Cambodia at the General Assembly is not due to be voted on&rdquo;.  We accept that now.  He also said: &ldquo;In the past this issue has been raised in the form of a challenge to the credentials of the delegation of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I accept that this challenge has not been made.  It was not made on 17 October and perhaps the Minister could explain to us why Ireland did not challenge these credentials on 17 October? Can he give us assurances today that before the next full meeting of the General Assembly, Ireland will initiate such a challenge if, in the meantime, we have not got absolute evidence and assurances that the Cambodian people are on the road to self-determination through free and fair elections?  Can the Minister give us an assurance that that is the Irish view and that between now and the next meeting of the UN General Assembly that is how the Irish delegates will behave?  That is the view of the Irish people.  We accept that today it will not arise.</P>
    <P>One of the points in the motion to be voted on today is the withdrawal of all foreign forces under UN supervision. That has not happened.  The coalition refused to allow UN supervision for the withdrawal of the Vietnamese forces in September.  Already, they are not holding to the four points that are before us today.  It is inexplicable that before 17 October there was not a challenge to the credentials, to use the Minister's words, of the Cambodian delegation of the UN when they have failed to comply with the <Col N="476" /> first item on the motion that will be voted on today.  Yet, we will be supporting a motion today, albeit with our explanatory statement, and one of the first issues on that motion is the withdrawal of all foreign forces under UN supervision.  The Cambodians did not allow UN supervision of the withdrawal of the Vietnamese, so how can we support this motion today?  The very first issue here should be thrown out of court and should be reason enough for us to reject the motion today, notwithstanding our explanatory statement, which I accept and welcome.</P>
    <P>We should not be supporting the motion today.  Other countries such as Sweden will not be supporting it.  I welcome the French ambassador's reported statement to the UN yesterday, as reported in our media today, on behalf of the EC Community, when he pointed out the absolute necessity to ensure the non-return to power of a Pol Pot-led Khmer Rouge regime under any guise. The Minister said that Ireland was not satisfied that the motion was strong enough in its emphasis &ldquo;on the need for an immediate ceasefire and a return by all parties to the negotiating table&rdquo;.  Of course, the motion is not strong enough on that.  We should not be supporting the motion.  We should not be voting for it on the one hand and then rushing in with an explanatory memo as to why we voted, knowing full well that our support of the motion will give rise to enormous international misunderstanding and confusion.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested, and it is worthy of serious consideration, that only the State of Cambodia should be seated at the UN at the moment pending free and fair elections, if we have to wait any length of time for them.  Perhaps both sides could have UN observer status and leave the seat vacant for the moment? That seat which should represent all the Cambodian people, it should represent their democratically elected Government, and it should be occupied only by a delegation following properly run democratic elections.  It brings into disrepute the whole principle of the UN <Col N="477" /> General Assembly to have the representation that is there at the moment from the coalition in Cambodia.  The delegation are sitting at the UN General Assembly representing a government who have refused to allow UN observation of the withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops in their own country. What are they afraid of?  What have they got to hide?</P>
    <P>Apart from differences of opinion in this country &mdash; they are not party political differences, they are within as well as between parties, highlighting again our urgent need for a foreign affairs committee &mdash; there are also differences of opinion in relation to the outcome of the Cambodian Peace Conference in Paris in August.  The Minister gave the impression in his speech this morning that it was a relatively successful conference. Oxfam consider it to have been a failure. A statement from Oxfam dated 3 November 1989, said they were concerned because of the failure of the Cambodian Peace Conference in Paris in August.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Dáil on 14 November said it managed to make worthwhile progress towards a settlement. That is an enormous divergence of view within our small country as to the contribution of the Cambodian Peace Conference last August.</P>
    <P>We cannot seem to agree on what is our best stance on this whole vital issue. We talk about democratic elections, the atrocities that have happened and the niceties as to whether they should be seated at the moment at the UN General Assembly but the bottom line is we are talking about the most fundamental human right of all for the Cambodian People, the right to life.  We cannot fool around herewith words.  We cannot bounce political views off one another, we cannot refer to niceties and explanatory memos as to why we do this and that.  We cannot do any of this without understanding that we are basically talking about the right to life of the Cambodian people with their tragic history of suffering in the immediate past.</P>
    <P>I agree that the Cambodian Peace Conference should be reconvened as soon <Col N="478" /> as possible.  Perhaps the Minister could indicate to us what moves are afoot if any, in relation to it?  It has been suggested in other fora that this should be done, that this may be done or that this will be done. I am not quite sure of the strength of the verb used.  Could the Minister tell us if it will be done and, if so, when?</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister here today and I welcome his comprehensive statement. I disagree still with the stance we will be taking on the ASEAN motion today and I have given my reasons.  I do not think we can be in a position to vote for a motion on the one hand and, on the other hand, feel we have to stand up with a rather detailed explanation as to why we did what we did lest there be any international misunderstanding.  I would much rather we had the courage of our convictions and voted against this motion today no matter what international economic niceties, delicacies or toes might have been stood on.  If we do not do this today, can the Minister assure me that, as I requested at the outset, the Irish delegation to the UN will initiate a challenge before the next session of the General Assembly to ensure that we do not have misrepresentation of the Cambodian people at the UN, which is effectively what we have today, when the delegates there are not representing all the people of Cambodia and do not represent the State of Cambodia, only a nondemocratic Khmer Rouge-led régime with Prince Sihanouk as the puppet-head coalition at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome this all-party motion.  I would also like to welcome the Minister to the House.  It is very good that we are having this debate before the vote takes place at the United Nations.  I would like to agree with some of the points which Senator Avril Doyle has made.  Unfortunately, if one were to follow Senator Doyle and some of her points there might perhaps not be quite so many nations represented at the United Nations.  It is not a requirement in the United Nations that the regime represented there be a democratically elected regime.  The People's <Col N="479" /> Republic of China and many others are rightly represented at the United Nations and they are far from being democracies. It is not either a requirement for representation at the United Nations that the regime should behave towards its citizens in a civilised manner.</P>
      <P>Sadly, we have had, and still have, many regimes at the United Nations who torture their citizens, who commit genocide against their citizens and Cambodia is perhaps a particularly flagrant, barbaric, horrific and obscene example. Nonetheless under the rules of the United Nations it is just as entitled as many other states to be represented there.  The query really arises as to whether the regime, ousted by invasion by another totally non-democratic group, should be unseated and that other regime installed with probably as little or even less validity than the previous one.  Indeed, the leaders of the present regime are ex-members of the Khmer Rouge.  It is not just as simple as Senator Doyle is suggesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cambodia is a very ancient state indeed.  The Minister has mentioned some of its history.  I have been in south-east Asia, I have been on the Cambodian border, but I have never been into Cambodia. It is, by all accounts, a very beautiful country.  I have met many Cambodians and despite the atrocities that have occurred there, those people I have met were very pleasant and by all accounts were nice people who, throughout most of their history, lived a very peaceful existence, had a very prosperous and very beautiful and, by the standards of that particular area, a relatively civilised and advanced existence.  Cambodia was dragged into the Vietnam war almost by accident.  The Vietnamese were using Cambodian territory as a way of supplying their troops in South Vietnam. The United States moved in to prevent this and indeed had been bombing Cambodia and killing many civilians there for a long time before they actually moved in.  Cambodia became involved in a situation, which still exists, of being torn between big power pretensions.  Let us be clear about this.  I do not think it has <Col N="480" /> been mentioned so far, not even in the Minister's speech, although he has implied it that the Khmer Rouge is not some sort of isolated group.  It is a left wing Communist, Marxist organisation openly supported by the largest country in the world, the self-same People's Republic of China who do not apologise for that support.  They openly support the Khmer Rouge.</P>
    <P>The Vietnamese who invaded Cambodia, on the other hand, were supported by the Soviet Union and as the United States were on a period of friendship with China or anti-Soviet union policy one finds the situation is that the United States effectively has also been supporting the Khmer Rouge.  We may find this appalling but we are here as are the unfortunate Cambodian people, right in the middle of big power politics with very little, whatever they may protest, real concern for those unfortunates who happen to get in their way.  It is not at all a simple situation.  Even in terms of local South-East Asian politics it is not such a clear-cut situation.  Perhaps some speakers here in the Oireachtas, and people in the media, have tended, very understandably, because of our horror at what has happened in Cambodia, to underestimate the complexities of the situation even in South-East Asia.</P>
    <P>Thailand, the one and only country in South-East Asia which is not and never was an ex-colonial country &mdash; it managed somehow or other to maintain its independence &mdash; for very good reasons has given support and succour to this same Khmer Rouge because of the fear of the military might of Vietnam which is the fourth or fifth largest military power in the world, even though it may seem a relatively small country.  The other ASEAN countries which are referred to here also have their grave reservations about Russian backed Vietnam countries like Malaysia.  The Philippines are trying desperately to pull themselves out of the morass left by President Marcos and they have the gravest reservations about attempting to suggest that a simple condemnation of the Khmer Rouge &mdash; and then we walk away from it &mdash; will solve <Col N="481" /> the situation.  The unfortunate reality is that the Khmer Rouge are a large, highly disciplined and extremely effective military group who, if we cannot find some compromise solution, will take over Cambodia again.  That will be the reality of it.  We may be very happy at having passed resolutions saying we will refuse to recognise them, that we condemn them, and so on, but effectively we will not have done very much to moderate or reduce the likely return of the sort of genocidal brutality which they previously exercised. There is a very slender hope, but a hope nonetheless, in Prince Sihanouk.</P>
    <P>We are talking here about the horrors of the Khmer Rouge and in these particular terms, as a medical man, I think of what they did in the hospitals when they took over in Phnom Penh.  They turned all the people out of the hospitals irrespective of their condition, whether they had been operated on that morning or whether they were dying.  No matter what their condition they were just forcibly removed from the hospitals.  The relations, if they could, tried to carry them and many of them died literally as they were being carried out of the hospitals, an appalling situation.  Sons and daughters of anyone, not just prominent people, who had, for example, a university education, or even third level education of any sort, were executed, usually in a very barbarous manner. Prince Sihanouk, as the Minister mentioned, lost several members of his family.  He has no love for the Khmer Rouge but he, nonetheless, in an attempt, however slender, to bring peace to his country has entered into what is effectively a coalition with the Khmer Rouge.</P>
    <P>I greatly sympathise with the idea that we should simply go into the United Nations and condemn this horrific regime, but if one stands back for a moment and thinks, as Senator Doyle rightly said, and as the Minister said, that really we are concerned about the people of Cambodia, these very nice and lovely people who have gone through these horrors, then perhaps we have to take a more difficult attitude but nonetheless an <Col N="482" /> attitude in which we hope somehow or other to play some small part in actually giving them a chance of that peaceful existence that we would like them to have.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister.  I do not think this United Nations resolution is sufficiently strong but I do not think we should vote against it.  With regard to the withdrawal of all foreign forces under United Nations supervision, this is a fundamental point of Irish policy right down the years from when we first joined the United Nations.  If we come away from that now, we are certainly entering into a very new, very difficult and very dangerous situation.</P>
    <P>It is true, however, that the full horrors of the Khmer Rouge regime of Pol Pot and his henchmen were not revealed until the invasion of Cambodia by the Vietnamese took place.  A similar situation existed in Europe in the Second World War.  The sheer horrors of the concentration camps, the executions and tortures were not revealed until after the invasion.  Only today are we beginning to realise that in the Soviet Union even greater horrors were taking place.</P>
    <P>I cannot see an Irish Government voting at the United Nations against a resolution for the withdrawal of all foreign forces.  It will be difficult for us to vote against the restoration and preservation of independent sovereignty, territorial integrity and the neutral status of Cambodia.  I wish we had territorial integrity for this country.  Another point in the resolution is the right of the Cambodian people to determine their own future through internationally supervised, free and fair elections.  We have just succeeded in Namibia in what seemed at first a totally intractable situation in playing a part in ensuring free elections which have now occurred.  Is it too much to hope that we will somehow or other manage the same in Cambodia?</P>
    <P>The difficulty is in the last part of that resolution, the incompatibility of a return of the Pol Pot Khmer Rouge regime with the achievement of lasting peace in Cambodia. Passing resolutions against the Khmer Rouge will not make one whit of <Col N="483" /> difference in a positive sense regarding that.  The only possible way in which we can hope for anything is by trying to bring together all the other groups there. Prince Sihanouk has shown great personal courage and sacrifice in joining, in an effort to find peace, the ASEAN countries who are very anxious to see a return to peace in the whole South-East Asia region.  Now, we have the removal of the expansionist Soviet threat, a much chastened Vietnam and a China, which, unfortunately, seems determined to revert to its previous horrific attitude towards its own people and still be imperialist in the region, but which nonetheless, is showing obvious signs of change.</P>
    <P>It is up to our delegation to vote for this resolution but to make it clear that we would like to see it even stronger. It would be irresponsible of us to vote against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Chair, I propose to share my 15 minutes with my colleague, Senator Norris.  I appreciate that international politics put pressures on governments that people like myself do not have to deal with.  I know the Minister of State very well by now and I know that nobody would dispute his considerable concern and desire to do what is right and good on many issues of international politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us reflect briefly, and I do not think it will take a lot of time, on the realities. The first reality is that the Khmer Rouge were perhaps the greatest genocidal regime since Hitler.  They rank with, perhaps, Hitler and Stalin.  One thing needs to be said about that, namely, that I resent the way news management seems to operate when the main morning news on RTE this morning talked about the alleged massacres of the Khmer Rouge. Can one imagine the outrage there would be if RTE said, &ldquo;the alleged massacres of Hitler&rdquo;?  Who manipulates news to even cast the slightest doubt?  They are not alleged.  We have all seen to our horror the piles of skulls all over Cambodia that <Col N="484" /> are the consequence of this mass murderous regime.</P>
    <P>The second thing that needs to be said is that while we posture about non-interference and the will of the people of Cambodia we are actually telling them who their leader is going to be in that resolution.  The resolution specifically refers to the Cambodian people under the leadership of Samdoch Norodom Sihanouk.  We cannot carry on with these postures.  We are actually not saying to them, &ldquo;you must choose freely&rdquo;.  We are saying, &ldquo;we are telling you who you will be led by and after that you can decide what you like but we are giving you a leader&rdquo;.  He happens to be a person with no army, no influence and no power.  He happened to be a despot himself 20 years ago but has actually found a use for himself and been found useful to camouflage the real power in so-called democratic Kampuchea which is the Khmer Rouge and which still is Pol Pot.</P>
    <P>No amount of rhetoric and no amount of verbal niceties can get away from that. The subsequent reality that follows directly from that is that it is ten years since the Khmer Rouge were driven out of Cambodia by the army of Vietnam.  I have always watched with amazement the two standards of the western world which stood up and cheered when Tanzania invaded Uganda and drove out Idi Amin and then stood up and deplored the action of the Vietnamese army in driving out a regime that was incredibly and enormously more offensive than Idi Amin's dangerous and maniac regime, a regime which killed a huge proportion of its own people and which destroyed the economy of its own country.  Yet, because we all liked and the international community approved of Julius Nyerere, we saw the moral worth of what he did but when a Government that had the misfortune to have defeated the greatest military power in the world in a war did the same thing in Cambodia we struck moral positions about armed intervention and about the sovereignty of individual countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What needs to go on the record is that the problem that the misfortunate Cambodian people have is the same problem that the misfortunate people of Vietnam face.  It is an unfortunate fact that they are allied to and linked to a country which beat the United States in war.  The United States will not forgive them and has spent 20 years getting its own back on the people of Vietnam for that fact.  That is the most profound moral disgrace of the whole issue that we, and other western democracies, should allow ourselves to be seduced into striking what we pretend is a moral position, but which is nothing more than the continuing attempt of the United States to gain retribution against the one small country that beat it in a war.  It is morally reprehensible.</P>
      <P>It is a fact that there would be no Khmer Rouge in existence today if the United States and China had not kept it in existence.  It had no physical, moral or political base.  It had no money and very little weaponry when it was driven out ten years ago.  China and the United States, with the connivance of other countries including ourselves, have rebuilt, reequipped, reformed, rearmed and put together again what was a dead, discredited, murderous regime.  It is on our consciences if that regime comes back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised the issue of our recognition of Pol Pot eight years ago in this House and at that stage no member of the then Government, which had a Fine Gael Minister for Foreign Affairs, was prepared to even contemplate the barbarity of what we were doing.  We have had ten years to realise what is going on.  Let it be said that it was Vietnam who told us the truth about Pol Pot.  It was Vietnam who told us the truth about the Khmer Rouge.  I cannot understand the moral position of our Government, given as I said, the hypocrisy of this motion deploring foreign armed intervention and occupation in Kampuchea which is the cause of continuing hostilities.  The cause of the problem in Kampuchea today is the Khmer Rouge, not foreign intervention. <Col N="486" /> The motion recognised that the assistance extended by the international community has continued to reduce the food shortages and health problems of the Kampuchean people.</P>
    <P>All the UN aid is not going to the people of Campuchea but to the refugee camps.  It is actually bankrolling the Khmer Rouge army.</P>
    <P>A motion which contains that level of hypocrisy, deceit and double-talk does not deserve the support of the Irish Government.  The very least we can do, given our attempt to strike a position of some consistency and of some morality, is to abstain on the motion.  I urge the Minister, even at this late stage, to realise how outraged Irish public opinion is on this matter.  There is no doubt that Irish public opinion is outraged that we would in any way contaminate ourselves by any type of implicit support for that most barbarous regime.  Therefore, the very least we should do now is abstain on that motion because by voting for it we are conniving in a total fabrication of the rewriting of the history of the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>The fundamental problem is that the people of Cambodia are absolutely petrified that the murderous, barbarous regime of Khmer Rouge will land back on them.  If it does they will know who did it, China and the United States, with our connivance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say how grateful I am to Senator Ryan for giving me these few minutes.  I concur with what has been said and I have a practical suggestion to make to the Minister which I hope he will take on board.  I have had discussions with the Leader of the Fine Gael group about it and I would hope that by consensus it might be possible actually to do something because, as Senator Ryan has said, our position in the United Nations currently is absolutely fatuous, hypocritical and morally revolting to the mass of the Irish people.  It is clear that the foreign policy decided in Iveagh House, without consultation with the Parliament, is something that is offensive to the majority of Irish people. <Col N="487" /> We can, however, do something.  I am suggesting that the House adopts the following amendment to this motion which is signed by myself, Senators Brendan Ryan, Avril Doyle and Michael Howard:</P>
      <P>That in the light of this universally welcomed motion, and in the light of the French Ambassador's statement on behalf of the European Community, and of this morning's decision by the Swedish Government to instruct their delegation to abstain on the vote, that Seanad Éireann requests the Minister to contact our delegation at the United Nations in New York and instruct them to abstain on the vote on the Kampuchean Resolution.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to consider this. I would like the Government party to consider whether it is possible that it would be agreed by consensus that an instruction issue from the Parliament in Dublin that our delegation to the United Nations should retrieve our honour, because it is a question of retrieving our honour.  I would like to quote in support of this from a book called <i>Punishing the Poor The International Isolation of Kampuchea</i> by Eva Mysliwiec.</P>
      <P>The introduction to the book was written by a British General, Commander Sir Robert Jackson.  In it he makes it clear that the United Nations was set up in the aftermath of the Second World War in order to ensure that there should be no further holocaust among the peoples of the world and that in the case of Cambodia it has signally failed so to do.  He concludes:</P>
      <P>One can envisage certain political changes that could lead to new initiatives, but the tragic fact remains that Kampuchea remains a very valuable tactical pawn in the strategic game of chess which the super-powers continue to play, and thus imperil the lives of the people they claim to protect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that this is what is happening. It is clear that the Irish people know that this is what is happening.  I introduce further into evidence one of a series of <Col N="488" /> letters that I have received from people all over this country expressing their horror at the position adopted on our behalf at the United Nations.  This lady, from the inner city of Dublin, recognises the facts, even if the Department of Foreign Affairs does not, and she concurs with the analysis by a military strategist whom I quoted.  Her letter stated:</P>
    <P>I am ashamed to be Irish, ashamed that our Government have allowed the Khmer Rouge to sit in the United Nations; horrified that our Government have allowed these mass murderers to return to power in Kampuchea so that they can begin another holocaust.  I cannot understand why we never helped the innocent people of Kampuchea.  They received no United Nations development aid, no World Health Organisation aid; nothing at all.  It is a disgrace.  These poor people are caught up in a political game between America and China.  I am lost for words to describe the horror and revulsion that I feel.</P>
    <P>The United Nations was expressly set up to prevent a repetition of the holocaust of World War II yet here is the UN actively supporting the Khmer Rouge.</P>
    <P>It is astonishing to me that it could be suggested that there is any place for the Khmer Rouge at the UN.  In the aftermath of the Second World War, would the then Department of External Affairs have supported a resolution for a Coalition government in Germany led by one of the contenders for the leadership of that nation under Nazi domination, Heinrich Himmler?  The real situation equivalent to that in moral terms is that this country is being asked to support a situation in which Heinrich Himmler would have been appointed as a legitimate element in a post-war German Government. I cannot believe that the people in the Department of Foreign Affairs are unaware of this or that they are unaware of the strength of feeling of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>What are the consequences of the situation?  The consequences are clear to <Col N="489" /> this woman in the inner city of Dublin.  It is clear that United Nations development aid is being deliberately withheld from the suffering people of Kampuchea.  No later than last night on RTE television was shown a film which recorded the fact that in recent weeks the Khmer Rouge had once again been attacking hospitals and destroying medical supplies. Tuberculosis, which had been eradicated before the genocide in the seventies, is again endemic throughout Cambodia as a result of the lack of medical supplies and the bombing of hospitals.  One must ask why?  I have got to agree with Senator Ryan.</P>
    <P>There is no question of doubt about it that we are lick spitting to the United States imperialism and their motives of revenge against not just the Vietnamese people, but also the Cambodians.  Let us remember that the Americans bombed Cambodia illegally in the seventies.  The Americans caused one million casualties. We are not just talking about the Khmer Rouge, we are also required to consider what is the position of the United States of America.</P>
    <P>I regret there are not people in attendance from the American Embassy because they are the people who are pulling the strings behind the scenes.  Why are we doing this?  Is it not an unholy alliance between the United States of America, on the one hand, and China on the other?  Are we satisfied that those who have committed acts of aggression against their own people unblushingly in Tiananmen Square are disposed well towards the interests of the unfortunate Kampuchean people?  There are certain things that we can do.  I urge the Minister not to be involved in fatuous moral posturing.</P>
    <P>The statement of the Minister, Deputy Collins, issued on 14 November, states:</P>
    <P>The memory of the deaths of over one million of their fellow citizens caused by the Pol Pot regime is etched irreversibly on the collective consciousness of the world.</P>
    <P>Yet, the impact of the resolution of the <Col N="490" /> United Nations is to invite a kind of collective amnesia in the people of Kampuchea.  How can they possibly be asked to forget?</P>
    <P>There were four recommendations made at the end of this stringent analysis of the situation.  The first is that the Governments, and the international community should: (1) provide reconstruction and development aid independently of political considerations; (2) withdraw all forms of support for the Khmer Rouge leaders responsible for acts of genocide; (3) resolve the ThaiKampuchean border situation and the plight of displaced people and, (4) pursue new diplomatic initiatives, support and facilitate all efforts towards a negotiated political settlement.  This is the kind of thing I believe the Irish people wish to see our Minister for Foreign Affairs support, and support actively.</P>
    <P>It is clear to me that Senator Doyle is absolutely right; nothing could indicate with greater clarity and force than this appalling situation, a tangle into which we have been led, the need for the establishment of a full and official committee on foreign affairs.  May I just end by saying that organisations which we all respect, organisations like Trócaire, like Oxfam to which, particularly in the Christmas season we pay such eloquent but easy tribute, are clear in their position on this.  I have before me a letter from the campaigns organiser of Oxfam in Ireland which states:</P>
    <P>I am writing to you, and a number of other public representatives whom I know to be concerned about the situation in Cambodia, to raise with you the question of the seating of the Khmer Rouge at the United Nations as a major part of a coalition.</P>
    <P>They are worried, so should we be.  I appeal to the Minister to contact the delegation and instruct them at least to abstain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a brief contribution on the very serious position in Cambodia.  Firstly, I wish to welcome the Minister here this morning.  I also <Col N="491" /> welcome this all-party motion.  Last September we had the announcement of the withdrawal of the Vietnamese occupation forces and immediately fears were expressed that the forces of the Khmer Rouge could come back again and in doing so use every means at their disposal to seize power by force.  One must consider the terrible suffering the people of this small country have endured over a long period, especially between 1975 and 1978, and the dreaded killing fields.  It is documented that during this three year period more than one million people were slaughtered in most terrible circumstances by Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge.  I fully agree that this outrageous act must never be repeated and that everything must be done to ensure that the Pol Pot Khmer Rouge regime, the guilty party and the instigators of these horrible crimes, will never be given a chance to return to power.</P>
      <P>No doubt the Cambodian people are of the same frame of mind.  They have for many years endured civil strife and the terrible tragedy of foreign occupation. They now look to the outside world for help and assistance to ensure an end to this long suffering and the restoration of peace and harmony.  I hold like previous speakers, that any settlement made will not last unless it includes the withdrawal of all foreign forces under the supervision of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the statement made by the Minister this morning.  He stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me first of all set out some of the fundamental principles that Ireland, as a small democratic country, upholds in the international community.  First among these principles is the right of every nation to self-determination.  A first requirement of this principle is that a country be rid of foreign invaders.  A second principle is that a country, once independent, should be allowed to live in peace and to run its affairs without outside interference.  In supporting these two principles, we are part of an international consensus <Col N="492" /> because the Charter of the United Nations spells out clearly the right of every people to self-determination and clearly rejects interference in a country's internal affairs. </P>

Perhaps the Minister will respond to the intention of the amendment when he is replying. We will have to accept the view of the Leader of the House.

The time is now opportune for such a committee.  As a nation we must continue to play our part to ensure that the Cambodian people are given the right to self-determination through participation in free and fair elections in peaceful conditions.  I welcome the Government's contribution of £50,000 to the people of Cambodia for emergency relief within that country.  I am confident that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, <Col N="493" /> Deputy Collins, the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, and our Irish delegation at the United Nations, with their personal interest in this sad situation, will continue to work at international level to bring about a peaceful settlement within Cambodia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing to this debate.  Let me say at the beginning that I have a difficulty with the Government's position in this matter.  The reason for this difficulty with the position as outlined by the Minister is that to me that most important issue in Cambodia is the tragedy and suffering of the people of that unfortunate country.  Reading the Minister's contribution, and looking at the Government's position on the issue, it appears that there is far more importance being attached to getting the structures of government in Cambodia right first before tackling what is to me the more serious and deeper problem of the suffering of the people of that country.  This is a position that the Government share with a number of other nations.  What makes me more concerned is the fact that the majority international position, if I might put it that way, as expressed on occasion at the United Nations, is the product &mdash; I hesitate to use the word &ldquo;conspiracy&rdquo;&mdash; certainly of an understanding between two conflicting ideologies, that is of China on one hand, working hand in glove as it were with the policies of the United States, and other nations of the West.</P>
      <P>The people of Cambodia have been victims of war, genocide, terror and, over the decades and particularly at the present time, of starvation on a grand scale.  Our response to that is a token gesture of £50,000 to be divided among and to ease the burden of a population of something like 6.7 million people.  If we were to attempt to calculate per head of the population what the contribution that the Government propose to make to relieve suffering there will mean, one would find it difficult to express the exact fraction that it represents to the unfortunate people of Cambodia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of the Government in <Col N="494" /> relation to the vote taking place at the United Nations on this resolution sometime this afternoon is to me at best weak and, perhaps more correctly, cowardly. There are aspects of that resolution that represent hypocrisy of the highest order. The Minister outlined the Government's reasons for the stand they are taking in relation to this vote.  They are peripheral reasons.  They ignore what are the blatant untruths that this resolution of the United Nations seeks to advance in relation to Cambodia.  I want to quote very briefly from the Minister's document because the time constraints on this motion prevent any Member from doing justice to this topic.  It states:</P>
    <P>Deploring foreign armed intervention and occupation in Kampuchea.</P>
    <P>It ignores the fact that apart from the Khmer Rouge, in the last decade or so, the greatest damage inflicted on that unfortunate country was by the bombing of the United States on the Ho Chi Minh trail during the Vietnam war, when something like over 1.1 million people were killed in Cambodia by United States bombing.  That is being ignored in this.</P>
    <P>The document further states:</P>
    <P>Recognising the assistance extended by the international community has continued to reduce the food shortages and health problems of the Kampuchean people.</P>
    <P>That is absolute nonsense because, as a result of the organised failure of the United Nations to recognise the present government, international aid organisations are unable to supply aid to the Cambodian people.  As far as I am aware, the only aid of any size or substance being supplied in Cambodia at present is through the Catholic aid organisations, particularly an organisation called CIDSE, to which Trócaire have made a very useful contribution.  Trócaire have 17 workers in Cambodia and they have reported time and time again on the inadequacy of the aid they can provide in relation to what is needed.  They have condemned the failure of international <Col N="495" /> aid organisations to come to the assistance of the people there.  They have identified the reason why these international aid organisations cannot play an effective role in Cambodia as the refusal to recognise the government there.  I will return to the point I made at the outset, that our Government, in alliance with so many other governments, are more concerned about getting structures of government in place rather than dealing with the more pressing human problems that exist there.</P>
    <P>Cambodia has a history of invasion and occupation, by the French, by the Americans during the Vietnam war, and then the desolation inflicted on that country by the Khmer Rouge.  The condemnation that the Minister has made of the Khmer Rouge is shared, of course, so often by other countries.  It is well to put on record that, the remnants of that organisation camped on the Thailand border and, with an army of 40,000 men, are being supplied, financed and trained by a number of nations, including China, the United States and the United Kingdom. I would like the Minister to deal with that.</P>
    <P>The question has been raised about fair and free elections.  Let us look at the reality of the situation.  Here is a country that for the past two to three decades has been devastated, where there has been practically no infrastructure, where the population is highly illiterate, where there is inadequate water.  As far as professional people there are concerned, I saw a report recently from Trócaire which said that in the population of 6.7 million people there are 22 doctors and seven solicitors.  We busy ourselves today and other days talking about the need in that war-torn country, in that set of circumstances, of ensuring the installation of a western-style democratic government.  It is desirable, but we are looking for it to be installed in conditions which do not apply in countries where western-style democratic governments exist.</P>
    <P>There is a government in Cambodia. <Col N="496" /> There have been complaints that the withdrawal of the Vietnamese from Cambodia has not been supervised by the United Nations.  The assistance the United Nations have given to the people of Cambodia is questionable.  They have conspired at many of the injustices that have been inflicted on these unfortunate people.  The present Prime Minister in Cambodia has indicated that he is in favour of free and fair elections.  He has indicated, furthermore, that the Red Cross and Amnesty can have access to that country's prisons.  Therefore, I would suggest that substantial progress has been made in the most difficult set of circumstances imaginable.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that our Government have not taken a stance which would identify their first and major priority to be the relief of the suffering and the starvation of the people.  We tend to ignore that and say that the sufferings of the 6.7 million people must wait until we get western-style government structures installed first.  That is prolonging the agony and it does not do us very proud.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by emphasising a couple of points made by Senator Doyle.  She stressed the need for an all-party Oireachtas foreign affairs committee on matters such as this.  I would appeal to the Leader of the House and to the Minister to give early consideration to that objective.  Had we such a body it would enable the development of a consensus which would give a national approach to this unfortunate problem rather than the party political approach we have at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the credentials of the Cambodian representative at the United Nations and he indicated the circumstances in which a challenge to the credentials of that representative could be put down.  I want the Minister in his reply to promise this House that at the first available opportunity the Government of this country at least will provide that challenge to the credentials of that representative.</P>
    <P>One other matter this resolution refers to is that it calls for the coming together <Col N="497" /> of the parties representing the people of Cambodia under Prince Sihanouk.  This man, by his own admission, has said he is a puppet of China.  His famous phrase at the Paris peace talks earlier this year was &ldquo;The Chinese own my clothes&rdquo;. That man's links and identification and participation with the Khmer Rouge is enough to reject him as somebody who would have the competence and authority to provide leadership for the Cambodian people.  In so far as this resolution at the United Nations would commit that body to support his nomination, in the circumstances of his background and his activities over the past decade, that alone is sufficient to justify this country rejecting and voting against that resolution this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Miss Keogh Miss Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Miss Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this all-party motion in relation to the rights of the Cambodian people.  As we heard so eloquently here this morning, for too long they have endured deprivations, which have more to do with international gun boat diplomacy than a genuine desire to improve the lot of those very hard-pressed peoples who endured the genocide which is second only to the Nazi holocaust of the Second World War.  In using that analogy I refer to the fact that in post-war Europe, and after the cessation of hostilities, then, at least the world had an immediate reaction to what had occurred.  That has not happened in the case of Cambodia.  We should have learned from that awful holocaust, but it seems that we have not learned any lesson at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tragedy of the Cambodian people has been extended by the manoeuvrings between the super powers and they are still threatened by the very elements, the Khmer Rouge, who carried out such wanton destruction in their country.  The coalition government of Democratic Kampuchea is dominated by these very same Khmer Rouge.  I hate to trivialise it by calling it an anecdote, but we all have our favourite anecdotes about what happened during those awful years of the Killing Fields.  It is on the record that the people of Phnom Penh would not wear <Col N="498" /> glasses because it was decreed by the Pol Pot regime that those who wore glasses would be summarily executed.  That is indicative of the type of regime we are talking about.  We should clearly reject the recognition of this coalition by the United Nations as having a legitimate role as being representative of Cambodia.</P>
    <P>There has been some misunderstanding about the nature of the vote in the United Nations today.  I thank the Minister for coming along and for giving us this lengthy and very comprehensive statement.  As he said, it does not relate to the representations of Cambodia at the General Assembly and, therefore, the recognition of the validity of the Khmer Rouge.  If this were the case I would today be calling on the Government to vote to unseat the Khmer Rouge from that coalition.</P>
    <P>I support the call to ensure self-determination for the Cambodian people through free and fair elections under international supervision and the call for a return to the Paris peace negotiations. I also welcome the decision of the Government to contribute aid directly to groups within Cambodia, however small that amount may be, and hope that in the future more funds may be made available. For one million people it is now too late, but for many more of the Cambodian people there is hope.  They have suffered 21 years of depredation, of bombing, genocide, starvation and finally isolation.  In 1983 the World Bank listed Cambodia as the poorest country in the world &mdash; the result of the appalling embargo on aid at that time in addition to the sufferings of war.</P>
    <P>The words of warning about the danger of the upsurge of activity of the Khmer Rouge within Cambodia, from their safe bases on the Thai border, are not based on speculation about their capabilities but are based on the actuality recently reported over the overrunning of two towns near the border with Thailand, sadly inevitably in the wake of the Vietnamese withdrawal.  There is a certain irony that aid which should have been <Col N="499" /> supplied to the starving peoples of Cambodia during the years 1980 to 1986, a total of $85 million supplied by the US Government, was given direct to the Khmer Rouge and their supporters on the Thai-Cambodian border, thereby building up their health and strength and helping them to renew their fight against the Vietnamese and against their own people.  The withdrawal of the Vietnamese from Cambodia is helpful in enabling the democratic process and empowering the Cambodian people to decide their own destiny and I would like to see us being in a position to ensure that this truly happens.</P>
    <P>I support the calls from both sides of the House this morning for an all-party committee on foreign affairs to address issues such as this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with this issue before us today, the question of Cambodia, one of the great problems with a country like this is trying to get access to information, to the political process, and trying to understand what is taking place there.  Where there is some confusion about the present position there, there are certain facts which one can be absolutely sure about.  The first thing is that one of the main players in this particular scheme, play or drama at the moment is Prince Sihanouk.  I would like to dispose of his position in the history of the development of Cambodia.  His record as a dictator, a despotic record indeed, which finished some time in the seventies, was nothing that anybody in the West can be proud of either.  It was an oppressive, suppressive regime and it was as well that it finished.  I think it is important to see that Prince Sihanouk at that point left Cambodia and took refuge in China and he has been in and out of the country ever since.  He is now, in a sense, trying to develop his authority and the authority of his regime and that group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But following on the Sihanouk regime was the murderous and barbaric regime of Pol Pot.  It was astounding to hear on RTE this morning a reference to Pol Pot as being the &ldquo;alleged perpetrator&rdquo; of the <Col N="500" /> crimes at that time.  There is no allegation. It is an accepted fact of history at this time, and it is important to call a spade a spade.  The only reason I make that point is that it is often very difficult to get at the core issue when it is buttered up in the language of diplomacy.  This is not the stuff of diplomacy.  The murderous, barbaric regime of Pol Pot is a very definite aspect of history.  It is as well to remind ourselves of some of the things that he did or which took place under that regime.</P>
    <P>First of all, the cities were effectively depopulated.  People were kicked out of the cities because they were too close, too organised, too difficult, and he attempted to force the country back to a peasant régime.  He killed the educators. He dismantled the education service.  He killed the medical people.  He dismantled the medical service.  He left a country, which was in the first place poor, almost without leadership of any description, almost without direction of any description, almost without education of any description.  This is the regime we are now speaking about.  These are the people who are now in one of the opposition groups in Cambodia at the moment &mdash; an uneasy alliance between the Sihanouk group and the Khmer Rouge.  It is significant that earlier this year Pol Pot resigned from his last remaining official position within the Khmer Rouge &mdash; I have no doubt a fairly artificial, shallow and transparent attempt to buy some sort of credibility or respectability for the Khmer Rouge regime.</P>
    <P>Without doubt, what we are doing in the world at the moment is that we are facilitating the return to power or power-sharing of the representatives of two former discredited regimes who ruled Cambodia in the past.  That is precisely what we are about.  I am saying this directly to the Minister because I know well the Minister's own views.  I have discussed this with him on many occasions and he has shown himself to be a man who cares about developments in countries like this and, indeed, on a specific issue.  I would just appeal to him to peel back the layers of diplomacy and <Col N="501" /> the structural layers of administration and to get at the core issue, and the core issue is the fact of the return to power of the Khmer Rouge regime.  Under any guise that cannot be given respectability. In any form it is unacceptable, and we have a duty to state that.  We have a duty to go further than the separate note which was issued by the Irish Government representatives at the UN in order to distance themselves slightly from the position of the Twelve.</P>
    <P>I want to say, as somebody who very often has to deal with negotiations of different kinds, that I recognise inches of progress when I see it and I do recognise that as an inch of progress.  I would just ask the Minister that the Department, the representatives of the Irish people, should take their courage in their hands now and make it absolutely clear that they will not only not sit silently by but that they will oppose any proposal or any development which will give respectibility or power to the Pol Pot successors.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to consider the debate that is taking place here today without referring in some way to the need for a foreign affairs committee of the House. It is significant, in fact, that one of the Government speakers this morning also made the same point.  I do not know how many times we have to say this, that there is all-party agreement on the need for a foreign affairs committee and, let me throw in a new word in case it is a threat to the Government, a foreign policy advisory committee.  That is all it would be; that is all it can be, constitutionally or any other way.  But there is a need for it.</P>
    <P>What we are seeing here this morning is actually the teasing out of positions of policy on one aspect of South-East Asia. It is the type of thing which would, perhaps, develop a bit better in committee. Without casting aspersions on the speakers on the far side of the House on this motion, I believe that there was a certain element of defensiveness, which I can well understand, because there was a certain element of offensiveness from this side of the House.  That really is perhaps not the best way of dealing with this type <Col N="502" /> of situation.  It is better that positions should be described, should be responded to in an attempt to find a middle line and perhaps we could all move forward that way.  For that reason more than any other I welcome this discussion. It does raise issues.  I also welcome the fact that we will have a similar debate about another part of the world this day next week.</P>
    <P>We are about to participate in what can only be described as an abomination. Sihanouk and China and the US cannot wash their hands of their responsibility in this area.  What we see in this motion for the UN is that we are seeking for an interim Government under the leadership of Sihanouk.  Sihanouk is the puppet of China and the US.  In this particular set of circumstances China and the US are really the patrons of the murderous Khmer Rouge regime in various forms.  So we have Sihanouk, who is in the pocket of the people who cannot be trusted in this particular area, and is also extremely closely connected with the Khmer Rouge is now being called on by the UN in a motion to which we at least are showing support.  In all these circumstances we are not in any sense acting honestly, correctly or with any sense of conscience.  There is no balance here and there will be no balance.</P>
    <P>It is significant that in this month's issue of the <i>Economist</i> what we actually see is a building up of the war régime in Cambodia, that the people who are now running the Khmer Rouge are people who led the murderous assault on the people of Cambodia a short time ago. One of them was known as Tamok but was better known as The Butcher during the years 1975-78.  These are the people to whom we are adding and giving respectability.  In any sense it cannot be an acceptable position.</P>
    <P>It is important that we would also consider the position of the representation at the UN.  The Minister quite rightly said in his speech that there is no vote on this particular issue.  I accept that point; I was quite aware of that point.  But it is also clear that, and I quote:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="503" /> The Assembly decided on 17 October last &mdash; without a vote &mdash; to accept the credentials of all delegations, including those of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea... </P>
    <P>&mdash; for which read &ldquo;Khmer Rouge.&rdquo;  We are now saying that instead of addressing this issue we should stand back from it and pretend it is not there.  This is ostrich diplomacy.  It is no way to run foreign policy.  If we have to stand on people's toes, if we have to tread on people's corns, then that is what we must do.  We need to grasp the nettle in this issue.  An ostrich policy of head in the ground, not recognising anything but allowing the world to go by, is not acceptable.  The Minister may feel that that may be somewhat unfair in the light of the attitudes and perspectives taken by the Irish Government, but that is what it comes down to because, with no decision on representation being taken this time, it means that the issue is, in fact, not being addressed by the UN.  Everybody knows it must be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The idea of accepting the credentials of both parties, or all parties might be a better description of it, is a cop-out.  It is an abrogation of international diplomatic responsibility.  It is an abrogation of the duty of care to the people of Cambodia. It is unacceptable that we should be left without a diplomatic initiative in this matter.  I would certainly take the view &mdash; and it certainly is the view which until recently and perhaps still which was endorsed by Trócaire, one of the main international aid agencies &mdash; that it would be better that the seat be left vacant in the UN until such time as the democratic process has thrown up a representative. I will quote from a document from Trócaire:</P>
    <P>A third option is ... namely the de-recognition of the Coalition and the decision to leave the UN seat for Kampuchea vacant until its people can determine their own representative. This option would not only signal the genuine concern of the international <Col N="504" /> community for a people which has already suffered intolerably, but help create conditions for negotiations in a defused atmosphere.  Although the non-aligned countries have left the Kampuchean seat vacant in their own assemblies, there has been no real precedent for such a move at the UN.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear the Minister's reponse on that issue.  I do not put myself forward as an expert, but it is a matter to which I would like to hear a response.  I believe that what we are doing at the moment is a denial of all sides of the democratic struggle, because we are giving credence to people who have turned their backs on democracy and are determined to make progress through an armed struggle.  We would find ourselves in an impossible situation in that case.</P>
    <P>Ireland is apparently opposed to giving support either to the coalition government of Democratic Kampuchea, that is the Khmer Rouge Government, or to the Hun Sen Government.  We are not prepared to support either.  I would ask the Minister why?  The Minister has spoken to us at some length, but we have not heard why.  The most threatening thing of all is to be answerable for the policy.  I look forward to hearing the reason of not being prepared to take a decision one way or the other.  We know why there would be objections to going one way; we are not quite clear why there would be objections to going in the other direction.  It seems to me that we cannot justify supporting a resolution which calls for support for a Prince Sihanouk Government administration which would be no more than a puppet for the Khmer Rouge.  The Khmer Rouge have set this up over the past number of years.  They have set it up by trying to clean up those people who represent them publicly. They have set it up by allowing Sihanouk to, in some sense, distance himself from all that has been happening in that country.</P>
    <P>It seems that, no matter which way we go about it, the people of Cambodia are now going to suffer.  But if they are condemned to such a future, will we be back <Col N="505" /> here in ten years time saying we were the ones who stood idly by when the Government might have done something? Will we be the ones who are going to have to explain to another generation that we knew about Pol Pot, the successor of Stalin, the successor of Amin, the successor of Hitler, the successor of all who have oppressed people down through the centuries, that not only did we know about it but that we stood back and allowed him have a second chance to steamroll over, to oppress, to suppress, to raze, to devastate the country and the people and the administration of Cambodia. It just is not good enough.</P>
    <P>The main players who are supporting the puppet Khmer Rouge initiative would need to have their credentials very closely examined.  The money that has come from the US, which has been a disgrace in the way it has been used, is simply fuelling the fire, worsening the situation. According to this week's <i>Economist</i>, they are now getting arms instead of money or they are now using the money to buy arms.  They are now moving forward. One of the Khmer Rouge is quoted as saying in regard to the new anti-tank weapons they have: &ldquo;This will do for us what the stinger did for Afghanistan.&rdquo; We are into a war situation.  We are handing over to the war mongers.  Diplomacy steps aside and lets the country go back on a war footing.  It is the reverse of what I know about diplomacy.  It is the reversal of what we would all wish to see taking place and it is a denial of the democratic process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never stood up in this House on a debate on foreign policy in front of this Minister without, first of all, being interrupted and, secondly, without making the same plea as I am going to make now.  That is, that on foreign policy issues, and particularly under this Government, it seems to me that Ireland's neutrality and Ireland's independence is constantly something which we ought to question, because we have had debates in this House on numerous countries, on numerous stances taken by Ireland in overseas matters, and I have <Col N="506" /> never failed to see a ministerial speech which does not run for cover under the umbrella of a bigger body.  We have had it before where they ran for cover mostly under the European Community's stance on particular issues like Nicaragua and Libya and other issues which have been before this House.  Today, although I approve &mdash; I think everybody approves of the wording of the motion, even if it is far too weak &mdash; we again seem to have from the ministerial speech some very high principles pronounced and also a statement from him which, once again, really hides behind a UN resolution.</P>
      <P>Whereas many of the sentiments expressed in this motion are worthy, they are absolutely no more than sentiments. It is high time that we saw from this Government &mdash; this may sound strange coming from me &mdash; a far more aggressive, independent and moral foreign policy.  I fail to see any signs of independence either from this Minister or from his senior Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  What I am saying really is that we are always taking the easy way out without establishing any identity of our own.  I do not think we have anything to fear by taking a stance on Cambodia, or on any other issue, which is different from that taken by other members of the UN, or which is different from that taken by other members of the EC.  The great benefit of being a member of a large body like that is being able to influence it and not be influenced by that body itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The UN resolution is obviously one with which the Minister, for some reason, can live and with which this country can live.  But he says, quite rightly, that we are issuing an explanation for our vote today because we disagree with part of that resolution.  It seems contradictory to say we are voting for it but that we need to issue an explanation because we are unhappy with it.  As I understand it, the Swedes have already stated that they are voting against this resolution.  Sweden is a country with a proud, independent and neutral foreign policy.  It seems to me that there is no reason whatsoever, apart possibly from all sorts of pressures and alliances to which we are not privy, why <Col N="507" /> we cannot for the same reason not take this attitude this afternoon in the Assembly.</P>
    <P>I would again like to make a plea to the Minister that it is time that Ireland's voice was heard in foreign affairs, was heard as an individual voice and not as a collective voice with other countries.  The Minister's speech begins by stating that whereas we wish to encourage peace, democracy and the end of strife in Cambodia, there are sacred principles to which this country and the United Nations adhere and those principles, quite obviously, take priority over the specific issue of Cambodia.  I do not know whether those principles should stand in this particular case.  The two principles which the Minister enunciates here are the principles of self-determination for a country and non-interference in another country's internal affairs.</P>
    <P>Where those principles are very high-minded, and whereas they are principles with which we can all agree in theory, I wonder whether we can any longer use them as an excuse to stand idly by in situations of mass slaughter and genocide. While no one is suggesting that we should suddenly interfere physically in the affairs of Cambodia, because it is not a practical proposition, we should now question those two sacred principles of the United Nations and ask whether, in certain circumstances, we can respect the principles of self-determination and the principles of non-interference any longer. Where people are being slaughtered is it right to say, &ldquo;Sorry, we cannot do anything about it and we cannot encourage anybody else to do anything about it&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>What happens if there is a repeat of what happened in Germany in the thirties? What happens if Pol Pot is reelected in what appear to be free and fair elections in Cambodia, by the Cambodian people, and after his election he goes on a programme of wholesale slaughter and genocide?  Are we, as a Government, going to stand idly by and say, &ldquo;Well, we are sorry we allowed them the right to self-determination but we <Col N="508" /> cannot interfere in the affairs of another nation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Had we interfered earlier, or had the powerful nations of the world interfered earlier in the affairs of Nazi Germany, we would possibly have stopped a world war and the slaughter of many people. Whereas these are great principles it is time that Ireland as a nation &mdash; a nation which is not expected to interfere personally or physically because of our weakness as an international nation &mdash; raised its voice in questioning these principles in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the credentials of the Kampuchean delegation in the United Nations are not an issue today.  If they are not an issue today I want to know, first of all, why they are not an issue today, why Ireland does not make them an issue today and raise them as an issue today?  Finally, why did we abstain on that issue in 1982?  It seems to me that this motion is worthy but it is weak.  It is a way of expressing sentiments while saying exactly why we can do nothing.  It is time that, as an independent nation, we raised our voice much louder to embarrass those who indulge in wholesale genocide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me first thank all the Senators who contributed to this debate.  I thank them for their contributions and especially for the quiet obviously sincere tones of those contributions.  I will start, first of all, with Senator Ross and say that I very successfully resisted any temptation to interrupt him, that I made a resolution for the rest of my stay that I would no longer interrupt Senator Ross.  In relation to the point he raised as to our fundamental principles, I would refer him to my speech and I quote:</P>
      <P>Second, is that universal and fundamental human rights &mdash; above all the most basic right to life &mdash; are a matter of legitimate international concern, as an exception to the general rule of non-interference in a country's internal affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="509" /> I hope that that alleviates his fears. Senator Ross has a phobia about the foreign policy of the Government and particularly about my own explanations to the Seanad and to, as he says, the present Ministers.  There seems to be a misunderstanding that foreign policy is decided by people or by civil servants in Iveagh House as distinct from a Government. This is incorrect.  Foreign policy is decided by the Government of the day, not only this Government but by all their predecessors.  Whereas advice will certainly be given by diplomats from all around the world, and it comes in regularly, the country's position is adopted by the Government and not by the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Many points have been raised.  The one raised most often is the question of a foreign policy committee.  I regret that I am not in a position to be able to state to the House what the exact situation is on that.  I do not think the House would, in reality, expect me to be able to answer that.  That is a matter for other people, it has been raised by other people and will be decided in due course.</P>

      <P>My personal views are private.  Many Senators raised the question of credentials.  As Senator Ross and others have said, the last time there was a challenge to those credentials was in 1982.  At that stage we did not go along with the majority.  Contrary to what Senator Ross might say, we abstained and we were part of a very small minority that did abstain because the challenge to the credentials was massively beaten.  I think that deals with Senator Ross's argument, that we tend to hide behind larger groups.  I am sure he will also be glad to <Col N="510" /> hear that we have broken also from our partners in the Community &mdash; I know that is another problem he has with me in particular.  Let me quote from <i>The Independent</i>&mdash; I mean the London paper</P>
      <P>&mdash; of 16 November 1989:</P>
      <P>Inconsistencies in the resolution which was drafted by the ASEAN group of countries were too much for Ireland and Belgium.  These Governments which had to contend with the vociferous humanitarian aid lobby &mdash;</P>
      <P>May I intervene there to say that when officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs met a deputation from the NGOs approximately six or eight days ago, we were able to tell them at that stage what our stance was going to be and explain that stance to them.  Rather than reacting to that the NGOs have said to us, we had a decision made before that.  I will continue with the quotation:</P>
      <P>&mdash; they decided to break ranks by declining to co-sponsor the resolution.</P>
      <P>I am sure Senator Ross will be glad for that little break from what usually happens.</P>

      <P>Senator Howard, in particular, made the point that he felt that the UN and Ireland were more anxious to have installed successful western-style democratic elections or governments.  I do not honestly feel this country wants to instal or see installed a particular type of government.  We are anxious that whatever government is installed be installed under supervised free and democratic <Col N="511" /> elections.  I think we can point to what has happened in Namibia where the UN quite successfully were able to supervise a western style, if you like, election. That is an indication of what can be done by the UN and it is also the answer to those who feel that the present Cambodian Government were justified in not allowing the UN in.  It is a point that has been made here, it has been made on radio and on television over the past few days, that the country somehow was justified by the stance that has been taken by the UN on certain issues in not allowing the UN to supervise the withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops.</P>
      <P>Another point was made by Senator Ryan, reiterated by Senator O'Toole and again by Senator Ross, on this question of the use of the phrase &ldquo;alleged genocide&rdquo;. Let me say that the Government have no compunction in not using the word &ldquo;alleged&rdquo;.  We hold quite firmly that what happened was genocide.</P>

      <P>Senators Ryan and Norris, in their contributions, quite correctly pointed out that the super powers have a very important role in the issue that surrounds Cambodia.  I agree with them, but what I cannot agree with and will not agree with is their suggestion that Ireland's behaviour is hypocritical on this issue and that we are kow-towing to one super power or another.  On the contrary, as I think I have already clearly outlined and explained, our vote on this resolution is based on the fundamental principles which we have spoken about and which underline our foreign policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would regret if there was bipartisan, political point-scoring on this issue.  It is something we cannot afford.  I would like to point out that since 1982 there have been different Governments in office in this country, all of whom have adopted mainly the same principle we are adopting now.  We have moved away from our stance in the past in that we are not cosponsoring the resolution and, while it may appear to Senator Ross that there is <Col N="512" /> a contradiction in the fact that we are voting for a resolution but at the same time seeking to clarify our reasons for it, I do not think there is anything contradictory in that.  I believe the resolution contains many good points that all of us in both Houses of the Oireachtas and many organisations right throughout this country can accept.  There are, as I have already tried to explain, some portions of the resolution that we are not quite happy with and because of that we are, as is our right, giving an explanation of that vote. I tried to help the House, with the Minister's consent, by having that explanation circulated to Senators for their information.</P>
    <P>A point was made by Senator Doyle in relation to the resumption of the peace conference.  May I assure her that our main priority will be to get the parties to realise that it is through negotiations and not on the battlefield that a settlement can be found.  I understand that the cochairmen of the Paris conference, France and Indonesia, and indeed countries in the region especially the Thai Prime Minister, are actively working behind the scenes to get the parties back to the negotiating table.  It is important to say that both sides walked away from the peace conference in Paris, not just one side or the other but both sides walked away from the negotiating table.  Our position is that we insist that they should go back to the negotiating table because we will do nothing to support people who are trying to pursue battlefield objectives by diplomatic means.</P>
    <P>Let me come back again to the question of credentials, which was raised by Senators Boyle, Norris, Ryan, Ross, O'Toole, and indeed Senator Conroy in his very thought-provoking contribution. If we had been faced with an actual proposal to leave the Cambodian seat vacant as has been suggested, then we would certainly have given very serious consideration to voting in favour of that particular resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the return of Pol Pot under any guise, let me repeat that I fully share and endorse the views expressed by every Senator who spoke that we must utterly reject the idea that the &mdash; and I choose my words very carefully &mdash; mass murderers of the Pol Pot Khmer Rouge should be allowed back to power.  We have not and never will do anything to ensure that Pol Pot or the Khmer Rouge should be allowed back to power.  We have not, and never will do anything to help that cause.</P>
      <P>Again may I place my own and the Government's views firmly on the record. Pol Pot and his minions were responsible for the deaths of well over one millions of their fellow citizens.  To answer a point raised by Senator Ross, I am absolutely confident and certain that the Cambodian people would never wish to see them in a position of responsibility again.  Perhaps one might offer a challenge to the Khmer Rouge: they claim, and people claim on their behalf, that they have the support of the Cambodian people.  They should be asked to prove it by asking the people of Cambodia for their support in free and fully supervised elections.  As for the present situation, one has Hobson's choice because while, on the one hand, we have in the Coalition Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge, we have, on the other, a Government installed by Vietnam which does contain quite a number of people who are very active who were commanders in the Khmer Rouge.  While one can say that they do not want any connection with the Khmer Rouge remember that they are on both sides of the divide and that makes the position for the Cambodian people that more difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the point raised by Senator Doyle, I understand that the vacant seat proposal <Col N="514" /> was advanced in the credentials committee by the Soviet Union, but I also understand that they did not press their proposal to the vote, for whatever reason I do not honestly know whether it was that they felt it would not pass the credentials committee or that it would fail. Ireland, however, is not a member of the credentials committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I hate to take Senator O'Toole to task but our information is that in so far as Prince Sihanouk is concerned, he is a former head of the State of <Col N="515" /> Cambodia who was involved in activities that do him no credit, but it is also a fact that he is highly thought of by the Cambodian people as an emblem of Cambodian nationalism.  This is something everybody will have to take into account in their efforts to bring to an end the sufferings of the Cambodian people.</P>
      <P>A point was raised by Senator Howard. Let me just say that Ireland does not normally get involved in the question as to who should run a country.  He made the point that what we and the United Nations are trying to do is to put the structures in place before we give aid.  A point has already been made about the American aid which I understood is given to the refugee camps, but some Senators seem to be under the impression that a considerable amount of that aid had got into the wrong hands and that it is now being used to arm the Khmer Rouge. That probably is as good a reason as any to refute Senator Howard's point.  You must have structures in place before you can really consider the kind of fundamental aid that is necessary for the restructuring of the country.  He talked about the £50,000 which the Government have granted, and there was an implication in some of the suggestions from other Senators that that money might have been allocated elsewhere.  That £50,000 was allocated to Concern.  Could I say why?  Concern asked for it.  No other non-governmental organisation asked for aid, only Concern.  They applied for £50,000 for specific purposes and the Government were quite happy to allocate that money.</P>
      <P>I tried to take note of all of the points made and I have tried to respond to them. I certainly will take on board the various suggestions that have been made, but could I repeat that the Government only reached their decision to support this resolution after very careful thought.  While I accept the points that have been made by many Senators, we will still be voting for that resolution on the grounds that having considered all aspects of the situation we feel it is in the best interest of the Cambodian people to do so.</P>

      <P>Last Wednesday I was beginning to speak about the subject of subsidiarity and I am glad to see that this is mentioned in the Minister's speech, because subsidiarity, in my view, is very important.  The tendency, over the last 20 years, has been to centralise things and this is a dangerous trend in the long term. It is very much in our interest that as far as possible all powers of decision be devolved to the most local region possible. As well as that, it is very important to us as a nation that the decision has been taken that this is one region with subsidiary regions.  It means that the role of the Oireachtas will be enhanced rather than otherwise.  It is also much easier for people, particularly in the more remote areas, to deal with people in Dublin than it is for them to deal with people in Brussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a fact, and a fact of which anybody involved in development is aware, that the bigger and the further away a bureaucracy is the less responsive it can be, by its very nature, to local needs.  It is also true that where schemes of a minor nature are devised far away they tend to be devised more with the aims of the devisor at heart than those for whom they have been devised.  The best approach we could have as a country would be that <Col N="518" /> the big projects would be dealt with at European level and that the smaller projects would be dealt with locally.  In this way we would reverse the trend that has been evident for some time.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a word on the question of cohesion.  The Minister stressed in her speech that it is very important that it be accepted that the giving of grants under structural aid is not, in itself, sufficient to overcome the problems of the differences in the level of development in the various regions.  We should look to the various methods tried to develop the Gaeltacht as an example that grants alone, without overcoming the other cost factors, will not ensure the development of more peripheral regions. Our experience has been that in this situation one would &mdash; as I have often said &mdash; spend half the day paying money into the system and the other half of the day trying to devise methods to extract money out of that same system.  The cost of doing so dissipates a lot of the good that the money being spent could do.  Therefore, we must insist that measures outside of structural aid be incorporated in European policies so that the disparities in income and in development of this country compared with the more developed countries nearer to the centre of Europe would be overcome. If this means subsidies for basic services we would have to say that if the EC is to live up to the aim of cohesion so be it.  Our policy on this must always put people first and it must be seen to ensure that the interests of the people in the peripheral regions are catered for.</P>
    <P>I would like to say just one word about emigration.  I am not one of those people who can look with equanimity at areas being denuded of their population.  I do not think that the migration of large segments of the population is either desirable or acceptable.  In terms of emigration, people tend to think of the emigrants but I have seen too often the effects of emigration on the residual community, communities of old people and the weaker sections who are not able to develop their areas as we would like them to.  We must ensure that both the social and economic policies of the European <Col N="519" /> Community reverse this trend and create throughout this country viable, self-sustaining communities that can provide the necessary social structures that would make it attractive for our young people to stay.  My experience has been that where these social structures exist and where the employment exists most people by free choice want to stay in the area from which they come.</P>
    <P>On the subject of grants and structural aid, we have to, at this juncture, look at the general effectiveness of giving capital grants to industry, etc., as a mechanism of this stimulating development.  It is a convenient way for the payer to transfer resources but I have often felt that it does not address the problems of the payee. What we need much more fundamentally is to ensure that the services available in the peripheral areas are at the same cost as those available in the more developed areas.</P>
    <P>If we do not aim, through our participation in Europe, to create a community whose standard of living and whose expectations are as high as the richest country in Europe, we will fail the people.  In my opinion we have a very great obligation to get away from any lethargy we might have had in the past and ensure that the European Community, and our membership thereof, is used in a positive way to ensure that the development that we desire in this country is available.  In the words of President Kennedy, some people see things and ask &ldquo;why&rdquo; while other people think of things that never were and say &ldquo;why not?&rdquo;  In my view we must face Europe with the second attitude.  Within that community we can, if we put our minds to it, carve out a niche for ourselves that will ensure us a vibrant, vital role in Europe and economic development at home that will ensure that our young people will be able to stay.</P>

      <P>It was Lorenzo Natali, Vice-President of the Commission of the European Communities speaking at the opening of the Centenary Symposium organised by the Commission of the <Col N="520" /> European Communities to commemorate the centenary of the birth of Jean Monnet held in Brussels on 10 November 1989 who said:</P>
      <P>Our generation has been fortunate to have had a man of inspiration like Jean Monnet who launched Europe on its first shared venture.  But what kind of Community do we want to find the day the scaffolding finally comes down?</P>
      <P>It is in that context that I welcome the publication by the National Economic and Social Council of the results of its major study on Ireland and the European Community, a report which was commissioned in May 1987 and which reported on 13 September 1989.  The terms of reference of the council were:</P>
      <P> (1)  To undertake an in-depth study of Ireland's comparative performance in the European Community;</P>
      <P>(2)  To assess the problems and opportunities inherent in the unification of the internal market; and</P>
      <P>(3)  To put forward and to evaluate the policy options available, to mitigate the problems and to capitalise on the opportunities. </P>
      <P>It is, of course, interesting to recall here today that it was on 9 May 1950 that Robert Schuman, the French Foreign Minister, made the famous declaration to which Jean Monnet had contributed in a decisive fashion, and which began the process of integrating the countries of western Europe into the European Community. On 18 April 1951 the Treaty of Paris was signed and that marked the creation of the first of the three Communities, the ECSC, the European Coal and Steel Community, whose task indeed it was to create in this sector a common market without barriers to trade, and without distortion of competition so that economic activity would develop in a healthy environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This first step resulted from the untiring efforts of a few men of great vision, courage and integrity, people such as Schuman, De Gasperi, Monnet, Hallstein and Adenauer.  These men <Col N="521" /> shared a vision of a Europe bound together by economic and social ties instead of being divided into competing and often hostile groups.  They realised how terrible the cost had been to ordinary people who had witnessed two dreadful wars in the first half of this century.  They realised how deeply people yearned for peace, a peace that would endure.  To Schuman and his colleagues the basis for such an enduring peace lay in economic co-operation among the European states persuaded to share their resources and to trade freely with one another.  The cooperation in coal and steel was but a first step.  However, the real advance was achieved with the signing of the Treaty of Rome on 25 March 1957.  On 1 January 1958 the European Economic Community, the EC, and the European Atomic Community, EURATOM, became a reality.  This set the European states on the road to economic and social unity and has made the possibility of war between them utterly inconceivable.  In this context Karl-Heinz Narjes, Vice-President of the Commission of the European Communities, draws what I believe is a very useful and historical comparison. He states, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The Schuman Plan was announced five years, a mere 60 months, after the end of the last world war.</P>
    <P>The situation five years after 1918 was very different; 1923 saw Franco-German relations reach the lowest ebb in the history of the Weimar Republic, with the occupation of the Ruhr and the emergence of passive resistance.  This situation underlines not only the different situations prevailing after the two wars but also the political vision of the men of 1950.  The gap indeed between 1945 and 1950 was very short, in any event shorter than the time we have allowed ourselves today between entry into force of the Single European Act and the completion of the internal market.</P>
    <P>Of course it is of interest for us to recall here today that the Treaty of Rome created an entirely separate and distinct legal entity to which each acceding state <Col N="522" /> surrendered portion of its national sovereignty. The creation of the Community saw the emergence of a new and autonomous legal order which had to be recognised as having supremacy over national law, if the Community was to function as the treaty intended.  This, of course, was something entirely strange to the Irish legal system, for under our Constitution Irish law stems from the Constitution and from laws duly made by the Oireachtas. At that time no executive act would make applicable in Ireland rules, regulations or principles emanating from an outside law-making authority, nor could an Irish statute so provide because such would be contrary to the Constitution.  The problem was, of course, solved by the Third Amendment of the Constitution which was enacted by the people of Ireland on 10 May 1972 authorising the State to join the European Communities and providing that, and I quote:</P>
    <P>No provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State necessitated by the obligations of membership of the Communities, or prevents laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the Communities, or Institutions thereof, from having the force of law in the State.</P>
    <P>The NESC report is indeed a major study of Ireland in the European Community, its performance, prospects and strategy. It presents a detailed analysis of the effects of EC membership on the Irish economy, an assessment of the likely effects of the completion of the internal market by 1992 and an outline of the approach which Ireland should take to current and future European integration. The NESC report in my view makes two crucial conclusions:</P>
    <P> (1)  Ireland has made little or no progress towards catching up in economic terms with the rest of Europe and the Community is still developing in an unbalanced way, which could be to Ireland's detriment;</P>
    <P>(2)  Ireland needs to adopt a more <Col N="523" /> explicit and coherent and fully articulated European policy or strategy. </P>
    <P>Following a detailed analysis of the relative merits of different levels of economic integration, the council unanimously concluded that Ireland's interests lies in advanced economic integration.  Consequently, Ireland's strategic approach should be the objective of creating a European economic and monetary union.  The NESC report emphasises that in advocating economic and monetary union it means a Community which will have sufficient resources and policies to create a genuine economic union and to manage a unified European economy.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the recent Delors report adopts a quite different definition of economic and monetary union.  The NESC report says that the Delors report on economic and monetary union, the blueprint compiled by European Community central bankers under the chairmanship of Jacques Delors, President of the Commission of the European Communities, ignores the essential role of the central European Community budget in maintaining an economic balance and in achieving the convergence which is essential if such a union is to succeed.</P>
    <P>The report considers that the policy measures envisaged in the Delors report would be quite inadequate to create the level of integration and economic convergence necessary to sustain monetary union.  Their analysis of the implications of economic integration clearly shows that by continuing to neglect these requirements the Community as a whole will sacrifice its central objective, namely a genuine common market, a monetary union and economic cohesion and convergence.</P>
    <P>The council considers that Ireland should insist that the argument on economic and monetary union should be widened to include a more adequate analysis of the role of public finance in economic and monetary integration.  The council further concludes that the long run benefits of market completion are likely to be distributed unevenly with the greatest <Col N="524" /> benefits accruing to the regions in which large scale industries and highly innovative sectors are most prevalent. Ireland, of course, is not such a region. Consequently, I argue that the completion of the internal market should not, on its own, be expected to narrow income disparities between regions in the EC, let alone bring about a convergence.  This, course, is the fundamental conclusion which informs the entire report of the National Economic and Social Council.</P>
    <P>For many citizens of the European Community, the regional dimension of its policies is of paramount importance. The Community, as we know, has three sets of policies which are aimed at overcoming structural problems which inhibit the economic development of certain regions, enterprises and individuals.  The Community's social policy is aimed at improving the employment opportunities and the working conditions of Community citizens.  It is funded from the European Social Fund.  The agricultural guidance policy of the Community is intended to address the structural problems in the agricultural sector and is funded by the guidance section of the Community's agricultural fund, the EAGGF.  The regional policy aims to improve the conditions of depressed and under-developed regions and is funded by the European Regional Development Fund, the ERDF.  However, these three Structural Funds have one important feature in common, their small size in relation to the total Community budget, in relation to the total Community GDP and, most significantly I would suggest, in relation to the scale of the inequalities and the structural problems in the European economy.</P>
    <P>The NESC report predicts that in the budgetary period 1988-92 it seems likely that the proportion spent on priority regions, such as Ireland, will increase only from 65 per cent to 70 per cent and that consequently a doubling of the funds by 1992 will not represent a major change in the focus of the Community structural policy.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is clear from this report that the development of the Community has <Col N="525" /> not facilitated the convergence of Irish living standards and that it is unlikely to do so unless there is a seminal and important change in Community direction. Economic integration tends to reflect and, indeed, to reinforce existing advantages and disadvantages, so that the creation of a single European market cannot on its own be expected to cause living standards to converge.  It is appropriate, therefore, that Ireland, with a relatively long period of EC membership and now about to assume the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, should, indeed, lead the peripheral and smaller economies in any analysis of the deficiencies and difficulties of European economic policy and in the search for new directions.</P>
    <P>This report &mdash; an excellent report &mdash; paints a picture of 16 years in which Ireland has been a relatively passive recipient of directions from Brussels. With this analysis, the NESC report, the Government and the Taoiseach should develop a more active and indeed a more creative approach to participation in the European Community.</P>

      <P>At the outset, I wish to welcome the Minister here this evening and to compliment her on her excellent work.  I would like to congratulate the members and staff of the National Economic and Social Council for their excellent report on Ireland in the European Community.  It is important that we in this House have an opportunity to discuss the latest NESC report.  This is a very important and comprehensive study.  It deals with issues which will have a major impact on Ireland's performance leading up to, and subsequent to, the completion of the internal market in 1992.  NESC have been complimented on this report as the best and most significant report to be published by any individual or agency to date.  NESC have attained an importance as a forum where the principles of economic and social development can be discussed in a non-political atmosphere by the social partners, leading to constructive economic and social change of the political process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="526" /> The report provides a detailed analysis of Ireland's performance since we went in to the European Community in 1973 and sets out the obstacles which this country has to face in competing in a unified European market.  It highlights the hard decisions that still have to be taken in the process of integrating and playing a more active role in the EC.</P>
    <P>It is accepted that the status report is very much on target as we begin to focus on 1992 and what we have to do to prepare for it.  Allowing for the fact that work is ongoing for many years, the run up to 1992 has started in a very serious way.  We are now mentally geared to concentrate on it in a real way.  The main thrust of the NESC report is to highlight the fact that we now need to adopt a more explicit and fully articulated European policy or strategy.  We have a unique opportunity to develop a successful disciplined economy, that in good times and bad will, to a large extent, perform so as to protect employment &mdash; especially at this time when we have massive emigration &mdash; incomes and living standards. There are a number of models in continental Europe and further afield of this type of economy that perform consistently and very successfully.</P>
    <P>We are a small, open economy with a limited domestic market on an island situated some distance from our main markets, emerging from a state of underdevelopment. We will only succeed in raising the living standards of our people and giving them the social services and cultural amenities that they are entitled to if we combine all our resources and work together on an agreed strategy towards common objectives.  There is no doubt that the approach of the single market, combined with our greatly improved economic performance, has increased Ireland's appeal as a location for industry.  The attraction of major companies, the growing interest in Ireland of Japanese and other Far Eastern companies, are very encouraging developments.  I welcome the Government's commitment to give every support to our industrial promotion policy abroad.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="527" /> There are other encouraging features within our outstanding export performance of these last three years.  One has been the export performance of the indigenous sector.  Surveys conducted by Coras Tráchtála indicated that exports from this sector grew by 23 per cent in 1988 and that an additional 4,400 jobs were created in the process.  Notwithstanding these trends, the central issue relating to industrial policy in the future will be how, in the light of the impending removal of barriers, to aim for Community trade.  We can ensure that indigenous industry in particular adapts and performs.  It is also appreciated that agreement has now been reached on the Community support framework for Ireland, namely, the context in which the greatly increased structural funding for Ireland will be invested up to 1993.  The contribution of the Commission to the <i>National Development Plan</i> for the period 1989 to 1993 will be £2.860 billion. Taking account of additional funding for new Community initiatives in which Ireland will share, the total support to Ireland over the five year period in question will exceed £3 billion.  This is a tremendous achievement and is the outcome of long, intensive, carefully conducted negotiations with the Commission.  In relation to our economy it is a significant addition to our investment resources.</P>
    <P>The overall total amount for the Community was fixed and our share of that total had to be decided in relation to the shares of other member states.  Ireland has secured the highest <i>per capita</i> share of the best developed regions in the Community. By 1993 we will be in a position to double the 1987 allocation from the Structural Funds at today's prices.  From the beginning of our membership of the Community our principle was clearly established that all the State would be treated as one region.  This principle has never been departed from in our relationship with the Community nor has it ever been called into question on either side. It represents an entirely rational approach.  After all the population of <Col N="528" /> Ireland as a region is just over three million.  In other European countries such as France, Spain and Italy individual regions have populations of up to nine and ten million.  The concept of Ireland as one region has always been accepted and acted upon, and rightly so.  With our present direction within the EC, I look forward to achieving our aim of increased employment, raising living and working standards and improving our social framework.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar dtús is mian liom fáilté a chur roimh an tuarascáil seo.  Is mian liomsa buíochas a ghabháil leis an Taoiseach de bhrí gur iarr sé ar an NESC an tuarascáil a dhéanamh, agus is mian liomsa comhghairdeachas a dhéanamh leis na húdair.  Tuarascáil mhór agus tuarascáil mhaith atá ann.</P>
      <P>There are three fundamental conclusions reached in the report.  The first is that the economic integration in the narrow sense will not serve to reduce the regional disparities and the forces they have unleashed may increase inequalities within the Community.  Secondly, as Senator Kennedy said, the EC has developed in an unbalanced manner leading to lack of genuine integration and a continuance of regional disparities. Thirdly, the report makes it quite clear that Irish interests in their view are best served by the attainment of genuine European Economic and Monetary Union.  Many of the effects that will be attributed to a Single Market will occur because of the internationalisation of economic activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NESC has brushed away much of the nonsense that has been produced in the form of euphoric forecasts about the defects of the Single European Act.  It has demolished the myth that the Single European Act will provide sudden and much needed jobs for the Irish economy. It set about clarifying the generalisations in the Cecchini report as they are likely to affect Ireland.  How will the gains of 1992 be distributed?  The report provided some answers.  It makes clear that what is true in general for Europe will not <Col N="529" /> necessarily apply to Ireland unless important changes are introduced.  It is good that somebody started a bit of straight talking, or perhaps more correctly that someone has begun to think of what the reality is in contrast to what message the hype seeks to convey.  It is also clear that all the options that are available to Ireland are difficult and they all imply changes.  There will be winners and losers.  That is a contrast to the illusion which is around that subsequent to the Single European Act we will all live happily afterwards.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that there was not an Irish expert involved in the preparation of the Cecchini report.  It is also a pity that the publication of the report followed the submission of the national plan to Brussels. This is another example of the Irish habit of bolting the stable door when the horse has gone.</P>
    <P>The report makes clear that the best option for Ireland is in supporting the Single European Act.  That is in accord with the country's decision to join the Community and with the decision of the Oireachtas to introduce the Single European Act in the recent past.  The report commits us to more than economic union.  It commits us to support EC integration in relation to the development of the Community's social policy, research and development policy which has cohesion measures to enhance economic and social cohesion as well as the development of a policy to protect the environment.</P>
    <P>The report identifies four measures which are necessary to counterbalance the adverse effects of the Single European Act.  It calls for the development of Structural Funds which, until now, have not been effective in ending the disparities that exist in a number of States, the introduction of macro-economic coordination, the introduction of budgetary and fiscal transfers and differential application of Community policies such as agricultural policy or internal market policy.</P>
    <P>The report makes it clear that redistributive measures must be introduced to counteract the divergent effects of the Act.  It is now imperative that Ireland <Col N="530" /> makes its case for the introduction of each of these initiatives in a coherent fashion.  We should seek to create a climate where the regional effects of the Single European Act have a central position in the agenda.  This will mean a marked contrast to attitudes that prevailed in the past.  The regional disparties have been rectified and, to a fair degree, we have not been prepared to make the difficult choices that would be needed to achieve this objective and that statement also holds true for the European Community. We have been prepared to accept short term improvements in the welfare of certain segments of the Irish community, such as large farmers, while allowing the situation of smallholders to remain difficult.  We have been preoccupied with the short term at the expense of the long term and now we are beginning to pick up the tab.</P>
    <P>There has been some talk of the social dimension but more talk is desirable and should be welcomed.  It is to be hoped that when people talk of the social dimension they are aware of the full social implications of the Act.  The Labour Party want to see the major problem of unemployment come within the ambit of the Single European Act.  It is essential that there is no misunderstanding on this central point and that everybody is aware that the social dimension extends beyond relatively minor adjustments to undesirable effects of economic integration. The country must start to formulate specific policy proposals that will be brought to the centre of the debate on the social dimension.  Irish needs &mdash; and the needs of other Europeans in similar positions &mdash; must be addressed from an Irish perspective.  That will only happen if we take the initiative in generating proposals.  Nobody will look after our interests if we do not do it ourselves.</P>
    <P>It is time we clarified what these interests are and how they are best served in the context of the longer term.  That is a problem in a society like ours where political realities determine that the long term is never longer than the next election and the next election is never longer than four and a half years.  There is need <Col N="531" /> to ensure that whatever debates take place the long terms gets the consideration and importance it deserves. If that occurs it will mark a welcome maturity.  We all have an obligation to level with the public in the long term and we must begin to think in terms that relate to what is happening down the road.</P>
    <P>The report draws attention to the Commission's proposal for social dialogue. That attention is welcome and overdue. The report calls for a consensus at national level and at the level of the firm. The call is welcome.  As they say blessed are the peacemakers.  If that consensus is to be achieved many changes will have to be made.  This will be a great change for some of the industrial relations on the employer side.  It will be in marked contrast to the dominant ideology of free market economics.  It will be at odds with the attitude of &ldquo;let the market rip and we will not bother too much about the poor.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is time that the case of the weak and the under-privileged was stated.  It is time, for example, that more attention was given to the pre-budget submissions of groups such as the Conference of Major Religious Superiors.  The welfare of the one million who are now existing below the poverty line in Ireland should and must be a top priority.  The Labour Party feel that the development of social dialogue has much to contribute to the development of Irish industry.  We will go further and say that social dialogue is an essential ingredient to that development.</P>
    <P>I now want to say a few words about the food industry.  The impact of EC membership on the food industry has been a disappointment.  There are now 38,000 people employed in this sector compared with 49,000 when we entered the Community in 1973.  There are forecasts of further shake-outs in the industry. The need for quality and marketing in the industry has been the subject of a lot of talk, some reports and not nearly enough action.  The industry is plagued with problems that relate to seasonality, quality of product and an industrial policy <Col N="532" /> that has supported grants and fixed investment rather than grants which would ensure that food produce is high, is of consistent quality and that it is marketed effectively.  Some of these problems have been compounded by the Common Agricultural Policy and by the structural nature of Irish agriculture. Neither of these problems have been effectively addressed and now we are beginning to pick up the tab for that negligence in the form of declining employment in the sector.</P>
    <P>The food industry is faced with a static product base in milk and to a lesser extent that is also true in the meat sector.  The response to this problem as far as one can judge is a frantic scramble for milk, with co-operatives engaged in cut-throat competition, which in these days is termed a milk war.  It is a pity that the ingenuity which goes into these wars is not channelled into adding value to Irish products which can be exported.  We have the lowest level of added value in respect of our food products in Europe.</P>
    <P>The situation in the case of the meat industry is particularly alarming.  The technological capacity of that industry remains very low.  The meat industry seems to major in the exploitation of grant opportunities with little attention to matters like product development or marketing.  It is a pity that the system encourages this type of behaviour, where the wise birds of the trade can take to killing cattle, sawing them down the middle, putting them into a refrigerated truck and making for Europe confident in the knowledge that somewhere between the eastern bloc border or the south of France they will be able to unload and even if the worst happens they can convert the factory back home into a dance hall or perhaps a centre for slot machines. It seems clear now that the scale of much of the food industries is too small.  It is imperative that the players are provided with the encouragement to attain the necessary skill so that value added in Irish food products can be increased and jobs can be saved and increased.  Expansion would be especially welcome in this sector as it is based on indigenous <Col N="533" /> material and has many of the characteristics being cited as essential for worthwhile industrial development.</P>
    <P>There is a need to look at our education system and the values that underpin it. It is difficult to take a country seriously as being committed to business and industrial development when the anxiety of most parents, as indicated by competition for university places, is to land their children into a profession where, in general, they make a modest contribution to job creation.  If we are serious about solving the major problem of job creation the system, and the values that are fostered, will have to put job creation as a very important priority.  It will have to ensure that those who develop industry will, in relative terms, as well rewarded.  Is there enough emphasis on relevant research, research which is economically useful as distinct from research that is interesting to the researcher?  Is there enough emphasis placed on harnessing all the expertise available in the country for industrial development?  We have had relatively little strategic thinking about Europe.  As I said, already we have been unable to think long term.</P>
    <P>Would we have been better served had we been more questioning about the value of the Common Agricultural Policy?  Should we have been more vigorous in suggesting that some of the common market agricultural policy resources be diverted into the Regional Fund?  Above anything else, it is vital that we should begin to contribute to the formulation of European policy.  If we do not do that we will face a series of rearguard actions.</P>
    <P>We are going for the single market and in doing so we are going for change. There will be winners and losers and for the sake of the losers it is essential that the social dimension gets the attention it deserves.  We must act seriously, coherently and vigorously to ensure that this happens.  It seems to me that we are already behind in this work.  I am glad to see there is talk of further studies in relation to how the different sectors will be affected.  We must act to improve our <Col N="534" /> infrastructure, particularly in communications. We must improve our technological awareness and capacity.  The State and the educational institutions have a vital role to play here.  It is clear that there must be much greater emphasis on indigenous industry.  We now seem to have gone full circle when we are back to the stage when Irish industrial development is to be provided from our own resources in contrast to the situation where it was mainly to be generated by foreign investment.</P>
    <P>The European Community is a political institution.  It was founded with the fundamental objective of avoiding war in Europe.  The turmoil in Europe in recent days presents new challenges for the Community, and indeed new challenges for this country.  The report has given the facts and it should have dispelled much of the euphoria about the Single European Act.  It has given us a clear idea of what we need to do.  It is good that somebody has been honest with the Irish public.  It is a pity it did not happen sooner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>This report is very welcome as an excellent document in itself and it is also welcome as a very timely and worthwhile study of the implications for us of membership of the EC.  It is important at this juncture, on the eve of 1992, that we do some very effective stocktaking about our situation within the EC and that we go forward with a very clear and very concise notion about our real business.</P>
      <P>If this report is a worthwhile stocktaking exercise and a worthwhile analysis of the EC and its implications for us over the years it also has some very stark and very bleak news for us.  We cannot escape the sad set of realities in the report.  The report makes it clear that we are farther from the average European living standards than ever we were and that is a very serious, very damning and a very challenging comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report points out that we have the highest rate of unemployment in Europe. We have approximately 250,000 people unemployed at the moment, a very serious problem for those people who are <Col N="535" /> affected.  The money we are giving to our long term unemployed is not adequate. We are far from the average European living standards with the highest rate of unemployment in the EC.</P>
    <P>We also have the highest level of emigration in the EC.  Every year 48,000 people leave the country.  The number of people who leave every year, to put it in more imaginable terms, would make a very large crowd at an all-Ireland football final in Croke Park.</P>
    <P>That is the scale of the number of talented young people who leave every year.  That emigration has very serious implications because it is the young people who have the skills, physical energy and the capacity to create wealth who are leaving.  Not only are they the wealth-producing sector but they are the ones who could give our society the required vibrancy, the required development that it will need in future years.  We are bedevilled with the crisis of emigration. That is one of the stark, bleak and damning findings of the report.</P>
    <P>The report states that we are below the European level of average income, that we have the highest rate of unemployment in Europe and have a damning, crippling, depressing level of emigration. If all that is not bad enough, the report also finds that the flight from the land has intensified beyond measure.  Our family farms are decaying and the number leaving the land multiplies by the thousand on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>One-third of those remaining on the land live below the poverty level.  That is part of the findings of the report of the Commission on Poverty, and is an extremely serious matter as well.  We are confronted after our term of membership of the EC, as we look at this very fine document, with the reality of low living standards relative to the rest of Europe, with monstrous unemployment, tragic and famine-like emigration and vast rural poverty.</P>
    <P>That is a very serious state of affairs, but within that there is another very sad reality which I must submit to this House for consideration.  I can say without fear <Col N="536" /> of contradiction that there is not sufficient Government concern about the problem.  We have within the island two structures.  We are developing a two-tier society.  I am convinced that we are losing sight of the reality of rural poverty in the west, the north-west and in other depressed, disadvantaged regions.  What we are creating is an island of poverty within an island and that is a very serious and damning fact.</P>
    <P>I want to draw attention, first, to the fact that one-third of our farmers are living in poverty and that the small family farm is decaying as an entity in rural Ireland.  I also draw attention to another very simple reality, that in the north-west of this country, for instance, in my own county of Cavan at the moment, a very simple and important reality is that the entire county road structure is breaking down.  The implications of that for the quality of life of the people who live along those roads and often, too, for those who live beyond them, those who live in the back hills as it were, are serious.  If the road structure of a county affects the quality of life of the people it also affects the economic life as well as the food processing sector which is strong in the area I am talking about.  In my county activity in that sector has been brought almost to a standstill.  The commercial life of the county generally is affected. The school buses can no longer travel on these very bad roads.  In addition, the public health nurses and the general practitioners are talking of not being able to travel on those roads for much longer. That is an example of an area within the country becoming the victim of tremendous neglect and deprivation by central government.  There are large areas of this country which could have benefited tremendously from the severely handicapped areas money available from Brussels if an application in that respect had been processed.  The counties of Cavan, Monaghan and a number of counties in the west that have not been classified as severely handicapped could be so classified if an application to Brussels was made immediately.  That classification would cost us very little in real terms because <Col N="537" /> we would get up to 75 per cent funding from Brussels.  The remainder would come from central government here but there would be a return to the Exchequer of such moneys by the hardheaded business and farming communities of these areas.</P>
    <P>We are missing great opportunities. We are missing the opportunity to fight for equalisation of our position in relation to the other countries in Europe.  As an island, Ireland, according to the NESC report findings, is falling below the level of living standards in the rest of Europe. As an overall entity Ireland is failing to perform on many levels within the EC. It is bad enough that Ireland is slipping within the EC but we are allowing dangerous regional disparities to develop, even within the country.  That is why I cited the example of the roads of County Cavan and of the position in relation to the exclusion of the area from the severely handicapped areas category.</P>
    <P>We must immediately change our entire approach at the negotiating table in Brussels.  We must identify with the other areas of the EC which are disadvantaged, which are peripheral, which are suffering from peculiar problems and poverty.  We must unite with those areas and develop a co-ordinated and strong position in relation to seeking adequate regional and social funding.  If our Government do not go to Brussels making very specific and strong demands, in conjunction with the other weaker members of the Community, we will continue to fall behind the rest of Europe.</P>
    <P>We must change our approach to the administration of the regional funds here. We must use the vehicle of the local democracy in local councils to identify the projects that qualify for benefit from the Regional and Social Funds.  Having done that, we must permit the local authorities to play a very active role in the distribution of those moneys.  It is regrettable that when the recent national plan was being drawn up the local authorities were not given a major role in its preparation.</P>
    <P>My final contention in relation to our <Col N="538" /> performance at European level is that we must seek in a vigorous fashion to redress the imbalance that exists.  As a peripheral country we must seek additional aid. Having done that we must go down the road of redressing the imbalances within our own country.</P>
    <P>Until we solve those difficulties we cannot say that we have adequately participated in the EC or that we have responded to the demands of our people. While unquestionably the essential conclusion of the NESC report is that the country, on balance, benefited from membership of the EC, as is undoubtedly the case, it is unfortunate that we have not managed those benefits in a better way.  It is unfortunate that we have not delivered more to the poorer regions of the country.</P>
    <P>We should look at the plight of the farming community bearing in mind that one-third of farmers live below the poverty line.  There is a major flight from the land.  We must look at the question of intervention and of putting beef into intervention.  The time has come when we must consider changing from the highly expensive system of putting beef into intervention to one of subsidising the producers and, indirectly, the consumers.  In that way we would be making the food available to the consumer at a cheaper price.  It can be very expensive and time consuming to put beef into intervention. We should look at this because, ultimately, it is wrong to be putting beef into intervention if there is no justification for it.  We will have to examine that scheme.</P>
    <P>Finally, the time has come when we must decide to use our membership of the EC to achieve a greater distribution of wealth throughout the Community. We must pursue policies that will lead to our advancement at EC level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to say that to a large extent &mdash; I know the NESC report does not cover political events &mdash; we should recognise when we read this report that it has been overtaken by what has happened in the last few weeks in <Col N="539" /> eastern Europe.  Whether we like it or not, we cannot ignore that fact when we are considering the report.  Who knows in what shape the EC will actually be by 1992?  It is impossible to say whether East Germany will be a member then, whether Hungary or Austria will be members, whether the EC will consist of 15, 20 or 30 members, whether, indeed, the EC will exist or whether it will have a need for its existence.</P>
      <P>As Senator Upton said quite so rightly, whereas the European Community is now principally an economic community, a community which sets barriers against the rest of the world in an economic way, it was set up originally as a political entity. If it was a political entity then it will, presumably, maintain that political structure in the years to come.  But, one has to ask, if it was set up as some sort of a buffer between the East and the West, whether such a middleman, or such a third power, is necessary any longer?  If the East and West conflict now no longer exists in the traditional conventional sense which we remember, there is no need for a third military or political power of such great might as the European Community.</P>
      <P>Reading the NESC report, as I did this morning, one feels to a certain extent that maybe one is reading a report which was good on the day it was published but which by today is no longer relevant. Having said that, I would like to come to one or two general points about the report.  The first one is that it appears now to be accepted that Ireland and the EC are rushing headlong into integration of an economic, political and fiscal nature with each other.  The report no longer is the sort of report which questions the basic of the EC, or whether we need an EC at all.  The report, having accepted 1992, and having accepted union of all sorts, merely asks how Ireland can adapt towards what it now regards as inevitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should, from time to time, sit back and look at these fundamental presumptions about the EC and ask whether in Ireland we still approve of the direction <Col N="540" /> in which the EC is going.  As the devil's advocate, it seems to me that we should ask the question not just because all political parties have now accepted the European Community but because there are certain straws in the wind which we have seen in the last year or two and which are not encouraging signs for us as a member of the EC.</P>
    <P>I say this in the full knowledge that even The Workers' Party appear now to have taken the European Community on board.  Certainly the Labour Party do not mutter about it any longer.  It is now very unfashionable to even question the direction in which the EC is going.  It was only as recently as last year that we saw the take-over of Irish Distillers by a foreign company, Pernod Ricard.  That indicated a fundamental problem which Irishmen and Irish industry are going to experience more and more in the years ahead.  It was disappointing to see the Fianna Fáil Government, the traditionally nationalist Government of this country, accepting such a take-over of a native, indigenous industry without really a murmur of opposition or questioning. It is absolutely true that the Minister for Industry and Commerce at the time referred the bid for Irish Distillers from a European consortium to the Fair Trade Commission but there was no real effort on the part of the Government here to question whether the integration which we are experiencing with Europe is something which is going to benefit our native industries or is going to benefit the bigger industries in Europe.</P>
    <P>My feeling is that what will happen on the road to 1992 and in 1992, is something which we may as a people greatly regret in the years ahead.  Whereas Irish Distillers was taken over by a foreign company, a European company, with great ease &mdash; the only difficulty Pernod Ricard found was that there was someone else from Europe who wanted it but there was no difficulty faced from this end &mdash; I believe it is quite possible that many other Irish indigenous companies will now find themselves faced by a takeover from France, Germany, the United Kingdom and from all the far bigger industries and <Col N="541" /> powers in Europe.  If we accept 1992 in the way we are accepting it in this report, we will be able to do absolutely damn all about this.  The result will be &mdash; it may be inevitable but it should still be questioned &mdash; that all the best companies, and certainly the best public companies in Ireland, will be taken over by their much larger foreign competitors and all the bad ones will be left to fester, to go under and go bankrupt as a result of unimpeded competition.  It is conceivable, although it would have been unthinkable ten years ago, that Allied Irish Banks, the Bank of Ireland, Cement Roadstone and all the other major Irish public companies will no longer not only be quoted on the Irish Stock Exchange, in which I should have a vested interest, but they will no longer exist as independent companies.</P>
    <P>I have heard from nobody in this debate, or in any debate about the European Community, or from any Government in the past five years, any questioning of this particularly unhealthy and difficult trend.  If it is not too late, the Minister, and the Government, should not sacrifice indigenous industry on the altar of efficiency.  It is quite possible that we really will not have any indigenous, efficient industry in 1992 and the years after it.  The consequence of that will be the banks like the Deutsche and the Dresdner banks will take over AIB and the Bank of Ireland because the Government will not be able to stop it.  I see the Minister shaking his head but they will take over these companies and they will decide who is employed in those companies, whether there will be Irishmen or foreigners employed in them, and what expertise is used.  The Government will have very little control over the matter.</P>
    <P>Acceptance of the EC, of course, means sacrificing a certain amount of autonomy but in this particular area it is something which needs a rethink, it is something which not just for sentimental reasons but for good, solid economic and parochial reasons as well we should reconsider.  Otherwise we may be handing over too much control not only over the financial aspects of our industry but over employment and who is employed <Col N="542" /> here.  That is the direction in which we are going.</P>
    <P>The second and only other point I want to make is about the European Monetary System or the ERM as it has come to be known.  The benefits of that system are something which all of us here should probably applaud.  It is not something which is particularly well understood and it is not something which was anticipated as being so beneficial in the years when it was introduced, as long ago as 1979.  Indeed, in 1979 we entered that system with mixed feelings.  I can remember that at the first summit meeting when the system was set up we actually withdrew and decided not to go into the system.  There was great confusion and then a week later we changed our minds and went into the system after a lot of coming and going and to-ing and fro-ing to Brussels.  There were great difficulties for Ireland about that because it involved a break with sterling and an attachment to the European Monetary System.  It was a big step, a step which many here did not understand.  To a certain extent we were stepping out into the unknown when we had been cosily attached to sterling since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>While the entry into that system was traumatic at the beginning, while it was something which I do not think the Government even understood at the time, where nobody knew exactly where the system was going, it has been of great benefit to Ireland.  One of the reasons is because of the enormous amount of foreign investment in Government stocks here.  The attachment we have now to the Deutschemark as opposed to sterling has meant that not only are we linked more closely to German inflation, which is far lower than Britain's which we were linked to before, but we are also linked to German interest rates which are also far lower than the British interest rate. Initially it appeared a foolish move to detach ourselves from the UK which was just about to enter into a period of great prosperity and low interest rates but now we are reaping the rewards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="543" /> The greatest single reward we are getting is the £3,000 million or so which has been invested mostly by German banks but by other banks throughout Europe in Irish Government stocks which has been an extremely effective way of the Government borrowing money.  I can remember in 1980 as a stockbroker going around German, Dutch and French banks attempting to convince them that now we were a member of the EMS they should be investing in Irish Government stocks.  At that time they were very reluctant. Most of them did not even know there was a market in Irish Government stocks and they certainly had no investment in Irish Government stocks but gradually, as a result of the European Monetary System, they have realised that they can now invest and there is virtually no currency risk to themselves.  The result has been that there has been a free movement, despite exchange controls which we imposed on ourselves against Europe, of money into the Irish market which has been very, very beneficial not only to the Government but also to the Irish people.</P>
    <P>The only danger the Government should be aware of &mdash; of course the Department of Finance are aware of it &mdash; is that if at any stage the large investment which is made into Irish Government stocks looks a little unhappy with the home that it has found, there would be a flood of money, maybe £1,000 million or more, attempting to come out of the country in one day.  That is something which the market, obviously, could not take.  That is not something which is anticipated as going to happen today or tomorrow, but at some stage all that money, because money will be flowing freely around the markets of Europe, will undoubtedly look for another more attractive home possibly with the EMS but possibly with higher interest rates. When that happens we will feel the harsher edge of EMS membership and we will have to find an alternative method of funding.  At the moment it has been of great benefit to us and we have not felt the breeze of British higher inflation or British higher interest rates as harshly as <Col N="544" /> we might have done if we had remained attached to the British market.</P>
    <P>Finally, if we are to continue going in this direction we should hear more from the Minister and from the Government about where we are going in terms of a common central bank and a common currency.  The logical conclusion of the financial direction in which we are going, the monetary direction in we are going, is towards a central bank and a common currency where currency fluctuations are just eliminated from the European equation. It may not be particularly good for those of us who earn our living in the financial services sector that currency speculation within the countries should be eliminated but it is something which would be of enormous benefit to trade and industry within these currencies because currency hedging is a very skilled and a very chancy type of a business which costs industry money.  Were this to be eliminated by the introduction of a common European central bank, by a common European currency, we would find it would be of great benefit to us all. We are half way down that line and we have been great beneficiaries.  Finally, I should like to welcome the fact that this report was commissioned, and to welcome the fact that we are debating it, but it may be right to say that even at this stage the report is irrelevant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with the Members who complimented the NESC on the preparation of this report. I should like to stress that our future, economically and otherwise, certainly lies within the framework and structure of the European Economic Community. However, we have not, as a very disadvantaged nation on the periphery of Europe, received the treatment from the European Economic Community that we ought to have received.  We are severely disadvantaged geographically; we are severely disadvantaged as an island and by the fact that we have a very small population.  In spite of these significant disadvantages, we must acknowledge that we have been net beneficiaries as a member of the European Community <Col N="545" /> over the last number of years.  We have been net beneficiaries to the order of £900 million.  The financial situation of this country would not be what it is today if we were not a member of the EC.</P>
      <P>Successive Governments since 1972 have not laid sufficient stress on the special treatment we were entitled to get. We had every right to receive that assistance as an under-privileged member of the Nine, in the first instance, and subsequently of the Twelve.  Who knows, in the future it may be 15, 20 or 30 nations. I recall that in 1972 there was great euphoria amongst the major political parties about our joining the EC.  Those parties went on a very vocal, vigorous campaign to convince people that our place was in Europe.  Various vocational and voluntary bodies were involved and with others, I advocated membership of the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our views, were perhaps, based on a false and inaccurate presumption, but that was not surprising.  That presumption was that our agricultural industry had unlimited prospects within the context of EC membership.  We accepted that our industry ran the risk of getting into difficulties from time to time and acknowledged that certain industries would go the wall.  We knew that in 1972 but we accepted that against a background of unlimited potential for agriculture. Unfortunately, we know that in the early eighties the whole scenario changed and our agricultural prospects diminished.  A quota on milk production was imposed and opportunities in other areas of production were curtailed.  We succeeded very well in the special arrangements on the milk quota. However, I suggest that we have now to face a new and very difficult problem.  I do not think reference was made to it in the debate, at least not while I was in the House.  Our problem is that a large section of our farming community are living below the breadline.  I am talking about the non-dairy farmers, those who do not have a licence to produce milk for sale.  We have many beef farmers, tillage farmers and mixed farmers.  An exception to the dairy farmers might be sheep <Col N="546" /> farmers who are doing better than those in the other sectors.  We must acknowledge that many farmers are living below the poverty line.  I do not think it has been said loud enough or often enough that there is virtually no future for the non-dairy farmer.</P>
    <P>That is the stark reality.  Assistance must be made available to enable those farmers earn an adequate income from their enterprises.  That position has come about very quickly.  In the past, people measured farmers' incomes on the basis of how many acres they had.  A farmer with 100 acres was considered a big farmer.  A holding of 50 acres was considered viable.  If a farmer had 30 or 20 acres he was considered to be getting into the danger zone.  Now one has to assess the farm income on the type of enterprise engaged in on that farm.  I could not overstress that point.  It is a tragedy to see all the fine land of this country on which people cannot make a living because they are restricted in what they can produce.</P>

      <P>Bhí cineál faitís orm ar feadh noiméid nach bhfeicfinn an tAire Stáit ar chor ar bith, agus tá áthas orm go bhfuil sí i láthair anois.  An cheist atá dá plé agamsa agus atá orduithe agam anseo, b'fhéidir go bhfuil sí i bhfad ón chineál díospóireachta a bhí ar bun anseo ó mhaidin.  Baineann sé go bunúsach le <Col N="547" /> muintir na Gaeltachta agus le daoine atá faoi bhrú uafásach go heacnamúil ar chuile bhealach.  Baineann sé le ceist oideachais atá go mór faoí chumarsáid, agus faoi chaint agus faoi chaibidil i chuile ghné den saol poiblí.</P>
      <P>An ceantair go bhfuil mé ag cur síos air agus an fáth go bhfuil mé ag ordú na ceiste seo inniu, uimhir a haon mar go bhfuil an ceantar féin scáinnte, bocht, gan tada inti, agus go bhfuil na daoine a bhfuil cónaí orthu ann beagnach uilig ag maireachtáil ar chúnamh an Stáit.  Is ceantar é atá gearrtha amach go hiomlán ar imeall na farraige ar leithinis, agus tá na mílte ón scoil dara leibhéal, ón scoil chuimsitheach sa Cheathrú Rua.  Agus nuair a cuireadh an mheánscoil nó an scoil chuimsitheach ar bun, gealladh do na daoine seo agus do na ceantracha imeallacha seo, a bhí i bhfad ón láthair oideachais dóibh, go mbeadh deis taistil sásúil acu le go bhféadfadh siad leas a bhaint as an cúrsa oideachais a bhí á leanúint acu.  Go deimhin ba é Donncha Ó Máille, go ndéanfaidh Dia trócaire air, an fear a thug isteach an córas saor-thaistil isteach agus go príomhdha, bhí sé i gceist go mbeadh daoine ar nós an mhuintear go bhfuil mise ag caint orthu in ann leas ceart, cóir sásúil a bhaint as an gcóras saor-oideachais.</P>
      <P>Mar chuid den chóras sin bhí sé bunúsach go mbeadh taisteal ann agus mar chuid den taisteal a bhí i gceist bhí sé go bunúsach go mbeadh sé saor agus nach mbeadh aon chostas ar thuismitheoirí na scoláirí a bhí le freastal ar na scoileanna cuimsitheacha seo chomh maith le haon scoil eile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is iomaí athrú atá tagtha ar an chóras oideachais ón am a fógraíodh é sin, ach go dtí an lá atá inniu ann tá saor oideachas chun na scoile fós mar cuid d'obair bhunreachtáil an Stáit seo.  Tuigimíd go léir an gearradh siar atá ar fhoinsí airgeadais an Stáit faoi ghnéithe eagsúla caiteachais an Rialtais agus tuigimid go bhfuil orainn uilig inár saol trí chéile, íobairtaí áirithe a dhéanamh le teacht i gcabhair ar an ghearradh siar seo nó an saol eacnamúil mar atá sé faoi láthair.  Go deimhin tá sé sin deánta i go leor bealaí, agus tá sé <Col N="548" /> déanta i gceist na scoile freisin; tá sé déanta i gceist gearradh siar ar úsáid deiseannaí scoile ó thaobh oideachais de, múinteoirí agus a bhfuil ann.  Tá sé déanta ó thaobh gearradh siar ar úsáid na mbusannaí scoile seo.  Ach nuair a thagann sé go dtí an pointe go bhfuil an gearradh siar ann chomh dona sin go bhfuil sé ag goilliúnt go mór ar dhaoine bochta nach bhfuil aon dara rogha nó deis acu a mhalairt de chóras a chur ar fáil, tar éis na gealltanaisí Stáit atá ann dóibh, tá sé thar am go gcaithfeadh an Rialtas rud éigin a dhéanamh faoi agus a gcuid dualgaisí sa mhéid seo a chomhlíonadh.</P>
    <P>Molaim an Teachta Dála a chuir in luí ar an Aire Oideachais, i gcás eile, droim ar ais a thabhairt ar shocrú a bhí déanta, agus an bus a cheadú arís.  Molaim an Teachta Dála ar éirigh leis é sin a dhéanamh. Tá súil agam go mbeidh na Teachtaí Dála in iarthar na Gaillimhe, áit arb as don Aire Stáit féin atá i láthair anseo, in ann a leithéid chéanna a dhéanamh, sa chás seo.  Is dona an scéal é go gcaithfidh scoláirí óga, idir dhá bhliain déag agus ceithre bliana déag, éirí ar maidin ag a seacht a chlog, dhá mhíle a shiúl chuig ionad bhusa, taisteal ar an mbus go dtí an Ceathrú Rua, fanacht amuigh sa bhfuacht trí cheathrú uaire go n-osclófar an scoil agus fanacht ar na sráideanna um thráthnóna ar feadh uair a chloig tar éis dúnadh na scoile.  Ní bhaineann siad an baile amach go dtí a sé a chlog um thráthnóna. Aon uair déag a chaitheann na gasúir seo as an mbaile.</P>
    <P>Sin é an saor-chóras taistil atá ar fáil faoi láthair.  Ná déan dearmad go dtagann an-chuid de na páistí seo ó theaghlaigh atá ag brath go hiomlán ar airgead Stáit. Is beag béile a bhíonn acu ag dul amach ar maidin, ná arís i rith an lae.  Nuair a bhaineann siad baile amach tar éis an lae fhada, ní hamháin ná bíonn fonn ite orthu ach ní bhíonn fonn staidéir orthu, ach oiread.  Níl sé ar a gcumas a dhá nó a trí uair a chloig eile a chaitheamh ar cheachtanna baile.  Más amhlaidh a chaitear leis na boicht sa chóras oideachais, thiar i gConamara, ó thaobh shaor-oideachais agus saor-thaistil ón Stáit, ní mór dúinn náire a bheith orainn mar Stáit agus ní mór dúinn deireadh a chur leis an gcur i <Col N="549" /> gcéill atá ag gabháil leis an gcóras oideachais. B'fhearr go mór do na gasúir sin fanacht sa mbaile nó ag an scoil náisiúnta, agus dul le ceard nuair a bhíonn siad a trí nó a ceithre bliana déag, in áit a bheith ag freastal ar scoil den dara leibhéal gan dada ina mbolg acu.</P>
    <P>Tá litir anseo agam ón bpríomh oifigeach feidhmiúcháin den VEC agus is eisean ionadaí an Aire agus na Roinne sa chás seo.  Do scríobh an bpríomh oifigeach seo chuig an Roinn Oideachais ag míniú an cháis agus ag moladh go hathsuífí an bus.  Bhí freagra cinnte le bheith againn ina thaobh coicís ó shin, ach níor tháinig sé go fóill.  Tá súil agam go bhfuil an freagra ag an Aire Stáit anseo inniu dúinn ar an gceist seo.  Ní féidir a bheith ag súil go mbeidh an córas atá ann inmharthainne.</P>
    <P>Níl na gasúir seo, ná a dtuismitheoirí, ná a múinteoirí ag lorg dada sa bhreis ar a raibh acu an samhradh seo caite.  Más gá dhá bhus 'chuile mhaidin le 175 scoláire a iompar ó thóin Litir Mhealláin chuig an scoil chuimsitheach sa Cheathrú Rua, conas is féidir an uimhir chéanna scoláirí a thabhairt abhaile um thráthnóna agus gan ach bus amháin ar fáil?  Céard a thárla don tarna bhus?  Conas is féidir leis an Roinn Oideachais a leithéid de chleas a imirt ar ghasúir nuair d'éirigh réiteach a fháil thar oíche in oirthear an chontae ar a leithéid chéanna d'fhadhb nach raibh a leath chomh dona.  Nuair a bheas freagra na ceiste sin agamsa, ag muintir Litir Mhealláin, ag muintir na n-oileán agus ag údarás na scoile beidh tuairim éigin againn faoina bhfuil ar bun ag an Roinn Oideachais.  Níl an cás seo ceart nó morálta. Conas is féidir linn a bheith ag súil go dtiocfadh na gasúir sin ar aghaidh go dtí oideachas ag an tríú leibhéal nuair nach féidir leo aitheantas a fháil ar an dá leibhéal eile?</P>
    <P>Cén fáth, mar sin, nach bhfuil cúrsaí anois, díreach mar a bhí siad roimh laethanta saoire an tsamhraidh?  Bhíodh dhá bhus ann maidin agus tráthnóna ach níl anois againn ach bus amháin um thráthnóna. Níl á éileamh ag muintir an cheantair ach go bhfillfeadh na gasúir ag am réasúnta thart faoi cheathrú tar éis a ceathair, in ionad a sé a chlog.  Caithfear réiteach <Col N="550" /> a fháil ar an gceist seo, má tá búnus nó ciall ar bith le saor-oideachas.  Ní lá fás é, más é tuairim na Roinne Oideachais é go bhfuil a gcearta á fháil ag na gasúir seo i gcomórtas le gasúir eile na tíre.  Tá súil agam go dtabharfaidh an tAire aird ar an gceist, go háirithe os é ionadaí an cheantair sin, agus go n-eireoidh chomh maith leis is a d'eirigh leis an dTeachta ó oirthear na Gaillimhe.  Tá súil agam mar sin go mbeidh an bus a bhí acu anuraidh ar fáil acu anois díreach.</P>

      <P>I dtús báire, ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Teachta O Foighil as ucht a bheith tofa ina Sheanadóir.  Nuair a bhí mé i mo mhacléinn sa Spidéal le Gael-Linn, agus eisean ina phríomh oide ar an scoil, níor cheap mé riamh go mbeinn, lá amháin, ag freagairt ceisteanna uaidh sa Seanad.  Gabhaim buíochas leis as ucht a bhfuil ráite aige ach tá teorainní leis an méid airgid atá againn chun an córas a chur ar fáil.</P>
      <P>Is é an chéad rud ba mhaith liom a rá sa chás seo ná go bhfuil seirbhís shásúil iompair á cur ar fáil do na micléinn atá i gceist.  Aontáim leis an Seanadóir go bhféadfaidh sé a bheith níos fearr ach tá an tseirbhís seo sásúil faoi réir théarmaí na scéime agus í gcomparáid leis an gcineál seirbhíse atá ar fáil ar fud na tíre trí chéile.  Nílim a rá go bhfuil seirbhís ó dhoras go doras ar fáil &mdash; nó fiú amháin go bhfuil sí chomh maith agus ba mhian liom í a bheith ach airgead gan srian a bheith agam chuige.  Ach táim sásta go bhfuil an tseirbhis seo ar chomhchéim leis an tseirbhís ghinearálta agus go bhfreagraíonn sé do bhun-aidhmeanna an scéim iompar scoile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An rud a chaithfear a choinneáil i gcuimhne ná gur scéim bhunúsach i seo, scéim atá ag freastal go príomhdha orthu siúd a rachadh sé rite leo freastal rialta a dhéanamh ar scoil dá uireasa.  Fiú amháin agus an scéal seo amhlaidh, tá costas antrom ar fad ag baint leis an scéim.  Le blianta beaga anuas tá go leor ráite annseo faoi chostais na scéime seo.  Beidh fhios agaibh féin go bhfuil iarrachtaí déanta agus á ndéanamh i gcónaí ag an Rialtas seo na costais a bhaineann leis <Col N="551" /> an scéim a mhaolú agus san am céanna caighdeán na seirbhíse a choinneáil sásúil.</P>
    <P>Beidh fhios agaibh freisin go riarann Bus Éireann an scéim mar ghníomhaire don Roinn Oideachais.  Iadsan atá freagrach mar sin as pleanáil na mbealaí bus, agus tá dualgas orthu an phleanáil seo a dhéanamh sa chaoi go seachnófaí costais iomarcacha.</P>
    <P>Is breá liom mar sin go bhfuil an cheist seo árdaithe ag an Seanadóir, mar tugann sé seo deis dom a mhíniú cé chomh costasach is a d'fhéadfadh na seirbhisí seo a bheith, murach go bhfuil srian á choinneáil ar chostais, trí sheirbhísí áitiúla a bhreithniú go rialta agus a ath-eagrú ó am go ham más gá.</P>
    <P>Má fhéachaimid ar chúinsí an cháis seo, feicimid an cur chuige atá i gceist. Suas go dtí deireadh na scoilbhliana seo caite, bhí ceithre bhus &mdash; bus poiblí san áireamh &mdash; ag freastal ar scoil chuimsitheach na Ceathrú Rua.  Mar chuid den ath-breithniú ar sheirbhísí sa cheantar a deineadh i rith an tsamhraidh tháinig sé i gceist go bhféadfaí freastal sásúil a dhéanamh ar an scoil trí bhus poiblí eile a úsáid (a bhí lonnaithe thar oíche ag Tír an Fhia) agus nach mbeadh gá a thuilleadh le ceann amháin de na busanna speisialta.  Faoin socrú seo bhí gá áfach le go ndéanfadh ceann amháin de na busanna speisialta turas dúbalta agus dá bharr sin bhí gá le ath-eagrú ar na cláracha ama.</P>
    <P>Mar thoradh ar na socruithe seo uilig, tá moill ar na micléinn, moill nach raibh ann go dtí seo, go háirithe i gcás na macléinn ón dTrá Bháin agus ó Leitir Mealláinn. Agus, ar ndóigh, d'fhéadfainn a rá gur chuir an Comhairleoir, Nioclás Ó Conchubhair, an ceist seo orm cúpla seachtain ó shin.  Tá seisean mí-shásta freisin leis an chóras atá ar súil anois. Ach arís caithfidh mé a mheabhrú dhíbh go bhfuil an tseirbhís nua ar chomhchéim le seirbhísí den chineál céanna ar fud an cheantair agus ar fud an tíre.  Glacaim leis, ar ndóigh, gur nadúrtha é go mbeadh díoma ar thuismitheoirí má fheictear <Col N="552" /> dóibh go bhfuil ísliú tagaithe i gcaighdeán seirbhíse áirithe.  Ach mar a dúirt mé níos luaithe caithfidh mise a chinntiú go bhfuil na seirbhísí ar chaighdeán sásúil faoi réir théarmá na scéime.  Táim sásta go bhfuil sé seo amhlaidh sa chás seo.  Agus seirbhísí nua á gcur ar fáil i gcónaí ní fhéadfá costais na scéime a choinneáill ar leibhéal reasúnta murach go ndéanfá ath-bhreithniú agus ath-eagrú rialta ar na seirbhísí áitiúla go léir.</P>
    <P>I ndeireadh na dála sé atá á iarraidh anseo ná bus a chur ar ais in úsáid sa cheantar seo sa chaoi nach mbeadh ar dhream macléinn ceathracha nóiméad nó mar sin a chaitheamh ar láithreán na scoile tráthnóna, toisc go bhfuil turas dúbalta i gceist.  Tá sé coitianta go leor ar fud na tíre turasanna dúbalta a bheith i bhfeidhm agus tá glacadh coitianta leis na moilleanna a ghabhann leo.</P>
    <P>Bheadh sé an-chostasach &mdash; b'fhéidir suas le £50 sa ló &mdash; bus a chur ar ais ar an mbealach seo agus thairis sin ní bheadh lán-úsáid á bhaint as an mbus sin nó as an tseirbhís phoiblí atá ann faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Tá sé ráite freisin i dtaca leis an gcás seo go bhfuil plódú ar bhusanna áirithe. Tá deimhniú faighte agam ó Bhus Éireann nach bhfuil a leithéid amhlaidh.</P>
    <P>Tuigim go maith go gcuireann sé as do na tuismitheóirí agus do na micléinn go bhfuil an tseirbhís a bhí acu go dtí le déanaí caillte acu, ach tá súil agam go dtuigfear &mdash; agus táim féin sásta faoi sin &mdash; nach bhfuil aon éagóir déanta annseo.</P>
    <P>Breathnóidh mé arís ar an scéal agus déanfaidh mé scrúdú air de bharr an méid atá ráite ag an Seanadóir, go háirithe faoi na hamanntaí go bhfuil daoine ag fágáil an bhaile, a seacht a chlog ar maidin agus nach mbíonn siad ar ais sa mbaile go dtí a sé a chlog tráthnóna.  Scrúdóidh mé an cás sin agus rachaidh mé chun cainte leis an Seanadóir nuair a bheidh an scrúdú déanta.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 22 November 1989.</P>
