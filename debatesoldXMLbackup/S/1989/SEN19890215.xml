      <P>I have notice from Senator Seán Haughey that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to allay public anxiety in regard to the recommendations of the Stardust Tribunal Report in view of recent media reports in that regard.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator John A. Murphy of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The recent large increase in the number of experiments on animals.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator John Connor of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to intervene to stop the precipitate closure of St. Patrick's Psychiatric Hospital, Castlerea, at any time during the coming year and that the Minister makes a statement on the future of this Hospital.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Maurice Manning of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The serious situation in the National Library where gross understaffing has led to a drastic reduction in service and security which has now reached crisis proportions.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Gerry Reynolds of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in view of the joint <Col N="3" /> statement following a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference, to state what steps are being taken to proceed with the restoration of the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore Canal.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Brendan Ryan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The delay by the Minister for Social Welfare incompleting the review of the system of operation of social welfare appeals.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Haughey, Murphy, Connor, Manning, Reynolds and Ryan as suitable for discussion. I have selected the matter raised by Senator Haughey and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m.  Senators Murphy, Connor, Manning, Reynolds and Ryan may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, I would like to refer to Item No. 41, which stands on the Order Paper in the names of a number of Fine Gael Senators.  Arising out of recent libel awards in the courts, there is genuine concern about the uncertainty of the Irish libel laws.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he could see his way to having the motion debated at the beginning of a major public debate on this subject.  I believe there is an urgent need to ensure that there is clarity in this particular matter.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom i dtús báire tacaíocht a thabhairt don Seanadóir Ó Conchubhair.  The Senator and I are on the Joint Committee on the Irish Language. The Senator is perfectly right, in my view, and I formally support him in asking you to ensure that simultaneous translation facilities are available in the renovated Chamber.  It is, of course, an appalling reflection on the Houses of the Oireachtas that a Member of this House from the Gaeltacht cannot find somebody who can do that sort of work in Irish. Tréaslaím dó gur ardaigh sé an cheist agus tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh toradh as go tapaidh.</P>
      <P>In the light of what has been reported in the news media, I request the Leader of the House to consider a change in the Order of Business today to discuss Item No. 26, which is a motion concerning the state or the absence of human rights in Iran.  We have had the frightening spectacle of a head of state calling for the execution of an individual because of a book he wrote.  A considerable amount of fire in this House has been directed against other régimes who have quite legitimately been criticised for things they have done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was endeavouring, subject obviously to the Chair's guidance, to explain to the House why I think Item No. 26 now assumes considerable <Col N="5" /> urgency.  The point is made that things were said yesterday which frightened all of us, and most of us are not easily frightened. I ask the Leader of the House, and I formally propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that Item No. 26 should be taken for an hour and a half today.  I formally propose it on the possibility that the Leader of the House will not accede to my request.  Therefore, I want to have it on record that I would like it to be done.</P>
      <P>The second matter I wish to raise is to ask the party opposite if there is any possibility that they would change their mind about the Bill I endeavoured to introduce last week, given the reports today of the extraordinary conflict of interests that has arisen about the Chairman of the Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Níl mé cinnte cén áit a raibh mé nuair a bhí mé ag caint ar an Bhille seo an Déardaoin seo chaite ach tosóidh mé arís inniú.</P>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill in the Seanad and the opportunity to speak on it.  I welcome also the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, who is here today to take the Bill on behalf of the Government.  I have a few things to say which I hope the Minister will take notice of during the course of my contribution and I will be considering tabling some amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pollution of all types has been very much in the news in recent times.  People generally have become conscious of the dangers of pollution to our countryside, our waterways and our seas.  It is a good thing that public awareness has been generated and that most of us have woken up to the obvious dangers, and indeed the hidden dangers, of pollution.  Let me if I can reduce it to its simplest.  Prevention of pollution is each individual making sure that he or she does not by any act or neglect or carelessness do anything or cause anything to pollute streams, rivers, lakes or seas.  If everybody looks after their own area then we will have no pollution.  Every farmer, industrialist, house owner, septic tank owner, every local authority and every Government Department, must play their part in avoiding the dangers of pollution. If every individual is determined to avoid pollution of any type in his own <Col N="9" /> locality, local river, lake or sea, then we will have pollution-free waters.</P>
    <P>Of course, we need the protection of legislation, and perhaps the threat of large fines may be a help, but we also need to be vigilant that the control of our waterways is not taken away from us because of any activity which would cause pollution of any kind.  If every individual in every community protects their lakes, rivers and seas in their own areas, then our waters will be free of pollution.</P>
    <P>I will, therefore, deal with my own region, which is the Corrib-Mask and the general Connemara region of County Galway.  We have in Galway-Mayo the Corrib-Mask, vast stretches of clean unpolluted water, a gem in the eyes of Europe.  The Corrib covers approximately 44,000 acres and the Mask over 20,000 acres.  The Corrib-Mask lakes are interconnected with the rivers and numerous small lakes in Connemara and, of course, are also interconnected with the sea through the same system.  This vast lake is fed also by the rivers on the eastern side from the farming lands of east Galway and Mayo.  This is mainly farming land with agricultural enterprise and we must be constantly vigilant against any type of pollution from that source.</P>
    <P>I believe farmers are now more aware than ever of the danger of pollution and the vast majority of them will take all possible steps to ensure that their farming activities will not cause pollution. However, where farmers do not take all the necessary steps to avoid pollution, the rigours of the law should apply.  I would like to pose a question arising from paragraph (a) of the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum attached to the Bill.  It states:</P>
    <P>an amendment to the &ldquo;good defence&rdquo; provision in section 3 (3) of the 1977 Act to put a greater onus on the person charged to prove that he could not reasonably have foreseen that his act or omission might cause pollution of waters (section 3).</P>
    <P>In relation to paragraph (a) of section <Col N="10" /> 3, if a farmer who, say, five years ago erected a silage lay-out and slatted shed on the advice of ACOT advisers and to the regulations set down by the Department at the time and he qualified for a grant under the farm development schemes and that now, five years later, that lay-out is causing pollution to a stream, river or lake, is he exempt from prosecution?  Is the fact that his work was passed for grant purposes by the Department proof that he could not reasonably have foreseen that his act or omission might cause pollution of waters as stated under paragraph (a) of section 3?  I would like the Minister to respond to that when he is replying to the debate.  If such a silage lay-out or slatted shed is in danger of causing pollution, would it be the responsibility of the Department to rectify the situation or would it be the responsibility of the farmer?  This should be clarified.  Where this arises, the farmer should be grant-aided to bring his buildings or lay-out up to the required standard.</P>
    <P>Another aspect regarding the farm buildings regulation is that a farmer with five cows gets the same literature and is governed by the same regulations as a farmer with 50 cows despite the vast difference in the incomes of the two farming enterprises.  Farmers, by and large, through information from their farm advisers, farm co-ops, farming organisations and the media, have become aware of the dangers of farmyard pollution and they are now much more conscious of the potential damage that this pollution can cause to rivers, streams or lakes.</P>
    <P>The jewel in the west of Ireland is the Corrib-Mask region and this can be promoted as the largest unpolluted, free fishing lake in Europe.  The potential of this wonderful waterway, if properly promoted, could be worth hundreds of millions of pounds in tourism revenue to this country and to this largely underdeveloped region which depends so much on tourist business.  Up to 15 months ago it could have been promoted as the largest and greatest free fishing lake in <Col N="11" /> Europe, before the Government introduced the now famous rod licence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke against it here in the Seanad on 18 December 1988.</P>
      <P>Rightly or wrongly, anglers and other users of the Corrib saw this licence as a means of the Government taking over control of the Corrib.  This is one of the reasons why the legislation has been resisted.  These other uses, I have no doubt, would lead to pollution of our lakes and rivers.  At the time I did not see this danger but subsequent events have established quite clearly that there was a campaign to take over our lakes for fish farming and thus create a further threat of pollution to our waterways.  The introduction of this licence coincided with the development of fish farming activities in Connemara and along the west coast generally. The ordinary people of the Corrib-Mask and Connemara regions became alerted and by their campaign of public awareness saved at least the Corrib-Mask from the introduction of fish cages.  This may seem an unreal threat to the outside observer but it was a real threat and I will establish that now by proof of what was happening in regard to attempts to put fish cages into the fresh waters in our area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To realise the threat the Corrib-Mask region was under one would have to realise the vastness of the salmon farming projects taking place in the sea water in sheltered bays along the west coast.  To supply those salmon farms with smolts, it is required to rear the smolts in fresh water, lakes or rivers, or in so-called land based hatcheries which are smolt-rearing <Col N="12" /> installations on the banks of rivers, discharging their effluent into the rivers and lakes.</P>
    <P>To give some idea of the vastness of this salmon farming business I will quote some statistics from a document produced by the Western Regional Fisheries Board, <i>Potential Sites for salmon smolt production for the aquaculture industry in the Western Region:</i></P>
    <P>It is estimated that there will be increasing demand for salmon smolts by the aquaculture industry in the region over the next 3 years.  The projected figures are: total requirement, 4 million; existing output, 0.5 million; planned output for new units extensions, 1 million; future requirements from 1987-1990, 2.5 million.  According to the I.A.A. the lack of available freshwater sites is impeding the development of the industry in the region.  Therefore, at this stage, it is important not only to identify the projected smolt requirements but to decide how and where this can be met. Salmon farming is of growing economic importance to the region but Irish producers have to be competitive with their counterparts in Scotland and Norway and operating costs affect this. According to Roberts 1987, the operating costs are&mdash;</P>
    <P>I will not give them.  The document further states:</P>
    <P>There is little published information in relation to the cost of smolt production on land based sites versus cages, but undoubtedly the capital costs associated with land based units is a prohibitive factor for many small operators.</P>
    <P>The industry requires sites within 2 hours driving time of the sea cages.  In practice this means that sea farms in the board's jurisdiction would most likely have to be supplied with smolts produced within the region.</P>
    <P>There are 25,000 smolts to one tonne, 4 million smolts equals 160 tonnes.</P>
    <P>It takes approximately 250 million litres of fresh water to produce one tonne <Col N="13" /> of fish, that is 55 million gallons.  It will require 8,800 million gallons of fresh water to produce four million smolts or 160 tonnes each year.  To get this into perspective, for example, Galway city uses 8 million gallons of water each day or 300 million gallons of water each year.</P>
    <P>The annual production of 4 million smolts will require about three times the amount of fresh water that Galway city uses each year.  This massive amount of fresh water is only available in Lough Corrib and Lough Mask.  It would not be economically viable to the multinationals who have invested tens of millions of pounds already in fish farm projects around the west coast if they were not able to produce their raw material smolts i.e. the young salmon, for putting in the fish cages.  So therefore, it is quite clear that those developers had their eyes on the Corrib-Mask as the only area of lake with volumes of water sufficient to produce the number of smolts required for their investment in their sea farming activities.  There was not enough fresh water elsewhere in Connemara or County Galway to rear the smolts so the pressure was on from high places to allow those multinational fish farm developers to get their smolt rearing cages on the Mask and the Corrib.  But fair dues to the people of Galway and Mayo, they saw the danger and were alerted in time and by their public awareness and public demand they closed that door, but barely in time.</P>
    <P>In case the Minister thinks I exaggerate, let me outline what was happening in my county and, indeed, in my neighbouring county which the Minister represents, County Mayo.  The multinational companies pursuing fish farming were eventually able to get permission for smolt rearing on lakes and rivers by persevering with planning applications and appeals and then applying again.  I will give just two examples to outline what I am saying and to prove that what I am saying is factual.</P>
    <P>Example No. 1 is planning reference 53604 to Galway County Council.  This was an application to Galway County Council by Bradan Mara for an onshore <Col N="14" /> salmon hatchery at Ballinahinch granted by Galway County Council on 27 April 1987 and appealed to the Appeals Board. The applicants in this case, strangely, did not wait for a decision from the Appeals Board but they proceeded to lodge another application, planning reference 54294.  This was granted by Galway County Council on 19 June 1987.  This decision was also appealed to the Appeals Board and both these decisions were decided on by the Appeals Board on 28 September 1987.  Despite the complexities of this case, this was a fairly quick decision, in three months, by normal standards of the Appeals Board, but stranger was to occur.</P>
    <P>Planning reference 53604 was refused by the Appeals Board and planning reference 54294 was granted by the Appeals Board, both on the same day.  It is quite clear the applicants must have had some knowledge of the likely outcome of planning reference 53604 when they did not wait for a decision from the Appeals Board and yet lodged another similar application three months later which was decided by the Appeals Board in their favour at the same time.  As well as that, it might be of interest to point out that some months before the Appeals Board decision in this case, the company concerned, without permission, started to erect a road through a forest to the site, another clear indication to me that they had knowledge of the likely success of one of their planning applications.</P>
    <P>The next example I will give is just as startling as the previous one.  I am certain that the Minister for the Environment, if he were here, would take special interest in this one as not alone does it affect my county but it also affects the neighbouring county of Mayo.  This application, again, was a double application, first planning reference 52454.  This was a planning application by Eisc Iathglas Teo., seeking permission for fish cages in Lough na Fooey.  To anybody who does not know, this is a lake at the head of Lough Mask, which feeds the Mask and also connects to the Corrib.  This planning application for fish cages in Lough na Fooey was refused by Galway County Council on <Col N="15" /> 17 July 1986 on two grounds.  I got this information as a result of a notice of motion put down to Galway County Council in June, 1988:</P>
    <P>Reference No. 52454: Eisc Iathglas Teo., permission for fish cages in Lough na Fooey refused by Galway County Council on 17 July, 1986 on two grounds:</P>
    <P>(i) public health hazard in head waters of Lough Mask which is a major source of public water supply and</P>
    <P>(ii) injury to visual amenity.</P>
    <P>Refused an appeal by An Bord Pleanála solely on grounds of visual amenity.</P>
    <P>Yet, despite the refusal of the application I have referred to, 52454, a similar application was made to the same planning authority by the same company for submerged fish cages in Lough na Fooey, planning reference No. 55416.  This was decided on by Galway County Council on 17 February 1988 and it was decided to grant temporary permission for five years.  This is now on appeal to the Appeals Board and it is quite obvious that even the Appeals Board at this stage are getting the message about the danger and the resistance to fish farming on those lakes which is being used as a water supply.  Even though Galway County Council decided on 17 February 1988 to grant permission, exactly a year later the Appeals Board has not made a decision in this case.  Yet in the earlier case I quoted, reference 54294, it took the Appeals Board only three months to make a decision to grant the application. The penny has dropped even with the Appeals Board and this is due to the awareness of the people and the public interest created by these matters.</P>
    <P>This has caused the people of the Corrib-Mask area to fight to preserve their waters free of any type of pollution.  It is still extraordinary in my opinion that the planning permission was granted by Galway County Council because if cages in application 52454 were a public health <Col N="16" /> hazard, as quoted in the County Council document, in head waters of Lough Mask, which is the major source of a water supply in the Minister's constituency, submerged cages would be no different.  They would create the same health hazard in my opinion.  All this, despite a recommendation to Galway County Council from the Western Health Board dealing with planning permissions and I quote from a document of the Western Health Board.  It is headed: <i>Application for permission for on shore salmon hatchery and associated site works at Cloonnacatan</i>.  It reads:</P>
    <P>We recommend that planning permission should be granted, subject to the following conditions.  That water is not extracted downstream for human consumption.</P>
    <P>I would also like to quote at this stage a letter issued by the Western Health Board in October 1986.  This concerns again the whole question of the Western Health Board's opinion of the pollution that may be caused and the dangers of fish farming development in waters being used as public waters supplies.  This is a letter from the Western Health Board in October 1986, signed by A. W. Halloran, supervisor environment health officer.  It states:</P>
    <P>The approach to water supply sources must be to protect and preserve them because of the significance of the wholesome water supply in relation to public health.  Any threat, therefore, to an existing source must be resisted. This principle is reflected in E.E.C. legislation relating to water supplies.</P>
    <P>Intensive fish farming is still at the development stage and little research has been carried out on its long term effects on drinking water.  We know, however, that it is almost universal practice in fish farming to use antibiotics in the feed to control disease and chemicals to control parasitic infection.</P>
    <P>Amongst the chemicals used are Formaldehyde, Malachite Green, Hyamine, Acriflavine, Dipterex and <Col N="17" /> Enheptine.  The first four listed are suspected carcinogens and the last two are known carcinogens.  There is no comparison in the use of Malachite Green in topical application for a limited period of time and its consumption in drinking water for a lifetime.  The fact that these substances are used means that they will be present in the drinking water, as conventional treatment will not remove them.  They will of course be used in very low levels and may be undetectable using existing techniques.  However, their presence in the water cannot be denied and this information, once it becomes known could give rise to great fear and anxiety in the community.  People would fear that their water supply would be contaminated with dangerous chemicals and no amount of expert advice would alter this view.</P>
    <P>Antibiotics which are used in the feed will be present also in the water supply and the food chain.  Again they would be at very low levels, but because their properties and effects are so well known, their presence could give rise to the same anxiety as would be the case for suspected and known carcinogens.</P>
    <P>The last planning application I will quote is planning application reference 51426 to Galway County Council.</P>
    <P>This is an application for a salmon, par and smolt rearing installation at Bunatobber on the Kilroe River, Corrundulla, Co. Galway.  This permission was granted by Galway County Council on 24 February 1985.  It went into operation some time in 1985-86 yet they did not have a licence to discharge effluent in the Kilroe River and this was only applied for two or three years later, planning reference 112-86.  This licence to discharge was granted by Galway County Council on 1 June 1988.  The decision to grant the licence to discharge effluent is now on appeal to the Appeals Board and, again, there is no decision on this one.  Yet, the enterprise has continued to operate since 1986 and must be discharging effluent without any licence to discharge.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="18" /> The extraordinary thing about this enterprise is that one mile downstream from this installation, the Kilroe river flows into the Corrib at Ballinduff in Luimneach Bay on the Corrib near Headford. This permission was granted despite the known attitude of the Western Health Board from several internal memos and from the statements of the health board officer.  Out of this same Luimneach Bay which is a sheltered bay on the Corrib near Headford, three major group water schemes draw their supply, the Kilcoona-Caherlistrane scheme with over 600 houses, the Annaghdown scheme with 300 users and Crosswood/Cloughan with about 250 houses.  All of this water is untreated water, just chlorinated.  The major pipe from the Crosswood/Cloughan scheme has been brought to Headford and is ready to be connected to the Headford town supply when a suitable pumping station is erected.  This is ready for connection and Galway County Council have also indicated that they propose to take a supply from this area to Tuam.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to explain the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum. It reads:</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the amendment of section 3 of the 1977 Act which imposes a general prohibition on causing or permitting any polluting matter to enter waters.  Subsection (1) amends the present &ldquo;good defence&rdquo; provision so as to place a greater onus on the person charged to prove that he could not reasonably have foreseen that his act or omission might cause or permit polluting matter to enter waters.  Subsection (1) also replaces section 3 (5) (a) of the 1977 Act by a provision clarifying the effluents to which the general prohibition does not apply. Subsection (2) empowers the Minister to restrict or repeal, by regulations, the exemptions set out in sections 3 (5) abnd 3 (6) of the 1977 Act; any such regulations must be laid in draft before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Because of the fact that the person getting permission to discharge effluent into <Col N="19" /> the Kilroe river in this case, does it prove that he could not reasonably have foreseen that his act or omission might cause or permit polluting matter to enter waters?  I have given three examples of planning permission sought &mdash; I could give more &mdash; and how it was eventually granted and the circumstances in which it were granted.  Are we serious about the prevention of water pollution or are we going along blindly hoping for the best, maybe to discover in five, ten or 15 years that we have destroyed an asset and a lake like the Corrib-Mask which might take hundreds of years to restore?  Are we going along blindfold, without proper knowledge or concern about the effects, if any, that the discharge of effluent will have on major water supplies?</P>
    <P>It should be pointed out that Galway city with a population of 47,000, and the surrounding areas, draw their water from the Corrib.  Fish farms, so-called land based, which is only based on the edge of the river disposing their effluent into the river, should not take place on lakes or rivers used as water supply sources because of the chemicals and antibiotics which are used to control disease and parasitic infection.  There is concern in County Galway about the operation of fish farms.  Lettercraffroe Lake upstream from Oughterard and the Kilroe river where salmon smolt rearing is taking place are used for drinking water when it enters the Corrib and it would appear that granting planning permission for these two fish farms is in conflict with the regulations relating to water supply for human consumption.  There are a number of group water schemes with over 1,000 houses being supplied from the very bay into which one of these fish farms is disposing of its effluent, and more importantly, a much greater demand will be made in the foreseeable future on this source of supply.  In <i>The Connacht Tribune</i> of 23 September 1988 Galway County Council published details of its Tuam Regional Water Supply project. This envisages the provision of water for Tuam with a population of 6,700 and the neighbouring electoral area from Lough <Col N="20" /> Corrib with an intake point in Ballyduff Bay which is in the townland of Luimneach East and Luimneach West, from Luimneach Bay where the effluent is being discharged from an upstream fish farm.</P>
    <P>To meet the additional demand, the County Council expects that water will be pumped from the bay at a maximum rate of 50,000 cubic metres per day.  The Minister for the Environment has stated publicly that ecological interests will not be sacrificed for the sake of creating jobs. I contend he must take action on those so-called land based fish farms and particularly he must ensure that this stretch of Lough Corrib is kept unpolluted.  This is used for drinking purposes for 1,000 families at present, and an estimated 2,500 when it will eventually cater for the Tuam Regional Water Supply and possibly another 1,000 houses in the Headford area when the supply is connected to augment the present Headford supply scheme.  He must assure those people that the principle stated by him will be applied with the primary object of ensuring that the quality of the water is safeguarded.</P>
    <P>I know that due to public awareness in Counties Galway and Mayo the Minister for the Marine responded in May 1988 when he issued a statement concerning the imposition or non-imposition of fish cages on fresh water, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Marine, Mr. Brendan Daly, T.D. wishes to clarify the legal position and policy with regard to the placing of aquaculture projects in freshwater lakes.  The Minister has stated that no such projects will be permitted in lakes where there are major wild fisheries i.e. trout and salmon.</P>
    <P>The Fisheries Conservation Act, 1959 requires that aquaculture projects in lakes be authorised by the Department of the Marine which has discretion as to whether or not they are allowed to proceed.</P>
    <P>In certain instances, local authorities have by Order extended the jurisdiction over specific lakes, usually <Col N="21" /> where the lakes are used for water extraction &mdash; this is a growing phenomenon. In those instances, cage based projects <i>also</i> require planning permission and are subject to the normal notification and scrutiny provisions of the Planning Acts and may not proceed without approval both from the Department of the Marine and the appropriate Planning Authority.</P>
    <P>I welcome that statement because of the concern being expressed in the regions I have dealt with.  How can county councils monitor this actvitity in fish farming because fish cages and smolt rearing is such a new phenomenon and we have not got the expertise to deal with this matter at county council level?  How can they, on a continuing reduced budget each year, have enough personnel to monitor what is going on in our lakes and rivers?</P>
    <P>The last sentence in the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum states: &ldquo;The Bill does not give rise to any additional financial or staffing costs.&rdquo;  How can we avoid additional financial or staffing costs if we are to properly monitor an ongoing situation?  How can local authorities continue to do this on a reduced budget?  For example, in 1988 in Galway our capital grant was reduced by 14 per cent or £1.4 million.  Again, this year it has been reduced by 5.5 per cent or £560,000.  I pose the question in all seriousness: how can the county council monitor pollution in vast areas like Galway with so many rivers, lakes, waters and seas in the light of these cutbacks?  Very shortly, because of the lack of money being spent on county roads, it will be impossible to travel some of the roads in County Galway to get to the lakes and rivers to see what is going on.  I know of situations already where people living in remote areas of Connemara have to park their cars at the end of the county road and walk to their houses, a distance of half-a-mile or more.  This is the reality of the way people in my county are living at present.  Perhaps it is different in other counties.  In the north and south Connemara regions in particular some county roads have been washed away.  If there <Col N="22" /> are not roads to get to the lakes and rivers &mdash; leaving aside the inconvenience to local people &mdash; how can the relevant officials on a continually reducing budget monitor some of the possible causes of pollution?</P>
    <P>In May 1988 the Minister for the Marine made a statement concerning the placing of aquaculture projects in freshwater lakes.  I submit he should have gone further in this matter.  He did not mention anything about having any opposition to so-called land based smolt-rearing installations and those can have the same detrimental effect as any projects in fresh water and can cause pollution.  Even with land projects the effluent has to be discharged into a river which eventually will find its way into the lake.  This must have the same effect on our freshwater as if those enterprises were conducted in the lake.</P>
    <P>I do not apologise to anybody for putting my feelings on the matter on the record of the House.  I am only mirroring the feelings of the people who have been alerted by the dangers they see around them in the development of fish farming in Connemara and the dangers they see to the Corrib-Mask area of Galway-Mayo particularly in relation to the possible pollution dangers to the Corrib and Mask waters from fish farms based in the head waters or in contributory rivers to those lakes.  Who will thank us as public representatives in ten, 15 or 20 years time if we now remain silent and allow some multinational, high-powered, high-financed companies to take over our waters?</P>
    <P>Will the generations to come after us thank us if we in the eighties stand idly by and allow anything to go ahead that might endanger the natural, God-given, free-from-pollution waters of the Corrib and Mask which I have described as the greatest unpolluted freshwater lake in Europe?  We will be hardly thanked if we stood idly by and allow anything to happen which might have a detrimental effect on those natural limestone lakes. These lakes are the greatest natural fishing asset in Europe &mdash; when we settle the rod licence question.  They could be sold <Col N="23" /> to the people of Europe because there is nothing to equal them on the Continent. In Europe you have to book your fishing time in advance; there is a queue and a whistle is blown when your time is up and you are only fishing for fish which were put into the lake perhaps a year or so before you came there.</P>
    <P>In my own area we have the greatest unpolluted 60,000 to 70,000 acres of water on the Corrib-Mask and it would be a sin if the public representatives of the area did not do everything possible in their power to maintain asset.  I have taken up this campaign vigorously to support the efforts of the people of that region in ensuring that the Corrib-Mask will remain as far as possible an unpolluted, free, natural lake.  Those who follow us will not thank us if we do not stand up now and be counted in this matter.  I am asking the Minister to join in my plea and stand up and be counted on behalf of the people of the area I represent, on behalf of the people he represents and on behalf of the people represented by the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, had to be called out on business.  We have had a change of Ministers of State.  I began the debate last week in the presence of the Minister for the Environment.  I welcome the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, whom I know has a keen interest in local authority and local government matters.  I have made my contribution at a slight disadvantage as regards looking for replies to some of the questions I have posed but I know they will be dealt with adequately.  However, over the past two weeks, I have made my speech to three different Ministers.  I know that could not be helped and I am not faulting any of the Ministers concerned because these things happen.  I am sure my views and the serious and very strong feelings I have on the matter will be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I have gone into great detail because I thought it was necessary.  From my position as a representative on Galway <Col N="24" /> County Council and Galway Borough council for many years I can see at firsthand what is going on.  An attempt was made about a year ago &mdash; and it was at its strongest before the Minister for the Marine made that statement in May 1988 and the evidence I have given in my contribution here today substantiates it &mdash; to get fish cages on the head waters of the Corrib and, indeed, on the Corrib-Mask itself.  I am glad that threat has temporarily abated but we and the Minister must be vigilant as public representatives to ensure that such a thing could never happen.  If I can get assurances in that regard on the record I will be very glad of them.</P>
    <P>I have responded to this debate because I was aware of what was happening in my own county and I am sure the Minister and Ministers of State are aware of what is happening throughout this area.  I am aware from my observations that people are now alerted to the dangers.  The bluff has been called: no longer will people take threats of any type of pollution, particularly such as I have outlined here.  I will quote just a couple of publications which came to my notice recently; there are 20 or 30 of them but I will only quote two of them.  The first one is from the <i>Irish Skipper</i> of January 1989: It says in the heading: &ldquo;660 Applications for Fish Farms&rdquo;.  The second one is more recent, I only read it today coming up on the train.  It is from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 14 February 1989 and says: &ldquo;&lsquo;Sea Threat&rsquo; appeal to Daly&rdquo;&mdash; meaning the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Daly.  It states:</P>
    <P>An alert on the &ldquo;serious threat&rdquo; to outstanding beaches on the Connemara coast has been sounded by the Roundstone Community Council.</P>
    <P>It is concerned at the Department of the Marine's decision to designate the 70 square miles of inshore seas from Slyne Head to Mace Head as suitable for fish farming....</P>
    <P>that is from outside the Ballyconneely golf course to a location on the Galway side of Carna.</P>
    <P>A licence to farm salmon in cages is <Col N="25" /> essentially a licence to dump effluent into the surrounding waters, uneaten food, excrement, antibiotics, pesticides and dyes, according to the chairwoman, Ann Conneally.  No local inhabitant has been consulted about the Department's decision and a licence to farm salmon has been granted to North Connemara Farmers' Co-operative Society.  The Minister, Deputy Brendan Daly, should specify this a designated area before the area is irreparably damaged.  I support the call by Ann Conneally of the Round-stone Community Council.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this is visible to anybody travelling the road recently, or in the last year, from Letterfrack to Leenane along by the very beautiful Killary Harbour.  It is like a battlefield, with all types of unsystematic fish cages littering the bay for a space of three or four miles. It is like something left after scrap merchants or people of that nature had departed in a hurry.  It is a scandal that in one of the highest scenic amenity areas in Connemara this should be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>I would like to know if the Bill deals with inland fresh water pollution and sea pollution.  I know that county councils have planning jurisdiction only up to the high water mark and have not control of planning outside that.  I wonder if there is any provision in this Bill to control development in seas as well?  In the sheltered bays around the Connemara coast very grave damage can be done by fish farming development in such bays over which we have no control as a local authority.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying I will be considering amendments to this Bill at a later stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The objective of this Bill is to modify and extend the present arrangements for control of water pollution with a view to ensuring that the quality of water resources is maintained at a high level &mdash; very important and very praiseworthy aspirations.  I would like to think that this Bill will allay the fears of Senator McCormack and many other people who, like all of us, have a real <Col N="26" /> interest in the whole area of water pollution. I welcome the Bill which, hopefully, will go a long way to end this problem of water pollution.</P>
      <P>When we look back over the past few years we will think, perhaps, of the summer of 1987.  It is one that will be remembered for the very high number of serious water pollution incidents and obviously these incidents could not be allowed to recur.  I see this Bill as a clear response to that problem.  When you consider that the last comprehensive water quality report by An Foras Forbartha in 1987 identified the sources of long-term water pollution as 70 per cent urban-industrial and 20 per cent farming or agriculture and 10 per cent other miscellaneous sources, one can readily understand that local authorities and industrial and farming activities generally would figure prominently in this Bill.</P>
      <P>While there are additional effective control powers given to local authorities, it is a fact that in very many cases local authorities are major offenders.  In so far as Athlone is concerned, it is a fact that the entire sewage effluent from Athlone town and the environs is discharged untreated into the River Shannon just downstream of the town and it is also a fact that the Foras Forbartha report has indicated very little evidence of pollution in the River Shannon and in some of the lakes.  It is not desirable that effluent be discharged into any river and while we hope that it will end, it is a fact that it has been going on for a long time in Athlone. As we have the Minister with us, we cannot let the opportunity pass without commenting on the fact that proposals for a full treatment plant have been with the Department of the Environment for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept this is not a problem peculiar to Athlone.  I imagine that pollution in a river smaller in size and perhaps less swift flowing might cause many real problems. In the river near Athlone it has been noted that the absorption capacity of the receiving waters is so vast that pollution is dissipated within a few metres of the actual outfall.  Whether that would <Col N="27" /> happen generally in the case of slow moving rivers and lakes I do not know.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the 20 per cent of pollution attributable to farming.  We are aware that there are pollution control grants for farmers in disadvantaged areas.  This is something that is understandable but it might also be seen in many areas as somewhat unfair.  The principle of the designated disadvantaged area has eliminated most of Westmeath from this scheme and bearing in mind that Westmeath is a great lake county, the fact is that many of the farmers in the Lough Derrevaragh and Lough Owel catchment areas will have financial difficulties. Requesting remedial work from them surely means that they should get some form of grant assistance in line with what is given to other areas of disadvantage. Some farmers simply cannot afford to carry out overhauls without financial assistance.  People in Westmeath resent the fact that so many farmers in the designated disadvantaged areas are getting a better deal.  This, in so far as the local authority-farmers relationship in Westmeath is concerned is bound to have some influence; they would feel in some way that they are getting a raw deal.</P>
    <P>As regards Lough Derrevaragh, I want to welcome the fact that a similar task force exercise as we had at Lough Sheelin has been arranged for Lough Derrevaragh and I would like to congratulate the Department of the Environment and my colleague, Deputy Henry Abbot, for his great work in bringing this about.  I think it is something that will be appreciated generally.</P>
    <P>In so far as the farming community is concerned, I hope that this Bill in seeking to penalise a known hard core of deliberate or careless polluters, would not frighten the genuine farmers because many of them are quite careful about water pollution and are playing their part to help in the matter.  Farmers must be given due recognition for the huge reduction in instances of fish kills from silage effluent, etc. from a total of 82 fish kills in 1987 to 22 in 1988.  These figures <Col N="28" /> have been officially recorded by the Cental Fisheries Board.  The vast majority of farmers fully understand the seriousness of this problem and are anxious to play their part.</P>
    <P>In respect of unauthorised discharges from trade premises into waters or sewers, perhaps the Minister might say if the local authorities or the fisheries people can reclaim all costs that have been incurred in the investigations, the monitoring and in the sampling that would have to take place.  I am just wondering if the local authority or the fisheries people have powers under section 10, which is the section that deals with direct intervention by local and sanitary authorities to prevent or deal with any water pollution incidents, to serve notices on such trade concerns?  Can the industry be held responsible for any damage caused by their particular action and can they be made to pay for all costs involved in this detecting, monitoring or rectifying of the damage?  Perhaps the Minister would comment on that.</P>
    <P>I note there is no mention of pollution from the use of boats and the use of pleasure craft.  I am not even sure if it is a contributory factor.  Many people have suggested to me from time to time that it can be a factor.  I would again make the point that certainly in a fast river such as the Shannon it may not be, but in slow-moving rivers and lakes it may be a problem. Perhaps the Minister would comment on that.</P>
    <P>There is certainly no significant evidence of pollution within the channel length, of 2,550 metres, of the River Shannon, that is within the Athlone Urban District Council areas, even though the average daily traffic through Athlone lock during August 1988 was 59 boats.  That may not be a real issue and prehaps the Minister would comment on it.</P>
    <P>I am convinced the Government are taking the important question of water pollution very seriously and I think it is working.  There is now a greater awareness of the problem.  I would like to think that advice has paid off and will continue to pay off.  The local authorities also are <Col N="29" /> taking a tougher line with polluters; as the evidence shows, we have had a trebling of prosecutions under the Water Pollution Act, 1987.  The heavy penalties provided for in this Bill will surely make people realise that the financial risks are not worth it.</P>
    <P>There is an increase in the maximum figure on summary conviciton from £250 to £1,000 which applies under the Water Pollution and the Fisheries Act.  The other penalty is a new maximum penalty on conviction which has been increased from 5,000 to £25,000 or imprisonment for a period of five years.  These are very severe penalties and I hope they will have the desired result.  I do not think, as Senator McCormack suggested, that we are running blind in this area because I see this Bill as a very serious attempt to rectify the important problem of water pollution.</P>
    <P>I support in theory the views of Senator McCormack that we have a duty to ensure that no one, whether through carelessness or greed, will risk damaging one of our most valuable natural resources.  The Bill will go a long way to rectify the problems that exist in the whole area of water pollution.  I congratulate the Minister for bringing forward the Bill and I sincerely hope it will be a huge success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to keep the House too long.  Any Bill that sets out to modify or extend the present arrangements for the control of pollution in the interests of the quality of the water we drink, or bathe in or use for fishing etc. must be welcomed.  It is good to see some of the provisions in the Bill will go a long way towards dealing with pollution problems.  It is particularly good to see the onus being placed on the persons charged to prove that they could not reasonably have foreseen that they were going to pollute water by their action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also encouraging to note the extension of the grounds on which High Court intervention can be sought by direct intervention. The extra powers that are conferred on the local authorities are also welcomed, particularly in the area where <Col N="30" /> they can insist on getting more information on water extraction and discharges and in relation to the whole question of activity involving water in industrial plants, etc.  Also to be welcomed are the powers that assist in the prevention of pollution by any means.</P>
    <P>It is equally encouraging to see that we have about 13 amendments to the Principal Act and that individuals have the right to seek a court order requiring the person responsible for pollution to mitigate or remedy any effects of the pollution in the manner and in the period specified by the court.  It goes on to state that the court may also order the polluter to pay the costs incurred by the applicant in investigating, mitigating or remedying the effects of the pollution. These are all welcome aspects of the Bill and welcome developments in the whole matter of dealing with water pollution.</P>
    <P>Most of us will agree that any environmental damage is very serious.  It is only right that from time to time problems, such as smog or whatever it is should be highlighted.  There is more concern about water pollution than anything else because the problem is much more widespread. The problem of smog can be confined to towns &mdash; some parts of towns could be free from it while other parts of towns and cities could be highly polluted &mdash; but when it comes to water, having regard to all its uses, for drinking, bathing, fishing and so on, the damage, for example, caused by seepage from an oil tanker can be colossal and can have long lasting effects, not only on the water itself but on everything around it, the forests the farms and the fish.</P>
    <P>The discharge of raw sewage and effluent into rivers is a very serious matter.  In many cases while factories get bigger the amount of healthy water diminishes.  It is very serious indeed.  I do not know if the Bill covers the question of records and data relating to discharges into the rivers.  Even though the licences given to the people who have the right to discharge demand that they make monthly records, I have a feeling that this is not adhered to.  It is one of the areas <Col N="31" /> where the Bill perhaps may not have gone sufficiently far enough to ensure that it can be done.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but I have a reservation in this particular case.  It is that if you give power to the local authorities in a comprehensive Bill to deal with the whole question of water pollution &mdash; it is certainly a very considerable step forward from the way we have been dealing with the problem &mdash; then you must extend to them the facilities to make sure that they can monitor the whole situation.  We have to think of all that is happening in the Bill in the sense of so many amendments to the Principal Act, the whole question of application to the High Court for individuals and the local authorities and also the question of collecting data on a much more regular basis.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the provisions of the Bill allow the fines paid by defaulters to go directly to the local authorities rather than to the courts and this is a welcome development.  It is a great extension to the powers of the local authorities. When you get back to the question of all of those powers being allocated to the local authorities, you inevitably come down to the question &mdash; this is where the &ldquo;but&rdquo; comes in &mdash; of staffing.  I am not satisfied that in dealing with a comprehensive Bill like this, where the powers are extended to the local authorities, that the staff situation at the moment will enable all the work to be done.</P>
    <P>The reservation I have about the Bill is the fear that, having given all these powers to local democracy it would be very sad indeed if they could not, because of understaffing, give full effect to the powers to protect the environment, particularly the effects of water pollution. That is the sad part of the Bill.  I hope the Minister can reassure me on that point. Quite frankly I am worried about it and I doubt if he can.  It is like the tax situation. You can go after all the tax defaulters but if you have not got the staff to monitor and research the matter you will come back to square one.  All the goodwill and <Col N="32" /> the good intentions of the Bill can be lost in such a situation.</P>
    <P>Many things can happen; for example, there is the worrying feature of the oil seepage from the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i>.  At the time we did not have a contingency plan and the disaster had a very serious effect on wildlife in the area.  One really does not know the full extent of the damage done when water is polluted, particularly as a result of seepage from an oil tanker. Naturally, we do not know if the environment around the whole area is in danger.  We do not know if any samples were taken from the water and sent for proper analysis by international experts.</P>
    <P>When there is a case of pollution it may take years for the full effects to become apparent.  Fish kills may result from something that happened years before but because of lack of testing and because the local authorities had no powers in the matter it was not possible to do the test necessary at the particular time.  We do not know if our Merchant Shipping Acts are up-to-date or if they are suitable to deal with any problems that may arise.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a very good one and I am very pleased to see it coming before the House.  The Government have responded well to the situation and we must give them credit for it.  At the same time, we do not know if the Bill can accomplish all that is intended.  My one reason for making a contribution on the Bill was to get these points across.  I appreciate fully what is in the Bill and I appreciate the efforts of the Government in this particular direction.  However, I do not believe their good intentions can come to fruition because of understaffing.</P>

      <P>I would like to compliment the Minister on the measures he has already taken to prevent water pollution.  These measures include surveys of farms in high pollution risk areas by task forces organised by local authorities. Pollution awareness and advice campaigns were organised among farmers by Teagasc and ACOT and the new scheme of pollution control grants were introduced for farmers in disadvantaged <Col N="33" /> areas.  I particularly welcome the awareness and advice campaigns.  I believe that many people who pollute our waterways are unaware of the damage they cause to fish life and to our amenities.</P>
      <P>Pollution control grants are obviously having a significant effect in combating pollution.  However, I ask the Minister to use his influence in getting an extension of the grants available in disadvantaged areas to the rest of the country.  In disadvantaged areas grants of up to 55 per cent and 69 per cent for young farmers are available, while in counties like my own, Wexford, only 20 per cent and 25 per cent respectively are available with the exception of the 3 per cent disadvantaged area we have.  Although we have only a 3 per cent disadvantaged area, about 1,000 farmers in our county have an income less than £5,000 and 2,500 farmers in my county have viability problems.  The cost of taking preventive measures such as slurry holding facilities and slurry spreading, are the same throughout the country and I feel that the grant should apply the same throughout the country.  However, measures which have already been taken by the Government and the Minister have resulted in a dramatic fall in the number of fish kills.</P>
      <P>The Minister deserves great credit for the considerable effort undertaken to raise public awareness of water pollution. In the period leading up to the presentation of this Bill valuable work has been done to make the public aware of the effect of people polluting our atmosphere. In co-operation with bodies such as Teagasc and ACOT advice campaigns have helped to explode many myths surrounding this question.  Taking a positive view, I feel that a lack of knowledge or awareness of their actions on the part of farmers rather than a cavalier disregard for our waterways, leads to much of the damage caused.  Given the efforts of relevant authorities to dispel any illusions under which farmers may be labouring, it is entirely justifiable to introduce stiff penalties for the minority who persist in anti-social and destructive activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="34" /> I should like to compliment the Minister on providing moneys for the upgrading of local authority sewage treatment and disposal facilities.  New plants in Portlaoise, Fermoy, Carlow and Malahide have meant a serious reduction in the problem of pollution in these areas.  I ask the Minister to give serious consideration for giving the go-ahead to Wexford Corporation to start the main drainage scheme.  At present, sewage is going into Wexford Harbour through 27 outfalls and is untreated.  If we could get our main drainage scheme going we could go ahead with our marina plans and finish our urban renewal plan.  It would certainly enhance the area.  I should like, at this stage to compliment the Minister on introducing that scheme in Wexford.  It is having a significant effect on the town.</P>
    <P>Section 21 allows a local authority to make by-laws relating to all or a particular part of its functional areas, prohibiting or regulating specified activities carried on for the purpose of agriculture, horticulture or forestry, where the authority considers it necessary to do so in order to prevent or eliminate pollution of waters.  I welcome this power given to local authorities.  They are much more familiar with the situation than those in central Government.</P>
    <P>Section 22 sets out the procedure to be followed when a sanitary authority intend to make an order declaring a combined drain to be a sewer.  Up to now a certain amount of confusion existed in this area. I had a case in my own constituency lately where people had taken legal action in order to ascertain who was responsible for a particular sewer.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides that where an offence is committed by a corporate body and it is proved to have been committed with the consent or connivance of a director or manager, then they are liable.  I particularly welcome this decision to make company secretaries liable for any pollution caused by their corporate body. The payment of fines to local authorities is a very practical decision and the Minister must be complimented on this.  I welcome the amendment to the &ldquo;good defence&rdquo; provision, which will place a <Col N="35" /> greater onus on the person charged to prove that he could not reasonably have foreseen that the actions would cause pollution.</P>
    <P>Section 20 deals with the fact that polluters now may be liable civilly to charges of pollution.  This should provide an effective deterrent.  Also, people will realise that this is not only a problem for local government or central Government but for individuals as well.  I welcome the Bill which strengthens the legislation.  It ensures that in future polluters will pay the price.</P>

      <P>The Water Pollution Bill aims at protecting the water resources of the community in the interests of the community and to promote tourism.  The Water Pollution Bill is very important to many community interests in the country over a long priod of time.  I come from County Leitrim.  We seem to be at the end of the line in having certain schemes provided.  In Leitrim there is a serious problem in providing potable water to homes, in particular to rural areas.  Some 22 per cent of the homes in County Leitrim had no piped water supply at the time of the 1981 census and today the situation has not improved.  Socially, that is a great disadvantage to any area.  If 22 per cent of a county has not the facility of piped water it is at a disadvantage because of the cost of boring for water and people will not be inclined to build houses in such an area.  Unfortunately, Leitrim is the only county whose population has decreased and if we are not able to compete and give the same services as any other county the population will continue to decline.  That is an area the Department should look at very seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an EC directive which requires certain standards to be maintained in the quality of drinking water.  There are quite a number of group schemes in County Leitrim and they are servicing the community well.  As they stand they are very well appreciated.  However, the quality of water in some of the group schemes is <Col N="36" /> disastrous.  For example, in the Coraleehan group scheme, which is just outside Ballinamore, the water there is basically bogwater.  You could get away with selling it as Guinness rather than as drinking water.  The water is brown.  If we are to take up the EC directive we must do it properly.  The quality of water piped into homes is very important.</P>
    <P>Quite an amount of money has been spent on an existing scheme, called the South Leitrim Water Scheme.  Basically, the water is provided from the Shannon to areas such as Mohill, Carrick-on-Shannon and Ballinamore.  Last week the ESB said that the level of water in Lough Allen was very low.  They closed gates and they wanted to raise the level.  A treatment plant has been provided in Carrick-on-Shannon, one of the most modern, which cost between £1 million and £2 million.  I am informed it was built basically to deal with alkaline water.  There was an increase of pH in the water &mdash; perhaps the people in the Department are more informed than I and they can correct me if I am wrong &mdash; and it arrived in households with sand at the bottom. People will obviously turn to their public representatives to ask what is happening.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that there has been a large investment in a treatment plant and once the initial investment is made it should cater for all eventualities. Obviously, this did not happen so far as the scheme was concerned in my part of the country.  This scheme, eventually &mdash; however long &ldquo;eventually&rdquo; means &mdash; will be extended to most of the housing in south County Leitrim.  There are proposals for the extension of this scheme to the rest of south County Leitrim.  It is farcical to spend over £1 million on a treatment plant when things like this happen.  Even though it may only occur once over a long period with that initial expenditure it should be able to cater for all eventualities.</P>
    <P>Sewerage can also cause pollution. There are a number of proposals from the local authority in Leitrim.  About 16 sewerage schemes are proposed for Ballinamore, Manorhamilton, Drumkeerin and villages along the Shannon such as <Col N="37" /> Leitrim, which is starting due to the allocation from the Department of the Environment, Drumsna and Dromod.  These are tourist areas.</P>
    <P>I agree with a lot of what has been said about tourism being one of our major industries.  Are we seriously trying to promote tourism if we leave areas such as the villages along the Shannon without proper sewerage facilities?  If tourists arrive and there is raw sewage coming out of an inadequate scheme going into the Shannon and major tourist areas, obviously it is very offputting.  The investment must be made so that this type of situation cannot happen.</P>
    <P>Everybody is being blamed for pollution, farmers, pig farmers, and so on. It is a fact that sewerage schemes in many areas are actually causing pollution and local authorities have to deal with it.  I am taking my county as an example: it is the only one I can speak of with any great idea of what is going on.  Certainly in Ballinamore a sewerage scheme that has been there for the past 35 to 40 years is now totally inadequate to deal with the sewerage going through the system. Leitrim County Council or any council in the county have to make application to the Department to provide the money.  A letter arrives back from the Department saying: &ldquo;due to lack of funds we cannot provide money for a sewerage scheme&rdquo;. Where is the ball going to stop?</P>
    <P>We can talk all we like about water pollution but there are schemes in this country which are perhaps not 100 per cent causing pollution but are certainly helping to cause it.  If the Government will not finance the improvement of these schemes we are not going anywhere.  It is all idle rhetoric.  We are the best country in the world for coming up with laws and legislation but if we do not genuinely make finance available to rectify the problems caused by sewerage schemes how can we put this into law?  When a farmer causes pollution because of slurry going into a stream which, in turn, may go into a river and cause fish to die, he can be prosecuted.  As legislators we cannot make law for one section of the community and not for another.  As <Col N="38" /> public representatives we have the ability to provide finance for sewerage schemes that would help enormously to stop part of the pollution problem.  We have to lead by example.  If we do not, we are fooling ourselves and showing bad leadership to other members of the community.</P>
    <P>A couple of months ago there was a matter on the Adjournment regarding the pollution of Lough Sheelin.  I do not profess to know a lot about Lough Sheelin but anybody who looks at television or reads the newspapers knows that Lough Sheelin is one of the main areas where pollution caused many problems as far as tourism is concerned.  It killed tourism in that area and pig farmers and farmers generally were blamed for it.  I got some information from Cavan County Council which stated a survey was carried out and one of the main causes of pollution in Lough Sheelin was the sewerage scheme in Ballyjamesduff.  My information is that money has not been spent to rectify this problem.  Local people have been accused by the media of causing the pollution. I am not defending them &mdash; they are part of the problem &mdash; but I am trying to emphasise the point that if we do not as a Government and as public representatives tidy up our own business we cannot expect ordinary individuals to act responsibly.  We cannot have a law for them and another law for us.</P>
    <P>The chances of Leitrim County Council getting any finance for the 16 proposed sewerage scheme applications are very small.  We cannot blame local authorities because they have not got the funding to do this work.  We can talk all we like about financial rectitude but if we are serious about implementing this Bill to try and boost our tourist areas and to try and have good quality water we have to clean up our own act.  I ask that the Department give funding to schemes that have been applied for by local authorities. The local councils will carry out the work once they are given the finance for it.  In the short term it will improve the whole structure of the community.  It will give people more reason to become <Col N="39" /> involved in tourism-orientated projects and, in turn, will help the economy.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about implementing the provisions of the Bill we will have to back up our ideas with finance.  There is no point in talking here about legislation when problems can be solved by spending money wisely.  The Minister would have to agree with that.  This Bill is wide-ranging, but if we do not clear up our own house, we cannot expect ordinary individuals to prevent pollution.</P>
    <P>Grant aid has been made under the western package for the provision of slurry tanks and slatted houses.  It is all rather farcical.  We are getting about 35 to 40 per cent which is very welcome; but ten years ago in my part of the country there were ACOT advisers, Department of Agriculture people and local authority people who advised on the size of tank to build and there was a grant provided for it.  Now these tanks are in and they are not doing the job but are causing pollution.  That was money badly spent. If we are going to make the initial capital expenditure we have to do it properly. Otherwise there is no point in coming back to this House or to the Lower House in five or ten years time with more legislation to prevent water pollution.</P>
    <P>Now is the time to rectify the problems throughout the country.  If the grants are made available to the farmers, I have no doubt they will do the work that has to be carried out.  If the Department make money available for modernising sewerage schemes in each county we will have gone a long way towards preventing water pollution and we will be able to say we are a pollution-free country, with fresh air, good lakes and waters.  We have to be the leaders in the matter and that is what I would dearly love to see resulting from this legislation.  However, there is no point in having all this legislation if we do not tidy up our own act first and provide the money that is so badly needed to help stop water pollution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivianOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to congratulate the Minister for the Environment and the Minister of <Col N="40" /> State who is with us this afternoon on what can only be described as particularly significant legislation.  It is a comment on the quality of the legislation that there has been no real criticism of it apart from the inadequacy of funding for sewerage and water schemes and so on.  It is not a problem peculiar to this Minister, but anybody with any doubts about the commitment of this Government to deal with the problems of pollution has only to read this Bill and the Air Pollution Bill which was published in recent weeks.  These are two major pieces of legislation.  Obviously we are going to address ourselves this afternoon to the contents of the Water Pollution Bill, but it is important that we record our appreciation of the obvious commitment of the Minister for the Environment and his Department to grapple in a serious way with the problem of pollution.</P>
      <P>It should be said at the outset that pollution is not a major problem here and that needs to be repeated often.  Listening to some of the comments here last week, and to a lesser degree today, one would imagine that this country was awash with pollution.  That is not the case.  Recent surveys have indicated quite clearly that somewhat less than 2 per cent of the waters of this country are seriously polluted. That is not a boast.  We should be striving to have no pollution of any description in our waterways but that is probably a pipedream; it would be extremely difficult to achieve.  This Bill is a serious effort to address the problem and should leave the public under no illusion about the determination of the Department and the local authorities not to pussy-foot with this matter any longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a complacency among certain sectors of industry in relation to pollution which stems primarily from the fact that the levels of pollution are relatively low and from the idea that if we pollute one lake there are about 20 more in the area so it really does not matter.  That is totally unacceptable.  We only have to listen to the comments of some of our European neighbours who when they visit on holidays or on business continue to tell us how lucky we are to have this extremely <Col N="41" /> high quality of water in our rivers and lakes and off our coast, to realise it is important that we continue to address that problem because there is a gradual erosion of standards.  We only have to look back to the summer of 1987 to see the kind of crisis a dry summer created in the agricultual sector.</P>
    <P>We are conferring huge responsibilities on local authorities in this Bill.  They will now be able to advise farmers on the methods of farming they may employ in the future.  That is a very onerous task to put on the shoulders of any local authority but, as a member of a local authority, I have no doubt it will be discharged responsibily.  This Bill increases in a very substantial way the powers of local authorities in this area.  Up to now we had relatively weak legislation in relation to the powers of local authorities to go onto lands, to take samples and so on.  Our officers met with indifference.  From time to time they were refused admission and refused permission to take samples and farmers refused to identify certain parts of their property and so on.  Under this legislation county councils will take this very seriously in future.</P>
    <P>It is important that we be quite clear about the huge responsibility we are now transferring over to local authorities. They may now make by-laws regulating or prohibiting specific agricultural activities in their functional areas or any part thereof which they consider necessary in order to eliminate or prevent water pollution. This, in effect, means that we can actually stop the whole production of a farm.  That is a very serious business because we are aware of the rights of private property under the Constitution. There are other areas of activity in the State where we cannot go next or near private property but this quite clearly defines certain tasks that local authorities may now discharge in this area.  It is a measure of the serious approach of this Minister to this problem and it is most definitely to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Members have already touched at great length on the size of the fines.  That is particularly important.  There is now a £25,000 maximum fine, an increase from <Col N="42" /> £5,000 in 1977 and that is not so long ago. It is a huge step even allowing for inflation but it is an indication of the approach we take to it.  It also addresses in a serious way the old chestnut we have had in the courts in the past couple of years, the &ldquo;good defence&rdquo;.  We all know of the rape of rivers and lakes where outstanding fisheries have been wiped out overnight, and we saw people shovelling dead fish onto river banks and so on throughout the summer of 1987.  That was a national disgrace and everybody was concerned about it.  The maximum fine of £25,000 leaves the Judiciary under no illusions as to how the Government feel about this or as to the category of a fine to be imposed in the future.</P>
    <P>I believe the Government have got the balance right in this case.  We should be aware of the import of this section in relation to the replacement of fish stocks, the restoration of spawning grounds, the removal of pollution from water and the treatment of affected waters, in making alternative arrangements or contributing towards the cost of such arrangements to replace a domestic water supply, commercial fishing, etc.  That is almost impossible to measure.  How can one reasonably expect a member of the public to replace a spawning ground?  Quite often one is talking about decades rather than weeks, months or years.  Again, this is an indication of the Minister's total commitment to convince the public.  All that will be required is one or two convictions. There was a case in Limerick 18 months ago where a farmer was prosecuted under the old Act and they are still trying to measure the costs to that person.</P>
    <P>The public, and particularly people in the agricultural sector, will have to be made aware of the impact of their actions on the quality of life of others.  They cannot go on indefinitely affecting this quality adversely.  We have had public commitments &mdash; and I have no doubt they are absolutely sincere &mdash; from the leaders of the farm organisations and so on, but that does not eliminate the cowboy.  He is just as indifferent to the quality of water in his area as he is to <Col N="43" /> the problems of bovine TB and other problems which the Government seek to address also.  There are always one or two cowboys and they will have to be made examples of if the necessity arises.  In strengthening the legislation the Minister is to be congratulated because it leaves nobody under any illusion about the fact that we mean business on this occasion.</P>
    <P>Farmers are not the only people who are polluting our waters; there was a great need for the Government to make a clear statement in relation to the general approach to water pollution, particularly in the case of manufacturing industry.  It was easy for pressure groups such as the Flat Earth Society and various groups that advocate environmental protection to say at public inquiries that, according to statistics the Government do not care and that there is no adequate legislation. I have heard that said on numerous occasions at public inquiries in my own county council.  The Government have eliminated this difficulty in one fell swoop in relation to both water and air pollution and that is most welcome.  In Cork in recent weeks we saw the spectre of a public inquiry in relation to the Merrill Dow development and there were many comments made on that occasion about the lack of legislation, the lack of power of local authorities, the lack of ability to monitor, the lack of power to go on to private land, and so on.  It is all clearly enshrined in this Bill as far as one can reasonably expect the Department to go and it is long overdue.</P>
    <P>The only note of caution I would sound is that it is important, if this legislation is to be effective, that the Minister would look at the embargo on recruitment of personnel training in the monitoring of water quality and so on.  As I said when we were debating the Litter Bill, there is little point in legislation if the various local autorities and county managers have not got the personnel because of the embargo.  It may only require the relocation of existing personnel, but it is important for the Minister to seek indications from the various local authorities <Col N="44" /> as to the plans they propose to put forward in relation to the implementation of legislation.  This point in regard to personnel came up time and time again at the public inquiry in Cork, as did the question of the lack of equipment and people trained in the monitoring of water quality, and so on.  This is a weapon which should be taken away from those who knock any steps taken.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately we have the spectre of the objector raising its ugly head with monotonous regularity.  Every time any industry is suggested now, certainly in our region, there is a plethora of objectors, all experts who can product statistics as long as one's arm to convince the whole world that the county council are so incompetent they should not be given charge of anything.  It amazes me that county councillors succeed in getting elected whereas the people who comment on their inadequacy never get elected to anything and never put themselves up for election.  Having said that, it is important that the Minister should be conscious of the reponsibility he has to local authorities, having given them the weapons to take on the polluters. They must have the personnel so they can nail this lie that county councils and their staff are not competent enough to implement these regulations.  I have absolute confidence in the ability of local authority employees to implement all these regulations provided they get the equipment and the personnel and I will be asking the Minister to be conscious of that when this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>Water quality management needs to be addressed.  In this Bill we are putting the weapons at the disposal of the local authorities to take on polluters, but it is equally important that we establish bench-marks in relation to the general quality of the water in all our rivers, lakes and coastal areas because it is important, when applications for development take place, that we are able to measure, say five years on, the impact of various sewerage outfall pipes and industrial outfall pipes on the environment generally and particularly on water quality.  In Bantry <Col N="45" /> a very elaborate water quality management scheme has just been completed at a cost of £200,000 to the county council but it has put in position a bench-mark for the next 50 years.  All development in the inner and outer harbour of that bay in future can be measured against that quality survey.  It is important, particularly in areas where we envisage any sizeable industrial developments, for example the Shannon Estuary, to have those measurements in place.  Senator Ryan touched on some of them.  Over the past 15 or 20 years the Department have indicated their desire, anxiety and intention to carry out water quality management surveys in various locations but quite often they have not been carried out.  In Cork Harbour it has been done and it is a considerable tool at the disposal of the local authority when these debates take place at public inquiries and so on.</P>
    <P>Over the past couple of years the Minister and the Department have addressed seriously the whole area of sewerage treatment.  In his address to this House, the Minister outlined a large number of towns that have already been provided with sewage treatment plants.  That was excellent and we lauded him for it because obviously it is very necessary but I was somewhat upset by the fact that no coastal town was included.  I hope the idea is not alive still in the Department of the Environment that because one puts a sewerage pipe out into the tide the pollution makes less of an impact.  That is not true.  People bathe on beaches, fish off the foreshore, take shellfish and so on.  It is important that the Department, in developing a programme of sewage treatment plants all over the State, are conscious of the environmental impact of municipal sewers on coastal towns.</P>
    <P>This takes me on to another point which I would like to develop.  In many of our coastal towns there are hospitals where the sewerage goes, totally untreated into the town sewer and, in turn, into the tide.  We are very conscious of the necessity to control infectious diseases. It could happen that there is an outbreak of hepatitis in the hospital, a highly contagious disease, and yet the <Col N="46" /> sewage from that hospital goes into the town sewer and, in turn, down to the tide where people are swimming, fishing and taking shellfish.  This area has been seriously neglected over the years and it is something which I would like the Minister to look at separately from this Bill altogether.  It needs to be surveyed to discover the extent of the impact of sewer outfalls from hospitals on the general environmental qualities in these coastal towns and in inland towns as well. In the bigger towns there are treatment plants and the impact of sewage outfalls is minimised if not eliminated, but in coastal towns there is the old phenomenon of the public sewer, maybe sometimes even a French drain system going down into the inlet and out into the bay. I have no doubt that there is a serious problem here that should be addressed.</P>
    <P>It is particularly relevant to the development of mari-culture and aquaculture because that takes place, in the main, in inlets and in enclosed areas of harbours, my own town being a classic example where there is a sizeable development of mussel farming now to the tune of £1.5 million or £2 million per year.  There are a number of problems of nature to contend with, such as Red Tide or toxins in the water created by natural phenomena.  If there are any adverse impact on the quality of the water in those inlets over which we have control we should be addressing them.  Certainly that is an area the Department of the Environment need to look at.  I put it to our own council a few years ago that when the Department are contemplating giving an appropriation to a county council for a big sewage plant in one of the bigger towns, that they wait another year, two years, or even five years, before giving them a treatment plant rather than giving them an <i>ad hoc</i> scheme that does not treat but only has maceration plants for the partial breaking down of solids. That is not treatment.</P>
    <P>We have to get away from the myth that because the sewer pipe is going out into the Atlantic Ocean or into the Irish Sea that in some way reduces its effect. Of course it does not.  It is something <Col N="47" /> the Department have to take on board because we are now having European water standards imposed on us.  A number of beaches have now been deemed to meet the European requirement, which is a pretty onerous requirement. On some of our bigger beaches members of the public congregate to swim with their families and so on.  The standard will be raised rather than reduced and this is something the Department would not want to be blasé about. My colleague from Leitrim was correct in saying, it is not entirely fair for us to expect John Citizen in the shape of the farmer, the industrialist or anybody else to put his house in order when the county councils are not doing it.</P>
    <P>By and large, it is an exceptionally fine piece of legislation.  It is not enough for the agricultural sector anymore to say they do not know or that they have a good defence or that when the farmer washed his slurry tank in the river he did not realise the effluent was going to go down the river for a couple of miles.  That kind of blasé attitude just will not work any more and that will be made abundantly clear under this legislation.  On the western seaboard in particular where the smaller tributaries run into the lakes there is an inadequacy of funds available to farmers to put these tanks in order especially in the disadvantaged areas where most of the problems are taking place.</P>
    <P>The first thing the farmer who is serious about production will do is to put his storage area in order.  It is not a good defence anymore, and it is not enough either for the farm organisations, to say they were advised five years ago that a tank was big enough, that they got a grant to provide X number of thousand gallons and that now they need more.  If I want to increase the size of my hotel tomorrow morning, I have to do it.  Bord Fáilte are not going to do it for me or anybody else, so I do not see why farmers should expect it done.  If they are increasing the capacity of their output, if they are increasing the size of their herds, if they are increasing the size of their milk quotas and so on, <Col N="48" /> that is a conscious decision to expand the farm and they must make all the relevant decisions along the line in relation to the containment of slurry and farmyard effluent.  That decision is taken in concert with the increasing size of the herd and so on.  It is not enough to say that they did not know.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like again to congratulate the Minister for the Environment and the Minister of State on this excellent legislation.  It copperfastens the Government's commitment to rooting out this serious problem of pollution.  It also strengthens the local authorities and the IDA, indicating that we are serious about industrial pollution as well in that we have legislation in position that will protect our environment.  The main attraction to industrialists in coming here in the first place is the quality of the environment.  Let us have no doubt about that.  I have had occasion to meet industrialists quite often and the one common denominator in the attractiveness of this country to them is the quality of life, the quality of the environment and the fact that we still have clean watercourses, clean lakes and suitable beaches for their children to swim in.  That is what this Bill seeks to protect.  It allows us to continue to say to our European partners, and indeed to the whole world, that this is a relatively pollution-free environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>In general I would welcome the Bill.  One of the important features is the increase in fines.  I remember an instance in my own area where animal blood was poured into a feeder river into the east Waterford water scheme and but for the vigilance of a member of staff who happened to have a day off at that time it could very well have happened without the knowledge of the people running the water treatment plant.  The type of virus contained in animal blood would not have been eliminated by the treatment which the water would undergo and there could have been a major problem for a water supply that was supplying Waterford city and the eastern part of the county.  What transpired following the court case showed the great weakness in the law up <Col N="49" /> to now in that only a £100 fine was imposed by the court in this case.  In general increasing the fines, and, more important, providing that the fines be paid to the local authorities, is very welcome.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Callaghan touched on the question of the number of staff necessary to implement the various responsibilities that are put on local authorities regarding water sources.  There is one feeder river to the east Waterford scheme, the Clodagh River, and Waterford County Council identified 80 possible pollution sources along the catchment of that river. In order to properly monitor the pollution sources our staff would be lucky to get three of them properly done in a day. Divide three into 80, and that is just one feeder river in the county.  As Senator O'Callaghan has suggested, I would ask the Minister to look at the question of raising the embargo in the public service so that sufficient staff would be provided in order to properly police possible pollution sources.</P>
      <P>Last Monday at a meeting of Waterford County Council I sought reports regarding the nitrate levels in the drinking water in the county and I was pleased that our water sources are well within the standards required.  It has come to my notice that four million people in Britain are drinking water which is outside the EC standards and there is a strong school of thought building up at the moment that nitrates contained in drinking water can contribute to cancer.  I was pleased that in the county I represent we have no problem, but we will have to be vigilant in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which concerns me, and which I raised previously at a county council meeting, is the aluminium content in drinking water.  Again, the aluminium content in the drinking water in County Waterford was well within the limits.  We are all aware of the present school of thought that aluminium in drinking water is one of the causes of Alzheimer's Disease, which causes premature senility.  One of the interesting points that came from the staff of the <Col N="50" /> water treatment laboratory in Adamstown in County Waterford was that while the water was fine, if you boiled water in an aluminium container, the aluminium content of the water increased fifty-fold. I wonder if we have a general problem there.  It is one the Minister might look at under another head.</P>
    <P>On the general question of bathing places &mdash; very relevant to the county I come from &mdash; they are a very important part of the tourism industry there.  Last Monday at a meeting of Waterford County Council I put a question asking whether our methods of discharging sewage could be giving rise to the algae present off the Waterford coast, indeed off the whole south coast, during the summer of last year.  This particular algae has an unpleasant smell if it is left on beaches but it is not a health hazard and it does not cause fish kills.  The &ldquo;Red Tide&rdquo;, which has been prevalent in the North Sea, has given rise to substantial fish kills in the North Sea.  I ask the Minister, as part of his approach on this Bill, to examine the causes of the algae which showed up off the south coast last year. It obviously has something to do with nutrients being discharged into the water. I had it examined in County Waterford. The evidence there is that County Waterford did not contribute to it, but something is contributing to it.  It is possible that something is coming down from the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another matter, which is not within the remit of the Bill but is still a very important and frightening area, and that is nuclear pollution. Pollution from Sellafield has been traced to the North Sea, up through the Irish Sea and across through the Pentland Firth. The type of nuclear pollution there is caesium.  The great problem with this is that it has a 300 year lifespan, that it still can be contaminating after 300 years.  If that is able to go up through the Irish Sea, around Scotland and into the North Sea, I would be very concerned about the Irish Sea and what may be happening to our beaches.  Is this type of nuclear pollution coming in on our shores?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="51" /> I know that the broad question of Sellafield has been pursued by this Government and by the previous Government. I am not happy with what is happening. As well as caesium there is also plutonium 237, which is a highly toxic pollutant. This is present in quite an amount of marine life.  Pollution of our waters does not rest solely with local authorities and with the measures contained in this Bill. In the UK in 1977 they had only 27 beaches inside the limits laid down and in 1985 half their beaches were not within the required limit.  Thankfully, that is not the position in this country, but we must be vigilant.</P>
    <P>At the meeting of Waterford County Council last Monday I asked that at our next meeting we should start the forward planning for sewage discharge from the two main sewage discharge areas in the county, Tramore and Dungarvan.  There is not a problem now, but as the population increases those problems will be there.  All our local authorities in the maritime areas, where we are discharging directly into the sea, should be encouraged to start their forward planning now and a programme should be put together by the Government, whether through EC moneys or Exchequer funds, so that we will remain well on top of the situation, because it is one of our major attractions as a tourist nation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but I believe there is no room for complacency.  Forward planning from the Minister's Department, particularly in the area of sewage discharge, is very important in order that we stay on top of the situation.  Capital moneys are necessary.  In order that this Bill can be fully and properly implemented by local authorities, I would ask the Minister to provide the staff to properly monitor the situation so that this instrument which is now available to local authorities can be used to the maximum effect.</P>

      <P>I want to thank all the Members of the House for their great contributions to this Bill and for the welcome they have given it.</P>
      <P>This Bill was brought in because of pollution in the River Barrow that flows through my county which created a lot of problems almost two years ago but which now, thankfully, have been overcome. At that time I arranged immediately with my Department that a circular be issued explaining in detail the powers of the local authorities.  Some local authorities were rather reluctant to implement those powers and they took the easy option, possibly because they did not want to offend some people.  I want to say that, as far as the Government and the Minister are concerned, we want to make it quite clear that we want the law that is now on the Statute Book implemented, but this new Bill gives very far-reaching rights to local authorities.</P>
      <P>Some Senators asked if we had the personnel in the local authorities to look after the regulations and see that they were being implemented.  I must point out that the same amount of work in construction is not taking place now as was the case some years ago.  It is up to local authorities to plan the use of their employees to the best of their ability.  It has not been brought to my notice that any local authority has not got the personnel to deal with this.</P>
      <P>We can bring in all the laws possible, but to be sucessful we must get the cooperation of everybody concerned, such as the farming community, industry and the public in general.  We must have their support.  I am glad that many local authorities, many of our schools and of our environmental organisations have done excellent work in explaining in leaflets through schools, local authorities, health boards and the other organisations involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill when it becomes law will give <Col N="53" /> far-reaching powers to the local authorities in this field.  There is more awareness now of this very important matter. The importance of putting their own house in order is now coming home to everybody.  It is not good enough for any group to come along with haphazard planning.  Even without this Bill the local authorities, under the Planning Acts, had wide-ranging powers in this regard, but there had been a &ldquo;softly, softly&rdquo; approach by some authorities.</P>
    <P>Many speakers referred to improvements that should be brought about to our sewage treatment plants.  Since 1980 some £300 million has been spent on sewage treatment plants in this country and successive Governments had to find that money.  Where did they find it?  You all know, and I do not want to lecture Senators on it.  This year £63 million will be spent.  We are approving the schemes that are most needed.  Both the Minister and I would like to have more finance to get more schemes going, but there is a limit to the purse and you cannot have it both ways.  You cannot ask me or anyone else for financial rectitude and then ask for more money for other schemes.  To be fair, there is a realisation that there is a limit to the purse and an understanding of the problem and I thank you for that and I appreciate many of the important points that have been raised.  In the Dublin and Kildare areas major improvements have been brought about to the sewerage schemes in the past two years, and this is to be welcomed.  Admittedly, local authorities can be prosecuted under the Act.</P>
    <P>Local authority prosecutions against polluters in 1987 numbered 156.  Notices issued under section 12 requiring measures to be taken to prevent pollution came to a total of 825.  The number of advice warning letters was 3,917.  Investigations in respect of waters and discharges to sewers were carried out in no less than 7,000 cases.  Local authorities, where it has been brought to their notice, have sent their officials around to see those who have to do what I would call a tidying up of their operations and have told them to get their houses in order. <Col N="54" /> There is no excuse for any individual or company not to comply with that.  I will not tolerate it.  If you have not got your house in order, you will see here that notices have been served.  Some have ignored them in the past, but we will not tolerate that now and the full rigour of the law will apply.  I think all of you here will agree with me that, where it is brought to the attention of the authority concerned that action should be taken the local authority moves and tells the persons concerned to get their house in order.  That is reasonable to ask.</P>
    <P>Many Senators strayed from the text of the Bill, but I did not mind that as I am a bit of a wanderer myself at times, and it is a wide-ranging Bill.  I know that everybody in this House is concerned when it comes to pollution.</P>
    <P>The fishery boards have been very active also in this and have pointed out the various problems in regard to it. Immediately after a spillage took place on the Barrow the Government set up a ministerial task force to examine the situation and this Bill is the result of that action.  We consulted with a great number of organisations, individuals and local authorities.  The officials of my Department met many associations on it.  The main objective was to bring in a Bill that would stand up legally and constitutionally.</P>
    <P>We can debate this Bill in more detail on Committee Stage.  If there are suitable amendments to be made to it, I will certainly go along with them if they improve the Bill.  Indeed, I would be grateful for any suitable amendments to improve it. I know that all of us would like to see a good Bill put on the Statute Book which would stand up and operate effectively. When we get down to the sections of the Bill, which will deal with the nitty-gritty of this legislation in detail, we will then see what improvements we can make.</P>
    <P>My officials and myself have taken notes of all the very important points that were made by Senators.  We will then proceed to have them examined and see what improvements can be made.  I do not think there was ever a Bill in either House that was not open to amendment <Col N="55" /> and improvement on Committee Stage, even improvement by the Minister of the day and the same will apply now.  Again, my sincere thanks to the Cathaoirleach and to all the Members of this House for their very favourable contributions on the Bill and, above all, the welcome which you gave it.</P>

    <Title>Urban Renewal Designation Programme: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann congratulates the Minister for the Environment on the Urban Renewal Designation Programme and considers that he should extend it to other suitable towns.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator Fitzsimons.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to say how amazed I am by the wording of this motion.  It is rather flattering or sycophantic in style and it certainly is extremely crass because the introduction of the Urban Renewal Designation Programme of course occurred during the last Administration.  While the Minister may wish to be congratulated upon it, I expect he will admit to the fact, in replying to the debate, that it was an initiative of the previous Administration and not anything for which the Minister can accept total and complete credit.  It is important to put that on the record.  I was also interested to see that the first spokesman for Fianna Fáil, Senator Fitzsimons, had the good grace to put that fact on the record also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say that coming from Waterford and being a member of Waterford City Council we have nothing but <Col N="56" /> praise for the inner city designation and the urban renewal programme because we are one of the areas which is designated and is benefiting and stands to benefit from this programme.  It was introduced in the 1986 Finance Act by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Alan Dukes.  It followed through with the Urban Renewal Act, 1986, which was introduced into this House and indeed the Dáil by the then Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Fergus O'Brien.  It was designed to give financial incentives in designated areas in the five borough counties. Initially Waterford, and indeed Galway, found themselves left out in the announcement of the programme.  Since we in Waterford were involved in compulsory purchase orders and in the assembling of sites in the inner city area in the hope that we would be mentioned, it was with some dismay we found we were not included in the first announcement. Of course we made very vigorous representations, and having Cabinet representation I expect did not go amiss. Very soon afterwards Waterford was included in the inner city designation and we have been doing great things down there since that happened.</P>
    <P>The financial incentives I speak about were, of course, tax allowances and remission of rates both of which are extremely attractive to developers and, hopefully, will act as a spur to renewal of inner city core areas many of which have been subject to blight and dereliction in so many centres in our community.  The 1987 Finance Act extended the designation and special incentives to Athlone, Castlebar, Dundalk, Kilkenny, Letterkenny, Sligo, Tralee, Tullamore and Wexford.  I am sure all of these areas will actively seek developers and will ensure that for the period of the designation as much development and renewal as possible takes place.</P>
    <P>It is important to state that while Government have come up with the imaginative idea and placed the package before the people it is largely up to the local authorities to get out there and market this is a viable and attractive <Col N="57" /> proposition.  Certainly in Waterford we were not behind the door when it came to shining our light and attracting developers to come in and look at our city centre and become part of our development plans and our urban renewal.</P>
    <P>The policy in Waterford could be described as aggressive, interventionist and active.  We in the city council acquired by compulsory purchase orders two major critical decayed blocks in the very commercial centre of Waterford. We are attempting to give that city a heart transplant.  We are confident we will be able to achieve this.  We ran into certain difficulties.  Because these sites were in the centre of the city and in the core area, it was more or less anticipated that we would run into archaeological remains.  This did happen.  I know that my colleague, Senator Eogan, spoke about this the last day.  He has been involved in some way.  We received very little other than lip service by way of practical help in the work on the archaeology but the developer was so keen to get involved and to develop the sites quickly that he made a major contribution towards that work.  That is something of a headline and I hope it sets a trend.</P>
    <P>Many developers, probably rightfully, have earned a certain disdain among the general public because they have been seen as not particularly philanthropic, sensitive or aware and more interested in the capitalist or commercial aspects of developing.  The developers involved in the development in Waterford were certainly civilised and generous to an extraordinary degree and I would like to place on the record acknowledgement of that generosity and positive quality.</P>
    <P>Also in Waterford we have secured the advice of one of Ireland's premier consultants in the area of inner city renewal and design: I refer to Patrick Shaffrey.  He has come to us and indeed has spoken to the council on many occasions and has drawn up a blueprint for what is acceptable design and shopfront and lay-out in the city centre. Anybody who has not been to Waterford for some time and who comes now to see <Col N="58" /> it is very taken with and struck by the obvious improvements which have taken place.  It is visually attractive and these improvements are quite visible.  The threshold of what is acceptable has been raised.  Quite spontaneously, shop owners and people who are interested in renovating their properties have come forward with quality wooden shopfronts and with distinctive advertising signs. One hopes it is the end to neon, glitz and glitter which was considered acceptable perhaps in the fifties or early sixties when we did not have a particularly tasteful approach to these things.  Now certainly there is a marked aesthetic improvement. Not everything, of course, has been accomplished but there is certainly a marked raising of consciousness of what should be done and of what is acceptable and desirable.</P>
    <P>We in Waterford have also engaged ourselves in a pedestrianisation project. It has changed the whole ambience of the city.  In particular, I refer to an area known popularly and fondly as Red Square because it has been paved, I hasten to add in red blocks.  There people tend to gather, street musicians play there, there is some vending of flowers and there is carol singing.  The whole atmosphere of the city centre has become enlivened and is attractive.  It has been referred to as having something of the flavour or air of an Italian piazza.  It is part of the inner city urban renewal and is very attractive indeed.  It is interesting to see in that immediate area window boxes appearing and a general air of a promising future about the place.</P>
    <P>To return to the CPO sites, they are in the heart of Waterford and they contain one acre in site one and one and a half acres in site two.  Site one is in the Lady Lane/Peter Street area and site two in the Peter Street/Olaf Street area.  The problems arose in getting these sites together of people who had title.  They needed to be persuaded to part.  There were also difficulties with old age pensioners and people who had an entrenched, deeply held and a strongly rooted commitment to the area.  They needed certain persuasion and rehousing.  All in all it took <Col N="59" /> time, patience, effort and energy to assemble these two sites.</P>
    <P>I would again make reference to the archaeology.  These sites which were compulsorily purchased were in the inner city.  They, of course, were built over the old historic Danish town and, in fact, when excavation work began in order to prepare the sites for building the remains of an old historic church, St. Peter's Church, were found buried under the site.  Again a tribute is due to the sensitivity of the developers in question.  This site and this ruin of St. Peter's Church is going to be incorporated into the design and plan for the new shopping centre and is going to be visible within the centre to all who come.  It will be glassed over and the shopping centre itself will be above the site of the church.  It should be an extremely attractive focal point and feature of what will be a smart modern shopping centre.  It will give recognition to Waterford's ancient past and will become part of the tourist trail in the inner city.</P>
    <P>Obviously if you come across a major archaeological find, as we did in Waterford, you run into problems <i>vis-à-vis</i> the time constraint imposed by the designation and programme.  We were very gratified indeed to find that tight deadline extended.  That was a practical recognition of the difficutlies (a) in selling the idea and getting it across to people and attracting developers, and (b) for people like us in Waterford who had come up against the archaeology and want to do the decent thing &mdash; buy it and explore it and have it held for post-excavation work.  Certainly the extension of the time deadline was of major assistance.</P>
    <P>Tenders were invited for the development of the site.  We had very clear objectives, very clear design criteria and major thought went into traffic circulation, services and access routes.  What we wanted, and we were very clear indeed about this, was the best possible redevelopment for the city.  It had to take place within the shortest timespan possible and it needed to bring about the greatest financial return to Waterford City Council.  We are having very little residential content <Col N="60" /> in the scheme but what we want is a large scale comprehensive retail shopping scheme with a high standard of architectural design.</P>
    <P>There is one thing I would like to mention and I would be interested if the Minister would comment on it in his reply. When you do something good, useful and worthwhile it very often has a knock-on effect and bothers other people.  It is not always all good news.  Those people who are outside the designated areas, of course, are suddenly finding themselves in a less competitive situation than those who will be trading in the designated area.  This kind of unhappiness has surfaced in many areas, not least in Waterford. The people outside the designated area are paying rates and taxes and they are, in effect, subsidising their competitors trading in favoured so-called compounds or designated areas.</P>
    <P>There is the possibility and I have heard it mentioned, of a constitutional challenge which might be mounted against the Minister by people who find themselves suddenly disfavoured and who would claim that perhaps this decision has in some way interfered with free market forces and with the marketplace in a direct way.  I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say by way of comment on that because it certainly seems to me that they have a certain legitimate grievance and their trading is suddenly less favoured than those in the designated area.  I am particularly thinking of some people who in a very innovative fashion in Waterford developed a major shopping complex at great personal expense and without all the incentives.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, my party obviously are happy about the motion even though we feel that perhaps it congratulates the wrong Minister for the Environment. However, we are pleased to see that this policy has been followed through and we hope that more and more towns will become involved and rid themselves of derelection, blight and decay and become vital living centres again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Bulbulia may be <Col N="61" /> pleased to know that I, too, share the initial comments of my distinguished colleague Senator Fitzsimons when he talked about congratulating the Minister only for the fact that in looking through the report in relation to this motion, I found a rather interesting comment from our then Environment spokesman in the Dáil when the then Minister of State at the Department of the Environment introduced the Urban Renewal Bill. Deputy Burke said that he was surprised to see the Bill coming before the House at that time having waited four years for it to be introduced.  Deputy Burke went on to say that it was the then Fianna Fáil Government as far back as 1978 who established a special interdepartmental committee on the development of a new approach to urban renewal.  He said it was also Fianna Fáil who advanced the first comprehensive plan for urban development when we published our Urban Development Areas Bill of 1982 and the Dublin Inner City Development Authority Bill of 1982.  He said that the Bill introduced by Minister of State that day was clearly inspired by those Fianna Fáil efforts but that, as with the Government's plans for house renovation, there were glaring, unacceptable and indefensible ommissions.</P>
      <P>To put the matter in context I feel that the wording in congratulating the Minister is correct in the circumstances and I would be the first to congratulate the former Minister in the Coalition. Indeed, I would have been happy to do so because of the fact that this legislation is so relevant and has been further strengthened by this Administration.  I would have been even more happy to have congratulated the Opposition because they introduced so much legislation that met with widespread approval during their term in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main interest in this motion is, in a sense, to be somewhat parochial. Having listened to Senator Bulbulia and having looked at other contributions to this debate last week I know that Senators have tended to centre quite correctly on the areas in which they have the most expertise, in the areas in which they live <Col N="62" /> and the areas which they represent.  We in County Leitrim are excluded from such deliberations because there is no town in my county designated under this Bill.  The nearest to us is in Sligo and coming from the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim I welcome the designation of Sligo town under the Urban Renewal Bill.  Anyone who visited Sligo in the past year or two will have noticed it has meant improvements in the aesthetic look of the town and long may it continue.  Sligo is designated as an economic growth centre and can only benefit my own county of Leitrim, particularly the northern end.</P>
    <P>The success rate of the Urban Renewal Bill in its component parts is evident from the contributions from all sides of the House last week and by Senator Bulbulia in speaking about the historic city of Waterford.  The legislation has had approval from all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>I should like to propose to the Minister that he consider the town of Carrick-on-Shannon being included as part of the urban renewal scheme.  The motion calls for consideration to be given to extending the urban renewal designation programmes to other suitable towns.  I intend, briefly, to attempt to justify why I believe the county town of Leitrim &mdash; the smallest county town, the smallest administrative unit in the country &mdash; should be considered for this extension.</P>
    <P>Leitrim, like many of the Border counties, has suffered intolerably since the foundation of the State, primarily as a result of Partition.  The hinterland of Leitrim &mdash; Fermanagh, Cavan, Monaghan and Armagh, and parts of Tyrone &mdash; being cut off geographically, militarily, politically and economically has meant a serious economic decline in many of the towns, in Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan.  To a lesser extent Donegal and Louth have been affected although I am sure my colleagues from those areas might differ with me on that point.  It is evident in Leitrim as a whole that the economic decline which set in from Partition &mdash; resulting in a population at that time of 127,000 people being reduced, according to the most recent census, to 27,000 &mdash; has had a major effect on the <Col N="63" /> life and spirit of the people who live there.</P>
    <P>I am not asking that Carrick-on-Shannon be included simply because it is the correct or proper thing to say; I am asking that it be included because of right.  It is a town of less than 2,000 people but it is the administrative centre of the county and if we are ever to have a chance of breaking the cycle of economic decline in our county then measures such as those contained in the Urban Renewal Designation Programme will go some way towards redressing the balance without any great extra cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In recent years the impact of the International Fund for Ireland was seen as perhaps being an answer to some of the economic ills of the Border counties. Sadly, that has not been the case.  Indeed, I would go further and condemn unreservedly the attitude that was adopted by the Department of the Environment in the northern part of this country, in the manner in which they expended the funds given to their care under the International Fund for Ireland.  One of its categories is urban enhancement.  This means that towns throughout the Six Counties and the Border counties would be eligible for funding to enhance the urban environment, to protect the listed and historic buildings and to generally improve the aesthetic look of the centre of our towns.</P>
    <P>Because of the mandate given to the International Fund for Ireland three-quarters of its funding had, by statute, to be dispensed in the Six Counties, with the remaining quarter coming to the South. Even a cursory glance at the report of the International Fund for Ireland, in the context of urban enhancement, will show that there is no comparison between the amounts of money given to some towns in the Six Counties, and the amounts of money given to towns of equivalent size in the South.</P>
    <P>To be more specific, I would be the first to accept that towns such as Strabane and Tyrone have suffered horribly as a result of the cycle of violence in the Six Counties over the past 20 years and deserve and should receive as much <Col N="64" /> money for urban enhancement as is possible. However, I find it very difficult to accept that the town of Enniskillen which, within the region I am talking about, has not only maintained a successful trading pattern since the foundation of this State but, despite the troubles, has managed to suck in people from across the Border &mdash; from Sligo, Donegal, Leitrim and Cavan &mdash; and in so doing has created an oasis of affluence in a region of economic despair, should be treated in the same way.  That is one of the reasons I am asking that Carrick-on-Shannon should be included in this programmes.  Under the International Fund for Ireland, in the urban enhancement category, only three towns in Leitrim were included; Carrick-on-Shannon was tagged on at the end, Manorhamilton and Ballinamore being the other two.  There has been little or no manifestation of the benefits that one expected would flow from this categorisation, in other words, we got no money.</P>
    <P>In order to encourage industrial development in a county like Leitrim it needs some extra incentives.  I shall put forward a hypothesis.  If the Minister or any of my colleagues here had an entreprenurial spirit and wished to set up business in the mid-north-west region I believe the last place they would wish to set up at the moment would be in County Leitrim, because the advantages that attach to other counties surrounding us would be far more attractive.  Sligo town is part of the urban renewal designation programme.  Longford has a very strong traditional and successful trading pattern, a town with a much larger population than Carrick-on-Shannon.  Cavan, to our east, is another strong and successful trading town.</P>
    <P>What chance is there for any of the towns in County Leitrim, where the county town being the largest has fewer than 2,000 people, to attract suitable industry or suitable investment?  If the Urban Renewal Designation Programme were to be Extended to Carrick-on-Shannon &mdash; I have no objections to it being extended to other towns in the county, <Col N="65" /> not least my own town of Drumshambo &mdash; immediately we would have the extra edge I believe is necessary for us to provide much needed employment.  It certainly would created an initial stimulus.  It would restore a spirit and dignity to our people that has been eroded over the past number of years and certainly over the past few generations as they have watched their sons and daughters take the emigrant ship.</P>
    <P>One statistic springs to mind.  County Leitrim has only 25 of the top companies in Ireland.  That figure on its own perhaps means little, but compare it with Dublin, where there are almost 7,000 top companies, and you begin to see the picture. Our people are leaving in vast numbers and there is a need to arrest that decline. This particular programme seems to be a tangible effort to arrest it.</P>
    <P>I was particularly interested to hear Senator Bulbulia &mdash; and other contributors to this debate &mdash; direct her attention to frontages and to the hope that more and more of our towns and Villages would take a look at the proliferation of neon plastic signs which have so blighted our environment over the past number of years.  I readily accept that many traders, in the difficult economic climate that we have been operating in over the past ten years, will go for what they see to be the cheapest and most impressive sign.  If you put a coloured sign and a bright light over you door, particularly in a rural environment it will be seen for miles around and, after all. the whole object of the exercise is to attract more customers.  However, I would appeal to those people and indeed to the people of my own county to give serious consideration to replacing their neon signs with more traditional shopfronts.</P>
    <P>Kilkenny is an example of what can be done.  It is correct that we should constantly remind people of what Kilkenny has done.  I know other towns and cities are following that trend but I hope the message could go out from here that in a way neon signs are counterproductive and that for us with our long history of <Col N="66" /> separateness and a heritage and cultural identify we are proud of, the restoration of older traditional shopfronts would fit in very well and would be a marvellous tourist boost.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for the Environment.  I believe that his commitment to urban renewal is unsurpassed. The commitment of the Fianna Fáil Party, both in and out of Government, has been shown to be one of activity in this area.  I will finish my contribution by once again asking that, in the spirit of the motion in extending this scheme to other suitable towns, the Minister will not forget lovely Leitrim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to be able to speak on the motion.  It has brought speakers to their feet to give vehement and emphatic testimony to the developments that have taken place in Kilkenny city and the surrounding areas of Kilkenny over the past 15 years or so. It shows the tremendous amount urban renewal can do to create a very lively and cosmopolitan atmosphere in a rural city like Kilkenny.  It can develop an atmosphere which is very conducive to foreign tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People in Kilkenny city and county have over the years become justifiably very proud of and pleased with the rehabilitation process that has taken place over the past 15 years or so.  In the late seventies with the coming to Kilkenny of our present county manager, Mr. Donnelly, he realised that Kilkenny had all the hallmarks of a city that could be beautiful; the traditional shopfronts could be a major feature of an important streetscape development and it had enormous potential to become a very vibrant place and a great attraction to foreign tourists in particular.  He adopted a plan. The names of architects like Shaffrey and Thompson have become synonymous, in conjunction with the engineering staff and officials of Kilkenny County Council and Kilkenny Corporation, with bringing about a tremendous revitalisation and rehabilitation of that area.  The leadership that was shown in Kilkenny in instituting a programme of urban renewal <Col N="67" /> at a time when there was very little concept of what those words meant is characteristic of the vision that was shown by the county manager and his staff.</P>
    <P>The modern-day uses that have now become part of the rehabilitation process in Kilkenny and the revitalisation of the old buildings is setting a headline for other cities and other large towns.  For example, there is Rathe House which houses the Kilkenny Museum, the Shee Almshouse which is a 14th century building which houses the Kilkenny Tourist Information Office.  In recent times the old stables of Kilkenny Castle were used by Kilkenny Design Workshops which was formerly a semi-State organisation and which is now held in public ownership under the auspices of Kilkenny Civic Trust.  The Butler family have been very closely associated with the history of Kilkenny.  Many of the historic buildings in Kilkenny city bear the name and insigna of the Butlers in connection with developments that happened in the 13th and 14th centuries when that family were in their heyday.</P>
    <P>An example of what can be done in preserving the old and making modern-day use of the buildings we have in order to enhance their beauty is epitomised by the successful transition of the Kilkenny Design Workshops building into the ownership of the Kilkenny Civic Trust.  I want to put on record my appreciation of the work that was carried out by the County and City Manager, Mr. Donnelly, together with a user group and the business people, in particular Avonmore Creameries, Smithwicks, Mahon and McPhilips and such industries that recognise the importance of keeping in public ownership facilities like the buildings I have referred to for the use of the general public and for the use of the business and commercial life of the city of Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>The local authorities, Kilkenny Corporation and Kilkenny County Council have subscribed generously to bringing that situation about but it would not have come to a successful conclusion, as far as the people were concerned, were it not for the generous contribution made by <Col N="68" /> the local business community to the financial package that was necessary to keep that particular building in the hands of the local people and to ensure that future generations would not look back on it and wonder what were the public representatives and authorities and the people generally in Kilkenny doing to allow such a building into private ownership and run the risk of it being put to a use that would not be in keeping with the aesthetic surroundings of Kilkenny city and county.</P>
    <P>To go further afield, Professor Eogan put his finger on it when he said during this debate that urban renewal is not about architecture and building; it is also about improving the quality of life for the people.  This is very evident in the context of Kilkenny and the pride that has developed in the local people.</P>
    <P>The various steps that Ministers for the Environment take in relation to litter may be difficult to implement if there is a drab and very difficult atmosphere and if people do not have pride in their city. No matter what initiative a Minister takes to bring about greater efforts in litter control and the elimination of derelict sites, his task is more difficult if there is not public pride in the area.  Generally, we can say that the enhancement of Kilkenny ensures the necessary pride and incentives to guarantee that the strides that have been made over the past ten or 15 years will not be diminished in the future.</P>
    <P>Often when I come to Dublin and see the developments that have taken place in our main thoroughfares in O'Connell Street in particular, with plastic signs and no planning whatsoever in relation to what commercial outlet is located in any particular unit in that street, I wonder what planning, if any, was undertaken in order to ensure that probably the most important and historical street in our country should not be allowed to develop in such a haphazard and ill-planned way. The former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Boland, in setting up the Metropolitan Streets Commission showed initiative in trying to ensure that O'Connell Street and the general city <Col N="69" /> centre of Dublin, our capital city, would be worthy of our heritage.  He showed his heart was in the right place in trying to undo the bad planning that had taken place over the years in that context and that the buildings would be renewed and rehabilitated to ensure that we could be justifiably proud of the centre of our capital city.</P>
    <P>In the context of urban renewal I also welcome the recent publication by the Minister of the Derelict Sites Bill.  All of us, not only in large cities but in every rural town and village, can identify the blight on our landscapes and streetscapes because of the amount of dereliction we see.  While there are difficulties on the capital budget side of our Exchequer finances at the moment, more incentives could be given and I suppose one could say more of the carrot-and-the-big-stick treatment could be applied to ensure that the urban renewal programmes in our rural towns and villages would gather momentum and bring about a rehabilitation of old buildings, get them out of decay and into modern-day use by the various landlords and owners of such property.  People want to live in their own locality and they would prefer, in my opinion, to live in rural towns and villages if they got some incentive to get those derelict sites into an acceptable and attractive shape.  It would do a lot for local pride and for the tidiness and general beauty of many of those towns and villages.</P>
    <P>In my opinion urban renewal incentives can give a distorted view and a distorted incentive to multiple outlets. There is always a fear that various mutiple grocery and supermarket outlets, if given incentives, will take up the main portion of an inner city and displace small family shops, small family grocers and similar trades.  People who have given a lifetime to developing the family business could now, through no fault of their own, but through unfair competition sparked by various urban renewal incentives, slip into decay and go out of business.</P>
    <P>In Kilkenny, an area was designated as part of an urban renewal programme.  I am not quite sure of the criteria by which <Col N="70" /> the Department laid down the boundaries as to what would and would not qualify in terms of the incentives given by the Department of the Environment but I found it very strange that certain properties were excluded and that properties on each side, would actually be part of the urban renewal programme. Despite my representations to the local authority, I think that it is regrettable that two buildings in particular of families that formed the heart of business life in Kilkenny city over the years were excluded from whatever incentives were to be given to their neighbours on each side of them.</P>
    <P>I know that the Crotty and de Loughrey properties have become subject of local debate over the past number of months since the announcement of this urban renewal boundary for the city of Kilkenny.  I appeal to the Minister to have these particular properties reinvestigated in the context of any extension he may be considering to the urban renewal scheme throughout the country.  It is hard to explain to local people why, if the properties bounding them on all sides are actually included in the scheme, their properties are omitted; it is very difficult to explain that.  Political reasons have been put forward.  You may be nodding in agreement with me, Minister, but there were political reasons for leaving the buildings out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I may have touched a nerve but part of the urban renewal incentives meant that there were boundaries to be created and boundaries to be decided in relation to who and would not qualify for those particular incentives.  If neighbouring properties are qualifying, I cannot understand for the life of me why properties which are dead straight in the middle of that area are not qualifying for that particular aid.  I know that the Minister will be glad to review that situation in the context of what the motion is saying here tonight and to include those properties so that we will not have any <Col N="71" /> explanations to make to the local people who find themselves ill-treated in that way.</P>
      <P>Finally, I certainly want to welcome the motion here this evening.  I think the previous Government showed remarkable foresight in bringing forward a scheme of urban renewal incentives and that the developments we see taking place throughout all our major towns and villages are an example of what can be done in selectivity promoting districts in order to create more life and more activity in our inner cities.</P>
      <P>I want to thank the Members for their kind words in relation to Kilkenny City. I know it has been treated as a showpiece and as an example of what can be achieved in a small area through imaginative planning and architectural sensitivity. I know that representatives from many parts of the country have come to see and visit Kilkenny and they are always welcome to see the type of work that is being carried out there.  Even though I suggest that the good that is being initiated will be continued, I would certainly support the extension of that particular scheme to other towns and villages in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief.  I just want to welcome this motion.  I think it is a very good motion, and the spirit of the discussion here and the contributions that have been made to it have testified to this.  It is practically unanimously agreed that this programme be extended to all other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose the motion would be pointless if it is not job-creating or if it is not making space for extra jobs in premises or giving extra services to the community in areas that were not attractive up to now for people to invest in.  I want to specifically mention Westmeath and the approach road coming from the airport into the capital city here in Dublin.  We all know the new look the airport has had over the past number of years and the massive improvements the Department of the Environment have presided over in relation to the approach roads to our <Col N="72" /> city.  When we drive in from the airport now it is as good as anything we can find in most other countries, better, as a matter of fact than anything in Europe. This great new approach to the city is absolutely fabulous until you hit parts of Dorset Street and it is there that I think this Urban Renewal Bill could play its part to the fullest.</P>
    <P>That Dorset Street belt then goes on and it takes up again at Capel Street which takes you right onto the quays.  We can see because of the Urban Renewal Bill &mdash; and the Department and the Minister are to be complimented on this &mdash; that the property on the quays that has been lying there for the past 20 years is now in such demand that the people who have been offered the various different sites have been offered a profit without even putting a foot on the site.  I happen to know two of the consortia involved. Now an area which was classified &mdash; as it was &mdash; in the film world as the best place in Europe to make pre-war films &mdash; suddenly, mainly because of this piece of legislation, has become one of the most attractive places for investment in the city centre.  That must be said in favour of the urban renewal plan we have here before us tonight.  All the signs are there of massive job creation in construction on the quays within the next three months.</P>
    <P>Having said that, if we come back up Dorset Street we meet a derelict road coming from Parnell Square which links Dorset Street, a road called Granby Row.  It is probably the most derelict road north of the Liffey and I reside there most of the week.  That road is not included and is a link road with all the great work that has been done in Parnell Square by the corporation in relation to beautiful pavements and signs.  We have all these lovely brown signs with white lettering telling you where the different places of tourist interest may be found.  It has been totally co-ordinated; it is a pleasure to walk around there and in the Garden of Remembrance.  But Granby Row should be included.  It is not included and I know two consortia that would create a minimum of 40 jobs if this incentive were applied there.  That option is open and <Col N="73" /> available at the present time.  I know they will not invest in that area if an incentive like this is not available because they can move somewhere else and place their investment elsewhere.  It is a tremendous opportunity which should not be lost because north of the Liffey is a difficult place at the best of times.  Tourists are taken into the city by coaches which park at Trinity College.  They are taken around all the beautiful areas such as the Westbury Centre and all the walk-around streets but north of the Liffey there are only two or three tourist attractions and that is the area I would like to mention.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to indicate our situation in north Westmeath.  It is extremely difficult to attract tourists or investment or industry to north Westmeath because it is bordering on counties which are classified as disadvantaged areas and there are additional grants for those areas.  It is for that reason that I would like to see Mullingar classified as a disadvantaged area.  Very few streets in Mullingar could be classified as derelict but there are one or two streets where investment and jobs could be created.  I welcome the motion and I look forward to an extension of the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>At home and abroad, the image of Ireland has been as a predominantly rural country.  This is no surprise, given the important economic and social position of agriculture in the development of the country down the years.  While agriculture and rural-based initiatives still bulk large in the country's life, there is no doubt that we are increasingly becoming an urban-based society.  The last two or three decades have seen a steady and substantial flow of people from rural to urban areas.  The reasons for this trend are many, the most notable being improved transport and communications, mechanisation of many rural based activities, general increase in industrialisation, centralisation of many activities and so on.  The results of this movement are evidenced by the fact that the greater Dublin area alone now <Col N="74" /> account for nearly one-third of the national population.</P>
      <P>This considerable movement of people towards our towns and cities coincided with, and indeed reinforced, a trend towards suburbanisation.  We are far more aware today both from our own experience and from that of other countries that policies which support urban growth through greenfield development and a sprawling process of suburbanisation can give rise to many social, economic and environmental problems. Large parts of what were formerly thriving central areas become run-down and derelict.  The malady of dereliction and decay is one which spreads and which can affect large portions of our towns and cities, rendering them unattractive for private sector development and often consigning particular locations to ghettoes and no-go areas.  The problem is one which must be tackled and tackled with vigour and imagination.  The Government are meeting the challenge and have, through their various programmes, grasped the nettle of urban decline.</P>
      <P>A special urban renewal programme was set in motion in 1986 by the Urban Renewal Act, 1986.  This Act introduced two very important initiatives; the establishment of the Custom House Docks Development Authority and the designated areas scheme of urban renewal. The Custom House Docks Development Authority (CHDDA) was established with powers of land acquisition, borrowing and planning control with a mandate to secure the redevelopment of a 27 acre site on the Custom House Docks. The area as defined in the Urban Renewal Act, 1986 originally consisted principally of Connolly Railway Station, the Central Sorting Office and the Custom House Docks site owned by Dublin Port and Docks Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made two orders under the Urban Renewal (Amendment) Act, 1987 extending the Custom House area.  The first order in July, 1987 extended the original area to the centre of the River Liffey thereby maximising the potential of the site's riverside location.  In May, 1988 I made a second order extending <Col N="75" /> the area in an easterly direction, so as to facilitate the development of the proposed National Sports Centre.</P>
    <P>Since its establishment in November, 1986, the Authority has made considerable strides towards securing an innovative and comprehensive redevelopment of the site.  The development will include the International Financial Services Centre, office, residential and retail accommodation, museums, hotel and conference centre.</P>
    <P>Starting with the acquisition of the site in March, 1987 the Authority proceeded to publish the planning scheme which formed the basis for the development. From the many interesting and competitive proposals put forward the Hard-wicke-McInerney &mdash; British Land Consortium was selected by the Authority to carry out the project involving an investment of some £250 million.</P>
    <P>Legal arrangements with the developer were completed in January last year.  The Taoiseach laid the foundation stone for the Financial Services Centre last September. Since then progress on the building of the west block has advanced at a very fast rate indeed.  Work on the foundations and basement of the south and north blocks of the centre has commenced. It is hoped to begin work on the residential element of the project before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The Custom House Docks site enjoys the benefits of the financial incentives under the urban renewal scheme together with a special favourable rate of corporation tax for international financial services.  The Government have energetically promoted the development both at home and abroad.  More important, we have succeeded in creating and stabilising an economic climate such as to make this development possible.</P>
    <P>The Custom House Docks project, when completed, will have enormous spin-off benefits and will serve to encourage and promote the further development of the whole north inner city area. While the Custom House Docks development will go some way towards the revitalisation of Dublin the Government are <Col N="76" /> keenly aware that other measures and initiatives are necessary if we are to erase the blight of decay and derelection in our towns and cities.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot, however, hope to solve the problem alone.  One of the most important measures therefore is to involve the private sector in the regeneration process.  This is being achieved through the designated areas scheme of urban renewal.  Under this scheme a wide and valuable range of incentives is being made available for the construction and refurbishment of property within specified areas.  Briefly these incentives are as follows:</P>
    <P>A tax allowance on expenditure of a capital nature on the construction or reconstruction of commercial buildings;</P>
    <P>A double rent allowance against income for traders and professionals leasing these buildings;</P>
    <P>A taxation allowance on expenditure on the building or improvement of a dwelling for owner-occupation and</P>
    <P>A remission of rates in respect of new or refurbished buildings.</P>
    <P>Under the Urban Renewal Act, 1986, and the Finance Act, 1986, these incentives were made available in specified areas in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway.  The local authorities involved were charged with publicising the scheme and with assisting in the promotion of development projects as well as carrying out environmental improvements in the designated areas.</P>
    <P>Having witnessed the success of the scheme in the original areas I made an order on 9 May 1988 extending it to a further nine towns.  These were: Athlone, Castlebar, Dundalk, Kilkenny, Letterkenny, Sligo, Tralee, Tullamore and Wexford.  I also made some small additions to the Dublin designated area to facilitate the development of a major commercial centre proposed for Bachelors Walk and also to the Limerick designated area.</P>
    <P>In last year's budget it was announced <Col N="77" /> that an area in and around the proposed Tallaght Town centre would be designated for the urban renewal incentives. Once agreement was reached between the developer and Dublin Corporation, I made an order on 14 November 1988 designating an area of some 120 acres in Tallaght.  This area included part of the existing Tallaght village.  Senators will be glad to know that work on the much needed and long-awaited town centre started last month and is due for completion in two years.</P>
    <P>An important aspect of the urban renewal scheme overall is that it is not open-ended.  A cut-off date for qualifying expenditure under the scheme has been fixed by statute at 31 May, 1991.  Benefit is only available for construction expenditure incurred and leases executed before that date.  Developers are aware of the closing date and will have to decide in the very near future whether or not they intend to partake in the scheme.  I do not propose to extend this deadline as to do so could put many much needed projects, now at advanced planning stages, on the back burner for a number of years.</P>
    <P>With over two years still to go before the deadline, the scheme has already enjoyed considerable success in promoting development in many of the centres designated.  While it may be unfair to single out specific successes of the scheme I think that the following developments are worthy of note.</P>
    <P>The scheme in Galway took off within months of its introduction and progress has been conspicuous since then.  Almost all available property within the designated area has already been taken up. Derelict sites have been replaced with fine new buildings, disused warehouses have been refurbished, residential development have returned to the inner city and new commercial developments have been attracted to the city.</P>
    <P>In Galway developments involving 43 retail outlets with a total floor area of almost 40,000 square feet, 35 town houses with an overall floor area of 23,500 square feet and office space amounting to a total of 33,000 square feet have already <Col N="78" /> been completed.  Other proposals representing further investment of £10 million are planned, including a cultural centre at Spanish Arch comprising a theatre, museum and exhibition centre.</P>
    <P>In Limerick many fine developments have been carried out in the designated areas.  Projects with a value of some £23 million have already been completed or are in progress in the city.  These projects include the major development at Arthurs Quay involving a new supermarket, shopping units, multi-storey car park and office and residential accommodation and also the new Limerick Civic Centre, which consists of civic offices, a municipal museum and courthouse facilities.  Further projects at a total estimated cost of approximately £18 million are at various stages of planning.</P>
    <P>In Dublin the urban renewal scheme was initially somewhat slow to show results.  In the last year the picture has changed dramatically in the Dublin Quays designated area, particularly in the vicinity of Christchurch.  As Senator Doyle mentioned in this House last Wednesday evening, there were no new developments along the quays between 1975 and 1986.  Since the introduction of the scheme however development involving investment of some £40 million is now either completed, in progress or about to start along the quays.</P>
    <P>In Wexford the scheme is also set to be a considerable success with a very attractive blend of developments proposed. The developments will include commercial, residential, civic and recreational projects, together with an imaginative project involving the restoration of the Town Wall and Medieval Tower to provide museum and craft workshops.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the success of the scheme in Galway, Limerick, Dublin and Wexford to illustrate what has, and what can be, achieved.  The scheme has also proved to be a marked success in many of the other designated areas.  I am also quietly confident that Castlebar will also produce major redevelopment and I am pleased that this will take place in the older part of the town.  I will say no more <Col N="79" /> on this for the present except that the development is assured.</P>
    <P>Our cities and towns benefit from many schemes in addition to the designated area programme.  In the late seventies the then Fianna Fáil Government established an interdepartmental committee to report on and make recommendations to deal with the particularly acute problems of the Dublin inner city area.  This group, which received funds from central Government towards recreational, educational and job creation projects in the inner city, helped in identifying many of the problems associated with urban decay.</P>
    <P>The perception of an area plays a very important part in its development. Improving an area's image by improving the environment and housing stock can act as a catalyst for attracting new investment. In promoting urban renewal we must therefore create &ldquo;living&rdquo; urban centres, that is places where people want to live, work and spend their leisure time.</P>
    <P>Local authorities for their part have been to the forefront in the provision of new good quality infill housing in urban areas.  Dublin Corporation, for example, have since 1982 provided nearly 1,300 new dwellings as part of a major programme of inner city housing.  Generally these new housing developments have taken place on sites which were formerly disused or rundown.  These developments have made a significant contribution to halting the decline of the areas involved.</P>
    <P>In the future I will continue to place emphasis on providing small infill housing schemes integrated with existing communities and services.  However, the great need now is to encourage private housing developments in inner city areas and I was greatly heartened to see recent reports of private housing developments planned for Ellis Quay.  This has to be a major milestone in the redevelopment of inner Dublin as a living city.  Indeed the interest shown in the recent Fisherman's Wharf housing development on the quays at York Road where all the houses were sold on the first morning, shows that <Col N="80" /> people's perception of the city is changing.</P>
    <P>This, however, is only a modest beginning and I hope that the incentives for owner occupiers to acquire accommodation in the designated areas and the &ldquo;Section 23&rdquo; incentives for private rented accommodation which are available generally throughout the country will generate significant new private housing developments in urban areas.</P>
    <P>The Government also recognise the fact that many existing older local authority housing schemes and flat complexes located in urban centres throughout the country are run down and in need of refurbishment.  We have, therefore, developed and expanded the remedial works scheme for local authority houses which was introduced in 1985 and the provision for this purpose, which has been more than doubled in the past two years, is £15 million in 1989.</P>
    <P>Twenty-nine urban authorities in all will receive funding under the scheme this year and the substantial increase in moneys available will mean that an extensive programme of works can be carried out which will complement urban renewal projects already underway. Physical improvements to dwellings are only one aspect of the remedial works scheme.  An essential aim, particularly in large urban estates, is the development of a greater emphasis on improved estate management and maintenance.  I have, therefore, stressed to local authorities that particular importance must be placed on tenant involvement in running their estates as a means of combating the social problems which have often contributed to the deterioration of the estates and also to ensure that the improvements brought about by the scheme are maintained in the long term.</P>
    <P>Another essential facet of the scheme is the obligation on local authorities to carry out environmental improvement works to estates being refurbished; well thought out programmes of works in this regard can contribute substantially to improving the overall environment and are of special value in urban areas.  I am confident that the remedial works <Col N="81" /> programme, which extends far beyond the existing designated area boundaries, will make a major contribution to the whole process of urban renewal.</P>
    <P>In 1987, in order to maximise the potential for urban renewal involving a number of various different interests, the Government approved a proposal for the National Building Agency to undertake certain redevelopment works bringing together local authority, private and voluntary interests.  The Agency's role is not, of course, confined to the designated areas.</P>
    <P>The Agency have built up a close working relationship with local authorities, Government Departments and the construction industry over 25 years and are uniquely placed to carry out a central co-ordinating role in relation to urban renewal.  While the Agency's main area of operation had been local authority housing, they had increasingly shown their ability to diversify having been involved in projects on behalf of bodies such as Clashganna Mills Trust in Carlow and the Grapevine Arts Centre in Dublin.  In addition to their experience of major construction projects the Agency had established a highly qualified and experienced urban design unit.  Since 1987, significant progress has already been made by the agency with the following projects in the course of construction:</P>
    <P>Westgate-Selskar, Wexford &mdash; including residential accommodation, a shop, a restaurant and the restoration of old Norman West Gate;</P>
    <P>Douglas Street, Cork &mdash; an attractive residential development of 35 houses and flats which is being developed jointly by the Agency and a local builder;</P>
    <P>Ormond Quay, Dublin &mdash; a very high standard office development which it is hoped will act as a catalyst to further development along the quays.</P>
    <P>In addition, a major redevelopment in Dundalk is at an advanced planning stage.</P>
    <P>The Government were aware that the <Col N="82" /> Agency required additional resources to effectively discharge its new role.  The Government, therefore, made available a £1 million revolving fund in the 1988 public capital programme to assist the funding of individual projects and a further £1 million has been allocated for the purpose in 1989.  As projects are completed and sold off, the fund will be replenished allowing new projects to be undertaken elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I moved the Second Stage of a new Bill to deal with the problem of dereliction.  The Derelict Sites Bill, 1989 will, when it becomes law, place a duty on the owners and occupiers of all land to take reasonable steps to ensure that the land does not become or does not continue to be a derelict site and it will be the duty of local authorities to ensure that this requirement is complied with.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides, subject to certain exemptions, for an annual levy on derelict sites in urban areas.  Local authorities will be empowered to require measures to be taken in relation to derelict sites and heavy penalties will apply where these are not complied with.  There is a need to take positive and aggressive action to effectively deal with the problem of dereliction.  The Bill is aimed at giving local authorities the necessary legislative framework with which to tackle and control the problem.</P>
    <P>One of the most important aspects of the proposed law is that it will also apply to local authorities themselves and other statutory bodies.  It is time all public bodies got their act together to stamp out the unacceptable face of dereliction in our cities and towns.</P>
    <P>Despite the overall level of achievement of the designated areas scheme I am concerned that a small number of the areas involved may not be living up to expectations.  I hope the local authorities involved will step up their activity in this area by using whatever means are at their disposal to encourage private sector involvement and to ensure whereever possible smooth and expeditious use of their planning and compulsory land acquisition powers and functions.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons the scheme has not <Col N="83" /> been as successful in some areas is that some parts of the designated areas are environmentally unappealing and, despite the incentives available, are not perceived by developers as attractive locations for development.  In order to overcome this difficulty, the Government announced in this year's budget that an allocation of £2 million would be made in 1989 to finance environmental infrastructural projects which will complement proposed private sector developments within the designated areas.  They type of projects which I have in mind are pedestrianisation paving, attractive public lighting, creation of walkways, and other urban landscaping. Besides encouraging further development, these projects will greatly enhance the urban environment and should make our towns and cities more pleasant places in which to work and live.  The planned environmental upgrading will also provide a boost for the areas concerned from the point of view of tourism.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that this fund will have the greatest possible impact in generating new development, it is intended that these environmental infrastructural projects will only be approved and undertaken in areas where there is already demonstrable development interest.  A fund operated in this way will guarantee maximum return on State investment by copperfastening existing proposals and by encouraging and accelerating other private sector development which might not otherwise take place.</P>
    <P>Experience in other countries has shown that urban redevelopment cannot be left wholly to the private sector and that selective public expenditure on environmental upgrading is an essential and effective element in promoting urban redevelopment.  I am confident that investment of £2 million will represent only a fraction of the value of private sector development which will be generated.</P>
    <P>The idea of designating specific and limited sized areas in each centre is to ensure that the maximum impact of the scheme is achieved in those areas which <Col N="84" /> are most in need of redevelopment but which are likely to remain undeveloped unless special measures are taken.  Designation of these selected areas focuses attention on these locations without having the effects of the scheme dissipated over too wide an area in any given town.  It is important that the fruits of the urban renewal scheme are readily noticeable and publicised.  This serves to generate interest in the scheme.</P>
    <P>If large tracts of land or indeed whole towns were to be designated, the concentration of development in the desired locations would not be achieved.  Just as the size of the areas in each of the towns involved must be limited so too must the number of towns involved.  The towns already identified under the scheme have been selected having regard to their size, need for renewal, their geographical location and the potential for redevelopent.</P>
    <P>Strong cases could and have been made for the extension of the scheme to many further towns throughout the country which are suffering from different degrees of dereliction.  I am aware of the problems that exist.  I have received hundreds of representations and deputations from individuals, private developers and indeed local authorities seeking designation of particular areas.</P>
    <P>As Minister for the Environment I have to be satisfied that further designations will not adversely affect the progress being achieved in those towns which have already been identified as having the greatest need.  If the scheme were to be extended in an unplanned and willy-nilly fashion this would be counterproductive not only adversely affecting towns already designated but also by slowing down or indeed halting developments in other areas with developers adopting a &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; policy in the hope that particular areas in which they might have an interest would be designated. I am keeping the urban renewal scheme under constant review.  The representations and submissions which have been made and the comments of Senators on this motion will be borne in mind as part of this review.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="85" /> Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, whose trojan work in promoting the scheme throughout the country has, in no small measure, been responsible for the success of the scheme. I would also like to thank all those who contributed to the debate.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for his very comprehensive contribution to the report on the scheme to date.  I have been encouraged by the many comments in his statement tonight. It is a very worthwhile scheme.  I will not waste time in repeating what has been said by Members on both sides of the House.</P>
      <P>I am being parochial when I speak about south Tipperary.  A number of applications have been made.  One was made sometime ago by Clonmel Corporation and the Minister received a deputation last year.  We hope that when the scheme is extended the Minister will bear in mind that they have put a very worthwhile case forward.  It is a beautiful and very historic town.  Carrick-on-Suir Urban Council have put forward an application and also the historic town of Cashel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an excellent scheme and the Minister's approach is very constructive and worthwhile.  If the moneys allocated this year and last year are an indication of his commitment to the scheme it will help to preserve the beautiful buildings around the country and the generations to come will read the history of this great land of ours and what happened in our humble <Col N="86" /> little towns and villages.  It is an excellent scheme and I compliment the Minister and his Department and also the previous Minister.  I appeal to the Minister not to forget the three small towns in south Tipperary when he is extending the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to express my gratitude to Senator Fitzsimons for facilitating me.  I want to make two brief comments to the Minister.  In his speech he stated that he has to be satisfied that further designations will not adversely affect the progress being achieved in those towns which have already been identified.  I ask the Minister to apply himself, in terms of further designation, to seaside resorts.  I would like to instance specifically what has happened in Tramore.  A company called Tramore Fáilte were set up by Bord Fáilte some 20 years ago for the development of the resort.  They employed consultants at that time and a plan was drawn up.  A great deal of the development proposed then has been carried out. Recently Tramore Fáilte again commissioned consultants because after 20 years the market requirements change. Our climate is a factor that has to be taken into account.  Having had discussions with people from overseas and so on it appears that indoor facilities need to be provided in seaside resorts, specifically aquatic indoor facilities, not so much swimming pools but waterchutes and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that a number of our major resorts around the country are in need of a facelift.  Not alone have Tramore Fáilte got their consultant's plan but there is one major private developer who has a planning application before Waterford County Council for very substantial residential development.  This company are also investing in Waterford Airport.  It <Col N="87" /> will be very much in their interest to develop that airport and their market will primarily be the UK market south of London.  A certain amount of private capital has been attracted so far but further designation of the town as an area for redevelopment would greatly enhance and speed up the process which is already underway at this stage.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at the possibility of extending the designated areas to seaside resorts.  This Government are rightly putting a lot of emphasis on tourism. It is seen as a major growth area in job creation and this type of help to our seaside resorts would attract more tourists, create jobs and get them done more speedily.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not refer to what is happening in Waterford.  This struck me as a bit odd.  In Waterford an £18 million shopping development is going ahead in the city towards the end of March.  Very special problems arose in Waterford city which related to very important archaeological remains which were discovered in the city.  Archaeological digs were necessary.  Much negotiation had to be carried out with the developer and with the Office of Public Works so that important aspects of archaeological interest could be retained in the overall development of the shopping centre.  Thankfully, we seem to be coming to the end of our problems.  They were not great problems when one looks at York in the UK where the city was run down in the early sixties and the core of the city was badly in need of refurbishment.  They got the formula right; the mixture of modern first-class shopping and archaeological and historical remains properly presented.  This has resulted in York becoming the tourist capital of Britain after London.  They have a throughput of three million tourists per year.  I have seen recently that they are encountering problems with archaeological remains because there are not sufficient funds available for archaeological digs and important remains are being covered over.  They hope future generations will carry out the excavation.</P>
    <P>When archaeological remains are <Col N="88" /> found in city centre areas an added burden is put on the local authorities because archaeological digs, the cataloguing of material and so on are very expensive.  This is an area the Minister's Department could look at in terms of making some funding available where important archaeological and historical remains are located.  This certainly has proved to be an obstacle to the speedier development of the Waterford project.</P>
    <P>In essence, the designation of areas in the major urban towns introduced by the previous Government and extended by this Government is very welcome We are seeing very good results.  I ask the Minister to look at our seaside resorts because I believe that their designation as areas for development will add greatly to the amenities and facilities of our own population and, on the other side, help to attract many more tourists to our shores thus increasing employment.  After all, tourism is an 8 per cent growth area in the Community: we have not hit a figure like that yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Cathaoirleach for selecting this topic for discussion in the Seanad tonight.  I am delighted the Minister for the Environment is in the Chamber to take this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Senators will be aware, yesterday marked the eighth anniversary of the horrific fire at the Stardust night club in Artane in which 48 people died tragically and 128 people were seriously injured.  The effects on the communities of Artane, Coolock and Raheny have been devastating <Col N="89" /> and are still felt very much today. Following the fire, a number of relatives established a committee in the locality called the Stardust Victims Committee. The committee was set up to achieve a number of aims, the main one being to secure adequate compensation for relatives of the dead and for those who were seriously injured.  This was a long struggle for the committee.  I was delighted to be associated with their endeavours and, thankfully, the issue of compensation has now been dealt with adequately after a long campaign.</P>
    <P>The committee had many other objectives and still have them today.  The main one at present is the proper development of the Stardust site and the provision of an adequate memorial for those who died.  However, there is one major objective still remaining and it is still very much pursued by the Stardust Victims Committee and that is to ensure that a similar type Stardust fire never happens again.</P>
    <P>Following the fire in 1981 the Government announced that a public inquiry would be held and a tribunal established. Item 2 in relation to the terms of reference provides for the making of such recommendations as the tribunal having regard to its findings thinks proper in respect of the statutory and other provisions in relation to fire prevention and means and systems of emergency escape from fire, and in respect of adequacy and enforcement and any other matters that the tribunal considers relevant.</P>
    <P>The final report eventually made a number of recommendations and these are to be found on pages 308 to 322 of the report.  We are now eight years on and need to know where we are in relation to fire prevention, fire protection, fire legislation and the implementation of the recommedations of the Stardust Tribunal.  Recent newspaper articles have suggested that there are still some problems in relation to our fire laws and fire safety.  <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> had an article last Sunday which suggested that there were still problems with overcrowding in Dublin nightspots.  I have since discussed the issue with firemen and <Col N="90" /> officers at Tara Street who have confirmed that there are some difficulties which need to be tackled, and tackled urgently.  I would be greatful if the Minister in response could give a progress report on the implementation of a number of the recommendations which I will now deal with.</P>
    <P>Of crucial importance with regard to Irish fire safety is the issue of regulations, and indeed the absence of regulations. Irish law suffers from lack of regulations at present.  At the moment each local authority has to establish standards and these are <i>ad hoc</i> and may differ from authority to authority.  In the Building Control Bill, 1984, these regulations are laid down very clearly and it would be of vital importance that this Bill would go through the Dáil and also be passed by the Seanad.  I understand that it is now at Committee Stage in Dáil Éireann.  It is absolutely vital that these regulations be introduced so that there is no cause for doubt and that the regulations are there for everybody to see and to implement.  It is unsatisfactory at the moment to rely on standards.  There is no danger with regard to the existing standards but it would be preferable if the same regulations applied in every local authority.</P>
    <P>In the Stardust Tribunal report the establishment of an inspectorate of five services was recommended to set objective standards for every fire authority and to supervise and inspect all fire services in the country.  In fact this was never established.  I would be interested to know the Department's view of whether it is necessary to establish an inspectorate of fire services.  Certainly, the tribunal report felt that it was.  Again, they were anxious to tackle the whole <i>ad hoc</i> basis to fire legislation and to have one single inspectorate examining each authority throughout the country and setting up objective standards.</P>
    <P>The tribunal also recommended that the control and direction of individual fire brigades become the responsibility of the Department of the Environment. This also has not happened.  As a local authority member I suppose I would have <Col N="91" /> a conflict of interest in relation to this recommendation in that maybe local authorities should have a great degree of independence in relation to what they do but, again, there might be a danger that the whole business would be left on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis again.  Perhaps the Department of the Environment should intervene to a larger extent than they are doing at present.  Certainly, the tribunal recommended that that be the case.</P>
    <P>The tribunal report also called for the establishment of a national training centre.  At the moment the nearest thing we have to that is the O'Brien Institute in Marino which has been a tremendous success.  Perhaps the services there could be expanded to bring about a national training centre.  Recent media reports have also suggested that in relation to the Dublin Fire Brigade half the firemen have not been properly trained in the use of breathing apparatus.  Again, it is never suggested that this is a dangerous situation but I think it is worth a comment.</P>
    <P>In my discussions with some of the firemen and fire officers at Tara Street I found a general concern regarding the lack of mobility between senior officers and firemen.  This issue was touched on in the Stardust Tribunal report.  Certainly firemen at Tara Street now would say that the fact that there is not this mobility between senior officers and firemen and the lack of promotional prospects and so on is leading to low morale among firemen.  I understand that the fire services council have now submitted a report to the Minister in relation to education and the fire service which is of crucial importance to this issue.  That is an area that must be dealt with in a pragmatic fashion to tackle this problem of low morale with regard to this issue.</P>
    <P>The Stardust Tribunal report also had some criticisms in relation to the control room at Tara Street.  I visited Tara Street recently and there is certainly no cause for alarm at the conditions there but the officers had some constructive proposals to make.  They felt that a re-organisation of the emergency system there would be beneficial.  At the moment there are three <Col N="92" /> telephones in Tara Street and the officer in charge can also be expected to answer the telephone.  Perhaps this is not a good thing in that if an officer has to take overall control of the situation he may not be available to make instant decisions if he is involved in taking a telephone call on one particular telephone line.  Maybe that is an area that should be tackled. Perhaps one officer could be given overall responsibility and allow the firemen there to take the telephone calls.  These are just some minor adjustments which could be made, but they are certainly promoted by the people at Tara Street and they believe that they would be most beneficial.</P>
    <P>One issue which was not dealt with in the Stardust Tribunal report but which has been brought to my attention is the whole area of stress with regard to firemen. Firemen are involved in some horrendous accidents and they witness some horrendous scenes.  Stress and sickness can result from their involvement in these fire-fighting services.  However, at the moment there is no welfare service provided for firemen.  Very often they may need counselling, having just experienced a horrific scene.  This is a demand which firemen have recently made, that adequate counselling and welfare facilities should be made available.  Unfortunately, when a fireman comes home from a fire he cannot really discuss what he has just seen with his family and very often he could be under tremendous stress as a result.  I would ask the Minister to look at that issue and perhaps some sort of welfare service could be established. I am mainly concerned with Tara Street and that is where this demand has come from but I suppose it could also be established on a national basis.  It would help to alleviate the amount of sickness in the fire service caused by stress and tension.</P>
    <P>I also believe it would be helpful in relation to Tara Street to create a post of public relations officer.  Unfortunately the situation at the moment is that Dublin Corporation's PRO, Noel Carroll, handles all media activities in relation to the fire brigade and perhaps that office is <Col N="93" /> slightly removed from the day-to-day activities of the fire brigade.  At the moment what we are seeing are unnamed spokespeople in the media making statements about the position on the ground. I believe the establishment of an office of PRO at Tara Street would be helpful and beneficial for the public.</P>
    <P>One last major issue which was dealt with in the Stardust Tribunal Report was the actual building at Tara Street.  Again, there is no cause for alarm, but certainly the long-term situation would dictate that that building be radically refurbished or replaced.  It is doing its service at the moment but there is general agreement that for the future if Tara Street is to function effectively a new building with the latest modern equipment, computerisation and so forth would be extremely desirable.  For the long term that situation should be looked at.</P>
    <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for giving me this opportunity to raise this issue.  As I said in my introduction, this week marks the eighth anniversary of the Stardust fire.  These issues are topical and I think the public now would very much welcome a comment from the Minister in relation to the Stardust Tribunal report and the issues that were raised in it and an outline of where he sees the situation going from here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to come here tonight and listen to the contributions which have been made to this debate.  At this time of each year our thoughts return to that dreadful disaster in the Stardust premises and to the victims of the fire.  I am glad of the opportunity to advise Senators of what has been done since the tragedy occurred.  A lot of progress has been made and it is only right that the public should be made aware of it.</P>
      <P>Since 1981, some £44 millions of capital expenditure has been invested in the fire service.  This has enabled the following to be undertaken:</P>
      <P>55 new stations to be built and major reconstructions to be carried out;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="94" /> six new fire stations are currently being built;</P>
    <P>170 new fire appliances were purchased;</P>
    <P>major improvements have taken place in radio communications, in the provision of breathing apparatus and other fire-fighting and rescue equipment.</P>
    <P>The 1989 provision for the fire service of £5.4 millions will ensure a continuation of the progress being made in the provision of fire stations and modern sophisticated fire-fighting equipment.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1982, the only professional post in the county fire service was that of Chief Fire Officer.  Since the re-organisation of the service in 1982, with its emphasis on strengthening fire prevention staffing, increases in staff numbers have been sanctioned, so that there is now a total of 133 professional posts throughout the service.  Of this total, the number engaged specially on fire prevention work is 69, including 20 in Dublin alone.</P>
    <P>Major improvements have taken place in fire service training since the Fire Services Council was established in 1982. The council has organised 78 courses since 1983, and has also organised places for fire service personnel on courses abroad where this was considered to be beneficial.</P>
    <P>The courses provided by the council cover command courses for all officer ranks, including retained officers; instructor courses, specialist courses such as dealing with hazardous materials incidents and fire safety engineering.  The increased level of central training has substantially added to the pool of instructors available for local training courses provided by individual fire authorities and this has been reflected in increased training programmes at local level.</P>
    <P>Guidelines aimed at improving the efficiency of the fire service have been issued and drafting work is proceeding on other guidelines.  In 1985, the Fire Safety in Places of Assembly (Ease of Escape) Regulations were made which <Col N="95" /> made it an offence to lock exits or block escape routes from places of assembly.  A code of practice on the management of fire safety in places of assembly was issued yesterday to give guidance to persons in control of places of assembly to assist them in discharging their statutory obligations under section 18 (2) of the Fire Services Act.</P>
    <P>I expect that a further code relating to furniture and fittings will issue within a matter of weeks and work is being pressed ahead on the others.  A separate code relating to hotels is also being prepared in consultation with local chief fire officers.  It, too, will be available for publication in a matter of weeks.</P>
    <P>I could go on at some length mentioning many other fronts on which substantial progress has been made. However, time will not permit this but I hope that what I have said will indicate that a lot of hard work has been done to ensure that the level of fire safety is improved and that our community is spared a repeat of the Stardust disaster.</P>
    <P>I should like however to comment on <Col N="96" /> some recent media coverage of the subject of fire safety.  I know that fire safety in discos was the subject of a report on the Gay Byrne radio programme on Monday last.  I think it is reasonable to say that the picture which emerged was that the premises visited did not give cause for serious concern except for one establishment in Dublin.  In that particular case, it was reported that the emergency exit could not be opened.  My Department brought the matter to the attention of the fire authority, Dublin Corporation, who promised to investigate it immediately.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I think it is fair to say that some reports gave the impression of lack of progress.  I am sure that bearing in mind what I have said, you will agree that this is not so.  As far as my Department and I are concerned, we are totally committed to the continuing improvement and modernisation of the fire service. There will be no diminution in the good work in the future.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 16 February 1989.</P>
