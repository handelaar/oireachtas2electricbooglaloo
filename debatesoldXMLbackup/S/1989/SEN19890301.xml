      <P>I have notice from Senator Seán Byrne that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to come to the assistance of Cahir Bakery which is threatened with closure with the loss of 25 jobs.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Gerry Reynolds of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs in view of the joint statement following a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference to state what steps are being taken to proceed with the restoration of the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore Canal.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator John Connor of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Tourism and Transport to confirm that no obstacles will be placed in the way of the proposed flights originating in New York, via Reykjavik, and landing at Connaught Regional Airport, Charlestown, County Mayo.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Philip Hogan of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="318" /> The need for the Minister for Finance to intervene immediately with the Revenue Commissioners so that the ban on the postal stamping services can be lifted forthwith.</P>
    <P>I also received notice form Senator Brendan Ryan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The delay by the Minister for Social Welfare in completing the review of the system of operation of social welfare appeals.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Byrne, Reynolds, Connor, Hogan and Ryan as suitable for discussion.  I have selected the matter raised by Senator Byrne and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Reynolds, Connor, Hogan and Ryan may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Government side for allowing us to take in Government time Item No. 1 which is the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill and also to thank the Government side for taking this Bill at such speed after its passing in the other House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, it has been outside my range of experience in this House to deal with a Private Members' Bill and I wonder how, procedurally, it will be taken through the House.  I would like to have some explanation of that from you perhaps or from the Leader of the House; I am not sure for whom the question is appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I thought we had got out of the habit of the one-day-a-week phenomenon but we are back again it seems to the Government party ordering business for one day of the week only.  I think it is a disgraceful misuse of the House that it is in this sense turned on and off at <Col N="319" /> will.  There is plenty of legislation to get through.  The Government keep saying they do not have time to get the business through and here we are working on a basis of one day a week.  It is not good enough and I would like a comprehensive explanation from the Leader of the House.  We are back again to asking the questions we were asking months ago: Where do we go from here?  What is the programme of legislation?  We are starting to flounder again very early.  I would like a comprehensive reply from the Leader of the House on the matter.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House when he anticipates Item No. 3 to be taken, the Insurance Bill, 1987, now that it has returned from the other House?  May I also ask him if in view of the deteriorating situation in the bakery trade he intends allowing time in this House for discussion of that important matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the decision of the Leader of the House to take Item No. 1 first today.  It is a very sensible precedent which I hope in future we will follow, taking a Private Members' Bill in this time.  I hope the Leader of the House will, as a result, give consideration to other Private Members' Bills such as that on capital punishment and others put down by the Independent Members.  I endorse what Senator O'Toole said.  It seems strange we are now lapsing back into one-day-a-week sittings.  As we are taking a Private Members' Bill today, if the Government are short of legislation in this House, perhaps the Leader of the House would consider taking on Thursdays some of the serious legislation which has been put forward by the Independents which we have not been able to take up to now, because one day a week is not enough for this House to sit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Leader of the House if he has any idea at what time Item No. 2 will be taken?  It is a Report Stage and, therefore, would not be nearly as lengthy as Committee Stage. It seems it is something that will be taken if we have time and will not be taken if we do not have time.  It is an important Bill on which a number of amendments, Government and otherwise, have been put down.  I would like to know if it is intended to take it today.</P>
      <P>I endorse the comments by my Independent colleagues and say how much I regret the fact that we are meeting apparently only one day a week.  The Leader of the House and I had an interesting public discussion about the role of the Seanad in which he was eloquent in his defence of the Seanad.  His eloquence would be even more heavily underlined if he ensured that the Seanad met as frequently as it did before now.  It is a matter of great regret to me that this Leader of the House who defended us so eloquently less than a week ago is now letting us lapse back into the bad habit of infrequent meetings or once-a-week sittings which are nothing more than a token gesture.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Ross in saying that if the Government cannot produce legislation this back bench here can produce all the legislation they need provided we are allowed to publish it.  A certain unpublished Bill becomes increasingly relevant as more and more disclosures about blatant conflicts of interests begin to appear.  It would be very helpful for the image of this House if we could discuss legislation and it would be very helpful for the image of politics if we could discuss legislation about Members' conflicts of interest which are becoming a serious concern to all of us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points have been made.  Item No. 2 has been mentioned specifically.  It would appear that Item No. 1 will take up most of the time today, so I doubt very much if we will be taking Item No. 2.  If it is the wish of the House that we do not start Report Stage I am agreeable to that; we could leave it over.  There was a question asked beforehand about Item No. 13.  I can guarantee Senator Fennell that I will have a full reply on that item before next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Questions were asked as to whether we were going to sit one or two days.  It was suggested that we were getting back to the old days of irregular and one-day sittings.  I can guarantee the House there is plenty of legislation coming forward, that we will be sitting two days and that <Col N="322" /> we are not in need of any Bills from the backbenchers as they call themselves today to keep the House going.  We have the Report Stage of the Insurance Bill to debate; it will more than likely be coming up next week.  We have the Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Bill, 1989 and the Bord na gCapall (Dissolution) Bill, 1988 to come and there is a number of very important items before the House.  We will be sitting two days.  We should leave the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill, 1988 over and take the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill, 1987 as far as we can today, as well as the motion.</P>
    <P>If it is the wish of the House we could start Items Nos. 4 and 5 at 6 p.m. rather than 6.30 p.m. which would give us two hours because we have to take the matter on the Adjournment at 8 p.m.  Somebody was talking to me when Senator Ferris was asking me a question and I did not catch what he said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At the outset I would like to thank the Government for allowing us to take this Fine Gael Private Members' Bill in Government time and also for taking Second Stage so soon after the Bill had completed its passage through the Dáil. There must be very many of us who felt that this much-needed piece of reforming legislation would never reach this House, let alone see the light of day but we can now give this proposed legislation a very genuine welcome indeed.</P>
      <P>That we have reached this Stage today reflects credit on many people, but in particular on Deputy Alan Shatter, for this most emphatically is his Bill.  In many ways it is the culmination of a decade of reforming and crusading work by him in the whole field of family law reform. While this Bill may not go as far as he would like, or as I would like or indeed as my party would like, it does mark a genuine and historic milestone in our approach to family law reform.  It marks the beginning, I hope, of a new era when questions such as this can be discussed on their mertis, free from party political point-scoring, free from accusations of bad faith, free from manipulation by outside agencies and free, most of all, to seek to create legislation which is designed to serve the common good.</P>
      <P>In praising Deputy Shatter, I must also give credit to the Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, I said here last week that he has been a good Minister for Justice with an impressive record of legislation so far in this Parliament.  Both he and Deputy Shatter have shown in this Bill an ability to compromise which reflects credit on them both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also give credit to the members of the Dáil committee who spent so much time and effort processing this Bill through Committee Stage.  As we know, it is in Committee that so much of the real work of the Oireachtas is done.  That is certainly true of this Bill which has been substantially improved in Committee and <Col N="324" /> I would hope that these improvements have not yet finished.</P>
    <P>I would like at the outset to say a word about the process which has brought us to this point today.  This is the first Private Members' Bill to be enacted &mdash; hopefully it will be enacted &mdash; in this House in 30 years.  It is only the sixth such Bill in the 50-year lifetime of Seanad Éireann.  For the record, the other five Bills were the Meath Hospital Bill, 1950; the Agricultural Workers (Weekly Half-Holidays) Act, 1951; the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Joint Burial Boards' Act, 1952; the Friendly Societies (Amendment) Act, 1953 and the Law Reform (Personal Injuries) Act, 1958. These are the five Bills which preceded this legislation, and I can see that while each one in its own way was important the Bill before us today is easily the most significant and substantial piece of legislation of its type ever to come before the House.  This Bill, in fact, brings a section of Irish family law from the 19th century up to the end of the 20th century.  This is certainly a most significant piece of Private Members' legislation.</P>
    <P>The very fact that we have reached this stage today should be a cause of some celebration for all of us who want to see Parliament working as fully as possible. Clearly, Government business must take precedence and must dominate the life and the timetable of Parliament.  No one would want it otherwise, but there is a place for Private Members' Bills.  If taken in the right spirit they enrich the life and the workings of the Oireachtas.  They add to, rather than threaten, the position of the Government of the day.  They can be seen as a sign of a Government that is confident rather than a Government that is fearful.  I feel there are two sets of winners here today.  First, the very many people who have waited so long, too long, for the relief this Bill will bring are the real winners but this House and our Parliamentary process is a winner, too.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us today does not go as far as many of us would wish.  This is due in part to the fact that as a Private Members' Bill it cannot constitute a charge on the Exchequer.  Thus, it cannot <Col N="325" /> implement one of the major recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown that there should be established a unified family court structure to hear and determine all family law disputes between spouses that require judicial resolution. The committee recommended that the current overlapping and fragmentary court jurisdiction exercised by the District, Circuit and High Courts should be transferred to a single court, staffed by judges with a particular expertise in family law matters and who would have the back-up of the necessary welfare services. I hope after this Bill is passed the Minister will turn his attention to this recommendation, if he has not already done so, and also that the quality of people appointed as judges in such courts be given attention.  Not all judges are temperamentally suited to family law. Many are not suited at all.  I believe far greater care should be given to choosing the people who will act in this difficult and delicate area.  Indeed, I would suggest the need to learn from other jurisdictions where special training courses are expected of those who judge in family courts.</P>
    <P>Marital breakdown is an ever-increasing and growing problem in our society but the full extent of the problem is unknown.  Comprehensive and detailed statistics on marriage breakdown are not available to us in Ireland.  In fact, the 1986 census was the first census which allowed people to accurately describe their marital status.  The figures from the 1986 census show that altogether 37,245 people said that they were separated. This figure includes people who described their marital status as &ldquo;deserted&rdquo;, &ldquo;marriage annulled&rdquo;, &ldquo;legally separated&rdquo;, &ldquo;other separated&rdquo; or &ldquo;divorced in a different country&rdquo;.  Of these five categories the most worrying by far is the 13,062 people who described their marital status as &ldquo;other separated.&rdquo;  These are people whose marriges have completely broken down and are living apart from their spouses but are not legally separated. The Bill before us today is, to a considerable extent, aimed at them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="326" /> The basic purpose of this Bill is to minimise the hardship and distress that can occur when marriages break down. It attempts to ameliorate rather than exacerbate marital conflict.  It seems to place a duty on lawyers consulted about a marital problem to ensure that all avenues have been explored by a distressed spouse before court proceedings are commenced.  It imposes for the first time in our law an obligation on solicitors to provide information about marriage guidance services that are available and, where marriage guidance is not a practical possibility, it imposes an obligation on them to provide information about the availability of mediation services.</P>
    <P>It is a measure which is designed to encourage spouses whose marriges have broken down to reach a civilised agreement about their future arrangements without the need of court proceedings where that is at all possible.  It confers new comprehensive powers on the courts to make financial lump sum and property transfer orders to provide additional protection, in particular for dependent wives and children, by enabling the court to give them a far greater degree of security than they can obtain at present.  By conferring a jurisdiction on the Circuit Family Court to resolve all outstanding problems that arise upon a marriage breaking down in one court action, the Bill will reduce the cost of family law litigation and will simplify much of the documentation required to commence court proceedings from other types of court proceedings.  The prohibition on the wearing of wigs and gowns and-provision to enable judges to obtain independent welfare reports on children will make family law court proceedings a less distressing experience for those who look to the law to resolve their difficulties.</P>
    <P>As I said, marital breakdown is an ever increasing problem in our society.  Prior to the 1970s the law relating to marital breakdown had remained virtually unchanged for over a century.  In 1976 the first significant reform took place with the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act of that year but the first real breakthrough came in 1983 with <Col N="327" /> the establishment of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  For the first time since the foundation of the State this committee conducted a detailed examination of our marital laws, especially laws dealing with marital breakdown.  It was a major educational experience for many of those who participated. It did help to change people's attitudes.  It focused public attention on the issue and it allowed the debate to be widened, not always in the most amicable of ways but at least the question was, in an informed way, put very fully on the public agenda.</P>
    <P>In its report published in April 1985, the committee acknowledged the failure of the Oireachtas to tackle this area and it emphasised the need for reform.  It proposed comprehensive and radical reform on our separation laws and of the court system which administers them. Many of the recommendations of that report are implemented in the Bill before us today.  As things now stand under current legislation the only grounds upon which a decree of separation can currently be granted is on proof of adultery, cruelty or what is known as unnatural practices.  The current law provides no legal remedy for many spouses whose marriges have totally collapsed and who need legal intervention to resolve the consequences of such collapse.</P>
    <P>In separation proceedings the courts currently cannot determine property disputes between spouses or disputes relating to the guardianship or custody of children.  At no time since the foundation of the State has legislation been introduced into the Oireachtas either to expressly state the grounds upon which a decree of separation can be obtained or to expand, modify or reform the grounds upon which such a decree can be granted. As a result, the current law provides no legal remedy for many spouses whose marriages have totally collapsed and who require legal intervention to resolve the consequences of such collapse.</P>
    <P>At the present time, if the court grants a decree of separation it has ancillary powers to make an alimony order to <Col N="328" /> require a husband against whom a decree of separation is being made to pay alimony for the support of his wife.  It may also under the provisions of section 18 (1) of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964 make a declaration that the spouse by reason of whose conduct the decree is made is unfit to have custody of any children.</P>
    <P>A decree of separation automatically deprives the guilty spouses of his or her legal right to a share of the estate of the other, either as a legal right or on intestacy under the Succession Act of 1965.  There are no other statutory powers conferred on the courts to make ancillary orders following the making of decrees of separation.</P>
    <P>At the present time, the courts in separation proceedings cannot determine property disputes between spouses or disputes concerning the guardianship of children.  At the present time, the courts in separation proceedings cannot make maintenance orders for the support of a dependent husband or dependent children or orders to protect the family home or permit its sale.  At the present time in separation proceedings the courts cannot make barring orders to provide protection for a spouse at risk of violence, or property transfer orders to provide security for a spouse who requires such security.</P>
    <P>The result of these restrictions is that in many cases in order to circumvent the limited jurisdiction conferred on the courts when determining separation proceedings, the practice has grown up in recent years of estranged spouses instituting a variety of other court actions at the same time as the bringing of separation proceedings so that all issues that have to be resolved between them which arise from a marital conflict can be dealt with in a single court hearing.  The consequence of this is that the husband and wife whose marriage has broken down can find themselves embroiled in two or three different sets of court proceedings and incur a great deal of unnecessary legal expense and hassle, inordinate delay and unnecessary emotional exposure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown discovered that there was almost universal agreement right across the religious, social and political spectrum that our separation laws should be reformed and that the current narrow grounds on which a decree of separation could be granted should be replaced with the one overall ground of proof of irretrievable marital breakdown. The committee recognised that the current grounds for separation which require proof of the committal of matrimonial offence maximised conflict between estranged spouses, discouraged instead of encouraged voluntary reconciliation, and effectively sabotaged the possibility of future co-operation between the estranged couple.</P>
    <P>The report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee recognised that the purpose of separation proceedings was to provide the means whereby the parties to a broken marriage could rearrange their lives with a minimum of bitterness and recrimination.  The committee recommended that all barriers to reconciliation contained in current law should be removed, and this is reflected in the provisions contained in the Bill.  They also recommended that following the granting of a decree of separation, the courts should have comprehensive powers to make maintenance orders, guardianship, custody and access orders concerning the children, lump sum payment orders, orders relating to the family home and other family property and also orders to provide protection for a spouse at risk of violence.  All of these recommendations are implemented in the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>At this stage I should like to go through the Bill before concluding the main points in it.  Part I of the Bill deals with the basis upon which a decree of separation can be granted and related matters.  Section 1 of the Bill is simply a definition of what is meant by the court having jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Section 2 proved to be one of the most contentious sections of the Bill when it was debated in the other House and during its Committee Stage.  It outlines <Col N="330" /> the six grounds upon which a spouse can apply for a decree of judicial separation. This area caused great difficulty and was the subject of much of the discussion which finally led to a compromise which was acceptable to all parties.  Basically, this section provides comprehensive grounds on which a decree of separation can be granted.  Section 2 (1) (f) defines the concept of marital breakdown: that the marriage has broken down to the extent that the court is satisfied in all the circumstances that a normal marital relationship has not existed between the spouses for a period of at least one year immediately preceding the date of the application.  This concept of marital breakdown rather than irretrievable breakdown met with general approval of all the parties involved in the lengthy debate before the Bill reached this House.  I believe it meets the main case made by both sides.  If accepted it takes away the need for adversarial strife which was so much in the minds of all sides in framing this particular section.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that the court will grant a decree of judicial separation in respect of the spouses concerned if it is satisfied that one of the grounds referred to in section 2 (1), which have been relied on by the applicant, have been proved on the balance of probabilities.  Subsection (2) states that where there are dependent children of the family the court shall not grant a decree of judicial separation until it is satisfied that such provision has been made or, intends by order upon the granting of the decree, to make such provision for the welfare of these children.  This is a key section in the Bill.  The provisions there are designed to ensure the protection of the welfare of the children in resolving any dispute.  This section is linked with sections 11 and 16.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill contains a provision to ensure that if parties to a marriage attempt a reconciliation after marital difficulties have occurred which could give rise to one of them seeking a decree of separation, then that attempt at reconciliation does not prevent a spouse from seeking a decree if the reconciliation does not prove successful.  Under <Col N="331" /> the current law if a husband or wife attempts a reconciliation and if the reconciliation does not prove successful, the spouse who could have brought separation proceedings may find that he or she is unable to do so due to their being held to have condoned the matrimonial offence previously committed by the other spouse.  In effect, the current law frequently acts as a barrier to conciliation in circumstances where reconciliation may prove possible.</P>
    <P>For example, at present if a wife learns that her husband has committed adultery and, upon his promising not to commit adultery again, forgives him and the couple resumes normal marital relations, then if matters do not work out the wife may find that because she attempted to resolve the marital difficulties she is excluded from seeking a decree of separation. Many people feel &mdash; and I agree &mdash; that the current law in this case militates against reconciliation.  The provisions of section 4 (2) of the Bill are designed to remove obstacles to reconciliation inherent in the current law.</P>
    <P>Section 5 and 6 contain provisions to ensure that court proceedings between couples are avoided where possible.  This section requires a solicitor consulted about a marital difficulty to advise the spouse as to the availability of marriage counselling where there is a possibility of the marital problems being resolved. Where there is no such possibility a spouse must be advised as to how to effect a separation without bringing court proceedings.  In this context a solicitor is required to furnish information to a spouse as to the availability of mediation services and the possibility of resolving the consequences of marital breakdown by the conclusion of a separation deed or written separation agreement.  At this point there is no harm in pointing out that the existing mediation services have been successful, but it would probably be the view of all sides in this House that this service could very well do with being strengthened.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill provides for the adjournment of proceedings at any time <Col N="332" /> to give the spouses an opportunity, if they both so wish, to consider a reconciliation, with or without a third party, or to consider agreement on separation.  This, again, is a very important section because it means that if a couple find themselves, as may happen today, on a legal treadmill there is the possibility of getting off it.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that following the granting of a decree of separation the parties to a marriage are no longer obliged to reside together.</P>
    <P>Section 9 abolishes the decree of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> after the commencement of this Bill.  Part II of the Bill contains provisions to enable the courts to make comprehensive ancillary orders following the granting of a decree of separation.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is a defining section, defining the terms such as &ldquo;conveyance&rdquo;, &ldquo;dependent child of the family&rdquo;, &ldquo;family home&rdquo;, &ldquo;chattels&rdquo; and so forth.</P>
    <P>Section 11 gives powers to the court in separation proceedings where necessary to make orders in respect of barring or protection orders to provide protection for a spouse at risk of violence.  It gives custody orders or access orders concerning children and orders for protection of the family home and household chattels.</P>
    <P>Section 12 is concerned with the making of applications for preliminary orders.  Section 13 is an important section.  It gives the court power, when application is made for judicial separation, to make an order for maintenance pending suit, that is, an order requiring either spouse to make to the other spouse periodical payments for the support of the other spouse and of dependent children of the family pending the separation trial.  Clearly, this is designed to meet a situation at present where frequently there can be very long delays in such cases.</P>
    <P>Section 14 lists the various periodical payments and lump sum orders the court can make following the granting of a decree of separation.  Section 15 lists the property adjustment orders the court can make following the granting of a decree of separation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="333" /> Section 16 gives the court power to make orders determining which spouse may occupy the family home to the exclusion of the other spouse.  This section can determine the sale of the family home.  It can determine property disputes under the Married Women's Status Act, 1957, orders under the Family Home Protection Act, 1976 and barring orders under the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981.  It can also determine orders under the Partition Acts of 1868 and 1876 in relation to the sale of property and orders under the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 concerning any dependent child of the family.</P>
    <P>Section 17 moves into the area of succession rights.  This, again, is an important section because it has provisions to ensure that dependent spouses will retain inheritance rights following the granting of a separation decree.  These are listed in section 17, where the court is satisfied &ldquo;that adequate and reasonable provision of a permanent nature has been made to provide for the future security of the spouse whose succession rights are in question...&rdquo;.  There is one exception where a spouse can lose inheritance rights and this is covered in section 20 (2) (i). Those rights are protected in section 17.</P>
    <P>Section 18 is an order for the sale of property.  It has provisions to enable the court to order a sale of property in circumstances where arrears may have accrued or where there is a need for a lump sum payment.  Under this section the court can order that property be disposed of to meet either of these two needs.</P>
    <P>Section 19 deals with additional family home jurisdiction.  This section is inter-linked with section 16 (a) and (b).  What it means really is that frequently &mdash; in fact almost always &mdash; after a separation generally it is not possible for a couple to reside together.  In section 19 the court &ldquo;shall in exercising such jurisdiction have regard to the welfare of the family as a whole and in particular shall take into consideration... that proper and secure accommodation should, where practicable, be provided for a dependent <Col N="334" /> spouse and any dependent child of the family ...&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The details of section 19 are greatly elaborated in section 20 &mdash; the conditions relating to the circumstances in which the court will decide are elaborated in great detail, dealing both with the spouse and with the position of the child.  Again, these sections provide one of the key parts of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 21 deals with restrospective maintenance orders.  This is a new power. It will ensure that courts can have maintenance orders backdated.  Again, this can mean additional protection for a dependent spouse, especially if there has been a delay or a draggging of feet by the lawyers on one side or the other or if there has been difficulty in coming to a resolution, so that there now exists the possibility of backdated retrospective maintenance orders.</P>
    <P>Section 22 deals with the variation and the discharge of financial property orders.  This is a usual type of provision which simply takes account of changing circumstances.  Section 23 on child maintenance is largely a technical section.</P>
    <P>Section 24 is quite an important section because under this section payments can be made through the District Court office to ensure the keeping of accurate records.  This section will apply automatically unless alternative arrangements are made, though in practice about half of the payments under existing law are made by bankers order.</P>
    <P>Section 25 is largely a technical section. Section 26 is in acccordance with current law and states that payments must be made without the deduction of income tax.  Section 27 is in line with current law and deals with the position of the Defence Forces.  Section 28 is a technical section.</P>
    <P>Section 29 is an important section.  It is designed to ensure that assets cannot be dissipated or transferred to avoid payments. It is important because it gives the Bill real teeth.  It ensures that the court can look behind transactions and, if the court is satisfied that there has been any attempt to dissipate assets or to transfer them in any improper way, this can be dealt with.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="335" /> Part III of the Bill deals with court jurisdiction.  Section 30 defines &ldquo;Family law proceedings&rdquo; in relation to a court. As stated already, currently separation proceedings can be commenced in either the High Court or the Circuit Court, although the majority of such cases at present are brought to the Circuit Court. Very often the Circuit Court hears family law cases on the same day as it hears criminal prosecutions, pub licensing applications, running down actions and other civil actions.  As a result, distressed wives and husbands are often left hanging around the courts while other legal proceedings are given precedence.</P>
    <P>The Bill expressly provides that the Circuit Court shall hear initially all judicial separation proceedings and that when it is dealing with such proceedings the Circuit Court is to be known as the Circuit Family Court.  It also provides that judicial separation proceedings should be heard on separate days set aside for the hearing of such proceedings and should not be intermingled with other types of court actions.</P>
    <P>As an alternative, it is providing that the Circuit Court sitting as the Circuit Family Court shall hear judicial separation proceedings at a separate venue to the venue in which other court proceedings are heard.  The Bill also provides that all existing powers vested in the Circuit Court to hear and to determine family law cases shall be transferred to the Circuit Family Court and heard and dealt with by it.  Matters relating to the Circuit Court jurisdiction are dealt with in section 31 and 32 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 33 provides for a degree of informality at the hearing of family law procedings.  This is based, again, on a recommendation by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown which &mdash; and I think this would be very much in line with current thinking &mdash; emphasised the need to reduce the adversarial element inherent in the resolution of family disputes and to provide a less formal type of adjudication process for their resolution.  Where legal rights are in contest it is clear it is essential to ensure <Col N="336" /> that justice is properly administered. Acccordingly, it is not possible to make such proceedings totally informal, but to deal with this issue the Bill provides that family law proceedings in the District, Circuit or High Courts shall be as informal as is practicable and consistent with the administration of justice.  These matters are dealt with under the provisions of section 33 and 45 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that neither judges hearing family law proceedings nor barristers appearing before them should wear wigs or gowns.  This provision is similar to provisions enacted in the legislation of a number of other countries in recent years such as Australia and New Zealand.  To ensure that the anonymity of couples whose marriages have broken down is preserved, provision is also made for all proceedings brought under the Bill to be heard <i>in camera</i>&mdash; section 34.</P>
    <P>Section 35 gives the court discretion regarding the costs of the proceedings. Section 36 is technical.  It is designed to simplify legal proceedings, as is section 37 also a technical change.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with a number of consequential amendments of existing family law legislation which are required to provide for a consistent legal approach in the area of matrimonial law.  Section 38 amends the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, regarding maintenance orders.  Section 39 is a technical amendment.</P>
    <P>Section 40 is an important section.  It protects the welfare of the children.  It allows the court to get independent reports from outside experts.  Typically, up until now when experts' reports are brought into court these reports are usually partisan.  They have been commissioned by one side or other, and, while the competence of the experts is not brought into question, the questions asked and the way in which the agenda is set may very well make these reports less than fully impartial.  Under this section the courts can seek independent advice.  Under section 40 (5):</P>
    <P>The court may, of its own motion or <Col N="337" /> on an application by an order under this section give such directions as it thinks proper to procure a report from such person as it may nominate on any question affecting the welfare of the infant.</P>
    <P>Section 41 is on the same topic, dealing with the welfare of the children.  Subsection (1) is worth quoting:</P>
    <P>Where the court grants a decree of judicial separation it may declare either spouse to be unfit to have custody of any dependent child of the family.</P>
    <P>The importance of this arises, and may currently be very topical, where a parent has been deemed unfit because there may be strong reason to believe that that parent has been subjecting the child to sexual abuse.  Under present law it is possible that if the spouse who has been given custody in a situation where the other spouse has been deemed unfit to be a guardian should die, the infant or child could revert to the care of the other spouse.  Under this section if the court is satisfied about allegations of unfitness it can make other arrangements.  This, I believe &mdash; and this was agreed in the other House and in Committee &mdash; was seen as an important change.</P>
    <P>Sections 42 and 43 are technical amendments.  Section 44 is slightly convoluted. It states that collusion between the spouses when applying for a judicial separation, except when an application for a decree of judicial separation is made on the ground of adultery and the respondent proves that the adultery was committed with the connivance of the applicant, or any conduct, including condonation or recrimination, shall not be a bar to the grant of a decree of judicial separation.</P>
    <P>Section 45 comes back to a point mentioned already, that is, the simplifying of procedures, the introduction of a greater note of informality and in general taking much of the terror out of the courts as far as the hearing of these cases are concerned. Many of us would agree that the trappings of our courts do not sit well on <Col N="338" /> a republican country, that many of the trappings in our courts &mdash; the wigs and the gowns and the forced formality, this need to dress up the majesty of the law in these ways &mdash; are something which we have taken perhaps too literally from an earlier régime in this country.  Most of us would perhaps like to see the simplifying of procedures and the taking away of many of these outdated trappings in all our courts.  Certainly, in this Bill, if and when it is passed, the family courts will have none of these trappings and these fearful symbols which are so out of place in courts of this kind.</P>
    <P>Section 46 is simply the short title of the Bill.</P>
    <P>This then is the Bill which we are bringing before you to-day.  It is designed to meet certain very well documented needs.  It is based on very detailed research and experience.  It has the support of the vast majority of people inside and outside this House.  Churches, caring agencies, welfare groups have all welcomed it.  No significant voice or group has opposed this legislation.  It is not divorce by the back door, nor is it going to open any floodgates and cause marriages to break up.  What it will do is alleviate some instances of hardship; it will simplify and humanise procedures which are often outdated and less than fully human. It will make what is always a traumatic and difficult experience somewhat less traumatic and somewhat less difficult.  It will eliminate unnecessary cost, it will eliminate some hassle and some expense and, most of all, it will allow very many people the opportunity to rebuild shattered lives with some hope and some decency.  It is a good Bill, it is an important Bill and it gives me great pleasure to commend it to the house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden) Terry Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, may I say that the Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, is unavoidably absent today and he has asked me to speak on his behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are happy to support this Bill.  The Bill has by now a history of its own.  There were serious differences in the debates in the other House but I <Col N="339" /> am glad to say that following concerted efforts from both sides those matters were resolved and important changes have been made on an agreed basis.  I am satisfied that the Bill as it now stands gives the best possible protection and financial security to spouses and dependent children in judicial separation proceedings.</P>
    <P>That there is a need for reform of our separation laws is agreed by all.  The Law Reform Commission and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown made recommendations on the matter and the previous Government stated their intention to implement certain changes.  There was a specific commitment in the Fianna Fáil <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and indeed when this Private Member's Bill was introduced the Minister's own proposals for legislation were already at an advanced stage of preparation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a very impressive record of legislation in the Dáil and Seanad.  From the start, therefore, he made it clear that the Government had no hesitation in supporting the principle of the Bill but, at the same time, he expressed concern in relation to a number of its provisions which seemed to him to require amendment.  The Bill now meets all of these concerns and I intend, therefore, to confine my comments on behalf of the Minister to a few general remarks about the Bill as it stands.</P>
    <P>You will no doubt appreciate that when spouses wish to formally separate they normally do so by deed of separation &mdash; in other words, they work out mutually acceptable arrangements regarding, for example, custody of children, maintenance, rights of succession, the family home and property in general.  In some cases separated or separating couples will, if necessary, have availed of mediation to help them to negotiate their separation terms.</P>
    <P>There are obvious advantages in agreeing a separation without involving the courts: it is obviously less costly and it ensures the minimum of distress or bitterness.  Court proceedings on the <Col N="340" /> other hand are a last resort, that is, where the spouses cannot agree the terms of a separation.  This Bill makes better provision than at present for spouses in that position.</P>
    <P>The importance of the Bill is that it provides for an extension of the grounds for a decree of judicial separation; it empowers the court to make various financial and property orders that it could not make heretofore in separation proceedings; and it makes provision for more informal hearings and the use of counselling and mediation services.</P>
    <P>The new grounds for obtaining a decree of judicial separation will, in effect, be desertion, separation and breakdown of marriage.  The existing ground of adultery remains and, while unreasonable behaviour is ostensibly a new ground, in effect it will replace the old ground of cruelty and unnatural practices in less emotive terms.</P>
    <P>I have just a few comments to make on the new grounds.  It will probably come as a surprise to some that desertion, which includes constructive desertion, is not a ground at present.  Desertion involves the direct repudiation of a marriage and on any view is a long overdue ground for a decree.  The ground of breakdown of marriage was recommended by the Law Reform Commission in its report on judicial separation.  Before granting a decree on this basis the court must be satisfied that the marriage has broken down to the extent that in all the circumstances a normal marital relationship has not existed for at least a year.  The phrase &ldquo;a normal marital relationship&rdquo; will present no difficulties to the courts because it is already in common usage in case law in the family law area.  It is used to describe the essential obligations of marriage and relates to the duties, responsibilities and indeed benefits of the marriage state.</P>
    <P>The position of children is safeguarded in section 3 of the Bill which provides that before granting a decree of judicial separation the court must be satisfied that the arrangements made for the welfare <Col N="341" /> of each child are proper in all the circumstances. This is an important provision in that it will entail the court looking at the arrangements being made for the children, if any, whether or not the parents desire it to do so.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that most couples who separate do so under a deed of separation without the need to engage in court proceedings.  With this in mind section 5 and 6 of the Bill place an onus on the legal representatives of the spouses in separation proceedings to make them aware of the alternatives to court proceedings, that is, counselling, mediation or, if necessary, a deed of separation. Other useful provisions in this regard are contained in section 7 under which the court must consider the possibility of a reconciliation between the spouses or, in the alternative, mediation leading to an agreed separation and the court will have discretion to adjourn the separation proceedings for these purposes.  The important point to note about counselling or mediation is that it is regarded in the Bill as primarily a matter for the parties to decide on; there is no question of any compulsion involved and if it were to be otherwise it would destroy the essential voluntary nature of participation by parties in the counselling and mediation process.</P>
    <P>The powers which the court have at present to make ancillary orders in separation proceedings are very limited.  The court has no general legislative power to order the transfer of property between the spouses.  As regards alimony it can make an order in support of a wife but not a husband and it has no power to award a separate sum for the support of any children.  An application for maintenance can be made by either spouse under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976 but the order that is made for the support of a spouse and any dependent children of the family is based on a failure to maintain and that circumstances may not exist in all separation proceedings.</P>
    <P>The Bill has none of those limitations. In future the court will have a range of powers available to it to order financial <Col N="342" /> provision and security for a spouse and dependent children.  The court will be empowered to order maintenance, as well as secured maintenance &mdash; which could continue after the death of the other spouse &mdash; to order lump sums, to order the transfer of property or to order that the wife may occupy the family home for life.  The court will also have express powers to order the sale of property.  The power to order a sale of property will be important whenever the court makes a lump sum, transfer of property or secured periodical payments order, that is to say, whenever it makes an order which involves capital assets.</P>
    <P>Section 20 sets out the considerations to which the court must have regard when making financial and property orders and it specifically imposes a duty on the court to exercise those powers in a manner which shall seek to ensure that such provision is made for any spouse and for any dependent children as is adequate and reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the case.  Under the same section the wife's contribution to the family finances and to caring for the family will be taken into account by the court when making financial provision for her following a separation decree.</P>
    <P>In deciding whether to make financial provision for a spouse, the general rule regarding conduct in section 20 is that the court will be required to take the conduct of a spouse into account if that conduct is such that in the opinion of the court it would in all the circumstances be repugnant to justice to disregard it.  Specific provision is made in the section regarding desertion as a bar to orders for financial provision.  However, the rule is not inflexible because the court may, notwithstanding the desertion, order financial provision if it is of opinion that it would be repugnant to justice not to do so.  This takes account, therefore, of the situation whereby a spouse although held to be in desertion is not altogether to blame for that desertion.  Section 38 of the Bill provides for similar new rules of conduct in relation to maintenance <Col N="343" /> generally under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976.</P>
    <P>These are safeguards in the Bill against transactions intended to defeat a spouse's claim for financial relief.  These make void transactions intended to frustrate the making of financial relief orders &mdash; or reduce the amount that otherwise would be available &mdash; in respect of spouses and children.</P>
    <P>As regards succession rights, the Bill now ensures that a court may end those rights only when it is satisfied that permanent provision has been made for a spouse, whether on or after the granting of a decree or on grounds of conduct.  In some cases permanent provision may not be required, for example, where both couples are young and childless or where a spouse is not a dependent spouse in which case the court could also end succession rights.</P>
    <P>These are the main provisions in the Bill as amended which I welcome.  As I said at the outset, I have pleasure in supporting the Bill and I commend it to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Manning, I am very pleased to welcome this legislation. I attended the open committee meetings when the special committee was meeting and sat in on the debate and consideration of the Bill.  Unfortunately, I must have selected the worst days for going because it seemed to be one long harangue whenever I went there.  It was like a tennis match, with the ball going back and forth to different sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In welcoming this Bill I am aware that its gestation began almost four years ago: in fact, that was the date of the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown, it having been set up on 12 July 1983.  This indicates the time-span that can be needed to examine, debate an initiate legislation in this very important area of family law.  Perhaps it should not have taken so long but the reality is, as we so well know, that this area of legislation is fraught with division, disagreement and argument.  It indicates <Col N="344" /> also the great need for all-party agreement on areas like this.</P>
    <P>Nothing can be done, or at least very little can be done, if both sides in both chambers tend to take critical opposing positions &mdash; very often bitter opposing positions &mdash; on proposals for change in such vital human areas of legislation. Given our experience of this and other social legislation, we need an all-party committee on legislation, specifically to create a forum to prepare legislative proposals that can get support on the floor of the House and maximum amount of debate.</P>
    <P>This Bill, and others like it, cannot be brought in without a great deal of consultation, negotiation and an attempt to meet the concerns or fears of specific groups.  An all-party committee could hear evidence, take submissions and propose directions in a number of areas.  At present we still have to bring in legislation on nullity, child abuse, age of marriage, joint ownership of the family home, to mention just a few topics.  All of these areas would benefit greatly from having treatment first in an all-party committee on legislation.</P>
    <P>After the four years of the all-party committee and their report we have a Bill and it is a very good Bill.  It is not the original one which was first put before the Dáil but it is better.  I am very happy this is agreed legislation, the result of consensus, because I do not believe that any one person, group or party has a monopoly on wisdom and the objective of parliamentarians should be to use the combined wisdom, talents and experiences in both Houses for the common good.  I hope this will be the first of many Bills brought forward in this area with agreement.  Indeed, it may be a case of making a virtue out of necessity, with a minority Government providing in the long run a positive legislative programme in conjunction with, and in many cases initiated by the Opposition parties, and with the active participation of people in those parties.</P>
    <P>I am a former Dáil constituency colleague of Deputy Shatter, the initiator of this Bill, and he is to be congratulated <Col N="345" /> on his achievement.  Indeed, I regret the Minister lacked the generosity to mention his name in the speech: perhaps it was an oversight.  Alan Shatter is somebody I have known for a long time, long before both of us went into politics, and we ran campaigns in tandem on the whole area of family law reform way back in the seventies before we had the three main pieces of legislation that were introduced at that time.  His commitment to this matter stretches very far back before he became a TD.  Having said that, I have also to commend the Minister for Justice Deputy Collins.  He has given a lead also in this area.  He could have held firm, he could have refused to allow the Bill to proceed, he could have used various political tactics to block it and then just sat back and waited for the dust to settle, and I suppose inevitably it would have done.  I am happy he did not do that and I appreciate his position in this respect.</P>
    <P>It was most regrettable that some of the disagreement during the debate on this legislation surfaced in the letters page of <i>The Irish Times</i>.  It was very convoluted technical stuff in those letters and I do not think it will have swayed opinion in any way.  It achieved little except to confuse people even more than they were confused about the very technical area of family law.  I do not want to dwell on it and I certainly do not want to labour the point but it seemed to relate to the word &ldquo;irretrievable&rdquo; Thankfully, the matter has been resolved in the Bill before us and, as I said, we need not re-run the old arguments.</P>
    <P>Prior to entering politics, my background was much involved with the need for reform of family law with AIM group, a voluntary organisation which helped then, and still does help through its women's centre, women with marital problems.  I know the great need there is for the provisions of this Bill.  Again and again, women whom I met in the centre found to their total disbelief that although their marriages had deteriorated to an intolerable degree they could not separate legally.  A separation under current law is only possible if the other spouse commits adultery, is guilty of unnatural <Col N="346" /> practices or cruelty.  Many of the thousands of wives and husbands in broken marriages want the possibility of obtaining a legal separation.  They want it to have judicial recognition of the fact of the breakdown or separation.</P>
    <P>Indeed, many thousands of women getting deserted wives' allowance, because their marriages have broken down, are recognised as having a broken marriage by the Department of Social Welfare for the purposes of the payment but cannot get judicial recognition for that fact.  This Bill will change all of that, opening up possibilities for both parties to a broken marriage in many different circumstances.  I am confident that in obtaining a decree under the new Bill lawyers will no longer need to identify one or other of the spouses as solely to blame for the breakdown and this is one of the most important achievements of the Bill.  This practice has in the past put down such a bitter foundation for the separated family that normal relationships have proved impossible.  Unfortunately, it is very often the children who have borne the brunt of this bitterness and antipathy.</P>
    <P>I welcome particularly the proposals in Part III on court jurisdictions.  We have waited a long time for the provisions in section 33.  Nobody operating in the social and legal area of family law will be anything but pleased with these changes.  I trust this will lead to the establishment of a legal sector that recognises the need for vital back-up services working in cooperation with the courts.</P>
    <P>It is indeed good to see in the Bill the provision to ensure that couples presenting for a separation decree are made aware of reconciliation proceedings as in sections 5, 6, 7 and 8 and that certification is required.  Again, I was interested in the Minister's speech in that he has mentioned several times the matter of reconciliation and mediation.  One tends to be cynical about the operation of such a process as certification in this instance.  It could become an empty format unless it is monitored, assessed and reassessed.  I hope that given the cost factor for legal fees, which I will speak about later, it will <Col N="347" /> not lead to a situation, now practised by one leading firm of solicitors, where clients who show an income of £20,000 or more, get legal action and get the service of the solicitor but persons on less than £20,000 are despatched off to the mediation service and it is deemed to be more suitable for them.  I am not suggesting that it is directly because they have less income but that is the way it seems to be working.  Of course, the mediation service &mdash; the pilot scheme &mdash; through the Department of Justice is now free.</P>
    <P>Most people know my vested interest in this area.  In 1986 I set up a three-year pilot scheme of mediation which has run very successfully in that time and is due to finish and report in September next. At the time it was set up in 1986 there was very strong opposition to the move. Many critics said it would be too limited a scheme, that there would not be enough resources for it and just to forget about it while others said there was no need for it at all and that people would not use it. I have to say that at that time my success in achieving the establishment of the scheme was due directly to the commitment and support of the Taoiseach at that time, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, who understood what I was attempting to do and gave me all the backing I needed. There were many very keen, dedicated people in Ireland who saw it as the most relevant way forward for couples in marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>It operates only for people who acknowledge that their marriage is at an end.  They then go in agreement together for mediation and with a trained mediator negotiate and agree on conditions for their separated state, on maintenance, property and their children.  This scheme must be secured.  When it was initiated and set up first there was no immediate sign that there was going to be legislation as firm and definite as this Bill.  I hope the Minister will now take the practical, long-term view and plan for its expansion and its extension in the same or similar form as it is in now.  There is no doubt it has proved itself; it has brought harmony <Col N="348" /> and agreement into the area of marital breakdown with very good spin-off effects for all but particularly for the children.</P>
    <P>Marriage breakdown is a tragedy.  A family going to live their separate lives a distressing thing to see but it can be made more bearable and more agreeable through mediation skills.  I am pleased that due to foresight and perseverence at the time the mediation scheme was established it is now in operation and its continued operation will be essential for the working of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like to propose an elaboration of section 5 with regard to the provision of mediation.  It should be available on a means test, as is free legal aid.  This is something about which many people have expressed a view and a concern.  We have to address it now and set down a marker for what will happen in the future when the Bill is in operation.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Bill and all its provisions, I am deeply concerned about the costs involved.  I sympathise with those who wanted to have these actions brought to District Court level but they were not considering the total implications of the matter and the big risk would have been that the quality of the justice would suffer because of lower cost.  Of that I am quite convinced.  At present the legal costs in family law cases are horrendous and we cannot just turn a deaf ear and a blind eye to them.  Of course, lawyers are entitled to a fair and just financial return for their work, but can they justify the extraordinarily high charges?</P>
    <P>This particularly hits wives, women who have devoted their lives to their homes and their children, and who have not any independent means of income. When they come to seek legal aid &mdash; and more and more of them will seek legal aid under this Bill when passed &mdash; they are in a position that the only money they can call their own is the children's allowance money.  I hope that is not under threat as we believed it was earlier in the year.  How can they go independently and seek to have a separation decree on the basis of that?  Many of these women get <Col N="349" /> into intolerable debt to pay the legal costs, some even on or before the first consultation as many solicitors seek a substantial down payment and will not move on legal action until they see the cheque.</P>
    <P>This question has to be addressed.  It is fundamental to the introduction of this legislation.  Otherwise, we could be creating a law for the rich and none for the poor.  There will be a deep and profound opposition if this legislation, when passed, is outside the reach of the majority of people.  Perhaps we should look at the establishment of the new family court and keep in mind that it will mean substantially increased business for solicitors involved in family law and perhaps a scale of fees might be drawn up or looked at in that context.</P>
    <P>Finally, one of the most important results of this legislation could be that when in place with the new courts structure, its effectiveness, its deliberations and its success will hold up a mirror to Irish society because it will be possible to assess and identify the widespread problems of marriage breakdown.  The inevitability of the need for divorce legislation will emerge.  At the present time we have a devastating array of solutions to broken marriages where married people no longer live together.  Some have church annulments and second church marriages, some have legal annulments and second marriages, while others have foreign divorces, many of which are not worth the paper they are written on, and are remarried abroad.  Very few of these couples are fully aware of their standing in law.  The sad reality is that in most cases their new unions have no legal status or legal protection.</P>
    <P>More than anything else, we now need some form of statistical information and a research facility to ascertain the extent of the problem, which will give clear facts on different forms of separation on what is happening to families in this country, on second unions and the status or the value of marriages after an annulment here or a foreign divorce is recognised here or whatever.  The welfare of the <Col N="350" /> family is vital and the difficulties experienced by family members in a marriage breakdown can cause widespread unhappiness and depression.</P>
    <P>Profound change is happening within the family unit and we need to understand this change.  Therefore, we need to identify the difficulties and the policy changes required.  The Bill before us is a very fundamental part of that change.  I look forward to discussing it in more detail on Committee Stage.  I welcome the Bill and wish it a good passage through the Seanad.</P>

      <P>The initial reaction to the arrival of this Bill in the House must be one of relief.  During the protracted and often tortuous negotiations it seemed as if agreement was to elude the parties involved.  For many estranged couples viewing the process it must have added to the unhappiness of their lives and that of their children.</P>
      <P>When one sees the comprehensive provisions and modern framework of the Bill the two principal negotiators, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, and Deputy Shatter, are to be complimented on the product of their discussions.</P>
      <P>I am particularly pleased that the Bill encourages reconciliation in a formal way.  This principle is one towards which all Irish people would aspire.  Up to now it has been the regrettable experience that the judicial system to a large degree has discouraged the parties to a marital dispute from seeking a reconciliation. Frequently legal advisers are constrained to advise such parties not to seek a reconciliation because to do so at certain stages in the proceedings would, in their view, prevent them from obtaining their legal rights for which they enlisted the help of professionals.  It is heartening to see that the Bill seeks to remove the old conflict which existed and puts in its place more humane provisions which facilitate those couples whose marriages could be saved with a bit of effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I adverted earlier to the negotiations which took place.  It is indeed satisfactory to observe that these led to some necessary amendments to the original Bill.  Of <Col N="351" /> particular significance is the agreement on providing protection for children.  As many Members will know, children suffer most in many cases of marital difficulty. For a Bill such as this, which provides a code for separation relevant to the modern age, to have omitted such provisions would have been little short of tragic.  The Minister's concern that the position be certified is to be commended.</P>
    <P>Comment must be made on the sections dealing with succession rights. Prior to consultation, a court would have been compelled to decide at the time of the granting of a decree whether adequate financial provision could be made for a dependent spouse and, consequently, whether it should end succession rights.  The implication of this would have been that the court was prevented from making better provisions for a spouse at a future date.  Even more disturbing was the likelihood that a husband would normally have kept his succession rights when a wife would have lost hers.  Given the vulnerable economic position of many women in Irish society, the inadvisibility and inequity of this state of affairs are evident.</P>
    <P>Under the amended version of the Bill, there are three cases in which succession rights will be ended by a court: (a) when it is satisfied that permanent provision has been made for a spouse; (b) where a spouse is not a dependent spouse or permanent provision is not required; (c) where the conduct of a spouse is repugnant to justice.  These new conditions take account of the economic reality of today.  Especially in difficult times, it is a hallmark of a just society that the best possible financial security is given to dependent spouses.  In addition to a failed marriage, the future of a person should not be dogged by deprivation.</P>
    <P>Attempts were made in the Dáil to give jurisdiction to the District Court to deal with marriage breakdown. While one has sympathy for those who find it difficult to afford legal fees, one must be careful lest the effectiveness of the Bill may be undermined by attempts to alleviate such <Col N="352" /> problems.  Frequently a principal reason for going to court in cases of marital breakdown is a concern for property. Should jurisdiction be given to the District Court in relation to this area it would introduce a new departure of questionable desirability.  The decision not to give the District Court this jurisdiction was a wise one.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a timely and valuable addition to the family law legislation of the State.  It provides in a rational and humane manner for the plight of those whose misfortune it is to be locked into a failed relationship.  I wish the Bill a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party welcome this Bill although we have a few reservations about it.  I will deal with those by way of amendment on Committee Stage.  I commend the mover of this Bill, Deputy Shatter, and compliment him on the painstaking efforts he put into compiling this legislation which got the agreement of the Government who were inactive in this area.  I am glad that Deputy Shatter used the procedure to have this Bill recommitted when it was obvious that the relationship between himself and the Minister for Justice was at the stage of irretrievable breakdown. It is appropriate also to put on the record that this House on several occasions last year used the same procedure to recommit a Bill to allow for further debate and amendments.</P>
      <P>It is welcome that political parties in Opposition have a facility through the legislative process to bring legislation before the Houses.  That prompted my question this morning.  If another political party in another place who do not have Members here had Private Members' Bills passed through the other House they would die a sudden death because there would be no procedure available to them to follow the Bill through to this House which they consider to be an unnecessary part of the legislative process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not often we have the opportunity to welcome Private Members' Bills in the House.  It is also appropriate to put on record that recent statements from the <Col N="353" /> Government side which refuted the rights of other people to bring forward legislation were questioned and that accusation has for once been put to rest.  On many occasions, my colleague Senator Brendan Ryan has made efforts, as an Independent Member of this House, to bring forward legislation.  He may not have been successful but I respectfully suggest that his efforts stirred into action not only this Government but previous Governments to bring in legislation in the areas in which he had an interest.  That is what Deputy Shatter has done in this area: he has stirred the Government to act in an area where they were dragging their feet.</P>
    <P>We had a referendum which addressed the problems of marital breakdown, irretrievable breakdown of marriage and all the other family problems that are rampant today.  Those of us in political life who meet on a weekly basis, an ever-growing number of people in these circumstances realise that the State has an obligation, through the legislation process, to address the problems of broken marriages.  We would wish that it did not arise in a Christian country but every week we are confronted with this problem.</P>
    <P>One must ask what function members of parties have in the area of marital breakdown.  It would be expected that legislation, marriage counsellors or social workers should deal with it but, for some reason, people come to politicians to discuss the implications of marriage breakdown. These normally transpire to be of a financial nature because usually the husband has reneged on his responsibilities, leaving a wife and family with no obvious means of support.  Sometimes he has disappeared out of the jurisdiction and leaves his family penniless.  We then have to bring the offices of the State into play to support them by way of payment for deserted wives and also supplementary welfare payments to tide them over their difficulties.</P>
    <P>There are other problems where the husband through his behaviour makes it impossible for the wife to remain in the house.  She is forced onto the housing <Col N="354" /> lists of local authorities who are trying to come to grips with the situation.  At times they are faced with housing both the husband and wife in certain areas.  That is an extraordinary situation but it is one we hear about on a weekly basis.  We are living in cloud-cuckoo land if we do not accept that there is a problem.  It does not give me any pleasure to put that on the record of the House but it is a problem we must face.</P>
    <P>Welcome and important as the Bill is, the benefits under it will be beyond the reach of many of the people I talk about. Many of the people in the social welfare categories whom I represent do not have the facility or the financial ability to go through the legal procedure outlined in this legislation.  A conservative estimate of the cost is between £1,500 to £2,500 to go through this procedure in a court hearing for a day.  How many people who are so unfortunate as to have a broken marriage or a marriage in difficulty and who need to address the problem can afford to do this?</P>
    <P>This point was touched on with a certain degree of knowledge and sympathy by Senator Fennell.  We have problems in that regard because from what has been communicated to us by professionals in the field there is no way, given the present funding of the Legal Aid Board, they can take on board the additional demands that will be made on them.</P>
    <P>I will quote from the Legal Aid Board Annual report of 1986 which is now almost out of date but the sentiments are still very relevant.  I quote from page 16, section 8.1 where they refer to law reform and the effects on the legal aid system. They quote the final paragraph of the board's last report which stated:</P>
    <P>The recently-announced intention of the Minister for Justice to reform family law is most welcome...  The Board has to make the point, however, that reform of family law will, unfortunately, not be of very much benefit or relevance to a great many people unless, at the same time, a serious commitment is made to provide adequate <Col N="355" /> staff and adequate funds for the expansion of the legal aid service.  Unless the necessary resources are provided, the Board will be unable to make... effective access to legal aid services available to those who need them.</P>
    <P>In section 8 (2) they point out that:</P>
    <P>The central point &mdash; that law reform, especially family law reform, has an impact on legal aid &mdash; needs to be emphasised again.  If the reforms of family law currently before the Oireachtas are enacted, there is no doubt that many people &mdash; perhaps thousands &mdash; will seek legal aid to avail themselves of the new provisions; and there is no doubt either that, without additional resources, the Board will be unable to meet their needs.  There is already a queue for legal services; the anticipated demand likely to be produced by the proposed legislation will lengthen this queue to an extent that will make its anticipated advantages illusory for a great many people.</P>
    <P>That is a statement from people who deal with those who cannot afford the facility of employing a barrister to represent them in court.  In this year's Estimates, as passed in the Dáil, the allocation for the Free Legal Aid Board was reduced by almost £2 million.  We must address this problem.  We are doing an injustice to those who cannot afford to avail of the structure we set up unless we address the problem and ensure that free legal aid is available to them or that their case can be heard at District Court level.</P>
    <P>The thrust of the Bill is important. While it would be unfair to criticise the terms and conditions laid down in the Bill, particularly those relating to maintenance and payments, unfortunately our experience in this area is that irrespective of what agreements are made in court or registered by courts requiring one spouse to maintain the other and also to maintain their children by way either of lump sum payments or continuing payments, the numbers who default on these agreements are extensive.  Anybody who deals <Col N="356" /> with people on social welfare incomes knows they are unable to meet the requirements laid down by district justices and justices in family law courts.  We have a problem in that the State, to a limited extent, will provide the legal machinery and the legal structures and the court will make decisions but court decisions have proved in the past to be extremely difficult to enforce, particularly where the spouse leaves the jurisdiction. Perhaps with the equalising of taxes in 1992 and the implications for all the countries involved Governments will ensure that those who are dependent on maintenance will not go hungry and will not be forced, as they are now, resort to begging for supplementary welfare.</P>
    <P>There is no point in setting up a grandiose system of legal processes unless we can enforce the findings of the courts and unless we can ensure that applicants have the fullest access to the courts.  I have expressed our reservations about the ability of people to do this.  Justice has to be seen to be done and it has to be capable of being implemented and availed of by everybody irrespective of their family means.  Surely in a Christian country that professes to help women and children, we cannot allow ourselves to treat some sections of society differently from others; we cannot have access to justice based solely on ability or means to pay.</P>
    <P>To a large extent, many people who are suffering at present from marital breakdown are on social welfare benefit, where unemployment possibly contributed initially to the breakdown of the relationship and the marriage.  I suppose ten or 15 years ago none of us would listen to the possibility of this ever happening in Christian Ireland but it is happening and I regret it.  There are times when you feel helpless in trying to advise people which way to turn in these difficult situations. At least now we know there is a judicial process which is available, but let us be honest and try to make it available at a level where applicants can use it.</P>
    <P>District justices deal with these cases effectively and compassionately.  Every month and week in rural Ireland where there are family courts and District <Col N="357" /> Courts, justices are competent, capable and compassionate in dealing with applications for maintenance, barring orders and so on.  They are already dealing with such cases.  We realise you cannot apply the rule of thumb to all applicants but if the process was available at District Court level for £15 or less it would be possible for people to make a personal application to the court and get the fullest co-operation at that level.</P>
    <P>The problems of legal separations &mdash; arranging terms concerning the home, who is responsible for the children and all the other processes &mdash; are being addressed in an expert way at district justice level.  I do not feel there is any danger to the concept of the Bill by having cases heard in a lower level of court.  It certainly would make it financially accessible to the people about whom I am concerned.  There is nothing worse than knowing there is a law of which only the rich can avail.  That creates a sense of isolation for people who are already trying to come to grips with the fact that their family unit has broken up, their marriage has broken down, their children are left without a father and all the other dreadful things that happen when a marriage breaks down.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation but I ask the Minister to seriously consider the points that have been made, not alone in this House but in the other House by the Labour spokesperson on Justice, Deputy Taylor, who dealt with this problem but who did not get the type of support we hoped he would get.  Perhaps in the meantime the Minister for Justice, the Government and the Attorney General's Office will deal with the concerns we have expressed either by adequately funding the Legal Aid Board or by having certain cases heard at District Court level.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in general and congratulate Deputy Shatter on his efforts in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to welcome the Bill.  It has developed a particular history of its own. Many people who care deeply about reform in this area held their breath over <Col N="358" /> a period of almost one year while this Bill wound its way between the Dáil, a special select committee, back into the Dáil and back into a special committee again.  It is with a sense of great relief and pleasure that I welcome it into the Seanad and also the opportunity to speak briefly on it.  I imagine that on Committee Stage there will be a more detailed exposition of the different facets of the Bill.  As somebody who sat for a lengthy period on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown I look forward to that type of detailed assessment in due course.</P>
      <P>This legislation will have a profound effect on the thousands of people who are locked into marriages that are dead in all but name and who need an adequate legal redress to enable them to cope with their difficulties.  By and large, the Irish Legislature has not served these people well.  A situation of hypocrisy and pretence has been forced on people who would have had recourse to the legislation had it been sufficiently adequate to meet their needs.  This type of progressive enlightened legislation is just the kind of measure which is needed to give these people the sort of legal status their situation demands.</P>
      <P>The genesis of the Bill is in the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown which reported on 27 March 1985, almost four years ago.  I cannot help but feel a sense of frustration at the length of time it has taken for legislation to emerge as a result of all the consultation and deliberation which went on in that period.  Contrary perhaps to popular belief, that all-party committee did not merely address itself to the question of divorce which has been momentarily put on hold in Irish society but, in fact, it examined every single facet of marital breakdown and brought forward a great deal of most important and significant recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I warmly congratulate my colleague, Deputy Shatter, on having the tenacity and the single-minded vision to pursue the important recommendation of the all-party committee and to be the instigator and author of this Bill.  For him, what has <Col N="359" /> happened has been a personal triumph and it is important that that fact be put firmly on the record of this House.  It is the first time in over 30 years that a Private Members' Bill put forward by an Opposition Deputy has been passed.  I am confident that it will have a speedy passage through the House and it will be on the Statute Book very shortly.</P>
    <P>What is on offer today in this legislation is a modern framework for separation laws.  It is a major step forward in enlightened, progressive, and indeed sensitive social legislation.  Without wishing to unduly politicise the issue, I state quite firmly and categorically, and the record proves the fact, that Fine Gael are a party who are progressive and enlightened in the area of social legislation.  They have given witness to that over and over again and have received enormous support from the electorate by virtue of that fact. They will continue to do so because in this area we lead.  We give the lead and have brought forward important and significant measures.</P>
    <P>There is another ample illustration of that here today in the House, witnessed by the fact that we on the Fine Gael side of the House have speakers who are prepared to come into the House and speak compassionately on this Bill and address the issue.  Without wishing to be churlish in any sense I cannot but express a certain feeling of unease, disappointment and dismay to see so few people on the Government side and to see that there are not more people willing to participate in this debate, to make known their views as to the importance of this legislation and the need to have remedies on our Statute Book which adequately address the problem of judicial separation.  It proves the fact that there is a certain unwillingness in the Fianna Fáil Party to deal adequately with&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but there is such a void there that I could not but make some comment on it.  The aim of the Bill is to provide a civilised and non-confrontational way out for couples who are obliged to have recourse to the law to sort out their difficulties and to disengage from a failed marriage.  For couples who find themselves in this predicament, the situation must be extremely painful indeed.  There is not a person who has not got experience of friends, family or personal experience of coping with this situation.  It is facing a sort of death in a way because it is the death of hopes, dreams, ambitions, aspirations and the death of a certain phase in one's life.  To come up against an unfeeling legislature in this area or an inadequate one is just the last straw altogether.  This has been the experience of so many people who have found themselves in interminable and painful courtroom wrangles in order, in a civilised and meaningful fashion, to bring about an end to a failed entity.</P>
      <P>This Bill allows the granting of a separation order by the courts after a normal marital relationship has ceased to exist for at least one year.  The law cannot ignore the fact that marriages in Ireland are breaking down on a daily basis.  We may wish it to be otherwise but that is beside the point.  Couples are separating and they are forming new relationships and, indeed, often second families.  We have a great deal to do in this area in bringing forward reasonable responsive legislation which meets the requirements of the electorate and indeed the citizens of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people who have spoken have attempted to analyse the reasons why there should be so much marital breakdown in the country.  Most people's views are, largely speaking, impressionistic because there has been very little real research of any substance carried out and very little collation of information and statistical evidence which would help us to frame preventive measures and also measures to cope and deal appropriately with the problem which all of us recognise. We are all long on description and on impressionistic analysis but short on <Col N="361" /> statistical hard evidence which would help us to analyse the problem and address it competently.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will indicate that this measure has acted in some way as a spur to Government to bring forward more measures in the area of legislative reform as it affects marriage.  So much needs to be done and a lot of it is fairly straightforward and simple.  For instance, legislation in the area of the minimum age for marriage does not strike me as being something that would cause the kind of extraordinary prevarication and difficulty with which this legislative measure engendered.  Everybody has agreed &mdash; the Law Reform Commission, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown and all independent commentators &mdash; that the minimum legal age for marriage, which is now 16, should be addressed urgently.  I hope that a simple measure on that is something that Government can deal with.</P>
    <P>It is a pity they had to be provoked into coping with this legislation.  It is yet another example where if only the Government could realise that in some areas a decent working consensus can be arrived at, given their minority position and that the fruits of that could be good legislation, which in this case &mdash; due to the staying power of Deputy Shatter &mdash; has been the case.  In his absence I compliment the Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins who eventually co-operated, when they hammered out together a useful consensus which will bring so much relief to so many people.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on the elements of reconciliation and mediation which are contained in the Bill.  I wonder if the Minister, in his reply would indicate whether further funding will be forthcoming from his Department for reconciliation and mediation services.  When some people speak, there appears to be a certain confusion between the two services. It is important to recognise that some people will benefit from reconciliation services.  They will be enabled to see their problems in a more objective and dispassionate way, perhaps seeing possible solutions which will affect the <Col N="362" /> patching-up and/or possibility of their marriage remaining intact.  Others will need the assistance of an experienced mediator who will help them analyse their problems a mediator who can assess the needs of the husband and wife and, what must never be overlooked, those of the children who find themselves willy-nilly in circumstances in which their security is being threatened and their family unit undergoing a dramatic change.  I do not think the Minister should stint at all in this regard.</P>
    <P>From the very beginning, there should be liaison between many Ministers in this area.  I would put in the front line the Miinster for Education because education in relationships cannot begin early enough.  Ideally, it begins in the family. Children learn from observation in their homes how relationships work or do not work, what can go wrong within a relationship, they absorb it through their very pores.  All of us who have grown up in families know that what I say is so.  In primary schools, following through into secondary schools, there should certainly be an element in our education system which affirms the values to which we all subscribe, values which put a premium on love, cherishing, caring and nurturing. These values should be upheld for our children and before them.  Should problems arise in these areas, then ways of coping with them should be suggested. There should be a lot of debate, discussion and examination of relationships in our schools system at primary and secondary level.  I stress that it is not too early to begin at primary level.</P>
    <P>That being said, my comments are more general than specific.  I look forward to Committee Stage when we can question the Minister and tease out various aspects.  We on this side of the House fully support the Bill.  Nonetheless it is useful to question and seek clarification on its different aspects.  I hope the Minister can indicate when he expects this Bill to be enacted.  Many people are awaiting its enactment before pursuing their family cases through the court and would like to feel that its provisions will be available to them.  It is important that we <Col N="363" /> be given a clear indication of when this Bill will be on the Statute Book.  That being said, I congratulate all concerned, particularly Deputy Shatter and the Minister who got together so that eventually this Bill saw the light of day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I should first like to repeat the last words of Senator Bulbulia and to congratulate Deputy Shatter, the Fine Gael Party and anybody who had a hand in the drafting and production of this Bill. I do not feel that so much congratulation is due to the Government side because to my mind their acceptance is reluctant and somewhat grudging.  Also, one can say it has been forced upon them.  I do not believe such a Bill would have been introduced without Opposition initiative.</P>
      <P>It is very unsatisfactory that we must have a Bill in this form because it is a compromise.  It is only another item in the long, contorted difficulties we have experienced here <i>vis-á-vis</i> marital breakdown. In essence, in spirit and in detail it is a good Bill.  It is the circumstances in which it has been introduced that I regret. Although not long in this House, this topic has presented great difficulties for all parties.  It would be much easier for all of us if this Bill were being introduced in the context of a recognition of the breakdown of marriage and the introduction and allowance of divorce in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before its introduction it was a pity the Government did not propose another referendum to delete that Article of the Constitution which prohibits divorce.  As Senator Bulbulia pointed out it could be noted without being out of order, a Leas Chathaoirligh &mdash; that those great defenders of marriage in this country, have had sufficient interest in this Bill to provide one Member only at a time to see it through.  It is significant that this Bill is something they would rather see swept under the carpet, got through and dispensed with.  While I welcome the fact that in this Bill the grounds for judicial separation have been extended to include breakdown of marriage and desertion, and while I congratulate the Opposition <Col N="364" /> on forcing it through and on acting properly in the circumstances in which they find themselves, we would not be in that position had not the Government, who were in Opposition at the time, played footsie with the Catholic Church and opposed the referendum on divorce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that this Bill has been accepted by the other House and that there has been agreement between the Government and Opposition on its main contents.  Having thoroughly read the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown and contributed to it I am all the more aware of the many difficulties people face in marriage.  Everybody enters into a marriage contract in the hope it will succeed.  Indeed, it has to be said that the majority of marriages are happy and successful but some through no fault of the partners, are not successful. Such people must be afforded some relief under the law.  I accept what Senator Ross said, that it is a pity in this country we have no provision for civil divorce.  It is my belief that in not allowing that facility we are undermining the institution of marriage itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>If we sweep the problems under the carpet, allowing people who have contracted marriages to enter into extramarital relationships and have children who have no protection under the law, then we are merely creating difficulties for ourselves in the future.  That is why I contend the absence of such a provision is an attack on the very institution of marriage.  I should like to see the civil law separate and distinct from ecclesiastical law in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill offer additional remedies to the parties to marriages that have not succeeded.  To date the law made limited facilities available to people to take proceedings whereas the provisions of this Bill augments those facilities.  While irretrievable breakdown has not been invoked, if it can be proven to a court that a marriage has failed, <Col N="365" /> people will be entitled to a decree of judicial separation under its provisions, which contain many good aspects.  I know it to be true that people whose marriages are failing do make an honest effort to have them succeed.  For instance, take the case of someone who has committed adultery which constitutes one of the grounds for a legal separation.  If the spouses are reconciled afterwards and the marriage fails at some future date that case of adultery can be held against them in the courts.  I understand that that problem has been overcome in this Bill.  That is very important.</P>
    <P>We must afford people every opportunity to come to terms with their marital problems before asking them to separate. For that reason I welcome the provisions of this Bill.  In the circumstances in which we must draft legislation it is a limited step in the right direction.  We must remember also that the referendum Senator Ross sought was put to the people and we must also bear in mind their views on the matter.  The people decided against divorce in the referendum put to them and we must acknowledge that fact.</P>
    <P>This Bill before the House is very welcome and will help to alleviate many people's problems.  Equally, its provisions will allow people who have separated, whose marriages have broken down, to behave in a civilised way, meeting and talking to each other.  That is very important for them and their children.  If its provisions encourage them to do that, then it is all the more to be welcomed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank all who contributed to the debate and the very supportive remarks of all speakers on this Bill.  The fact is that very few points of specific disagreement were raised by any speaker.  Therefore, it will be possible for me to conclude very quickly indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I have to express my sense of regret at the opening remarks of the Minister of State at the Department of Health.  He should have found it possible to have indicated some sense of the part played in all of this by Deputy Alan <Col N="366" /> Shatter.  This is a Fine Gael Private Members' Bill.  It was initiated by Deputy Shatter.  It is a Bill which has gone through a very lengthy process in the other House.  It is a Bill which has involved members of all parties, because this problem and its solution does not belong to any one political party.  All parties have participated very fully in the debate.  There has been a great deal of give and take and that give and take emphatically included the Minister for Justice.  It is regrettable that, on an occasion like this, the Minister of State did not appear to have the generosity to acknowledge the part played by Deputy Shatter in having brought this Bill through some very difficult times to the point today at which it is close to finding its way onto the Statute Book.  I have to say that Senator Cullimore was generous in his remarks.</P>
    <P>Senator Fennell drew heavily on her very considerable experience in this area because, as is well known, she was an advocate of change in this area at a time when it certainly was not popular or profitable to political reputations.  She has a very deserved reputation and her remarks certainly bear consideration. The question which she raised of legal fees and the alleged £20,000 barrier &mdash; which she claims has been set up by some members of the legal profession &mdash; is one which, regrettably, is for the legal profession.  It is a question that body should examine.  Her concern about very high legal costs in matrimonial cases would be shared by all parties in this House.  It is important that there is a monitoring procedure established to ensure that one of the main purposes of this Bill, which is to simplify the law procedures and reduce the costs, becomes a reality.</P>
    <P>Senator Fennell also made the point that the provisions of this Bill will help to identify many of the real problems. She claimed that nobody viewed this Bill as a panacea; it is a device to help people solve specific problems.  However, she felt that perhaps the problems were so great that, ultimately, the logic of having <Col N="367" /> civil divorce legislation will be unquestionable. That may well be.  Senator Ross made the same point.  My feeling is that, following the referendum last year, that question is fairly much off the political agenda for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>As somebody who spoke and campaigned for the introduction of civil divorce last year &mdash; and would do so again should the matter be on the agenda &mdash; I believe that perhaps for the moment the time is not right to put this matter back at the top of the political agenda, that more time must pass.  I suppose many of us who campaigned at that time must be forgiven a wry smile on reading the remarks of the Cardinal Primate of Armagh, Dr. Ó Fiaich as reported in the <i>Sunday Press</i> a few weeks ago to the effect that apparently he is now having second thoughts about the role he played in that matter.  When the occasion next arises perhaps we will all have learned.</P>
    <P>Senator Cullimore referred to succession rights.  Senator Ferris concentrated to some extent on what will be the substance of amendments put down by his party on Committee Stage, that is the need to extend the provisions of the Bill to the District Courts.  At this stage it may well be possible to have some discussions, as Senator Ferris suggested, between the Minister, the Attorney General and the Opposition parties to ascertain whether that point can be accommodated.  My feeling is that it has been debated exhaustively by the Special Committee and on Report Stage in the other House and that perhaps all of the arguments put there have been met.  In any event this can form the basis for some discussion between the various groups between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia expressed a sense of frustration which many people have felt at the delay in bringing the remedies which were identified four or five years ago to the stage at which they are ready to be enacted.  We have known for some time what needed to be done.  She said it is no great reflection on the Houses of the Oireachtas, and on some of the leaders there that it has taken so much time. <Col N="368" /> Senator Bulbulia also mentioned questions which I am sure the Minister &mdash; as the person responsible for the implementation of this legislation &mdash; will bear in mind, that is problems to do with funding and liaison between various ministeries.</P>
    <P>I referred to a point made by Senator Ross already, that is about this Bill being half-way legislation and contending that there is a need for full divorce legislation. I should like to conclude this stage of the debate by saying that I do not believe this Bill could be described as half-way legislation.  In the circumstances prevailing and within the limits of what was available, Deputy Shatter has produced a Bill which goes a very long way to meeting many of the current problems. It simplifies procedures, it ensures that the courts will be much more informal and it provides secrecy and privacy for those involved.  It means also they will not form part of a long series of other cases.</P>
    <P>The system also provides a whole range of new safeguards.  It is designed to cut costs, reduce delays, and avoid duplication of procedures.  It is designed to do all of these things.  As Senator Bulbulia said, it is designed to provide a proper, modern framework within which separation laws can operate in a way which helps to alleviate problems, minimise costs and reduce formality.  It also ensures that people who have been or are going through the trauma of a broken marriage and a separation are given as much help as possible in bringing matters to a speedy conclusion, ensuring that property rights are properly discharged and that the question of the care and custody of children is decided in a proper manner.  Ultimately, it allows the spouses and children an opportunity to remake their lives with some degree of peace and dignity.</P>
    <P>May I conclude by thanking all of those who participated in this debate and the Government for having made Government time available for this Private Members' Bill here today.  I believe that this Bill a milestone in the history of Irish family law reform.  It is a substantial Bill and the fact that it has come to this stage <Col N="369" /> in the form of a Private Members' Bill ultimately reflects credit an all parties and both Houses.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The particular problems facing haemophiliacs were outlined in detail last week and, consequently, I do not propose to go over that ground again.  Having said that, however, I think the two motions are welcome and represent a valuable initiative as far as this <Col N="370" /> House is concerned, not least because they provide an opportunity for discussion on the topic of AIDS, and in particular the impact on haemophiliacs. Our level of awareness should be increased all the more for that reason.</P>
      <P>AIDS is clearly a tragic disease and has the potential to reach frightening proportions on a worldwide scale.  Only a few days ago I heard a person on radio refer to the possibility that four African countries would lose half their populations in a relatively short space of time. That is a very frightening picture.  We must hope that a cure will be found and research is particularly important in that regard.  As far as Ireland is concerned, it is only a few short decades since tuberculosis was rampant in this country and was responsible for many thousands of deaths but today the situation is greatly corrected following advances in medicine. Despite the fact that AIDS is a killer disease, we must certainly hope that research will come up with solutions to the problem.</P>
      <P>Pending a solution through the avenue of research, there is the important consideration of what can be done in the educational area in the meantime.  This debate provides an opportunity for us to raise our level of awareness in relation to AIDS but there is clearly a case for a deeper understanding of the problem and a need to reduce the prejudice and the fear relating to it.  There is a need for a shift in attitudes in relation to this disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland the Haemophilia Society is deserving of a sensitive response.  I suggest that the Minister and the Minister of State have shown a caring response to date in relation to the problem and a sum of £450,000 has been allocated from lottery funds.  A sum of £50,000 has been given to the Haemophilia Society which they have chosen to use for counselling services.  Action has already been taken in the educational area which offers the possibility of deepening understanding and reducing prejudice among the population at large.  Nobody goes out to get AIDS deliberately.  Neither we in the <Col N="371" /> House nor the Minister or the Department can be in the business of apportioning blame or innocence in relation to AIDS.</P>
    <P>The Haemophilia Society have presented their case in a comprehensive, factual and moderate way and they should be complimented on that.  The society believe they have a special claim and they clearly deserve a sympathetic approach by the Members of the Seanad in the course of this debate.  As we noted last week, there are 106 Irish haemophiliacs who have been infected, of whom ten have fully-blown AIDS and six have died.  This is a sad picture.</P>
    <P>The point was made last week that patients have a right to a certain quality of help and patient care and I fully subscribe to that view.  It must be said, however, that when the State provided the necessary blood products which constituted the necessary treatment for haemophiliacs some years ago, the hazards of the treatment given at that time were unknown and, therefore, unforseen.  So the State continued to provide blood products to help haemophiliacs to maintain their health levels but they were in the dark in relation to the impact of particular treatments of plasmas at that time. The blood transfusion service responded quickly to ensure that the risk of infected blood transfusion would be removed.</P>
    <P>Haemophiliacs believe they have a special claim but this, as my objective reading of the situation shows, presents a difficulty for the Minister for Health and for the Department.  Nobody goes out to get AIDS deliberately but once the disease is contracted all are patients and that raises the question as to how the Minister can differentiate between one patient who is an haemophiliac and another who is not, or between one set of dependants and others who are not dependants.  It is true that the haemophiliacs make a special case which they have placed before us but could a special case not also be made for infants of AIDS-infected drug-addicted mothers? It seems to me that the need is to look after all affected patients.  Towards that <Col N="372" /> end a Ministerial review group on services for AIDS sufferers has been set up under the Minister of State who is in the House.  This group is concerning itself with the problems facing all AIDS sufferers. I might add that the Haemophilia Society is represented on that review group.</P>
    <P>One cannot but feel sympathetic for haemophiliacs.  In conclusion, therefore may I make an appeal first, to the Minister and then to the Haemophilia Society. I appeal to the Minister to keep the door open in relation to the claims of the Haemophilia Society and, at the same time, I also appeal to the Haemophilia Society to await the conclusions of the review group which, as I understand it, will report as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much.  I feel the case for support for the Haemophilia Society members have been very ably put.  We have had a great deal of debate here, questions in the Dáil since that debate and a lot of media coverage and discussion about it.  I think it is a case that stands on its own merits.  I believe no one can continue to say that the people who are haemophiliac and are now HIV positive or have AIDS because of contaminated blood do not deserve all the necessary support that can be given to them.  We know that in other countries financial support has been forthcoming. The Minister has from previous speeches a list of the countries and the amounts of money that were given and the latest country to join that list is Japan.  They <Col N="373" /> have recently recognised the special position of haemophiliacs who are HIV positive or AIDS sufferers.</P>
      <P>This is a case where the Taoiseach, Deputy Charles Haughey, has an opportunity to demonstrate his care and concern. Last Sunday I listened, with many other people to his RTE interview where he stressed again and again that Fianna Fáil under his leadership have a compassionate and caring philosophy and that this is the philosophy of his Government. That is very worthy and very commendable and it presupposes that he and his Government will act to relieve intense suffering.  That philosophy of care and concern needs to be demonstrated more than ever before in this debate and on the issue before us.  It is not an issue of party gain or advantage.  Members of all parties have a deep human regard for suffering.  Fianna Fáil members are no less moved by the plight of haemophiliacs, as at present described, than members of the Labour Party, Fine Gael, The Workers' Party or the Progressive Democrats.</P>
      <P>The public are expecting a positive response to this campaign.  They speak about the problem in their workplaces, in their pubs, in their clubs and in their homes and there will be public disappointment, to say the least, if no solution is arrived at.  This is not a threat, I am just stating the reality and the facts, as I see them.  We need a generous response, one that will create the machinery for speedy action for the people concerned and their families.  Unless this group get help from the Government they face a dismal future and small, inoffensive, innocent number of 100 individuals approximately will be abandoned and asked to solve their own problems without the necessary financial resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I sympathise with the position in which Senator Lanigan found himself last week and Senator Hillery this evening, defending a stance they cannot honestly agree with, I question the sensitivity of Senator Lanigan in telling haemophiliacs last week to take legal action as a solution.  He must know the tedious and difficult course that entails.  It can <Col N="374" /> take years and years to prepare a case and it is desperately costly.  The people we are talking about have neither the time &mdash; the years and years &mdash; nor do they have the money.  No, this cannot be the solution.  It is a matter of natural justice.  If the Minister needs greater consultation or time to explore all the possibilities for funding that this needs, he will get all the necessary support from us.  I ask him not to close the door on this appeal.</P>
    <P>Last week, Senator Doyle referred to the campaign appeal in the UK and how at the beginning that campaign mirrored our situation here.  The British Government would not accept responsibility for the matter initially but after an all-party meeting which put the facts of the case before members the Minister for Health there changed his attitude very dramatically in a matter of months.  Now, infected haemophiliacs in the UK are beginning to enjoy the dividends of that change of mind.</P>
    <P>Having money, of course, will not make everything right &mdash; how could it? The people concerned can never have a normal lifestyle as enjoyed by us but at least they can have the relative luxury of not worrying about their families if they die and they can afford to buy the best medical attention.  I know the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, has met members of the society and has had from them at first hand details of their difficulties but he has not been in a position to make them a meaningful offer.  I hope this evening he can tell us he has had Government approval to meet their request.  The Government of the day should accept responsibility for the policies or acts of a previous Government and this has been borne out by former Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, in the Dáil.  He contends that because the official blood collection and distributions policies in the eighties have led to this tragedy, the matter lies with the Executive, with the Government.  If the situation were reversed and we were now in Government I have no doubt that we would meet our obligations in this matter.  This is a <Col N="375" /> very exceptional, unique situation and it requires a special response.</P>
    <P>The members of the society representing haemophiliacs have campaigned with great dignity and great dedication to get help from us.  They have been appealing to us since last May.  I have to confess that I was only remotely conscious of their situation.  It is in the way of politics that when you meet a particular deserving case you presume, it being such a glaring injustice as it is in this case, that surely it is being corrected and that you do not have to worry too much about it because the people concerned, the Minister and the Department of Health, would have taken all this on board.  It was only when I got the society's booklet which was published last April in the midst of my Christmas post that I was motivated into action.  There it was with all its sad detail in the midst of all the happy Christmas wishes.</P>
    <P>Later on, I talked to the mother of a ten-year-old boy.  Her child has full-blown AIDS through contaminated blood.  She is a young mother and she is trying to cope with this awful tragedy. She told me he is slowly dying, that he changed from a lively, normal little boy to a child who cannot go to school, who spends most of this time sleeping but is bright enough to know he is seriously ill and asks her several times a week if he has cancer.  These are the real cases; these are the statistics, the children and individuals who are suffering either with AIDS or with the HIV positive virus.  I appeal to the Minister to give us an answer tonight that will either resolve the situation or lead very quickly to it being resolved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that in the first part of this debate last week there was considerable reference to the biochemistry and biology of haemophilia and also the necessity for Factor 8.  There was reference to the difficulties with Factor 8, and the fact that it has been impossible for small countries to create sufficient supplies to meet the needs of the haemophilia population and that this <Col N="376" /> led to the importation of Factor 8 already infected with the HIV virus.  I am sure that the difficulty of recognising infection of HIV virus due to the period which is required before there is sero-conversion was also alluded to.  Therefore, I do not intend to deal with that part of my prepared speech this afternoon because I would only be going over what, presumably, other Senators have already dealt with.</P>
      <P>I would, however, like to give some credit to the authorities in Northern Ireland &mdash; perhaps credit for intuition as much as for organisation &mdash; because Northern Ireland is well recognised as having the lowest recorded incidence of HIV infection among its haemophiliacs. This has led to some difficulties because the person who is largely responsible had female intuition and for no other reason that I can understand &mdash; and I have explored this &mdash; she decided early on that she would take a pool of blood from Europe rather than from America to treat haemophiliacs with Factors 8 and 9. The net result of this, of course, was that the HIV virus had not penetrated European blood until much later than it had penetrated American blood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I mention that is that an argument has been used by some claimants in England looking for compensation that members of the medical profession in other countries were tardy or negligent in looking at the implications of infected Factor 8.  While I support the case of the haemophiliacs I believe the medical profession should not be left as a scapegoat to pay the compensation, as could easily happen.  One of the problems we are up against today as far as our profession is concerned is the media bombardment, instant communication and the concept that the latest must be the best.  If one adopts that theory it leads us into all sorts of unsatisfactory avenues.  It takes time to dissect and distil what is appropriate for medical care and medical need.  It is easy to say it was known for a number of years that Factor 8 might be infected and nothing was done about it. It takes time to circulate information throughout the profession as a whole.  I <Col N="377" /> certainly feel quite sympathetic to doctors who have &mdash; and I am more sympathetic, of course, to the haemophiliacs who have suffered &mdash; been involved somewhere in giving Factor 8 which was shown subsequently to be infected HIV virus.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I must take issue with my good friend, Senator Hillery.  He has said that no one goes out to get AIDS and, therefore, he feels that the person who gets AIDS is in exactly the same situation as the person who is given AIDS with no thought of it &mdash; at least initially no thought of it &mdash; by treatment received from the State in order to prevent the worst aspects of their disease.  From what I have heard there is far too much talk about sympathy and not enough about action, and urgent action.  It is very easy to get off the hook by talking about sympathy. I agree with Senator Fennell on this point: I read the Taoiseach's speech on Sunday, and heard part of it, and I was greatly impressed by the emphasis he laid in Ireland being a caring society. I do feel the Minister must address himself to the special claims, the unique position of people who have been infected in this way.  Therefore, my first point is that we must see two things: first, not to use the profession as a scapegoat for defects which have occurred, &mdash; and admittedly occurred and, secondly, to look at this problem as it faces us and acknowledge the special case of people with haemophilia. I think it should also be understood that even with the best screening techniques available, a negative result for HIV is not an insurance that the blood is free of disease as it takes about six to eight weeks for the sero-conversion I mentioned.</P>
    <P>The matter of compensation which has also been mentioned is certainly one the Haemophilia Society is bound to pursue. It has no other option but to pursue it, but whether it is by action taken against the therapists, local authority or the health authority or the State, nevertheless and I think this should be emphasised &mdash; it is a legal minefield and full of pitfalls and could, in fact, take years to sort our properly.  This brings us back to <Col N="378" /> the point at issue, the need to set up a trust fund in Ireland to deal with the appalling problem and the appalling consequences of this treatment of this disease of haemophilia by contaminated Factors 8 and 9.  I think we must be chiefly concerned here with the social obligation on a national scale to provide unqualified support to meet the special needs of a special group of people.  This is primarily a humanitarian motion and, as such, should obtain the full support of the Seanad and, hopefully, a sympathetic, urgent, practical, pragmatic and constructive response by the Government.</P>
    <P>Haemophiliacs are born with a defect which cannot yet be changed.  It is tragic irony that the treatment which they require to sustain a reasonable expectation of life and an acceptable quality of life now strikes them down.  There is fear of the effect of the next treatment, fear of the expectation of what will happen without treatment.  They are indeed caught between the Scylla and Charybdis of therapy.</P>
    <P>In 1987 the Haemophilia Society of the United Kingdom started a campaign for recompense.  This campaign highlighted the fact that the blood product safety was now so improved that we were dealing with a finite number of cases.  One has to see here that while AIDS may be escalating &mdash; although for reasons I have mentioned here before not escalating in the way people had anticipated initially because of the special population that is affected, in spite of what we have heard here today about Africa &mdash; what we are dealing with here is the haemophiliac population treated with Factors 8 and 9. Now that there is awareness of the danger in Factors 8 and 9, an enormous amount is being done to ensure they are safe.  We are dealing with a finite population, a population in this respect which is unlikely to increase, and a population, sadly, in which we will know the results in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of this &mdash; not only the effect on the person who may be doomed to an early death but also the effect on families.  Consider the effect on the wife of the haemophiliac.  As we <Col N="379" /> know, it is a disease which rarely affects a woman, that is unless a female carrier were to marry a male who has the disease, which would be a fairly unusual occurrence. On the whole, we are talking about men who are affected and the effect on the woman who could, first, develop HIV virus infection or full-blown AIDS as a result of intercourse and, secondly, the terrible dread that any woman must have that she will give birth to a child which is in any way defective but in this particular case, through no fault of her own and no fault of her husband, a child which will come into the world with a fatal disease and has nothing whatever to look forward to.  It has side-effects with regard to obtaining life insurance, house mortgage, seeking and retaining jobs and perhaps most of all, there is the great difficulty being a wage-earner because you are so sick with this disease at times that you may not be able to hold down a job.  It also means that on the death of the husband, the widow, who may or may not be affected has to face up to similar problems.</P>
    <P>As I said before in this House I had a very dear friend who died of AIDS in St. Mary's Hospital, London way back when it was practically unknown and where he was extremely well cared for.  I can assure you that anyone who went down that row of single cubicles in which those young men were being treated, could not but have sympathy for them but also had to recognise that the haemophiliac who has been given the disease by treatment the State says is the only treatment we can provide for them, has a special urgent need of our understanding but &mdash; more important &mdash; of our action.</P>
    <P>It is argued here that there should be no distinction made between the AIDS sufferer and the sufferer from haemophilia who acquires the disease.  May I just make this point?  We must do something about AIDS; there is no doubt about that.  We must give some acknowledgment of a disease which, not unlike the scourges of the past smallpox, syphilis or other diseases, has special demands on a so-called caring society and <Col N="380" /> on the resources of the society.  These demands are of a distinctly different quality from the demands of the haemophiliac. The haemophiliacs are a relatively small group and the numbers affected are around 20 per cent of the total and, hopefully, that can now be contained as there is more knowledge of how the disease is spread and how it affects people.</P>
    <P>In <i>The Times</i> of 6 November 1987 there was a full report of the meeting between the Haemophilia Society and a cross-party group of almost 60 parliamentarians in the House of Commons. Julian Millar, a haemophiliac who had contracted HIV and Simon Taylor who detailed the financial recompense which the society was seeking, were credited &mdash; and I quote from that article in The Times &ldquo;with having achieved the near impossible by welding together MPs from every strand of political opinion into a united body determined to force the Government to give financial support to the 1,200 HIV positive people with haemophilia in Britain.&rdquo;  As a result of that, a £10 million fund was raised to be established as a trust, properly governed, with various rules and reference points for distribution as fairly and as equitably as possible between the people who are affected.</P>
    <P>A further point was made that some Senator had remarked, if you please, that haemophiliacs infected with this disease should go out and get compensation, that that is the way to deal with the problem. I would like to quote from <i>Hansard,</i> from the speech of the man who had the conversion on his way to meeting the Haemophilia Society or after meeting with them.  I quote from the House of Commons <i>Hansard</i> of 16 November 1987, Col. 3774. Mr. Newton, the British Minister of Health, said:</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions I have commented on the difficulty of a compensation scheme.  This</P>
    <P>&mdash; that is, the trust &mdash;</P>
    <P>is not a compensation scheme.  That must be made clear.  It is a recognition of a special and unique combination of <Col N="381" /> circumstances and I am glad to make that recognition.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I appeal to the Minister to see this group as a group which has distinctive requirements and which should have a distinctive claim on the finances of the nation.  In particular, because we claim to be a caring nation, we must recognise that we are now in a situation which has got a finite quality to it.  It has also, alas, with regard to those who are affected, a certain limited span of time.  We must show to the people at large that we do care and that it is not enough to make a sympathetic response. That response will only be adequate when discussion is backed up with action and when action can be felt and perceived by those who have been affected by this abomination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to fully support the motion proposed by the Opposition parties.  I would like to congratulate the Haemophilia Society on their campaign to make Members of this House and of the other House aware of the real difficulties in which they found themselves as a result of contracting HIV positive. We should all ask ourselves if we are supporting this motion not for purely emotional reasons, not simply because they have run a very successful campaign which has touched everybody's hearts and drawn in a great deal of public sympathy. We should ask ourselves why these people should be treated differently from any other particular unfortunate group in our society.  The answer is moderately simple.  They were born with haemophilia. They already had an unfortunate and unhappy situation in their lives &mdash; they drew the short straw.  Now they have come across this second appalling tragedy and accident in their lives. That makes them almost unique as a group and as an indentifiable group.  The second reason is purely practical: they are a very small group and a group which is not going to increase at any particular rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unreasonable for the Minister on fiscal grounds, on emotional grounds or <Col N="382" /> on any practical grounds to say they should not be helped.  Were it a group, however unfortunate, who was possibly going to increase at such a rate that the State's finances could not sustain it or a gruop which was impossible to identify in the size into which it was going to grow, then perhaps he could say we cannot afford this or may not be able to afford this, but he knows, the Government know and everybody involved in this particular campaign knows, that this group will not grow at a rate which the State cannot sustain in terms of supporting.  It is very difficult to justify the refusal of the Government to support their very meagre and very modest demands.  The figure of £400,000, which I understand is what they are looking for, is an absolute pittance in governmental terms.  It is a small amount which I cannot understand the Government refusing to give.</P>
    <P>I do not really care, and I cannot understand how anybody else cares and why it is offered as an excuse, who is responsible for what happened to these unfortunate people.  It is wrong for anyone, in defence of not paying this money to say the Government technically have no responsibility, the Government do not have the guilt so they should not pay.  I do not think it matters who carries the responsibility, whether it is ourselves, whether it is certain individuals, whether it is people overseas, whether it is the people themselves.  The fact of the matter is that they are in this situation.  The fact of the matter is that they live in this country and that, irrespective of whoever is responsible for what happened we have a responsibility for them now.  That is what we have to face up to.  That is the reality.  To say otherwise or to try to lay the blame elsewhere is not only unsympathetic, it is also dishonest.</P>
    <P>We should also look at the situation overseas.  I have an incomplete picture of what the situation is overseas.  I have an incomplete picture of what the situation is overseas as regards victims of this sort but it is quite clear from the information I have received from the Haemophilia Society that it it normal in Britain and in other EC countries who can afford it to <Col N="383" /> make large and generous and adequate grants for the victims of this condition. I do not understand why we should be exceptions to this rule.  The figure of £50,000 seems to be too little.</P>
    <P>While stating categorically that these people should be helped, I do not think we should fall into the trap, which happened so often in the debate in the other House on this matter, of saying that they are innocent victims.  To my mind all victims of AIDS or the HIV virus are innocent victims.  I do not believe there is any great difference in terms of conscience or guilt for those who contracted the disease or that they should necessarily be differentiated on those grounds.  These people, because of their tragic situation initially and throughout their lives, because of their second tragic situation and because of their small numbers, their containable numbers, should be given special consideration and should be granted the modest demands they are asking of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we all agree that the Irish Haemophilia Society have a very genuine case to put forward, and indeed they have done so magnificently.  They were formed, I understand, some 20 odd years ago to represent the needs of haemophiliacs in Ireland.  It is true to say that little did they know that the eighties would bring this very real problem to them, not just to the 106 Irish haemophiliacs who are affected with HIV but also the other 200-odd haemophiliacs and their families.  I understand from this debate that there are ten full-blown AIDS victims and that six have died from this terrible disease.  I recognise the very special problem of haemophiliacs who are affected with AIDS and HIV positive through transfusions of contaminated blood.  The reality of life is clear: AIDS is a reality which is with us and affects people, whether they be drug addicts, homosexuals, or haemophiliacs.  One way or the other, we have a duty to come to terms with this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case made for the haemophiliacs is different to the other groups.  They are <Col N="384" /> in many ways the innocent victims of a system which was regarded as being of help to them.  It is a Catch-22 situation for the Government.  I am inclined to the view that the members of the Government are very sympathetic to their case and I would think the same applies to the Minister who is with us this evening.</P>
    <P>The question then is: can the Government categorise one section of a disease? Should they not treat all victims of the disease the same?  As far as I am concerned, my heart would clearly be on the side of the small special group who have this problem we are discussing this evening. At the same time we must recognise the position of the Government, and I am pleased they have set up a review group under the chairmanship of Deputy Leyden, the Minister of State, to examine the problems of all AIDS sufferers.  We should give this group a chance to come forward very quickly with their findings, recommendations and proposals.</P>
    <P>From the start haemophiliacs have had problems from birth.  Haemophilia is a hereditary blood disorder.  The affected haemophiliacs in this instance feel badly let down on the grounds that they came to be infected by a health service to which they turned for treatment.  They have a special problem and a very unique, real one and my hope is that the very special case they have would get special consideration from the review body.  I am aware that the Irish Haemophilia Society have a representative on this body and I would like to think that the chairman of that body, Deputy Leyden, would be very sympathetic to their cause.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, could I have some details of this review body?  It is totally new to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood it was common knowledge that a new body was being set up.  The chairman of this body is Deputy Leyden and I imagine he would be very much on the side of the Irish haemophiliacs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health is with us and will reply in detail at the end of the debate.  In the knowledge that people on <Col N="385" /> both sides of the House are interested in this cause and are sympathetic to it, I would hope that would have no vote this evening but would wait to see the outcome of this review body, ask for its findings to be implemented very speedily, and at the end of the day perhaps something positive might come out of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>First, my apologies for interrupting Senator Fallon but I thought there had been some new development of which I was unaware.</P>
      <P>All Senators who have spoken have covered the facts of this case very well and in particular Senator Robb, Senator Ross and Senator Fennell have very graphically described the situation.  The basic fact is that the people we are talking about were infected while taking treatment which was intended to keep them healthy.  Their HIV antibody positive status is a result of the medical treatment received through the health services. Infection with HIV was the direct result of services provided by the Department of Health.  Blood products are manufactured from two sources &mdash; from commercially obtained clotting factor concentrates drawn from the blood of paid donors abroad and bought and given to the health service, and from domestically obtained Factor 8 and Factor 9 clotting factor concentrates from voluntary donations in Ireland.  Since 1985 all Factor 8 and Factor 9 has been treated to prevent infection and all individual donors have been tested.  Commercially obtained concentrates from plasma of paid donors were first suspected of carrying HIV positive virus in 1982.  Yet, concentrates produced from Irish volunteer donors were not available until 1986 and in March 1988 we were still not totally self-sufficient.  Thankfully, we are now almost completely self-sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implication of HIV infection for families of people with haemophilia has been devastating.  Haemophilia, as a disease, is itself worrying for a family, but HIV and AIDS places an intolerable pressure on family life.  The problem is even more acute because the HIV and AIDS virus can be passed on and there <Col N="386" /> is often more than one sufferer in a family unit.  Due to the hysteria associated with AIDS and haemophilia, many haemophiliacs, and even those not infected by the HIV virus, have had to publicly deny their blood disorder.  They feel ostracised and rejected by society at large.  The financial problem adds to the burden on those victims of AIDS and HIV positive.  Because of the infection they cannot obtain endowment or life insurance to protect homes and families; thus they cannot make adequate provision for their families.  It is, I believe &mdash; and I am slow to attribute responsibility to any particular Minister or Department &mdash; the responsibility of the Minister to help these individuals and their families who are in desperate need and that is why we believe the Minister must set up a trust fund to help them.</P>
    <P>The Minister, on 9 February in the Dáil, stated it was his responsibility to ensure that all AIDS sufferers were properly treated and looked after by the State. This is a welcome stance, but surely a special case must be made for those suffering from AIDS or HIV positive because of their medical treatment?  This treatment was provided by the Government and therefore the Government, the State, have a clear moral obligation to help these people.</P>
    <P>The issue in relation to haemophiliacs is completely separate from the general issue of medical or other assistance being given to people with the HIV antibody or AIDS or other people with fatal illnesses. This group of 106 people were injected with plasma that was infected with the HIV antibody as a result of which a significant proportion have or will contract AIDS.  The decision to compensate people infected in this way would not create any kind of general precedent.  We on this side of the House would be very happy to underline this fact: that we do not see this as in any way creating any sort of general precedent.</P>
    <P>It has absolutely nothing to do with the different question of helping AIDS sufferers generally and the Minister cannot and must not be allowed to avoid the issue of helping haemophiliacs with <Col N="387" /> AIDS or HIV positive by confusing these two distinct groups of AIDS sufferers. Other countries that face the same problem as we do in Ireland have risen to the challenge and have provided generous compensation for their own haemophiliacs infected with AIDS and HIV positive.  Britain, Spain, West Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Bulgaria and New Zealand have all compensated haemophiliacs who have become infected with AIDS as a result of treatment with infected blood products.</P>
    <P>Haemophiliacs with AIDS and HIV positive are different from other AIDS sufferers and must be treated accordingly. The treatment they receive to help their handicap has now led to a double disadvantage where not alone are they haemophiliacs but they have now developed HIV positive or full-blown AIDS.  The Government must find a solution to alleviate the distress of these haemophiliacs and they must do it quickly.  The Haemophilia Society has made a reasonable and well-thought out modest request to the Minister but to date we have had no response.  The Minister and the Government must now face up to their responsibilities in this issue. They must provide much more funding than the tiny sum of £50,000, which is the sort of grant a small town would get from the national lottery for one project.  They must do far better than the money already offered to the Irish Haemophilia Society to help it engage in the self-help programme.  I know that despite the financial constraints which the Minister faces there would be universal heart-felt approval for giving the kind of support requested by the Irish Haemophilia Society.  I now call on the Minister to respond adequately and comprehensively to the needs of this small, disadvantaged group who, through no fault of their own or of the Irish health care system, have been dealt a very cruel hand by fate.</P>
    <P>When Senator Fallon says he hopes there will not be a vote on this matter, one part of me agrees with him.  I do not want to have a vote on this issue, but I have to say at this stage that unless the <Col N="388" /> Minister in his reply can go much more than half-way towards meeting the very modest request of the Irish Haemophilia Society, we will have no option but to oppose him in the division lobby this evening. I hope that in his reply he will not give us reason to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the facts, figures and statistics regarding the position of people with haemophilia who have become HIV positive have been well presented by other Members here.  I would like to home in on one area in particular, that is, the special position of these people.  They were given a treatment which was provided by the State. Obviously, the State did not know there was any problem there, but unfortunately 106 people have become HIV positive because of the treatment.</P>
      <P>We can talk about the legal question of responsibility but the process through the courts is a long and expensive one.  I believe that the real issue here is not the legal issue but the moral responsibility the State has to the people who have become HIV positive.  One of the frightening statistics which was given to me when we attended a meeting in Buswells Hotel and met with members of the Irish Haemophilia Society was that it seems now about three people per annum will develop full-blown AIDS as a result of having become HIV positive.  So, I believe that there is a moral responsibility to these people.</P>
      <P>In order to get around the legalities of the situation, the Labour Party instanced the Stardust agreement whereby a precedent was set.  There are a number of parallels here with the people who have become HIV positive.  These were people who received Factors 8 and 9 before 1985; in other words, it is a group that is contained, it is a group that, thankfully, is not going to grow any larger.  As with the Stardust Tribunal you had a limited number of people there.  The courts were not going to reach a conclusion quickly or effectively enough, so the previous Government decided to deal with the problem in a way that allowed people adequate compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="389" /> Regarding the issue before us tonight, these people deserve our sympathy, but they also need a lot more.  They need effective action and financial help, and they need it now.  Going along the lines of the settlement that was made with the Stardust victims, we are opening up an avenue that can give quick and effective financial help to those concerned.  Other people &mdash; and I am not going to go back over statistics &mdash; have instanced the help that is given in other countries.  Whatever they do in other countries, this country, which prides itself on being a Christian country, through its Legislature must stand up and be counted and take on board its moral responsibility to these people.  I do not want to get into any hassle on this because an issue like this must be treated calmly, but at the end of the day we must be strong in seeking immediate justice for these people.</P>
    <P>The first motion before us tonight refers to people being infected with AIDS and HIV positive through transfusions of contaminated blood.  I wonder if that is quite accurate, because I have a news report of a statement made by the Minister of State at the Department of Health who stated that blood transfusions had not given rise to AIDS, that it was the people who had received Factor 8 and Factor 9.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would say that an important point has been made here by other speakers, that is, that we should not apply any moral criteria as to how all those who are HIV positive and all who have developed full-blown AIDS in our society became infected.  They are infected and they have a problem.  They deserve our sympathy but, more importantly, they deserve our help.  The Labour Party position is that every public health facility should be made available to all those AIDS victims.  That is not to say that the people who became HIV positive and developed full-blown AIDS through Factors 8 and 9, which were provided by a State agency, have not a special case. I make the analogy with the Stardust Tribunal.  I await the Minister's response and I, too, hope that this issue will not be put to a vote.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="390" /> I would say to the Minister that the Labour Party want effective action now. These people have suffered in silence for quite a long time.  Recently, they have gone out into the public arena and sought the help of politicians.  But all the suffering that has been caused, all the suffering that is there at present and all the suffering that is to come must be dealt with.  We must deal with it effectively and we must deal with it now.  We, as Labour Party Senators, are earnestly requesting the Minister to respond to this problem and to respond to the moral obligation this Legislature has and that he, as Minister, for Justice, has to these people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all learning about AIDS.  It is something whose dimensions most of us have not yet grasped.  It is a problem that is going to affect our generation and generations to come.  It is a problem that is going to loom large for those of us who have children because it is a problem that is going to be even more of a threat to the health of our children as, sadly, the virus extends and multiplies and seems to take its inevitable course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like all things that are so large and so frightening, we do our best in many ways to ignore it, however genuinely concerned. For instance, most of us cannot contemplate nuclear war because of the concept of the obliteration of the human race.  It is incomprehensible to us and we duck.  Most of us cannot contemplate the possibility of the death of a loved one; it is <Col N="391" /> so incomprehensible and so heartrending that we duck.  People who smoke cigarettes cannot contemplate the possible consequences of what they are doing and so they duck.  It is similar for many of us in regard to AIDS.</P>
    <P>In some ways because the word &ldquo;AIDS&rdquo; is raised in a debate it can hypnotise us into inactivity, because of its dimensions, its complexity, the human and ethical problems, the problems for children, the problems for African societies and because of the increasing fear that this is going to be with us, is going to get worse and turn up in places where it was not expected.  Scientific knowledge is never absolute; you can never say with certainty anything that has a scientific basis is absolutely true; all you can ever say is that this is the best we know at a particular moment in time.</P>
    <P>We do not know where the AIDS virus will go.  We do not know how the problem will develop.  We do not know what effects it will have.  We do not know even yet whether or what proportion of people who are HIV positive will become infected with full-blown AIDS.  All of the information that I as a lay person has read suggests that as more and more information becomes available the proportion of HIV positive people who become infected with full blown AIDS will keep on going tragically and painfully up.  That is the kind of context in which we are talking.</P>
    <P>Suppose a group like the group of haemophiliacs in Irish society had been infected with a fatal ailment which was not AIDS, something totally different that was unknown and suddenly became apparent because of the use of Factor 8 and Factor 9, suppose therefore we could separate the problem of haemophiliacs from the problem of AIDS, suppose the human consequences were the same but it was not part of a bigger problem, we would work out without any great difficulty a way of dealing with it because we would not be worried about precedents and implications for other groups.  Of course we should worry about <Col N="392" /> precedent, of course we should worry about policy implications.</P>
    <P>I was not here for last week's debate but if the argument was used it should not have been used &mdash; there are no distinctions between innocent and guilty victims of AIDS.  Anybody who is infected with AIDS is innocent from that moment because of the scale of the human tragedy that is involved.  There can be no talk about innocent and other victims of AIDS.  That is not the line I would take on the problem we are addressing here and it is not the line I would avocate that anybody else should take on the issue. The issue is quite different.</P>
    <P>The issue is that we are in a perpetual learning process about AIDS and its impact on society, and on particular groups in society from time to time.  We have been able, and many of the moralists in our society have been somewhat smugly able, to talk about AIDS in terms of ethical behaviour.  We have had unfortunate utterances that the safest way to avoid AIDS was to live according to certain moral principles.  We now know that is nonsense for at least one group and probably in the future will be for a number of groups.</P>
    <P>We now also know that haemophiliacs simply did what the best medical advice available to them said they should do.  It was something brief, if was something temporary; in terms of the corpus of knowledge about AIDS, it was no more than a hiccup in scientific development. In human terms, on the other hand, it is an enormous, concentrated human tragedy affecting a small number of people, affecting more than one and in some cases more than two people within an immediate family group, affecting two generations of the same family.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to stand back and say that we must talk about AIDS as if it was a similar problem for everybody.  We must talk about AIDS at one level as if it was a similar problem for everybody but the fact that it is an extensive problem, a problem that affects all sorts of people in our society, a problem that in some cases is related to human behaviour and in some cases is not, does not mean <Col N="393" /> we should draw an artificial bottomline common denominator and ignore the differences between groups of people who have been infected with AIDS and ignore the fact that in certain categories of risk the risk is rapidly diminishing.  For instance, amongst haemophiliacs the risk must be close to zero now of further HIV infection.</P>
    <P>What we are dealing with is not a group of people who are going to become more extensive but a fixed number who were caught at the interface between ignorance and knowledge, who were caught at a particular moment in time when our knowledge as a society fell behind the progress of a particularly frightening illness. They got caught at that interface and got left behind for one, two or three years and out of that came the fact that as well as being seriously ill with haemophilia a large number of them are now effectively going to die.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we cannot do anything about the fact that they are going to die. What we can do is try to minimise the human consequences of that.  The human consequences of that are not helped incidentally &mdash; I say this because perhaps the Minister can do something about it &mdash; by an insurance industry which, by and large, penalises people simply for admitting that they have been tested for AIDS, irrespective of the outcome of the test. This particular group have told us in graphic detail about the problems of mortgages, life insurance and the desperate worry that many of them have of what will happen to their families if, or when, they die.</P>
    <P>For a group like that who can see clearly from within their own perspective the clear definite, almost physical, boundaries that surround their problem, who can look around and say, &ldquo;We are not a continuing expanding problem. Something happened to us once, some moment in history happened to go wrong for us and we are stuck with the problem. We feel we are entitled to the support of our brothers and sisters in Irish society simply because we got caught at the interface between ignorance and knowledge&rdquo;. That, it seems to me, is the crux of it.  It <Col N="394" /> is not a question of guilt or innocence.  It is not a question of anything like that.  It is a question of a tragic accident of history that struck these people at a moment in time when they could not know differently.</P>
    <P>All over society it is true there are people who were caught because of an ignorance about the spread of AIDS.  All over society there is a developing problem, the limits of which we do not yet understand, the sort of responses that we must produce to it we do not yet understand, the ways we can influence human behaviour to minimise the risk of AIDS we do not yet understand but the case of this particular group the one thing we do understand is, we know the limits of the problem, we know the cause of the problem, we know the extent of the problem and we can be 99 per cent certain that it is not a problem that will continue to grow, multiply and develop indefinitely. This is one human manifestation of what will become one of the biggest human tragedies of recent history. Because of the nature of that manifestation, we know the limits to the problem. We know the boundaries to the problem.  We know the extent of the problem in a way that we do not know for any other group in society who are threatened by or infected with AIDS. That is why it is possible to deal with haemophiliacs differently because of the clear definition of the problem.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that it is not good enough to talk about precedent.  It is not good enough to pass it off in terms of the need to be concerned about all people suffering from AIDS because that fact is one on which we are all united.  What is different here is, as I have and other Members have said, the clear parameters of the problem; the way it originated as a consequence of humanity's lack of knowledge of something that was changing very rapidly, the fact that we do not have to talk about an indefinite period of care and concern but are talking about a fixed group.  All of that seemed to me from the very beginning to argue for particular treatment.  I would rather use &ldquo;particular&rdquo; than &ldquo;special&rdquo; because it <Col N="395" /> seems to me that all people who are infected with something as appalling as AIDS become special in society.  This is a particular group within that overall group who have identified a particular need and I have yet to be convinced that there is any legal procedural precedent or indeed policy argument which can justify the continued resistance to what is not a significant sum of money &mdash; I think nobody can argue about that.  I do not think the money is the fundamental issue.</P>
    <P>There is an issue of policy, an issue of principle and an issue of precedent that is being used to avoid doing what is requested.  It seems to me that the overwhelming view of Members of the Oireachtas from all sides, talking in public here and talking in private to many members of Fianna Fáil, is that something should be done.  Something should be done without us having to repeat in public the tragedy we heard described at a recent meeting of a family with a child of ten years of age dying from AIDS.</P>
    <P>There are children dying from AIDS all over the world.  The problem here is that we have identified one group who know the dimensions of their problem, have told us in very painful ways about the extent of their pain and have asked us for a very specific response to their problem and to their need.  It is up to us not to confuse ourselves with bigger issues, not to confuse the issue with longer-term problems but to identify one specific human problem and do something about it now.  The best people to tell us what to do are those who are suffering.  They have asked us for a specific sum of money over a number of years to meet very human needs and to give many of them the security at least of knowing that if they cannot be with their families indefinitely, at least their families are going to be protected from indigence and from poverty by our often compassionate society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators in their contributions have encapsulated the difficulties which haemophiliacs who have contracted the <Col N="396" /> AIDS virus have in leading a normal life and I can see that problems exist for this group.  I have a difficulty however, in accepting that the problems which infected haemophiliacs face are unique or special to that particular group of persons to the extent that particular measures should be put in place to assist these, over and above what might be required for others who are infected with the virus. I regret, therefore, that as Minister for Health I cannot accept the thrust of resolutions before the House.</P>
      <P>As I said in the Dáil recently, many families will, tragically, be affected by the AIDS virus.  These effects will be very direct and immediate for haemophiliacs and their families and dependants and for intravenous drug abusers, for homosexuals, bisexuals and heterosexuals and their families also.  It is worth noting, for instance, that over half of the I.V. drug abusers infected have families and 53 babies born to such couples have been tested HIV positive.</P>
      <P>It is against this background of the broadly based spread of the infection that I and the Government must assess the most equitable and pragmatic route to take in providing for all AIDS sufferers and a major consideration in this is to ensure that discrimination against, or the potential for generating feelings of guilt amongst persons for whom special measures would not be taken, does not enter into our strategy.  If one particular group were singled out for special treatment in relation to this extremely sensitive condition, where the sources of infection are varied &mdash; it could be seen as discriminatory towards other categories of AIDS cases.  Therefore, I am not convinced that it is appropriate to establish a trust fund for haemophiliacs.  Rather, it is necessary to address equitably and pragmatically the problems of all AIDS sufferers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is with this objective in mind, that I have established a group under the chairmanship of my colleague, Deputy Leyden, Minister of State, to inquire urgently into the accessibility of services to AIDS sufferers generally.  This group consists of representatives for the Irish <Col N="397" /> Haemophilia Society, the health boards, the Department of Health, the Virus Reference Laboratory UCD, and the Drugs Treatment and Advisory Centre in Pearse Street, Dublin.</P>
    <P>I have asked the group to report to me as a matter of urgency as I am conscious that difficulties of access to services could be damaging to infected persons and I am anxious that difficulties which individual AIDS sufferers experience should be comprehensively identified.  The remit of the group is not confined to health services only and when it completes its work it would be my intention to bring its report to Government.</P>
    <P>I would like to outline briefly to the House the measures which the Government have taken to protect the blood supply, as the quality of the blood supply is, to a significant extent, central to the issues raised.  Protecting the blood supply was our first priority in developing the Irish strategy and we acted on this in all manners available to us as soon as we possibly could.  As soon as HIV testing became available, it was introduced in Ireland and, as a result, no case of transfusion-related AIDS or HIV infection has occurred in this country and Ireland is the only EC country which has not had such a case.  Similarly, HIV-tested and heat-treated blood products were introduced here as soon as they became available.</P>
    <P>The National Blood Transfusion Service Board immediately took up, as a priority, the task of supplying the national requirements for blood products from the domestic supply.  These measures now guarantee that the blood supply and the supply of blood products are free from HIV infection.  These blood products represent a major medical advance in the control of haemophilia which has enabled haemophiliacs to live as normal a life as possible, reducing the trauma of treatment and the need for protracted periods of hospitalisation.</P>
    <P>Thanks to these important measures those haemophiliacs who are not infected can now be reassured that their treatment is safe and will not result in HIV infection. Even prior to the availability of HIV testing and heat-treated blood products, <Col N="398" /> the benefits of Factors 8 and 9 to haemophiliacs were considered to outweigh the risks of contracting AIDS.</P>
    <P>A wide range of other measures have also been introduced to prevent the spread of AIDS and to care for those infected.  In identifying and introducing measures, care has always been taken to ensure equity and easy access to services within the resources available.  In this regard, the Government have provided a special allocation of £450,000 for special AIDS programmes out of national lottery funds, in addition to the normal costs of treatment and testing.  Already the Department of Health have provided funding for additional counselling services at St. James's Hospital where the National Haemophilia Unit is located. The society itself has benefited from this funding and at my recent meeting with the society on 10 February, 1989 I offered a further grant of £50,000 to enable it to develop its counselling and support services &mdash; an offer which I made to them without prejudice to other considerations which might arise as a result of the working party's deliberations to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>At the meeting of 10 February I had a full discussion with the society on the implications inherent in their proposal to establish a trust fund for one sector of the population affected by the virus.</P>
    <P>Indeed there would be considerable practical difficulties in establishing and administering a trust fund on the lines suggested and it is with interest that I noted the comments of the former Minister for Health, Deputy Barry Desmond, in relation to this in the media recently.</P>
    <P>I would now like to respond to specific points made during the debate.  While they encapsulated the problems of infected haemophiliacs, Senators also underlined the difficulties which the Government have in dealing with this particular group in a specific way.  Perhaps unwittingly, the concept of innocent and other categories of victims has, regrettably, been brought up in the debate and the thrust of the manner in which the motions have been promoted has revolved around the justification and need for special measures for haemophiliacs infected with the AIDS virus, <Col N="399" /> on the grounds that they contracted the virus in a manner which was not associated with lifestyle.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle referred to the infected haemophiliacs as &ldquo;normal ordinary families living in this country with children going to local schools and wanting to live a normal happy life but, unfortunately, due to the medical problem which they have inherited through no fault of their own, they are now unable to do so.&rdquo; Senator Bulbulia also referred to the difficulties which these people and their children have both medically and socially and Senator Murphy referred to the &ldquo;particular category of totally innocent people&rdquo; who contracted the infection in &ldquo;a totally involuntary way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Identifying one group of AIDS sufferers as innocent on the basis of the source of their infection brings value and moral judgments to the situation which serve no useful purpose in trying to develop a compassionate approach towards caring for all AIDS sufferers. Rather they could serve only to drive a wedge between categories of AIDS sufferers and to alienate specific groups in the process and could ultimately prove counterproductive in the Governments objective of minimising the spread of infection through a broadly-based strategy. The graphic picture which Senator Doyle pointed out of the stigmatisation of the children of haemophiliacs is one which could apply equally to the children of HIV positive intravenous drug abusers, a situation which could be exacerbated for these people in the event of a sectoral approach to the question.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Shea brought up the Stardust case.  In that particular case everybody who was affected was considered for compensation and the same was true of those who suffered from the thalidomide tragedy and the brain damage from the three-in-one injection.  In the thalidomide tragedy the firms involved were found to be negligent and in the three-in-one case the Government of the day invited parents to bring along their normal children for immunisation with the product, whereas in the case of those suffering from haemophilia the blood <Col N="400" /> supplied was the normal treatment, and the necessary treatment at the time.</P>
    <P>Senators have argued that the State has a moral obligation to provide especially for this group of AIDS sufferers, for a number of reasons, including the fact that they are a finite group.  The obligations of the State, however, have to be assessed on criteria which go beyond the source of the infection and the numbers in a particular group.  The State has to provide equitably and uniformly for all and, as Senators know, State services are developed, provided and are continually being updated in an equitable and uniform manner.  Within this, care has to be taken in fulfilling the obligations of the State not to discriminate in favour of one or particular group.  All persons infected with the AIDS virus are &ldquo;victims&rdquo; of the disease, just as others who suffer illness or disease or are disabled as a result of accident or injury &mdash; whether it be self-induced or otherwise &mdash; are victims but all must be treated equally and efficiently with the utmost support, compassion and care of both the State and of society.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to assure the House that I fully share its concern about haemophiliacs who are infected by HIV but, for the reasons stated, this concern has to extend to all AIDS sufferers to ensure that all are treated equitably, and effectively in relation to the health and welfare services available.  While I recognise the case being made by Senators, it is with regret that I must inform the House I cannot find it possible to accept the motion as proposed.</P>
    <P>I would ask the House to note the establishment of the committee chaired by Deputy Terry Leyden, with two officials of my Department, Dr. Jimmy Walsh, the medical co-ordinator of the AIDS programme in the country and Michael Lyons, Principal Officer, who has been dealing with the problems arising from AIDS in the public health division, the CEO of the Eastern Health Board, Ciaran Hickey, Programme Manager on the Southern Health Board, Sean Hurley, three representatives from outside, Brian O'Mahoney has been invited from the Irish Haemophilia Society, Dr. John O'Connor from the National Drugs Treatment Centre in Pearse Street and <Col N="401" /> Professor Irene Hillery from the university. I have asked the committee to report back to me as rapidly as possible and what I would suggest is that we could arrange that the committee would meet a representative group of Members of Seanad Éireann at a very early stage, within the next couple of weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I was somewhat taken aback by the contribution of Senator Lanigan to this debate last Wednesday and I regret to have to say I am horrified by the Minister's response tonight.</P>
      <P>The Minister tonight has once again endeavoured to merge a question of financial assistance for haemophiliacs injected with infected plasma with the more general question of AIDS sufferers. Haemophiliacs have been infected with AIDS through receiving medical treatment to help them to overcome the handicap which they were born with.  A decision to give financial assistance to people in this category has nothing whatever to do with the quite different question of AIDS sufferers.  Let me say now that everyone is most sympathetic to AIDS sufferers and wants to help them.</P>
      <P>The Minister said if one particular group was singled out for special treatment what would happen but that group by its very nature has been singled out. They were persons who were receiving treatment for a handicap they already had and were receiving it in order to help them to lead a happy, productive life. They are now burdened with a double handicap and that is what distinguishes them clearly and distinctly from the rest of AIDS sufferers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="402" /> I have never been more moved by anything in my political career, except for the situation in the northern part of our country, than I have been by the motion before us in the House tonight.  All reasonable people would agree it is a genuine request and has to be met by civilised people.  I cannot understand the stance the Minister has taken because I know him to be a compassionate and an understanding man.  The only pointer I got to the Minister's view in this matter was when he answered questions in the Dáil on 9 February last.  I said in my speech last week &mdash; and I tried to indicate the situation as I understood it &mdash; that those people are in a quite different situation. It is regrettable that the Minister was not in for Senator Robb's contribution here tonight because he made that distinction very well.  I must congratulate all the Senators who contributed, and especially Senator Ryan because he made that distinction crystal-clear.  The Minister was here to hear his contribution.</P>
    <P>There can be only two reasons why the Minister and his Department are taking this view.  Either the Minister's advisers in his Department are pulling him by the arm and saying &ldquo;listen, Minister, you cannot do this because you will be setting a precedent&rdquo; or else there is some difficulty in finding £400,000 per year to meet the requirements of this trust fund. After the Taoiseach's speech of last weekend where he said this Government are a compassionate and caring Government, I rule out any difficulty in getting £400,000 per year to meet their needs.</P>
    <P>There cannot be a precedent in this matter because we know that there are a finite number of persons who are suffering from AIDS.  We know there are a number who have full-blown AIDS and they are in urgent need of financial assistance and to be set up some kind of advisory group to look at the question is just ridiculous in this case.  Indeed, last week &mdash; and I regret to say the Minister did not even bother to mention it tonight &mdash; I asked him to reflect on the situation as it obtained in Britain.  The Minister there held the same view as he is holding and yet, because of an all-party meeting, he changed his view.  I want to say to the House, a Chathaoirleach that the British <Col N="403" /> Minister came into the House of Commons and announced a trust fund of £10 million for haemophiliacs.  Even though there are a number of cases pending in the courts, a number of haemophiliacs have taken action against the Government in Great Britain but, leaving that aside, the Government made an exgratia payment of £10 million.  I know of no one here taking legal action.  Time is running out.  These people need assistance urgently.</P>
    <P>We all came into politics to serve people and especially to serve those most in need.  I can think of no group of people more in need of the support of the State than the 106 HIV positive haemophiliacs. It must be a terrible tragedy for people with this problem, facing death and not knowing what security there is for their family.  We had an example before Christmas of a man making an appeal through the media and some anonymous generous person responded with £25,000 to meet the needs of that family.  That man said he would die happy because he knew his wife and family were being looked after.  While we may not want to call it a moral responsibility, surely we have a civil responsibility to address ourselves to this question by providing financial assistance for these people who are trying to lead normal and happy lives.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reflect on what Senators said in this debate.  It has been a most touching debate.  Everyone spoke with sincerity because it is a question of which we are all aware.  We know these people.  We know their needs.  We know that for a number of them, their life span is short.  What more can I ask than that a Government who claim to be compassionate should address themselves to <Col N="404" /> an issue like this?  The Minister will have to change his stance at some time in the future because this is a justifiable and righteous case which stands on in good foundation.  The Minister will have to change his view and give financial assistance to those in this special category who have, by the very nature of their illness, singled themselves out from general AIDS sufferers.  The Minister should not be afraid to change his view.  We will all admire him and think he is a far more compassionate man and that the Government are a far more compassionate Government if the Minister accedes at some time in the near future to this request.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this important issue.  I would like to share my time with Senator McGowan and with Senator Ferris who is in my constituency in south Tipperary.</P>
      <P>This issue is in connection with the Central Bakery in Cahir, County Tipperary, which is threatened with the loss of 27 jobs.  My latest information is that that may happen if the Minister does not take immediate action on Friday next.  In a small town with a massive unemployment rate &mdash; there are over 758 people unemployed in Cahir and the immediate district &mdash; one can imagine the effect 27 extra redundancies will have on that area.  Most of these people are young men with young families, some with mortgages and other commitments.  It is a bleak outlook for these young people. My heart goes out to them.  They are in a town where there is very little industry and where there has been much emigration over the past number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Bakery in Cahir have supplied high quality bread products to the people of south Tipperary, Waterford and adjoining counties for over 100 years and have provided good, permanent employment for their excellent staff. They used Irish flour produced in one of the greatest wheat-growing areas in this country in south Tipperary, which was processed by a sister company which closed some years ago.  I pose the question to the Minister: is Mr. Ben Dunne using Irish flour in this bread war?  I take lightly his statement on television last night and his press statements because it seems people with muscle like that can <Col N="407" /> say and do what they like.  The Minister has power to intervene at this stage in the national interest.</P>
    <P>The bread war was started by Ben Dunne in a very unfair way, with unfair competition.  It is alleged he is employing cheap labour in his outlets and is importing cheap flour.  There is a question mark over the quality of the product he is selling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will have to deal with Cahir Bakery.  If I allow the debate to broaden, where would I draw the line?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be guided by the Chair.  I was speaking about the quality of the product that is competing with the product produced in Cahir.  I do not like to have to raise this matter here this evening and speak about people losing their jobs.  There will be great hardship for the families in the immediate area of Cahir town and district and also for the farming community.  This bread war will not stop with a bakery closing.  It will affect the farming community and the milling industry.  It will be the cause of more imports coming into this country, whether from within or outside the EC. It is also alleged that some of this cheap flour is imported from the United States. I hope the Minister will investigate that.</P>
      <P>I cannot see it as fair competition when a firm employs cheap labour.  It is an abuse of young people with all the unemployment we have today.  Where is the fair play there?  If Cahir Bakery employed cheap labour over the years maybe they would be more competitive than Ben Dunne.  They were not so irresponsible: they were very considerate towards their staff down the years.</P>
      <P>The family grocer will also be affected. He provided an excellent service to people and gave long and short-term credit to families when they were not too well off.  He did not charge any interest on this.  I can imagine the response a poor family would get from Dunnes Stores. They would go out the door empty-handed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not only the workers who are in danger here.  It is the farming community, <Col N="408" /> the milling industry and also poor families. In the long run, when Ben Dunne has put all the bakeries to the wall he can jack up the price of bread and do the same with other products.  That is the dangerous situation we have here tonight.</P>
    <P>The future of small shopkeepers who are trying to pay rates on their premises and taxes of every kind is at stake as well.  They provide a service because Mr. Dunne does not have an outlet in every part of the country.  What about families in rural areas who need bread when there is a foot of snow on the ground?  Where will Mr. Ben Dunne and his service be then?  Small industries like Cahir Bakery brought quality bread to every boreen and hamlet through the years.  If there was some bread left over it would be taken back the following day.  We do not have that kind of service from Mr. Dunne.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to act immediately and save the jobs in Cahir and also in the other smaller bakeries around the country.  Thousands of jobs are at stake. If the Minister does not act there will be a calamity.  The bakeries will fall, just as apples fall off a tree on an October day. Over 7,000 people are employed in the bakery industry.  Up to now it was good permanent employment.  Successive Governments have tried to stem emigration and have travelled to the four corners of the globe trying to create jobs at enormous expense &mdash; anything up to £20,000 per job.  Here we are taking lightly a bread war that will cost thousands of jobs.  Where are the economics there?  Where is the commonsense? Where is the fair competition?</P>
    <P>Over 250 people are employed in the bakeries in south Tipperary.  Other people in the House tell me there is a fear throughout the Twenty-Six Counties about this problem.  There are 250 permanent jobs in danger in south Tipperary alone.  Ben Dunne talks about fair competition. At present he is selling bread in Northern Ireland at 68p.  When you compare that with 39p in the Republic I ask the question: is that fair competition? I wonder does the Minister know anything about that?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to get off the fence <Col N="409" /> and listen to the people in this House. The cream of the country exists outside Newlands Cross.  Do not forget them because when men and women were needed they were found on the other side of Newlands Cross in the boreens.  The small farmers and the workers gave us the freedom we now enjoy.  Are they to be sold out because a multinational can come in and do what they like and ride roughshod over us?  In a few years time Mr. Dunne will be able to dump what he likes into this country.  There are powers vested in the Minister if he acts in time.</P>
    <P>Just a month ago the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Burke, deemed it desirable to impose a prices order for bread, forcing retailers to charge not less than 55p for a white loaf. The order followed discussions between the Minister and the supermarkets, during which he failed to win agreement for a voluntary restoration of prices.  On that occasion the price of an 800g loaf had tumbled to 35p.  Deputy Burke's order promptly restored the price to 55p, but within one week he revoked the order and said that it would put an end to the price war.  Almost immediately the price war resumed.  A loaf is now selling at 39p but Deputy Burke seems content not to intervene.</P>
    <P>How could Deputy Burke consider 55p a proper price for a loaf of bread just four or five weeks ago and now regard 39p for the same loaf as satisfactory?  It is crazy. I appeal to the Minister to act quickly in the interests of the people &mdash; workers, farmers, shopkeepers and consumers.  In the long run the housewife will be caught. There will be a monopoly and people in the industry will be sold down the Swanee.  I do not want that to happen because the finest people in rural Ireland are employed in our bakeries.  I appeal to the Minister to act immediately.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words on this important subject.  While Cahir Central Bakery is a long way from where I come from in Donegal, everybody is concerned at recent developments in the bread industry. If, for one second, I was convinced that the price of bread would stay at 39p then I would not stand up to comment <Col N="410" /> on it in the Seanad but I have a strong feeling that the price of bread will not stay at 39p.  That is the crux of the matter and that is the real difficulty.  Bread is being dumped from the North of Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Senator should read the wording of the motion before us.  It is the need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to come to the assistance of Cahir Bakery, with its threatened closure and the loss of 25 jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to stay on the motion.  However with your guidance and assistance, a Chathaoirligh, I have to comment on the basic reason the Central Bakery in Cahir and others are in difficulty. It is basically because of the sale of the 39p loaf.  I might point out that the bakery baking the 39p loaf is not in a position to sell the same loaf in the North of Ireland at 39p or indeed at 49p.  That is the tragic reality.  I see this as a short term price war among the major supermarkets who will not be able to sustain the reduction in the price of the loaf.  I view this as a very serious problem for the Central Bakery in Cahir.  Indeed I can foresee the same consequences for bakeries in other parts of the country.</P>
      <P>I am in support of the motion out of concern for the people of Cahir today and for, possibly the small bakeries in other regions, including Donegal tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very disheartening to see three lorryloads of bread from a bakery in Belfast being dumped in Donegal and other parts of the country and, at a price at which they cannot sell it in the North of Ireland.  The reality is that it is dumping and nothing else.  The people who contend it is not below-cost selling have never ascertained how that price is determined. Should we take their word because they utilise modern technology in the production of bread?  I do not think so.  Flour is a product produced from the land whose cost is easily ascertained.  We should also remember that the labour costs, whether in London, Dublin, Cork or elsewhere in Europe do not vary significantly. We have many modern bakeries utilising conveyor chain ovens but, <Col N="411" /> for the life of me, I cannot account for a price variation per loaf between 76p and 39p.  That differentiation has not been explained by anybody.  I would ask the Minister to ascertain from those people who claim they are not selling below-cost, at 39p, how that price is determined because they owe the public an explanation. If we could sustain the 39p loaf it would be of tremendous benefit to our under-privileged and poor but I predict that price will not be sustained, which will have disastrous consequences for the many people employed in the bakery industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Seán Byrne for allowing me share his time. We represent the same constituency and, therefore, have a common interest in this problem.  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food who has specific responsibility for food and food products.  In this House we have debated, to our mutual advantage, the whole concept of the quality of food available to people and its improvement. That is his brief, how he views it and that has been the manner in which he has worked since assuming office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>And he has done it well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>He has.  That is also why we defend the Central Bakery in Cahir because they have produced a quality product over a long period and provided much employment.  There are agencies available to the Minister whose expertise could well be utilised and deployed in this connection.  For example the IDA have finances available to assist such bakeries to modernise and develop technologically, rendering them capable of competing with the monopolies in the bread industry, such as Dunnes Stores and others.  Why should small bakeries such as those in Cahir, Tipperary, Hickey's in Clonmel, and others have to compete with these monopolies so that 50 per cent of their production is being dumped while this undercut bread finds a market.  It is common knowledge &mdash; and those who have bought it so testify <Col N="412" />&mdash; that this bread being produced at this low price is a bad product; it is not up to standard.</P>
      <P>I would like to know what was the mandate of the consumer affairs committee which investigated the product and its cost.  For example, did they take into account the quality of the ingredients used?  Did they take into account the baking process?  Did they take into account the wage structure of its producers? We should remember that that workforce must rise at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. to put real bread on our tables.  If people like Dunnes can press buttons and produce the equivalent of sawdust being sold as bread, then we have a duty to ensure quality as well as quantity and ascertain that the weight factor is right so that the bread on our tables is good and wholesome.</P>
      <P>Irish consumers are prepared to pay premium prices for good products.  That has been proven in respect of organic food in Cahir where that concept has been piloted and put to the test.  They have produced excellent expensive food of tremendous nutritional quality.  When we examine the price of bread it is important we take everything, including ingredients, into account.  Much suspicion has surrounded the ingredients of low cost bread which has created many problems for bakeries such as the Central Bakery in Cahir.  We are defending them today but it will be somebody else's problem tomorrow unless the Minister of State can convince his senior Cabinet colleague that he has a role and a responsibility in this area, that consumers are prepared to back him in his efforts to protect jobs in the bakery industry and also, in the long-term, to protect the consumer from the monopoly that will follow inevitably this bread war.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity of responding to this motion of Senator Sean Byrne and I wish to thank him for raising this matter and also his colleagues Senator Michael Ferris and Senator Paddy McGowan.  While I have no wish to return to this House on a permanent <Col N="413" /> basis, I am very glad to pay the occasional visit to my former colleagues here.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the Central Bakery in Cahir.  I know that particular bakery well enough because I pass through Cahir twice a week at least.  I want to say here that I will immediately be available to the principals of Cahir Bakery.  If they find it difficult to come to Dublin tomorrow, I will meet them in Cahir tomorrow evening on my way to a more isolated part of the country along with some IDA officials to see if there is any way in which this threatened closure can be averted.</P>
      <P>I have for the past two years put forward very clearly the opportunities and the difficulties for the bakery industry, particularly in the document &ldquo;Strategy for the Development of the Food Industry&rdquo;. I set out very clearly what individual firms and what sectoral food areas have to do not alone to survive but to enhance their organisations.  Additionally, I had a very intensive study done on supermarkets in Ireland and I found that imported into Ireland were £200 million worth of food products which could be produced at home.  Of that amount £50 million is of flour and confectionery and bread products.  That is about £1 million per week.</P>
      <P>I have said clearly to the industry over the past two years that they must be innovative and progressive and that they must modernise their plants.  They must also visit shops and the supermarkets around the country.  It is not necessary to go to the major supermarkets here in Dublin or any place like that; you can go into the shops in Cahir, Clonmel or Clonakilty and find a whole range of imported bakery products which could be and should be supplied by our bakeries here at home.  There are millions of pounds worth of opportunities available to the bakeries and to the bread industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against that background I wish to state that I am available to meet those specifically involved in the Central Bakery in Cahir along with the IDA to see in what way we can set up a strategy, not alone to rescue the company and prevent its closure but to establish it as a viable industry in Cahir.  There is no reason that cannot be done because alongside <Col N="414" /> closures there are examples of start-up companies, relatively small companies, for example, Seery's Biscuits started in a back kitchen but is now a brand leader. Another example is Kelly's Biscuits in Dublin and Braycot bakery products in Wicklow.  These are all very small companies but the one thing they had in common was the fact that they kept pace with the changes which were taking place.</P>
    <P>There is no use producing a product if the consumers are not prepared to buy it and eat it.  Any industry, be it the bakery industry or otherwise, that does not keep pace with the changes taking place in society is doomed.  There will be substantial casualties in the Irish food industry and the bakery industry if the people running those businesses are not alert and aware of the fact that the demands, taste and the trends of consumers are changing very radically.  If they are innovative and carry out their consumer research there is certainly a bright future for them. However, those who are ill-prepared will go to the wall.</P>
    <P>We are not near 1992 yet it is the wish of the Irish people that we should participate in a single European market where not alone will we have competition from larger units within the country but we will face the full brunt of international competition.  People should not close their ears to the reality of international competitive industry.  They must develop a strategy not alone to cope with the reality of 1992 but to take advantage of it, because there are significant advantages for Ireland.  We have excellent workers.  We have excellent graduates. We have very substantial grant aid in the food industry.  There is a grant of up to 75 per cent for modernisation and reequipping industry and firms.  We have training grants of various kinds for our workforce and they will have to be availed of.  To rely on the taxpayer and on subsidy of some kind is just not being realistic.  The one message I wish to give to the industry while giving my commitment in relation to Cahir, is that industry in general will have to gear itself for even more intense competition in the future.</P>
    <P>I have in the document &ldquo;Supplying the <Col N="415" /> Supermarket&rdquo; named 28 specific products that could be produced here.  It is quite easy for anybody to see those products when strolling through any supermarket or shop.  Entrepreneurs can take the opportunity to make a profitable enterprise out of an ailing and threatened industry or factory.  Resources, whether from the IDA or people's own resources, will have to be directed towards exploiting those opportunities not alone in Ireland but on the export market.</P>
    <P>Again, with modern technology there is a very substantial export market.  There is a supermarket trade in the UK of £30,000 million per annum.  There is a catering market there also of £10,000 per annum.  I have initiated discussions and I have met delegations and organised seminars to say to people this is what they should be looking at, not to rely on the hard-pressed taxpayer, on subsidies, on the old order of things, because that is not the way things are going.  Before we reach 1992 which is staring people in the face they should avail of the very attractive grant aid and training programmes because there is no future in the old order of things.</P>
    <P>In relation to pricing in general, as you are aware my colleague, Deputy Burke, has being dealing with this question in recent times.  There is no doubt that this price issue has highlighted the structural weaknesses and the lack of modernisation in the industry.  For traditional products there is an over-capacity there and that will have to be sorted out because the underlying problem is causing this pressure and will threaten the industry itself.  Those fundamental changes have to be addressed straightaway.</P>
    <P>In the area of white bread, you do not <Col N="416" /> have to read health magazines or watch diet programmes on television to realise that the demand for white bread is declining and that there is a more balanced diet demanded by the consumer.  Our mothers were experts at baking brown bread but we did not appreciate the quality and health-giving aspects of that brown bread.  Today the modern consumer is learning that wholemeal brown bread is good for them.  There is a demand for it.  Some of the brown bread we eat from time to time must be prepared in concrete mixers because it is quite inedible.  There is an opportunity there for smaller bakeries throughout the country to have a look at those specialist markets and to take advantage of them. Bakeries will have to find ways of doing that and change the whole culture within the industry.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to reiterate my willingness to respond to Senator Byrne and Senator Ferris.  Their action is in line with their diligent work on behalf of their constituents and the firms in their constituencies. They are right to bring those issues to the attention of Seanad Éireann, and to the attention of the Ministers responsible for their areas.  I will be glad to meet the people from Cahir Bakery. With good sense, with willingness to modernise and to sharpen up and to take advantage of the consumer demand for quality products we can sort out not alone this problem in Cahir but in the industry in general.</P>
