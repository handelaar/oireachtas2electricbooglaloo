      <P>I have notice from Senator John Connor that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to relocate the national air and sea rescue services from Baldonnel to Connaught Regional Airport.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Gerry Reynolds of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to give a direction in writing to An Teagasc under section 19 of the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act, 1988 in relation to carrying on the specified service of the Agricultural Research Station in Ballinamore, County Leitrim which is due to be closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1618" /> I also received notice from Senator Brendan Ryan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to conclude his investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of a homeless man in Thurles in June 1988.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Nuala Fennell of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to acknowledge that there is an obligation on the Government to give special financial assistance to haemophiliacs who have developed AIDS or/are HIV positive, through blood transfusions given prior to 1986.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Paddy McGowan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the upturn in the tourism industry nationally.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Seantors Connor, Reynolds, Ryan and Fennell as suitable for discussion.  I have selected Senator Connor's matter and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m.  Senators Reynolds, Ryan and Fennell may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>The matter raised by Senator McGowan is too wide to be dealt with under the half hour Adjournment procedure and I regret I have to rule that it is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.</P>

      <P>Before I call the Leader of the House on the Order of <Col N="1619" /> Business I wish to make an announcement for the information of the House on the progress report on the reconstruction work in the Seanad Chamber.  This report follows from the visit made by Senators to the site of the Chamber at the end of the last session which by all accounts was successful.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works report as follows:</P>
      <P>As indicated to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, the Commissioners of Public Works are extremely conscious of the wish of the Members of Seanad Éireann to reoccupy the Chamber after the Easter recess and all of our efforts are now being directed towards that end.</P>
      <P>Provided no further unforeseen problems are encountered, we are reasonably optimistic of meeting that deadline which is considerably earlier than our projected completion date of end of 1989.</P>
      <P>The work of restoring the temporary Chamber for use as a Seanad AnteChamber will be undertaken as quickly as possible after the restored Chamber is successfully back in use.</P>
      <P>The repairs to the ceiling are now very well advanced and have proceeded very satisfactorily to date.  Decoration of the ceiling will commence shortly.</P>
      <P>A further progress report will be made when the need arises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank you, a Cathaoirligh, for the progress report on the reconstruction work.  I am glad that the work is proceeding, as we expected it would, and that we will be back in the Chamber after the Easter recess.  It is proposed to take Items Nos. 1 and 2 today and that we take Item No. 2 from 6.30 to 8 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say how pleased I am at the progress that has been made <Col N="1620" /> on the restoration of the Chamber.  I welcome the undertaking given by the Office of Public Works to have us back in the Chamber as soon as possible after Easter. Secondly, may I ask the Leader of the House, in view of the very unsatisfactory situation which arose in the early and middle part of the last session in regard to the ordering of business, to convene a meeting of the Whips either today or tomorrow to ensure that full information is made available about what business is being ordered and that it can be done in a structured way.  Can the Leader of the House give us some indication as to when there might be a debate on Item No. 42, a motion on press freedom and libel, which was discussed at the end of the last session when he indicated his willingness to have it put on the Order Paper at an early stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to welcome the report on the progress which has been made in relation to the reconstruction work in the Seanad Chamber and I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he could give me an assurance that we will be back in time for me to sit in it?  I never hoped to sit in that Chamber, so I look forward to an assurance that he is not going to do anything rash in the meantime.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I would like to extend a welcome and my congratulations to the new Senator Tony Bromell and to say that I welcome the fact that there is now another representative of the education sector and an educationist in this House. I should warn him, however, that his colleagues are deeply suspicious of people who seek to represent third level interests in education here.  I have no doubt&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator, you are totally&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to extend a warm welcome to Senator Bromell and to bring to the attention of his colleagues from Kerry in particular that during his very illustrious term as Mayor of Limerick he had, as it were the audacity to <Col N="1621" /> take a boat down from Limerick, cast a dart in the direction of Kerry and claim control of that county, an act for which he has never been forgiven but we will tolerate him nevertheless.  Welcome, Senator.</P>
      <P>I want to reiterate what Senator Manning said in relation to the programme of legislation.  During the early part of the last term there were long and bitter arguments on the Order of Business day after day on the question of ordering properly the business of the House.  I would also put the case for having an ordered and structured legislative programme for the next number of months.  I should like an assurance from the Leader of the House that he will meet us on that issue, I should also like to get an indication as to the number of days per week the leader would envisage the House sitting during this term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to welcome the news with regard to the Seanad Chamber.  I should like to point out that my name should be associated with Item No. 2 on the agenda because I did sign it.  I would like to formally place that on the record of the House because it is the only method I have now of making sure that my name is associated with that item. I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he is in a position yet to give us information with regard to Item No. 43, that is, the European Patent Convention, because he did say at the end of the last session that he would bring this matter to Government because, I understand, there was some kind of constitutional difficulty involved.  Perhaps at some stage in the near future we could have some information from the Leader of the House on this.  I would like to have an indication, if this is possible, of when it will be possible to take Item No. 44 with regard to the critical situation arising in the Women's Aid refuge.  I will not press this further because it would be inappropriate and I have no doubt I will be brought to heel but I will be bringing it up this afternoon at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I would like in a very special <Col N="1622" /> way &mdash; and I do not intend or wish to abuse the proceedings of the House &mdash; to put down an amendment to the Order of Business and see if the Leader of the House will find that there is some scope for manoeuvre here.  I would like Item No. 30, if at all possible, to be taken today.  There is a very particular reason for this and I do not believe I will be abusing the procedure of this House if I mention it.  Yesterday or today &mdash; there is some dispute about the date &mdash; is actually the 44th anniversary of the disappearance of Raoul Wallenberg.  I am in possession of information which suggests that the Soviet Union is currently preparing a report on this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris, you are asking for Item No. 30 to be taken today but you cannot make a speech on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I was simply indicating why this is a very special day.  Forty-four years ago a man who was a shining example to the whole of Europe, and particularly Christian Europe, disappeared without a trace.  There seems to be a possibility of exerting some pressure on the Soviet Union with the advent of <i>perestroika</i> and <i>glasnost</i> and I would like to put an amendment that this item be taken today for the very special reason that it is such a significant day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want, first of all, to associate myself with the remarks of Senator O'Toole in welcoming Senator Bromell.  I think we have got to the position now where, notwithstanding some of the criticism, there are more academics on that side of the House than there are on this side so perhaps some of the criticism about us academics will be directed towards the Fianna Fáil back-benchers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;rather than to those on this side who are accused of that apparently awful sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I also, with your indulgence, a <Col N="1623" /> Chathaoirligh, compliment Senator Hanafin on the award he received during the period of the recess and ask through you if he got the permission of the Government to accept what is effectively an award from a foreign government?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to clear the Order of Business today.  Will the Senator stop that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless I think it is an interesting question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a constitutional question&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I also ask the Leader of the House if the Government have any proposals to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the first Dáil.  I have the distinct impression that because of the radical nature of the declaration of that body most of us in Irish politics today would prefer to forget it.  I think it is an important epoch in our history.  Seventy years ago on 21 January the first Dáil met and issued a ringing and radical declaration about what this country should be about. It is a pity we are not going to commemorate it and if the other House is afraid to commemorate it I would ask the Leader of the House if it would be possible for us to commemorate the event for them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator John Robb, then I will call Senator Ferris.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to refer to the topic which has been raised by Senator Brendan Ryan because I think it would be a great tragedy if it passed unnoticed that we are approaching the 70th anniversary of the meeting of the first Dáil. <Col N="1624" /> My grandfather, who was a Unionist, was invited to the first Dáil.  Needless to say, like many Unionists of his time he did not accept the invitation but I am certain that as an Irishman many of them would have wished to work for a resolution of the problem we have had on this island, which continues to exist on this island and to which, hopefully, we will all address ourselves most earnestly in the forthcoming session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>So that I can clear today's business I want to request the rest of my colleagues to stop making speeches.  We are getting back to the old position where what is being talked about now should have been discussed by Senators and the Whips before they came into the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Having accompanied the Cathaoirleach to see the renovations in the old Chamber I want to endorse the statements that have been made about the work which is being carried out and to pay tribute to the Office of Public Works for the obvious effort, enterprise, ingenuity, craftmanship and dedication in so ensuring that the Chamber will be in the sort of condition all of us would wish.  We should pay tribute to them today.  They are on target with their work and, hopefully, all the new Members who have never sat in that Chamber will have the opportunity to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Even for a short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter how short it is, and only you, a Chathaoirligh, will be privy to that kind of information.  I also want to say that the Labour Party are willing to enter into any negotiations with the Leader of the House in coming to agreement about the Order of Business, procedures and our legislative programme. In a spirit of goodwill for the New Year I think it would be appropriate for all of us to co-operate with one another in trying to make this House as effective and efficient as possible.  As a Tipperary man and Munster man, I want <Col N="1625" /> to welcome the new Senator, Senator Bromell, from Limerick.  I was also elected in a by-election and I am still here in spite of some efforts to the contrary. The Senator is as well elected as anybody else and long may he be here.</P>
      <P>I think it is appropriate also that I be associated with the congratulations to Senator Hanafin, who is a Tipperary man also.  A very high and distinctive honour has been bestowed on him and as a sitting colleague of ours we should be associated with the congratulations to him.  He is not the first Irishman to be honoured nationally or internationally by other Governments.  People like Seán Mac-Bride have been so honoured by other governments and it is appropriate that we should pay a tribute to him and convey our best wishes to him.  It is a very high honour for anybody in this country and we should be proud of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also glad to hear about the good news about the Chamber and I looked forward to resuming my own seat, even if only for a brief period.  With reference to Senator Ryan's wish to point out to the Government that 21 January 1919 is an important date, I would agree, of course.  I would also have to point out to the Senator, however, that the democratic programme of the first Dáil was a piece of eyewash.  It was mere window-dressing and it had nothing to do with the Sinn Féin movement.  It was put in there against the wishes of the IRB&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness, I think the whole lot of you should put down a motion and have a discussion on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply trying to dispel a myth, and the more myths we can dispel the better.  With regard to Senator Ryan's and Senator Ferris's references to the honour conferred on Senator Hanafin, I must say I had not suspected Senator Ryan of having a sardonic sense of humour.  I cannot take seriously a motion which would express the elation of this House at the participation of one of our colleagues in a <Col N="1626" /> referendum campaign the outcome of which was disastrous and not in the best interests of the Irish people.</P>

May I say how pleased I am that the intellectual and academic wing of Fianna Fáil has been so enormously strengthened by the addition of Senator Tony Bromell.  Tá áthas orm é a fheiscint anseo.  Tá súil agam go bhfanfaidh sé tamaillín linn agus nach n-imeoidh sé ró luath to dtí áit eile.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to keep up with the positions which people aspire to and hold in this land, and I apologise.  I <Col N="1627" /> should like first to congratulate you on the report about the Chamber next door and how the work is progressing.  I was not able to be escorted around the Chamber by you because I was not there; I missed that privilege.  Secondly, I would like to endorse what my colleagues have said about Senator Hanafin's appointment. I think it was an appropriate appointment for Senator Hanafin and we should all recognise it as such.  But we should also recognise the divisive nature of the reasons for that appointment.</P>

I should also like to endorse what everybody has said in this Chamber, which is to congratulate &mdash; and I hope this is non-contentious &mdash; the new Senator for Fianna Fáil.  I am delighted. Everybody in this House says he will be a very worthy Member and he does add to the calibre on the benches over there. Having said that, I would like to ask your guidance, a Chathaoirligh, because this is a matter which I think is relevant to the Order of Business.  I regret enormously that it is well known that the new Senator was elected in a most unusual way.  I regret that members of the governing party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, getting away from the irrelevancies that were brought into the debate, some questions were asked in connection with the ordering of Business for the future.  I would suggest that the Whips meet tomorrow morning immediately after the Order of Business when we will have a programme on which agreement can be reached to a certain degree as to what will come before the Seanad over the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>The matter of press freedom and libel can be discussed again tomorrow morning.</P>
      <P>A question was asked in connection with Item No. 43.  If Senator Norris refers to a speech made by Minister Calleary just before Christmas, he will have the answer.  There is a problem with Item No. 43 which relates to the European Patent Convention.  A comprehensive reply was given that regard stating the position the Government are in.  As far as I am aware the European Patent Convention has not been ratified by any State. If Senator Norris and the other Senators who are interested in this matter would refer to a speech made just before the Christmas break by Minister Calleary, I think their query will be answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, on the matter of the importance of the first Dáil, I recognise that all Senators would wish to have the anniversary of the first Dáil commemorated in some way.  The Fiftieth Anniversary was commemorated.  The Dáil sat in the Mansion House on the fiftieth anniversary. I can discuss the matter with the <Col N="1630" /> Government and with the Whips tomorrow morning to see whether we can have a debate to commemorate in an appropriate manner the 70th anniversary of the first Dáil.  On Item No. 30 relating to Raoul Wallenberg, I suggest that a Standing Order 29 motion might be the appropriate way to have that brought before the House.  There is no other way we can bring it before the House today.</P>
    <P>The Order of Business stands.  As I have said we will take Items Nos. 1 and 2 today; Item No. 2 between 6.30 p.m. and 8 p.m.  I do not think there are any other questions on the Order of Business.</P>

      <P>I was hoping that the Christmas holiday would have a setting effect on some of the Senators who continue to disrupt the Order of Business here but obviously that is not the case.  I hope we will not continue, in this present session, with the same king of futile, irrelevant, repetitive arguments that we have had in the last session.  It is unfortunate that this House should be brought into disrepute.  I hope that in this session we will see a more orderly Order of Business each day and that Senators will allow the Cathaoirleach and the House to proceed with its business without unnecessary interruptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Appropriation Bill gives us an opportunity each year to examine the <Col N="1631" /> performance of the Government in office.  Today we can state categorically that the present Fianna Fáil Government since they came into office in 1987 have been the most effective administration in many a long year.  We must remind ourselves that it is not yet two years since the outgoing Coalition Government reneged on the responsibilities and shied away from the harsh decisions that were required in order to put the ship of State back on course.  Of course, the Labour Party had already opted out of Government, leaving Fine Gael to carry the can. It was then left to the new Fianna Fáil Administration to pick up the pieces and launch their plan of action to put this country back on the road to economic recovery.</P>
    <P>The consistent sound management of this Administration has succeeded in restoring business confidence. This, indeed, is in sharp contrast to the general feeling of despondency and lack of hope experienced at the end of 1986. Interest rates have fallen by up to 6 per cent due to firm Government action on public expenditure.  This has encouraged many young people to buy or build their own homes and has saved existing mortgagees many hundreds of pounds in interest repayments.  At the end of 1986 interest rates were almost 14 per cent. Industrial output and export growth are continuing very strong.  The balance of payments will remain in surplus in 1989 for the second year running.  This contrasts with a deficit of £513 million in 1986.  Inflation is now running at 2 per cent, its lowest level in 25 years, the average rate for 1986 was 4 per cent. Borrowing has been reduced by a third to under £1,200 million.  This compares with a borrowing figure of £2,145 million at the end of 1986.  The budget is fully on course to achieve its targets.  Temporary tax incentive schemes have ensured significant progress in the collection of tax arrears.  Indeed, the tax amnesty introduced by the Government has been a great success and has succeeded in bringing in £500 million extra for the <Col N="1632" /> Exchequer.  The 63 per cent of taxpayers, almost two-thirds, are now paying at the standard rate of tax.</P>
    <P>We have heard much recently about the new Structural Funds.  In that regard the Government have set up seven regional committees to utilise to the maximum effect receipts from EC Structural Funds up to 1992.  Those regional committees are actively involved in preparing projects in their regions which they hope will qualify for Structural Fund grants and create additional jobs in these regions.  Those major improvements in the economy during the past two years are positive proof that this Government's plan of action is bearing fruit.  I know that if further action is required to prime the engine of State, the Minister for Finance, in his budget next week, will do just that.</P>
    <P>We have a long way to go yet but I am satisfied that this Government have the commitment, the political will and the determination to surmount any obstacles that might come in the way of achieving their targets as set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  The twin evils of unemployment and emigration have still to be solved and the upturn in our economic fortunes has not been translated to the extent we would like into increased levels of job creation.  The recovery in all sectors of the economy is evident but it is especially evident in industry.  In the past year manufacturing output was 12½ per cent higher in the first nine months of the year than in the first nine months of 1987.</P>
    <P>There has been a marked improvement in the international competitiveness of Irish industry due to favourable developments in inflation, interest rates and industrial costs such as electricity and telecommunications.  An increase in industrial output of 10 per cent in 1987 continued in 1988 with an increase of over 15 per cent in the first four months of the year.  A figure of 9,500 jobs have been created in industry and in international services in the first six months of 1988 in line with the overall jobs commitment given in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  Thirty-seven projects <Col N="1633" /> have been approved for the financial services centre at the Custom House Docks site with an employment content of 1,000.  Twenty seven new industrial projects were announced in September which will create 2,250 jobs with an associated investment of £55 million.</P>
    <P>This year also we have seen a rapid recovery in agriculture after two poor years, 1985 and 1986.  This is very encouraging because we all know that agriculture represents a vital part of our economy.  It accounts for 10 per cent of our gross national product, 20 per cent of our total employment and 30 per cent of total exports.  Last year was extremely successful for Irish dairy exports which, at £1.2 billion, showed an increase of 26 per cent on 1986 levels.  Some 7,000 dairy farmers in the more severely handicapped areas will now qualify for increased grants of £70 and £66 on beef cows in dairy herds which should help to increase cattle numbers.  Higher prices have been paid to cattle producers during 1988, particularly for well finished animals. Prices have remained consistently strong and are in the region of 7 per cent higher than in 1987.</P>
    <P>Sheep farming remains a very attractive farm alternative and the value of this sector's output in 1987 was £113 million. Indications are that the 1987 levels will be exceeded in 1988 and exports for the first half of 1988 were up 16 per cent on 1987.  In addition to the payment for their output, sheep farmers will have received some £62 million in ewe premium payments and nearly £12 million in headage payment grants in 1988.  The revised western package will give a much needed injection to cattle investment of around £200 million in disadvantaged areas.  The western package will now apply to all the designated areas which cover nearly two-thirds of the whole country.</P>
    <P>The new approach adopted by the Minister for Agriculture and Food to the eradication of bovine TB is very welcome. The problem of animal disease has plagued Irish farmers for the past 30 years.  Vast amounts of taxpayers' money have been used to eliminate TB from the national herd, but unfortunately, the <Col N="1634" /> incidence of the disease is still too high. I hope that the setting up of the eradication of animal diseases board will finally get to grips with this problem and achieve their target of reducing the existing levels of bovine TB by half in four years.  Adequate funding has been guaranteed by the Government for their programme.  This is very important for the working of the board, because far too often in the past we have seen programmes launched which due to lack of finance fell asunder and did not achieve what they set out to achieve.  I hope this new board will be successful.</P>
    <P>We who have an interest in agriculture look forward to the day when we can say that the incidence of bovine TB has now been reduced to acceptable levels.  The Minister has already adopted the recommendations of the new board.  The main feature of these new measures is to increase the level of reactor grants and a move away from the existing flat rate of depopulation payments to a system where varying rates of grants are paid depending on the type of animal.  This is a major step forward because the system of payment for reactors was a bone of contention with farmers for a long number of years.</P>
    <P>Another great step forward by the Government in the past year is the extension of the social insurance scheme to the self-employed, including farmers, from last April.  Until now up to 70 per cent of all self-employed people had to fall back on means-tested assistance payments in their old age.  Farmers and the self-employed can now build up entitlement to a guaranteed basic pension for old age and survivor's benefits.  They will no longer have to worry about the visit from the social welfare officer and the means test when they reach the age of 65 or 66. When they have paid their PRSI for the ten years preceding that age, they qualify and that is it.  In that connection I would hope also that the Minister would be able to do something for farmers in the 56 to 66 year age bracket who are prepared to pay an extra premium to benefit in full from this scheme.  I know it is not easy to satisfy every need when resources are <Col N="1635" /> scarce, but in spite of that scarcity the Government have maintained the overall value of all social welfare payments by the payment of a 3 per cent increase in July.  The total increase for social welfare recipients in 1988 was £101 million.</P>
    <P>In spite of all of that, there is still poverty in our society.  There are still families who are at their wits end trying to provide the essentials of life on a very low income.  This stress on family relationships often leads to alcoholism, drug abuse, homelessness, violence and family break up.  This poverty is often not of their own making but is thrust upon them through circumstances well outside their control.  It may be that the breadwinner has lost the job, a fate which very many families have experienced in recent years, resulting in loss of income and hardship.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> pledged that greater social equity in terms of access to social benefits and to health and education services is a prime object of Government policy.  I hope the Government will fulfil this promise by adopting the values of equality and equity as central operating principles.  This will demand policies which would guarantee every citizen a right to an adequate income related to prevailing living standards, and to equality of access to health care, housing and education.  The Fianna Fáil Government have always been noted for looking after the less well off people in our society.  I am sure they will not be found wanting now either, and as the resources become available I know they will have regard to the submissions made to the Government by various groups such as the Combat Poverty Agency and others who have made a submission to the Minister for Finance and have set out their priorities in tackling this problem.  I am sure the Minister will take note of those submissions and act on tnem as the resources become available to him.</P>
    <P>There have been many other noted improvement in the last year-and-a-half since this Government came into office but I will not list them all here today. I have, however, highlighted the main <Col N="1636" /> achievements of the Government, the reduction in interest rates and inflation. We are satisfied that the economy is on the upturn.  I hope that this Government &mdash; even though they are in a minority position &mdash; will continue with their <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> that they will not be put off course by any groups, be they political or otherwise, and that they will continue to build up the economy.</P>
    <P>We know harsh measures have to be taken to get the country moving once again.  As I said, there is a huge number of young people unemployed but I believe there is now a light at the end of the tunnel.  We will shortly see the day when those young people will have the opportunity to get a job in their own country, to build homes and make their future here.  That is what we are working towards.  I hope this Government will get the opportunity to implement all the objectives set out in their programme for Government two short years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am the first from my party to speak on the debate proper.  I would like to extend my welcome and my congratulations to Senator Bromell and wish him well.  As a veteran of six or seven years in this House, I sincerely hope he has a long and satisfying career here.</P>
      <P>As I have often said in these debates, I speak for my party on agriculture, and in this debate I will confine myself almost exclusively to that subject.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food contributed to the debate on the Appropriation Act in the Dáil.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, did not refer to agriculture in his opening speech in the Seanad on 16 September last, I will deal with what the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, said in the other House on the same day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He spoke glowingly, in his usual political terms, about the agri-industry over the last two years.  He spoke of the industry being in a depressed state up to 1987 and said that in the last year he found it &ldquo;vigorous and buoyant&rdquo;.  He said agricultural income in 1988 would top the £3 <Col N="1637" /> billion mark, an increase of 8 per cent over 1987 and also spoke about family farm incomes realising about £1.5 billion, an increase of 16 per cent on the 1987 figure.  What he conveniently forgot to say was that the 1988 farm incomes barely reached, in real terms, the 1984 level, and 1984 was not a bonanza year.  This is the dishonest exercise this Minister started in 1987 when he compared the figures for that year, which were relatively favourable, with 1986 which with 1985, were absolutely disastrous years purely because of the weather.  The improvements in agricultural output and income in 1987 and 1988 represent nothing more than the weather-related and, to a lesser extent, favourable market-related improvements.  These two elements alone, which no act, word or deed of the Minister or the Government had any influence over, led to the better position in which agriculture finds itself today.</P>
    <P>The Minister admitted when he spoke in the Dáil that almost all the increase in the value of agricultural income in 1988 was accounted for in the substantial and unexpected increase in milk and beef prices during that year.  Milk prices improve because the external and Community market for dairy produce increased arising from the super-levy working its way through the Community milk production.  This significantly reduced output throughout the Community and also reduced the butter and skim milk powder mountains throughout the Community.  These positive factors &mdash; and we welcome them &mdash; started to bring real market forces back to the Irish and European dairy markets for the first time in more than a dozen years.  Hence the buoyant market for milk at co-op level during the year.</P>
    <P>For much the same reason, the beef industry was buoyant, indeed to a remarkable level, during 1988.  We owe this to the decline in our cattle numbers. The forces of supply and demand gave us this buoyancy.  That is fine for the present but it bodes disaster for the future as our national herd declines over future years. <Col N="1638" /> Teagasc predict an 8 per cent drop in marketable cattle for 1989.</P>
    <P>When speaking in the Dáil the Minister failed to say that net profits to beef producers, when all input costs were taken into account, was only 5 per cent in 1988. That is exactly what the return to beef farmers was in 1987.  Teagasc predict a margin of 5 per cent for these farmers in 1989.  The returns from beef production in Ireland in 1988 were as low as £300 per hectare or about £100 per acre, the lowest return in the older EC.  Let us not forget that beef production is the largest single component in Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>There was another negative feature of the Irish beef market in 1988.  The slaughter of prime steers in numerical terms fell by 4 per cent over 1987 but live exports of cattle, from which we got no downstream benefit, increased by 3 per cent over 1987.  On top of that, the numerical output of cattle in Ireland in 1988, owing to slaughter in our meat plants and to live exports, fell by 3 per cent over the figure for the previous year.  We got an increase in the value of beef output in 1988 from two very vulnerable sources.  First, the value increased because there was a significant increase in the carcase weight of the steers presented for slaughter during the year, as high as 6 per cent over 1987. This came about because in 1988 we had for the first time in a decade an early spring with excellent grass growth.  In April, May, June, July and August there were higher than average temperatures, and hence excellent grass growth and for the remainder of the year the soil temperatures were higher than usual.  This precocious growth gave us better returns in terms of heavier animals leaving the fields for slaughter.  By the law of averages, we will have to wait another decade for the forces of nature to smile so kindly on us again, and the forces of nature have a lot to do with farm incomes.</P>
    <P>The other reason for a buoyant beef market in 1988 was a local shortage of supply in Ireland and in the market of one of our major customers, the United Kingdom, and the fact that the common agricultural beef intervention régime was by and large benign.  Those days are <Col N="1639" /> ending.  Early in 1988 we entered a new round of GATT talks in which the Americans put particular pressure on the European Community to dismantle, as far as possible, the propping up of beef prices. The Commission has proposed to reduce very significantly the amount of beef that may be allowed into intervention during the current year of 1989.  We did not have those factors working against us in 1988. Of course, they had a major influence on the way the market moved during that year but we will have negative elements moving against us in the coming year.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated in relation to milk, we get an 11 per cent increase in income from this sector in 1988 purely because the super-levy policy had moved the unwanted mountains.  Our creamery milk intake in the current super-levy year is down to about five billion litres from about 5.3 billion litres in the previous super-levy year.</P>
    <P>Of course, the rise in dairy farmer incomes is not all related to a better market for milk products.  At least some input costs to dairying, and above all the volume of inputs for dairying, declined in 1988 for a number of reasons and this is estimated to account for about three of the 11 percentage points of increase in income to that sector that year.  Politics certainly had nothing to do with that.  We will be very lucky to get these factors working for us again next year, and the best expert advice warns us that an increase of 3 per cent in volume of gross dairy output is the most we can expect in the current year of 1989.</P>
    <P>Sheep did extremely well in 1988. There is no denying that.  Unlike cattle, we had a big increase in flock numbers, up by 17 per cent on 1987.  Slaughterings for export were up by 10 per cent and we had a price increase to the producers of about 4 per cent on average for the full year.  The size of the flock continues to expand and there are indications that the national sheep flock will increase by possibly 9 per cent in 1989.  All this good news is in response to market conditions and market forces.  The EC sheepmeat <Col N="1640" /> supply/demand situation is still below par, but the day of market equilibrium is approaching.</P>
    <P>The sad thing is we are losing out on a great deal of sheepmeat income because of the Minister's inaction in setting up a classification régime for lamb in our factories.  This would encourage more of our farmers to produce more lambs of correct weight and conformation for the lucrative French market.  It is generally estimated that lamb exports would be £15 million more valuable to us now had we animals suitably prepared and produced for the Paris market.  When, we ask the Minister, is he going to move on setting up a lamb classification scheme?  If the Minister for Agriculture and Food is not here to reply to this debate, I ask the Minister of State who is standing in and who may be replying to answer that question.</P>
    <P>The Irish pig industry remains an area of unrelieved gloom and near disaster. Pig numbers and slaughterings continue to decline.  We now have barely two million pigs in our national herd.  We had 2.25 million in 1984 and 2.5 million pigs in 1974.  In recent years we have expended enormous sums improving our slaughtering facilities.  In fact, we improved slaughter capacity by about 50 per cent. Yet, only two-thirds of our slaughter capacity is being used.  The producers have become more and more hard pressed.  Recently the American drought gave them another big hike in feed prices. In this country, we have a much lower feed efficiency than is the norm among our competitors in Europe.  The pigs we produce are too light and preponderantly geared to the low return cured bacon market.  The Dutch are beating us blind in world markets because they produce a much better mix of pig weights and consequently far more diverse pork products that fetch much better prices on world markets nowadays.  Dutch producers' feed costs are also almost 10 per cent lower than ours.</P>
    <P>What is the Minister doing while this once very valuable industry falls apart, bringing millions of pounds of recent public investment down with it?  The <Col N="1641" /> answer is absolutely nothing.  He made not a single move in 1988 to help this sick man of Irish agriculture, if I may slightly misquote Gladstone.  He made not a single, useful, intelligent suggestion. Could we appeal to him from the floor of this House to move away from his usual woolgathering on this subject?  He might listen for a change to the advice and warnings of the IDA ane Teagasc about this industry.  For heaven's sake, let him do something.</P>
    <P>Let me comment on the performance of agriculture as a component of our food industry in the last year.  To save time I will confine myself to our main horticultural product, that is potatoes.  When this Government came to office they made a huge propaganda brouhaha about growing all our own food, especially vegetables.  Potatoes were singled out as representing a particular national scandal because we were importing potatoes at a rate on average of 50,000 tonnes per year. An Bord Glas were set up and a Minister of State put in charge to set all these wrongs to rights.  We were promised new market organisation, controlled imports, new strains of early varieties, and all kinds of market incentives &mdash; free grants, free advice, etc.  What happened?  What are the results?  The results are an unmitigated, unholy mess and a ridiculous disaster. By June 1988, the Central Statistics Office enumeration showed a decline of 10 per cent in the acreage under potatoes last year and yields in the first half of that year down disastrously.  The first half of the year is the time we must get our production up to ward off imports.  In the second part of the year we produced this huge glut in the autumn, giving an annualised drop in price to producers of 15 per cent.  Unless the Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, wakes up very soon, and more so the Cabinet who give him the policy and the money, we may very soon be importing 100 per cent of our potatoes. I might mention to the Minister of State because he is shaking his head, that the last year for which we have completed figures for potato imports is 1987.  In that year we imported 52,000 tonnes, 2,000 tonnes above the average we were <Col N="1642" /> importing up to 1986, and the figure will be the same in 1988.</P>
    <P>Let me come away from the various sectors and their performances and look at the Common Agricultural Policy and developments in 1988.  The Brussels Summit of February 1988 effectively froze the amount of money to be spent in future on the price guarantee side of FEOGA.  However, they decided to double the funds to the guidance side of FEOGA between now and 1992 and they changed the collective name to &ldquo;Structural Fund&rdquo;.  Under this new umbrella we have the old Guidance Fund that gave various grants to the backward and less favoured areas &mdash; for instance, cattle and sheep headage, building grants, land improvements, some pollution control and formerly, drainage grants &mdash; the Social Fund, which is the largest component is used for industrial training, agricultural training and education, and the much vaunted Regional Fund.  Under these latter headings we got something over £300 million in 1988, if my figures are correct, and we got about £1.1 billion out of the price guarantee side in 1988.</P>
    <P>Assuming that in the year just gone, 1988, we got £300 million plus under the structural headings, we should get about £600 million plus by 1992.  Let me ask the Minister, how much of this £600 million, £650 million or whatever the various indices for inflation may fix the figure at by 1992 will he get for agriculture?  Has he taken into account that agriculture in Ireland may have lost £500 million in guarantees with the continued squeeze from all sources on intervention buying by 1992?  If that has happened, we certainly will not have got a very good bargain.</P>
    <P>What guarantees has the Minister for the small farming sector to deal with that kind of eventuality?  Can he guaranteee the less favoured areas a doubling of the paltry amounts they receive now because they are going to need it?  Can he guarantee a doubling of the livestock headage payments as an income supplement to these people and as a fillip to the national herd?  Can he guarantee grant-aid for <Col N="1643" /> farm improvements like pollution control, better livestock housing and land improvement like drainage on which the Government I might say sold us down the river &mdash; that is, on drainage grants &mdash; at last year's farm talks?  I hope the Minister has his eyes open at the Cabinet table and that he is saying to his colleagues that the reason we are getting a doubling of the Structural Fund is to compensate for the gradual dismantling of the intervention system under the Common Agricultural Policy and to cushion the underdeveloped areas and regions against the problems caused by freer trade.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister for Agriculture and Food is aware that some of his colleagues are going around the country throwing millions of this increased Structural Fund after everyone they meet.  His colleague, the Minister for the Environment, has already promised millions of pounds to almost every parish in County Mayo.  On his travels throughout the country he appears to have this ubiquitous supply of confetti to throw around from what he calls the Structural Fund. Everywhere his colleague, the Minister for Education, goes nowadays it is like a wedding because she is always more than well supplied with this Structural Fund confetti for her travels.  The little effort of the Minister for Agriculture and Food of going around with a few thousand pounds led by a brass band, or was it a pipe band, from village to village in Tipperary is a tawdry joke when compared with the flambouyant extravagance of some of his colleagues spending the Structural Fund.</P>
    <P>There has been a much publicised debate recently on the level of poverty here and much of it concentrated on urban poverty, which is often very apparent in poor housing estates and in blighted areas of unemployment in the towns and cities.  There is no doubt that this mass deprivation exists.  Nowadays, 35 per cent of the population are on or below the poverty line and so it qualifies to be called a mass problem.  There is no <Col N="1644" /> doubt that the monetarist policies pursued with such zeal by the Government have made the deprivation more acute for those who are already in the poverty trap but the number of people reduced to the level of poverty in the past two years has increased significantly also because of the assaults on welfare, the health services and so on.  In all this debate there is one sector of poor people seemingly forgotten, and they are the poor people and families found on small farms scattered all over the country but especially in ther less favoured, backward and declining areas.</P>
    <P>The Combat Poverty Agency, in a recent report, reminds us that the ESRI report on poverty reveals that 23 per cent of poor households, that is, where the weekly income for every adult equivalent in a household is £40 or less, were engaged in farming.  The Conference of Major Religious Superiors in another recent report on poverty stated that many farm families are totally marginalised from the benefits of the Common Agricultural Policy by pointing out that for every two farms who had an increase in income in 1987 &mdash; remember what I said earlier, that these income increases were purely weather-related &mdash; one farm in this poor or marginalised category had a decrease in income.  Will the Minister bear these figures and people in mind as he and his colleagues work out the priorities for distributing the Structural Fund?</P>
    <P>In 1988 we got no hint of a land policy from the Minister.  May I ask &mdash; again, I want a specific answer to this question, please, in the Minister's reply &mdash; what proposals, if any, the Minister, and the Government, have in this important area?  Have they any proposals for assisting the small to medium-sized enterprising farmer to augment his farm size to increase his family income or is he to be left forever to the ravages of the marketplace to get his additional land, that is, if he wishes to increase his acreage to stay in farming?  Will the Minister reply to that specific question because those farmers were told very often by Fianna <Col N="1645" /> Fáil in Government and when in Opposition, that they would not have to wait forever, that there would be a land policy to assist them.  There used to be an old shibboleth in Irish politics to the effect that small farmers were the backbone of Fianna Fáil.  When I look at some of the assaults that have been carried out by the Government on the interests of small farmers, assaults, indeed, that have got rid of many of them, I conclude that if the small farmers were the backbone of Fianna Fáil that party should now be very much an invertebrate creature.</P>
    <P>One of the most unpopular moves by the Government in the agricultural arena in 1988 was the forced marriage of ACOT with AFT.  In this House &mdash; and on this side of the House, too &mdash; we vigorously opposed that move and we are proud of that.  I, and my colleagues, pointed out in that debate that the drastic budget cut of 43 per cent, the hamfisted and hurried manner of the marriage and the getting rid of half the staff could not work and I now regretfully say, with the benefit of hindsight, that we were absolutely right. Farm advice is no longer existent except for the top category of commercial farmers. We warned that some of the best people working in advice and on research would leave both bodies under the new umbrella and they have.  Training for young farmers has suffered and, of course, farm research has suffered terribly. Research stations at Belclare and Creagh have been closed.  Those stations carried out research into livestock enterprises &mdash; cattle and sheep &mdash; particularly in the area of twinning.  Their work was very appropriate to the west and the shameful, lame excuses of Mr. Joe Rea, the new Chairman of Teagasc, as he tried to defend his actions and to shield the Minister, are absolutely disgraceful.  It is something which makes every farmer more than a little sick.</P>
    <P>Research in the area of agricultural economics has suffered even more.  The Rural Economy Centre in Dublin had an outstanding record in the old days of An Foras Talúntais in compiling the annual farm management survey.  That was a marvellously informative, objective and <Col N="1646" /> comprehensive document.  It was completed using the principles of scientific certainty and total professional detachment. Its findings were not what the Minister of the day wanted to hear or what he wanted the farmers and the public to hear.  In short, they told it as it was &mdash; as they say in the United States &mdash; and they were always objective and accurate.  No longer can that happen because of the 75 researchers and field investigators that were there in 1987 only 35 are left.  Agriculture never before operated in an era where there is, and will be, a rapidly changing economic and policy environment. The Common Agricultural Policy, the cornerstone and indeed very often the crutch of Irish agriculture for the past 15 years, is changing fundamentally and as a support mechanism it is disappearing.</P>
    <P>The pressure on agricultural supports &mdash; I mentioned that before &mdash; coming from the GATT negotiations also threatens the certainties and all the we relied on and looked upon as certain in the past. We never needed more than we do now the services of a high powered economic and market intelligence unit to advise us and chart our future, yet the Minister with the compliance of the new chairman of Teagasc sacked half of the rural economy research unit and closed down vital research stations from which came a whole range of innovations and discoveries which had a profound effect on the agri-food industry in recent years.  It is no wonder that the Minister did not want watchdog committees like the old ACOT committees, comprising of public representatives and representatives of the various farming interests, on Teagasc.  All the Minister wanted was a compliant chairman to decimate the research, educational and training services relating to our most important industry.  The Minister wanted somebody who would take the public flak for this outrageous policy debacle and he certainly found that in Mr. Rea.</P>
    <P>We do not argue with the Minister in his review of the year on 16 December last when he speaks of the increases in beef and milk prices in 1988.  That was <Col N="1647" /> the result of an unexpected but fortunate market upturn.  Our argument relates to the total lack of policy to boost agricultural output and to develop downstream food processing industries.  The Minister conveniently forgot to say in the Dáil review that there was no expansion in any of our farm enterprises in 1988 except in sheep and poultry.  All other enterprises have declined or remained static.  The gross value of our agricultural output reached £3 billion but the total volume of all agricultural produce declined by as much as 2 per cent in 1988. That is the fundamental weakness of Irish agri-business.  Had commodity prices in 1988 remained as they were in 1987 there would have been a significant fall in farm incomes last year because of the fall in output.  At this early stage the portents for 1989 are that there will be a major assault on the Common Agricultural Policy's beef regime.  Unless the Minister asserts the national interest as Deputy Austin Deasy did in 1985, the largest component of Irish agriculture, the beef industry, will be in serious hot water before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>We cannot expect benefits this year as a result of terms of trade because input prices have declined relative to the price value of output.  In normal years the relationship between output prices and input costs has been fairly consistent, but in the last two years input prices have declined while market forces have forced up the prices of our main commodities to an unusual degree.  This windfall on the terms of trade will not continue in 1989 because imports are already rising as a result of the US drought and increases which we already know about, will come in fertiliser prices.</P>
    <P>Agricultural incomes in 1988 were also boosted by subsidies which were not related to increased production.  In 1987 £180 million in such subsidies was paid out to farmers.  These subsidies increased to £260 million in 1988.  They came under the heading, livestock headage which remained the same in 1987, but the increased subsidies were for the milk cessation scheme, the linear reduction of <Col N="1648" /> milk scheme and the EC special beef premium scheme.  There is every indication that these payments will not be as high this year and that they will bring another down pressure on incomes in 1989.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Appropriations Bill gives us an opportunity to review the events of the past 12 months as well as giving the Minister the appropriations necessary to deal with matters in the year ahead.  Last year was a year of exceptional economic progress.  It exceeded the most optimistic expectations.  There is now a confidence that we can overcome the economic problems of this country. The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has been the key to our success.  The programme is unique and has worked well.  It is based on commonsense, realism and the participation of the major representative groups in our society.  We have had our best year of industrial peace since the sixties and the lowest inflation rate since the early sixties.  Our 2 per cent inflation rate is below the UK, the EC and OECD average.  Low inflation gives us reduced costs for energy, telecommunications, transport and infrastructure and allows us to be more competitive in the export market.</P>
      <P>The Government were exceptionally successful last year in collecting outstanding taxes.  I am proud to be a member of a party and of a Government who finally took decisive action to collect outstanding taxes.  The total amount collected was in the region of £500 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total national debt is still in the region of £25 billion and it costs us approximately £2 billion every year to pay the interest on that debt.  This annual interest payment is equivalent to nearly £2,500 annually per taxpayer.  It presents major difficulties for real economic development.  Strict discipline must be maintained in relation to our public finances.  The improvement in public finances has contributed to lower interest rates which are at least four or five points below our British counterparts.  Lower interest and mortgage rates have been of great benefit to every sector of the <Col N="1649" /> economy.  The lowering of interest rates has allowed us to release exchange controls with little or no disruption.</P>
    <P>Last year the Government honoured their social welfare commitments.  There was a general 3 per cent increase in social welfare payments in the budget.  There was a 6 per cent increase in child dependant allowances and an 11 per cent increase in payments to long-term unemployed people.  The Minister should give special attention to needy groups, especially the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Government have honoured their commitment to tax equity.  It is not possible to achieve tax equity unless everybody is paying his fair share of tax and in this area the Government have been extremely successful.  The introduction of the tax amnesty and self assessment were major factors in helping the Government in tax reform.</P>
    <P>The Government are to be congratulated on their efforts to reduce unemployment.  The increase in employment by 6,000 in the year to April 1988 is the first significant increase since 1980. The aim of the Government is to achieve a significant reduction in unemployment figures.  The committee set up to monitor progress, under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, have reported progress in job creation in all sectors targeted by the programme.</P>
    <P>Fresh evidence that our economy is picking up is contained in a report published by Dun and Brad-street. The report states that a total of 10,132 new companies were launched last year &mdash; the highest number in a decade.  With economic activity on the increase there was a slowdown in company failures last year.  The number of firms going to the wall dropped from 869 to 803.  Irish companies in receivership fell by almost 48 per cent, from 132 in 1987 to 69 last year, while winding-up petitions dropped by 21 per cent, from 81 to 64.  The slow-down of failures among limited companies, coupled with the fall in receiverships and winding-up operations, is evidence of businesses expanding and an improved cash flow position.  In 1987 our exports <Col N="1650" /> exceeded the £10 billion mark.  In the first ten months of 1988, to October, our exports exceeded the £10 billion mark and there are indications that they will reach a figure of £12 billion in the full year.  A balance of trade surplus of £1.7 billion was also generated in that year and it is expected that the final figure for that year will be even higher.  Exports overall showed an increase of 14 per cent. It is particularly satisfying that indigenous companies' returns show an increase of 16 per cent.</P>
    <P>The construction industry has experienced a tough time but, with the introduction of the provisions of section 23, lower interest rates and reduced inflation, is showing signs of recovery.  I would ask the Minister to seriously consider extending the provisions of the business expansion scheme in the forthcoming budget. Considerable progress has been made within a short space of time.  There is now a commonly held belief that we can overcome our economic problems through a combination of reduction in Government spending and effective collection of outstanding taxes &mdash; giving us all hope for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to speak for very long.  My colleague, Senator Connor, dealt at great length with agriculture.  In passing I should say it is my belief that there has been great movement in the agricultural service sector over the last couple of years.  The evolution of the public limited companies from the larger co-operatives constitutes a timely and welcome development.  The co-operative movement, as envisaged by Horace Plunkett and the people who built up that movement and rendered such tremendous service to Irish farmers in the last 70 odd years is not as effective or efficient once its units become larger and individual members become numbers in a computer.  At the same time the contribution made to our economy by individuals or firms such as Goodman International is without doubt, unprecedented. Their competitive approach to business has been of tremendous benefit to our farmers and agriculture in general. <Col N="1651" /> Large agricultural co-operatives &mdash; such as Kerry and Waterford and Avonmore PLC &mdash; have by their forward planning rendered modernisation easy for thousands of farmers who can avail of new development opportunities despite the difficulties imposed on them by quotas, restrictions and levies of one kind or another.  The Goodman entrepreneurial spirit has been a beacon of light in what would have been otherwise a very dull period in Irish farming.  Their investment in agriculture and success in developing markets in Europe and in third countries &mdash; have provided competition within that service sector on the domestic scene and constitute a completely fresh approach to inputs and outputs in agriculture.  This has been to the benefit of farmers and farm prices, remembering that, in general, farmers have endured considerable difficulties in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government decision to abolish the county committees of agriculture indeed almost to abolish agricultural education or research as we knew it, is much to be regretted.  Research has been affected adversely by the closing down of so many research stations.  If we do not carry out research into the effectiveness of, say, sprays, manures or the performance of new varieties of seeds or whatever what will be the effect on the competitiveness of our producers in the coming years?  I am convinced that the Government decision <i>vis-à-vis</i> An Foras Talúntais will cost us a tremendous amount.  We must remember that individual firms or big multinational firms supplying sprays &mdash; all of which are extremely expensive &mdash; carry out research into their products but their motivation is to make a profit.  They do not care what happens so long as they are not sued at the end of the day.  One would need much time to read thoroughly all the small print on the litre or five litre can of spray.  Inevitably one finds they blame the weather, the operative or the method of application, but there is very little room for blaming the fact that the chemical in the can did not do what was <Col N="1652" /> expected of it.  Such large companies have themselves well covered.</P>
    <P>Over the past 20 years farmers have depended on the agricultural institute &mdash; as we know it &mdash; to carry out such trials. I would suggest it constituted a foolproof system.</P>
    <P>How farmers can operate without that back-up service is something that has not yet been acknowledged.  I wish the new organisation Teagasc well.  I hope they will be able to fill that gap.  However, having regard to the resources allocated to them, I predict they will not be able to provide the same as did An Foras Talúntais and the county committees of agriculture in the past.  I predict that that loss will be felt most severely by smaller, marginally economic farmers.  For example, whether one calls on an adviser for five acres or 500 acres the fees appear to be the same, which is somewhat unfair principally on the smaller uneconomic farmer who needs that advice and the back-up service to eke out a livelihood.</P>
    <P>On this subject of the role that the agricultural institute played the Government took a decision recently to allocate all the cut-over bogs &mdash; which amount to over a quarter of a million acres &mdash; to the new forestry organisation, Coillte Teoranta, in the teeth of 25 years of research on the part of An Foras Talúntais, and that is an extraordinary thing for any Government to do.  There is well documented research on the use of peat lands for forestry and for the last 40 years the Department of Forestry have planted trees in all types of soil.  Even though they know exactly the type of peat required in which to grow trees, they have now decided that they are going to allocate the whole lot for forestry.</P>
    <P>Seven years ago the biomass experiment, which cost the EC almost £5 million, failed.  How can a Department of State take such an economic decision having regard to the information before them or do they not read their files anymore? I would like the Minister when replying to address these very serious questions.  In the midlands, not to mention the rest of the country, there are 200,000 acres of cut-over bogs.  That is a <Col N="1653" /> large amount of land.  Parts of it should have been allocated to the small farmers from whom it was compulsorily acquired for as little as half a crown an acre from 1932 on.  It is nonsensical to give this land to Coillte Teoranta and leave it to them to decide what to do with it.</P>
    <P>Coillte Teoranta have been given 33,000 acres of forest in Laois-Offaly &mdash; or is it in Laois alone?  On this huge amount of land they employ 50 people with almost half of these posts being managerial posts.  If we were to talk about creating employment, surely it is possible without any great help to devise a plan on the usage of this land which will give a greater return in employment, while not completely ignoring the possibility of increasing the acreage of many small and medium sized holdings adjacent to these boglands.</P>
    <P>An Foras Talúntais have very clearly indicated, in their research, that it is possible to reclaim, for summer grazing purposes, cut-over bogs at a cost of something like £400 per hectare.  This works out at a little over £200 an acre which is extremely good value having regard to the fact that land on the open market is realising between £1,500 and £2,000 per acre in the midlands at present.  If it is possible for him to do so I would like the Minister to respond to some of those points because I believe there are opportunities open in all of the counties in which Bord na Móna have established operations since the enactment of the Peat Development Act of the mid thirties.  I take it we will have an opportunity later to develop this argument when the new legislation dealing with Boad na Móna comes before the House.</P>
    <P>In looking at the Vote for the Department of the Taoiseach let me say that while I can accept there is a scarcity of funds in every Department and that money must be made available to every sector, the time must come, and economists must surely accept this, when the reductions and retrenchment must stop. Otherwise, our infrastructure and the services we provide will deteriorate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1654" /> Let us start with the Department of the Taoiseach, and again this has a bearing on the Minister's Department.  I hope that greater funds will be made available to ensure adequate infrastructural maintenance of the National Gallery.  I cannot help noticing the building because my office is situated alongside it.  I am not a critic of the Board of Works but ongoing repairs must be carried out to ensure that pictures are safely stored there.</P>
    <P>I would hope that adequate funds &mdash; I do not know what the appropriate figure is &mdash; would be made available.  We should protect our national heritage and ensure that the premises are maintained to a satisfactory standard and that we, as legislators, cannot be accused of allowing a valuable portion of our heritage to be destroyed through neglect, decay or dry rot.  I hope the Minister will take a special look at the National Gallery, which is provided for under the Vote for the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Vote 16 covers the Farm Classification Office.  I presume it relates to spending agreed to in a previous year because I cannot imagine that there are people still working in the Farm Classification Office since it was disbanded the month after the Government came into office.</P>
    <P>Let me refer very briefly to Vote 20 which covers the Department of Justice. This is a Department that the Department of Finance should have a certain amount of respect for.  When James Dillon was Leader of Fine Gael he very often quoted Edmund Burke who said that all you need for security and peace is eternal vigilence.  I am horrified by the discovery of arms and ammunition in the midland counties.  It is a matter of some concern to people who want to live in peace, harmony and security that there have been several arms finds of late in the midlands.  I appeal to the Government to strengthen the management within the Garda.  Because of the embargo and cutbacks far too many management positions in the Garda Síochána have been left unfilled.  Far too many posts of superintendent have not been filled.  While there may have been a saving the Garda, whether the numbers are adequate or <Col N="1655" /> not, will be certainly less effective if there is no proper management.  As citizens of this country we are entitled to believe that the forces responsible for the preservation of law and order and justice are up to an adequate standard.  Recently there have been arms finds in the midland counties &mdash; in Counties Offaly, County Laois and County Kilkenny.  Every vacant post of superintendent in those counties should be filled without delay. The embargo should be abolished although I believe there must be some order of priorities.  It is frightening that there seems to be a sleeping cell of terrorist activists across the midland counties although there are no visible signs.</P>
    <P>I want to address my remarks to Vote 22, particularly the subheads on prisons and places of detention.  This is a very difficult area and is one to which, I as a visitor to a prison, have a small social input.  I should like additional resources to be made available for both educational and remedial facilities in prisons.  There is a limit to what can be achieved, but a very high proportion of prisoners appear to be illiterate or, at best, semi-literate. Much can be done for those prisoners even if they are only serving a few months.  I make a special appeal to the Government to allocate greater resources to the Minister for Justice so that these people can be given a second chance and to make available to them every possible modern facility to improve their educational standards.</P>
    <P>There is another point I should like to make.  Over the Christmas I was rather saddened to hear a senior Minister commenting on the parole system in Northern Ireland and on the situation in the Northern jails, while at the same time very few, if any, of our prisoners &mdash; and certainly none of the long term prisoners &mdash; were released on parole.  I am sure many applications and representations were made on behalf of prisoners.  We should avoid hypocrisy in this area.  It is difficult enough to operate in this area and we need a very clear and unbiased approach to this problem.  This is not the kind of subject I like to debate in public, but I <Col N="1656" /> believe there is much we can do to improve the situation and to offer some hope to our overcrowded prison populations. I look forward to greater resources being made available in the present year for the upgrading of accommodation at least in the prison I am most familiar with.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to Vote 26 for the Department of the Environment.  It is very difficult being a member of a local authority at present.  Individual members of local authorities, irrespective of what the party they belong to, or even if they do not belong to any party, are embarrassed because for some years there was no money to provide and maintain the services we have enjoyed for many years. I think there were only five new house starts in my county last year.  If that rate continues during the coming year, it will mean the return of housing lists and all the hassle involved in the allocation of scarce housing resources.  In fact, in my county the local authority do not even have sufficient funds for maintenance. Last year the council took a decision to maintain or repair houses for old age pensioners only.  I do not know where this is going to end if the proper financing of local authorities is not tackled head on.  I do not think people will offer to serve on local authorities if they are not given the authority and power to have an input into the provision of services in their areas.</P>
    <P>Looking at this Appropriation Act we can see that the appropriations for the year in question have not been satisfactory and I hope the Minister can do something to redress this problem.  The budget will be introduced next week and I hope the increased resources we have read about will be made available to upgrading local authority services and the health services.  The estimates for the health boards are being considered at present, and again the Government are asking for considerable cuts in the health area.  The health board in my area have been asked to reduce their expenditure by £1.2 million.  It is very difficult to know where to start to do this.  In 1984 the cost of running the services in the four <Col N="1657" /> counties in the administrative area of the Midland Health Board was about £64 million or £65 million &mdash; I think that has been reduced to £49 million this year.</P>
    <P>That is a huge reduction.  I was passing the mental hospital in Portlaoise last night and could not see any light on in there.  I thought they were all on strike or dead.</P>

      <P>Those of us who serve on these boards with some misguided idea of being public spirited, find our efforts are being frustrated.  I do not know what kind of service the Government are aiming at, but if the Department came up with a long term plan and said exactly what kind of service we were aiming at, that would be all right but we have created the situation where the CEO says there will be 120 more job losses and this effects every employee in the service. This is creating unnecessary hassle and apprehension in the service.  I do not want to develop that.  As my colleague said, we will have an opportunity at the health board meeting to go more fully into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During this debate we should indicate to the Minister the things that we as public representatives find very difficult to handle.  I appreciate that there has to be an order of priorities.  I appreciate that there must be a budget.  I certainly appreciate the public's difficulties in accepting the idea of a higher percentage of general overall taxation.  Nobody wants to advocate the introduction of new forms of taxation; nevertheless, we must stay on an even keel and there must come a time when the service is tailor-made or reduced to a position where it should level off and is absolutely stabilised. I would suggest to the Minister that we have reached that position now, certainly as far as the health services are <Col N="1658" /> concerned and especially where the services provided by county councils and local authorities are concerned.</P>
    <P>With those few remarks I would like to express the hope that the Minister, or his colleagues, will be able to advert to one or two of the points I have made.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Appropriation Act and to compliment the Taoiseach and the Government on the exceptional year 1988 was in every way.  I can say, without exaggeration that 1988 exceeded everybody's expectations.  If there was one little hiccup in 1988 it was that Galway beat Tipperary in the All-Ireland hurling final.  Apart from that one would have to say it was an exceptional year.  I want to state that I expect 1989 will be a little better in that we will overcome Galway in 1989 and win the All-Ireland and that the economy will go from strength to strength in the meantime.</P>
      <P>The confidence that has been generated in the future of the country is great and numerous people who, a couple of years ago, did not see any hope or any light at the end of the tunnel now are beginning to think differently.</P>
      <P>On the whole problem of emigration, I had occasion over the Christmas to meet a number of people in London who saw in the upturn of the economy reason for great hope.  Heretofore they felt that the chances were that they would have to make their homes in London and in other places.  Now they are the development of infrastructure and investment by different companies in the economy here at home and many feel that there will be opportunities for them here in the not too distant future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole economic scene in the past two years has really turned around and investment has been accelerating at a very fast rate.  I would sound a note of caution by saying that we still have a long way to go, but the important thing is that we are moving in the right direction.  All our problems have not been solved.  To relax the restraint and discipline at this stage would undo the great work that has <Col N="1659" /> been done heretofore and put at risk all of the gains we have achieved so far.</P>
    <P>We must build on our success.  If we are to solve the major problems of unemployment, emigration and taxation as proposed in the <i>Programme of National Recovery</i> we must stick with the targets we have set ourselves.  It strikes me as somewhat peculiar that the various pressure groups and interested organisations who were vociferous in their condemnation when the Government undertook the programme with the help and co-operation of the social partners and stated <i>ad nauseam</i> that this approach definitely could not and would not work, are the very ones who are now advocating that we should loosen the purse strings and dish out moneys here, there and everywhere.  The very people who gave advice in one direction a couple of years ago are giving advice now in a different direction as to what should be done with the money, whereas they could not see the approach that was being adopted working in any way whatsoever.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was a unique programme.  The social partners and the Government combined and the results of that combination has been, to say the least, absolutely fantastic. As other speakers have already mentioned, we have the lowest inflation rate since 1960.  It is below the UK rate. It is below the EC rate and the OECD national average.  We have, to a very great extent as well, industrial peace.  We have a huge surplus in our balance of payments and we have substantial economic growth in a number of different areas.</P>
    <P>It is important that we realise the Government cannot give in to the pressure groups I mentioned earlier.  To do that would undo all the good work that has been done.  Effectively, that would mean that we would have to start increasing borrowing and again lose the confidence and the good reputation we have gained on the international scene.</P>
    <P>One has to be aware of the huge effect the tax amnesty had in bringing in the £500 million.  As has been mentioned by <Col N="1660" /> the Taoiseach and by a number of Governement Ministers and other people here today, it was a once-off effort and the likelihood of that happening again is very remote.  Having said that, one still has to accept that the national debt stands at £25 billion.  Senator Cullimore mentioned that the annual interest repayments are in the region of £2 billion which is £2,500 in annual interest per taxpayer.  Those statistics in no uncertain terms, show how they would affect our ability to allocate resources for social services and economic development.  Every single sector is seeking increases in their allocations and they will all give very reasonable and adroit arguments as to why those increases should take place.  One should stand back and question where all those increases are to come from.  In a situation where we have a national debt of £25 billion where in God's name is the opportunity when, on the one hand, you are trying to reduce a debt of that nature and on the other hand you are giving increases in many different areas.  Everyone recognises that increases in a certain number of areas would be more than welcome and everyone would be hoping that that could take place but we have got to create the environment and the conditions where one can afford to make those increases without having an adverse effect on the overall workings of the economy.  That is extremely important. I fail to understand why people are so vociferous in condemning the Government for not doing X, Y or Z.  It would be hard to believe that such people do not understand exactly what would be the difficulties involved in complying with the various requests made.</P>
    <P>Obviously, all we can do is expend what we can afford to pay for out of the goods and services we produce.  The simplest way of all is to relate it to a household budget.  A household can spend X number of pounds each week and has to live within its means, if it does not it gets into difficulty and gets into debt.  I know it is a simplistic approach but it is an easy way of explaining exactly what one has to do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1661" /> The Government are laying the foundations for future progress and are creating the economic environment.  That is extremely important.  If the economic environment is not there we are wasting our time.  We have got to create confidence. We are a small open economy and it is important that people would be aware of that.  We depend to a large extent on selling our goods abroad.  We must have investment in our own products if we are to increase our sales.  We should pass a vote of congratulations to the industry side.  In the past two years there have been enormous increases in our balance of payments surpluses as a result of the energetic approach industry has adopted.  Having said that there are difficulties involved in giving increases and in allocating resources particularly in social areas which are non productive in the sense that they do not generate their own income.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> recognises the need to improve the circumstances of the poorer sectors and also recognises the need to make progress on tax reform.</P>
    <P>In relation to the educational sector, in which I am directly involved, I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Education on upgrading the NIHE in Limerick and in Dublin to the status of university.  It is a fantastic achievement on their part and is well deserved.  I am more <i>au fait</i> with the situation in Limerick than in Dublin and I have first hand knowledge of the fantastic developments that have taken place in the NIHE in Limerick since the early seventies.  This upgrading is extremely important, perhaps not to any great extent on the home front because everybody is aware of what the National Institute for Higher Education means both in Dublin and in Limerick, but for the graduates of the establishments who go abroad.  It appears that they did have some difficulty in explaining exactly to our European partners and to others what a degree from the National Institute for Higher Education meant.  In other countries establishments which might have the same name tag would not be capable of bestowing the same type of degree on graduates as are <Col N="1662" /> those two institutions.  The Minister, too, should be complimented on this move. As a pointer to the Minister we would hope that she would keep an open mind regarding the regional college in Thurles. This is an area in which I am very interested.  When the time is right I trust she will consider reopening the files on the regional college in Thurles.</P>
    <P>In relation to tourism the whole mid-west region is now under the operation of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  In that particular region we are unique in that we have a State agency responsible for industry and that it has now taken under its wing the area of tourism.  That will result in enormous benefits for the whole mid-west region particularly the are where I live which is on the shores of Lough Derg, on the Shannon.  The facilities and the opportunities for tourism development in that area are enormous.  If I do have one misgiving &mdash; and I spoke here at length about it almost 12 months ago in relation to that area &mdash; it would be <i>à propos</i> CIE and in particular the rail service which is provided for that area.  I would like to reiterate the argument I advocated at that particular time for a train service to the mid-west region.  There is a train service from Dublin to Limerick and to Thurles for people who live in the northern part of Tipperary.  I have in mind areas such as Nenagh, Roscrea, Cloughjordan and Birdhill which have only the services of one train each day to and from.  We have a difficulty in that we have to change trains at Ballybrophy on the way down. In their wisdom or otherwise CIE see fit that one of the inter city trains which they provide leaves Heuston Station at 5.40 and does not stop at Ballybrophy.  It has all the facilities of modern conveniences including dining cars etc.  At 5.45, five minutes later, a commuter train leaves for exactly the same destination.  The difference between the two trains is that there are no facilities on the 5.45 train and it stops at Ballybrophy.  That is the service that is provided for people who are travelling from Birdhill, Nenagh, Cloughjordan and Roscrea and all that area who depend on that service.  I cannot <Col N="1663" /> understand why CIE cannot organise the inter-city train which leaves Dublin at 5.40 to stop at Ballybrophy as it would take only two to three minutes.  I have had numerous representations on umpteen occasions asking if the inter-city service could be provided, because the train people are forced to use on the service at present must be from the Dark Ages; there are no service facilities whatsoever on it.  In these modern times people expect some comfort when travelling by train.  I ask the Minister to have a chat with the Minister for Tourism and Transport to see if he can influence CIE to change the scheduling of that train service. It would be of great benefit to the people of north Tipperary and parts of Galway also.  If a proper service were provided, far more people would use it. There has been a lot of controversy in recent times about the competition with private bus owners etc.  If CIE want to compete with private operators, they will have to provide a proper service.  An additional stop would mean that a train stops in a particular place for five minutes.  I do not know how that time difference would have any great effect on CIE's scheduling.  If that were done it would help the tourism potential in that area enormously and would increase the revenue to CIE.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate what has been said on the economic recovery and the Government's achievements in the past two years.  With reference to Senator McDonald's point on local government financing, everybody recognises the difficulties in providing finance.  If the finance is not there, there is very little that can be done.  However, there was a unique development at local government level this year that was an outstanding success &mdash; the tenant purchase scheme. The Minister is to be congratulated on bringing this scheme forward.  The scheme gave people, who would otherwise not be in a position to do so, an opportunity to buy their own houses.  I, and I am sure all politicians, have had the experience where houses which were <Col N="1664" /> being sold by local authorities for a minimum of £4,000, having made allowances for all the relevant discounts, were being insured for a minimum of £20,000.  That was an enormous benefit to people.  This was a big advantage for those on a differential rent scheme.</P>
    <P>Where people were not in a position to buy the house outright under other schemes &mdash; and quite a majority of them were not &mdash; and if they were now getting loans from the county councils, within a very short time buying out of their house would cost less than they would pay under the differential rent scheme because of the fixed rate of repayment.  That was of enormous benefit.  When people own their own house they take greater pride in it.  I can see enormous benefits coming from this scheme and the number of people who applied prove how successful it was.  I welcome this opportunity to say a few words on the Appropriation Act and I look forward to a very successful 1989.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make an observation on one of the points Senator McKenna raised about many people not being able to understand certain things. The fact of the matter is that we can understand an awful lot but certainly there are an awful lot of things we cannot understand.  Speaking for my humble self and fellows like me, I can never understand why there has always been a poor and underprivileged class and why under the capitalist system it seems necessary to perpetuate it.  This has puzzled me all my life.  That is not just an off-the-cuff remark but is my serious concern about the society we live in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us have regard to what brought about the formation of the Labour Party in 1912, a time when there were many underprivileged people, and the run into the 1913 strike; but right into the twenties and thirties we always had this big social gap between peoples.  There were some adjustments in the sixties and the seventies when wages were higher. Although profits and wages were higher, there was not one extra person at work at the end of that decade.  That is a fact <Col N="1665" /> of life.  There were 1.5 million people at work in 1970 and at the end of the decade, when everyone had done well both in wages and profits, the same number were still at work.  In effect, the system we work under either by design or by accident seems to believe in the perpetuation of an underprivileged class.  To add substance to my point, I would like to quote from the 1941 Labour Party document <i>Labour's Constructive Programme for an Organised Nation</i>.  The paragraph, which refers to a capitalist revolution, is very close to what we are seeing at present.  It is very relevant.  The paragraph states:</P>
    <P>Ireland is in the midst of a Capitalist Economic Revolution.  No matter how it may be looked at, the economic change that is taking place before our eyes is capitalist in conception and in design.  It will provide profits for capitalists and owners of wealth but it will also increase... and extend the dimensions of the propertyless class who will be the victims of unemployment, bad housing, poverty and disease.  And be it always remembered that Capitalism is the most foreign thing in Ireland.  It is vitally important that we should take stock of the position before the vested interests develop their strangle-hold on the people, and that in the building up of the Nation's industries and in the development of its resources, steps shall not be taken which will afterwards have to be retraced.  It is important, too, that Ireland should benefit from the experience of nations which have long since passed through the same stages of capitalist development and now afford a striking illustration of its folly.</P>
    <P>At the present moment the country is definitely committed to a policy of building up a capitalist economy with all its evil influences and soul-destroying effects and to the making of all the mistakes which have already been made in Great Britain, in Germany and in America.  Political and economic history will have been written in vain if we in this generation, when laying the foundations of our social <Col N="1666" /> life, model our structure on a design that has nothing to recommend it except greed and the glittering wealth it produces for the few at the expense of the many.</P>
    <P>Are we not in this day and age talking about the very same thing with a little change in emphasis?  Are we not at that stage again?  With regard to the present situation, we in the Labour Party would like to make two essential points on the whole question of the Estimates and the Appropriation Act.  First, the public who pay the bills are entitled to know how their money is spent and to see that it is well managed, efficiently distributed and not wasted.  Secondly, the revenue which finances essential programmes must be contributed fairly by every sector of the community.  Let us look at the whole question of whether the money is being well managed and efficiently distributed. There is a debit and a credit side.  Let us take the financial recovery first.  Inflation is at a 20 year low of 2 per cent; Exchequer borrowing is at 4 per cent of gross national product; interest rates have fallen from 14 per cent in mid-1987 to 8 per cent; the trade surplus for 1988 is £2.3 million; the debit GNP ratio has been stabilised; GNP has grown by 2.4 per cent in 1988; there is a substantial balance of payments surplus; domestic trade has benefited very considerably from lower energy costs; the mortgage rate is at its lowest level for almost 20 years and farm family incomes have increased by 17 per cent over 1987.  That is a lovely picture.</P>
    <P>We will now examine whether the money has been well managed and fairly distributed and whether everybody is paying his fair share.  The price we have had to pay is that the unemployment figure is over 230,000; nearly 19 per cent of the labour force have no jobs &mdash; if the true figure was known it could be nearer 20 per cent; 36 per cent of our young people and families are emigrating every year; 1.3 million people live on or below the poverty line; environmental services have deteriorated; health services are being denied to those in need; there is a <Col N="1667" /> two-tier health care system in hospitals; there is less access to education and the resources in that area have been cut; social welfare entitlements have been reduced and overseas development aid is being denied to those who are starving.</P>
    <P>We should have regard to the fact that we are a little cynical about whether you can deal effectively with ensuring a fair distribution of wealth.  In order to ensure a fair distribution of wealth there should be political will-power and also the belief that it can be done.  I do not know whether the will-power exists or whether the desire is strong enough to distribute the wealth of the nation in an even way. With every passing day there are more signs of divisions and alienations.  That is not just expressed by way of hospital waiting lists, closed wards or the numbers of people leaving the country; it can be seen from the large numbers of people, young and old, who are always asking where it is all going to end.  After the next budget that same question will be asked and will be asked more frequently.</P>
    <P>It is a cruel irony that that does not have to be the case.  We do not have to copy the British solutions or the tenets of Thatcherism.  Their approach is a very crude one and should not be copied. Down through the years we have copied the British to a great extent, particularly with regard to so-called economic development.  There is a consensus in the Dáil in favour of that approach but that does not mean that they are right or that it should be accepted.  If the argument is made that the position was never any different and that there will always be a two-tiered system, the consensus that is operating at present, particularly in the Dáil, with regard to social and economic policy is wrong.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis when we look back at the history of the State, the economic developments and the distribution of money, the people have been excluded to a great extent, there is no room for people.  I hope that is a fair statement.  It is not meant to be derogatory in any way but it seems that is the position.  We took many things for granted, things which we <Col N="1668" /> believed had good effect.  The fallacy that all public spending is bad is the one matter that has been exposed.  It has become almost a cliché in Irish life that the only thing we need to do to solve our problems is to cut public spending. Regularly we hear on radio programmes that the climate for enterprise will be improved, the economy will start to grow, unemployment will drop rapidly and we will all have more money in our pockets.</P>
    <P>That is a simplistic approach and for that reason it is obviously attractive. Many people who believe that believe also that public spending is the root of all evil but that is not the case.  The mentality of an acquisitive society has been at work down through the years and has not changed very much.  By generating the idea of materialism, as expressed through the media, we have added to that mentality and we now accept than there is no blood being shed.  There is a similarity with the North.  We have a clear polarisation of the working classes versus everybody else.  I am not suggesting that there are only two classes.  There is a class in the middle that will very shortly, if we are not careful, become the new poor and this is also of concern to us.</P>
    <P>What we never seem to get across is that public spending represents such items as wages for nurses and teachers, children's allowances and the various support schemes for the unemployed, the handicapped and the ill.  We must remember that when we cut public spending we cut essential services.  This never comes across on the radio.  You hear the argument I have mentioned about a reduction in the number of beds etc. but it never seems to come across to people that in essence when you cut public spending you are cutting off essential commodities that we are entitled to take for granted because there was enough money to go around if it had been properly distributed.</P>
    <P>The public become aware that public spending is not such a bad thing after all only when they lose something they have been dependent on.  At local level that fact stands out sharply.  A constituency <Col N="1669" /> that has been badly affected by the cutbacks illustrates very well the impact of the present policy, as it is described.  I do not describe it as a policy &mdash; I describe it as a programme.  Old people are informed they must make their own way to a day care centre because the ambulance service which they had relied on for months or years is withdrawn because of the public cutbacks.  Then people realise that public spending is not such a bad thing.</P>
    <P>We cannot work on the basis of calling cutbacks policy and suggesting that by cutback measures we are going to solve all our ills.  The effects and the consequences of such practice are sometimes invisible and probably remain so for years but they are real and they are frightening to us in this House and to anyone who understand what is going on.  For example, you can create a housing crisis if you go too far on cutbacks as happened in the sixties.  Then we told ourselves that problem was dealt with.  It is happening all over again.  In some cases we have got more houses available than are needed and in other cases we are well on the way to resurrecting the crisis; we are on the way back to all the bitterness that arises from the family stress that results from cutbacks in the housing area.</P>
    <P>In education we may have had improvements over 15 years or so but, suddenly, due to a mere cutback notion, these improvements are wiped out almost at a stroke.  The child-centred curriculum is in the process of being substituted, so to speak, by a system of overcrowded classrooms staffed by teachers who are under stress.  Again this is a result of describing cutbacks as policy.  It is not policy.  It is a programme similar to the one being followed in Great Britain which results in crisis after crisis in working class areas.  It is widening the gap and will continue to do so unless somebody's mind is made up that the programmes are a poor substitute for good, detailed economic planning that will ensure that the money collected in tax is well managed and distributed efficiently.</P>
    <P>Another effect of the cutbacks is that people without education have to go <Col N="1670" /> abroad.  I do not know too much about the American scene but on the English scene a great number of Irish people must out of necessity squat in council houses. These people have not the education to enable them to pick up the jobs that are there.  Generally speaking those who are not resourceful enough to squat are living very rough indeed.  I am not suggesting that everyone who emigrates does so because he has not got a job, but the bulk of working class people who emigrate do so.  People who have left primary school and who have no secondary education emigrate out of necessity.  Because they have not a skill, because they cannot be afforded a higher standard of education due to family circumstances, they have to go out to look for a shilling or else leave home to allow the loaf to be shared among the rest and they end up in Great Britain, particularly in the London area, living rough or squatting.  Generally speaking, they become dropouts from society.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this hand to mouth basis of dealing with the economy will ever enable us to solve the unemployment problem.  In the final analysis if the whole question of job creation was properly pursued without the State being at the centre and not just providing the means, and I do not mean through agencies, we might arrive at a solution. However, I do not think that will ever happen.  I think we will go on taking decisions in an <i>ad hoc</i>, arbitrary way.  If we are to have good Government we must talk about the consequences as well as the benefits.  Some good things are happening, as has been pointed out. There are the debit and credit sides. Governments must be concerned with the consequences of what they are at. Consequently, I would be more than delighted if what they are at will lead to a fairer distribution of the wealth of the nation and will allow the whole question of tax to be dealt with in a way that will bring about that improvement.  However, on the basis of experience I have doubts about it.</P>
    <P>I have known men in this city who have never had a fulltime job in their lives, <Col N="1671" /> who went to their graves as unemployed people.  They may have got three days' relief work on and off, but they stood around corners and I know for a fact that never in their lifetime had they a full, secure, pensionable job.  Their work was casual, such as loading furniture vans or digging the roads for the Corporation on three day relief.  There is no change really.  You can be poor now in a different way from years ago when people did not realise that lack of education, hospital facilities etc. was poverty.  At that time people believed that those who could only afford to give their children bread and dripping were poor but not destitute. Those who gave a down-and-out a place to sleep on their landing in their tenement house, as was common in those days, were considered generous and to be expressing concern for other people.</P>
    <P>However, there is so much greed about today, with the profit motive being everything, that the poor are not as generous towards other poor people as occurred in the twenties and thirties.  It is not surprising that people are getting angry.  I do not wish to be the person to spread alarm and tell the Government that we have reached a crisis but it is no harm to point out that in the fifties when 57,000 were unemployed people lay on O'Connell Bridge in protest.  I do not know if we will have similar protests, and I hope we do not.  I hope my fears will be proved unfounded.  It is important that the Government should not cut back on spending without taking into consideration the question of distribution among the poor and so on.  My ego will not be dented if I am proved wrong and I will be pleasantly surprised if in 12 months time I can be told that there has been a marked improvement in employment. I hope I will be told that instead of cutbacks the Government will be easing the people back into the comfortable standard of living they enjoyed some years ago.  There is no reason why that should not be the case and it could come about if the Government managed the State's finances efficiently and distributed the wealth equitably.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1672" /> There was not an increase in child benefit in 1987 or 1988 and, as a result, many families are suffering.  The Labour Party are concerned about that because we were responsible for the introduction of that scheme in 1986.  I am saddened to think that the Government's attitude of cut, cut, cut has resulted in many families struggling to survive.  Under the long-term disability scheme a person is required to have 260 stamps, or five years constant employment, to qualify compared to 156 stamps in January 1987. That has resulted in a saving of £9.25 million but thousands of people are suffering. I understand that 40 per cent of all disability benefit claims are of more than one year duration and subject to rigorous medical examination.  Those basic entitlements were improved by the Labour Party and that is why we are concerned about the changes in them.</P>
    <P>In order to be entitled to unemployment benefit, maternity benefit or disability benefit the number of paid or credited contributions has been increased from 26 to 39.  That affects 12,600 adults. In the seventies and early eighties the Labour Party fought hard to improve those entitlements.  A widow, a deserted wife, an unmarried mother or a prisoner's wife is no longer entitled to claim the half-rate payment or the disability benefit, maternity allowance or unemployment supplement from this month.  The Labour Party were responsible for the introduction of those benefits in the seventies. Optical treatment benefit has also been cut.</P>
    <P>The amount paid under the social employment scheme was reduced in 1987 from £70 per week to £60 per week, a retrograde step.  I could quote such statistics all night.  The Government attempted to abolish the National Social Service Board but, fortunately, reversed their decision.  I am not claiming that the Labour Party were responsible for that but we did campaign against that move. Since the thirties the Labour Party, in Opposition and in Government, have pioneered the development of a modern comprehensive system of social welfare and in doing so from time to time have <Col N="1673" /> overcome the many influences who opposed progressive measures to eliminate poverty in our society.  Once again it falls to us to defend the hard-won rights of the poor.  We will do that in the work-place, at union meetings, among community groups, in our social contacts but, most of all, in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the decision to abolish pay-related benefit and not to pay child benefit in respect of the first child. I understand that as a result of those decisions 475,000 families will suffer.  I was disturbed to learn of the decision to withdraw child benefit from families with a gross income of more than £15,000 per annum and the increase in the number of waiting days under the disability benefit scheme from three to six.  There is a lot of concern about the decision to cut the duration of unemployment benefit from 15 months to 12 months, with effect from 1 April for new claimants.  I understand this will affect 15,000 families.  I understand that it is intended to cut what has been described as the &ldquo;heating season&rdquo; by one week at each end of the season without any increase in the amount of the fuel voucher which now stands at £5.</P>
    <P>All we have had from the Government's policies are decisions that make the poor poorer and there is no evidence that the Government will not continue that pattern in 1989.  It is easy for Members to ask the poor to hold their fire and to tell them that when the economy improves a lot more will be done for them.  We all accept that our economy is in a bad state and that there is a need to adopt stringent measures.  We have been able to overcome many problems but we have never managed to be able to have a fair distribution of resources.  We never seem to be able to find a way to use the free market enterprise system to create sufficient jobs for the people who have become redundant from the land and to facilitate people who have lost their jobs as a result of higher technology.  We have never been able to cope with the rate of change in a way that would reduce unemployment, and as yet we have no hope for the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1674" /> The fact that services and social welfare benefits for the poor have been cut makes us cynical, as do the numbers of redundancies notified to the Department of Labour in 1988.  These facts must concern us.  The report of the central review committee on the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> does not comment widely on the extent and nature of the redundancies notified to the Department and the projected 20,000 jobs for 1989 are not definite.  They might be an aim of the Government but so far they have not been confirmed and there is no real evidence to suggest that the estimated expansion of employment in the services sector will not level off in 1989.</P>
    <P>The Congress of Trade Unions who are a party to the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> agree that it is now clear that the rate of job creation over the past year is insufficient to meet our problem.  It is also clear that creating the right environment is not enough.  Obviously, this is a party to the national agreement who are not happy with the efforts being made to combat unemployment and so on. What might be the answer to our problems? Because of the high level of unemployment which persisted through 1988 it is clear that we need a radical policy of private and public investment if we are to have any real impact in maintaining and creating jobs.  The people who talk about creating a climate for job creation are not phoney but they are following a wrong system which cannot solve our problems.  However, it is fraudulent for the masters of industry to suggest that the present way is the way forward and that it will create jobs.  The high level of unemployment is of grave concern and there is no real evidence that the level will be reduced.</P>
    <P>What are we going to do about our problems?  Should we put more emphasis on wealth creation and on the fact that wealth should be retained in Ireland and put to work for the people?  Are we going to halt redundancies in the public service? Are we going to halt cutbacks in basic services such as school transport and so on?  Are we going to do something to increase public construction projects? <Col N="1675" /> Are we going to do anything in those areas to increase employment?  I know that road building alone will not solve our problems because with the type of machinery being used nowadays the same numbers of labourers are not required. The same applies to the building industry in general.</P>
    <P>Are the Government prepared to consider the suggestions of the Commission on Social Welfare and ensure that a single person gets £60 a week and that a married couple get £96 a week?  That will not make people rich, it will just make their problems less acute.  Are the Government prepared to increase the child benefit scheme by at least 25 per cent?  Will the Government tackle the family income supplement in order to try to bridge the gap between the haves and the have nots and will the Government do something about the long-term unemployed?  If we are serious about tackling poverty will we make more money available to the Combat Poverty Agency and highlight the extent of the poverty problem?  Are the Government to pay any attention to the submission of the Simon Community or the submission of the Catholic Social Services Centre?</P>
    <P>We need an investment of about £100 million, for instance, in local authority housing in 1989.  If we do not make that sort of allocation this year we will be faced at the end of the year with the same numbers being unemployed, if not more. If we do not do something about income tax and try to bring some equity and relief for PAYE workers, the jobs situation will get worse.  So far, under the commitments made in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> the <i>status quo</i> has been maintained in relation to the PAYE workers, and that is the most that has been done for them.</P>
    <P>So far as the Labour Party are concerned, we feel that the public who pay the bills are entitled to know that their money is well managed and efficiently distributed and we also feel that the revenue to finance essential projects must be contributed fairly by every sector.  If we do not work towards change in all the <Col N="1676" /> areas I have mentioned, we will remain static in relation to poverty and unemployment; in fact poverty may increase to a stage where there was more than one in three people living below the poverty line.</P>
    <P>I should like my contribution by way of appeal to be taken on board.  We are not saying there are ready-made solutions to all of our ills.  In recent months many socially concerned bodies have advanced substantial, detailed proposals that would alleviate some of the poverty being suffered at present and help us to be more tenacious about the question of job creation, thereby rendering the overall problem less acute.</P>

      <P>Generally on the occasion of the debate on the appropriations we range over a very wide field but, this evening, Senators will be glad to hear I propose to be very brief, at least I intend to be very brief.</P>
      <P>Some of the topics which absorb a lot of my attention &mdash; such as Anglo-Irish relations, North-South relations, constitutional issues, all that area &mdash; have been debated at considerable length in the last term before Christmas with their various issues and motions which gave us generous opportunity to talk along those lines, and I am not going to deal in any sense with those topics tonight.  I want to confine my remarks, very briefly and cogently, to central issues of our economic situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I say first of all that I share the general admiration for the good job which is being done by this minority Government within the policy and philosopical limits they have set themselves, within the constraints of our membership of the Community and within a whole lot of other parameters, some of which are voluntary, some of which are involuntary but which limit the Government's activities. In the job they have set out to do since they took office, in the fervour of Pauline conversion with which they embarked on putting our fiscal affairs in order, then it is generally conceded that a good job is being done.  It is true that <Col N="1677" /> we do not see any of the larger consequences of that job as yet.  But they have to be complimented on being a good Government in that sense and on having a good Opposition because, in Irish political history, we are in the centre of a unique political experiment in consensus. The motivation is not always altruistic perhaps but, nonetheless, let us give credit to Opposition as well as to Government. This could not be a good minority Government unless they had a responsible Opposition.</P>
    <P>On a personal level I feel compelled to dwell a little for a moment on the irony of the fact that the Taoiseach is experiencing perhaps his golden age as a political leader in his political career.  There is an irony in this fact because he is doing that as the Leader of a minority Government, whereas it is no secret that his burning ambition as a politician was to do something he has not yet achieved, that is to say, to lead a majority overall Fianna Fáil Government.  He has not done that yet, he may never do it and suddenly it does not matter any more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">

      <P>But again, he may.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Suddenly it does not matter any more because, if this Taoiseach is to be remembered in the history books for certain achievements, I think it is now that this is happening.  Maybe in the end this is only poetic and historic justice because, again, it is generally agreed that one of the best Governments in the history of the State was run by his father-in-law in the early sixties, and that also was a minority Government.  I think there is a strong political moral there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that I wish to confine my remarks to one or two aspects of Government policy and briefly to mention education. I agree with Senator McKenna in congratulating the national institutes on attaining university status.  In fact, the governing body of University College, Cork yesterday unanimously expressed their congratulations to our colleagues in Limerick.  We would hope that, although <Col N="1678" /> there will be consequences and shakeouts that we yet cannot anticipate as a result of the conferring of University status on the two National Institutes for Higher Education, in the end it will be beneficial. With respect to Munster, we hope that the issue would not be one of acrimonious conflict and competition for declining student intakes as we move into the nineties, dwindling Government grants and so on, but rather that the keynote would be co-operation, co-operation perhaps along an axis running from Cork to Limerick, to Galway, and balancing out the heavy metropolitan advantages of third level institutions in this area.  But that remains to be seen.</P>
    <P>I want to make one simple point however about education in general.  It is simply to endorse the complaint, appeal &mdash; or whatever you like to call it &mdash; of bodies such as the Conference of Major Religious Superiors who, in a booklet published a few months ago, put no tooth in one of the central defects of our whole educational policy, that is its gross inequality.  They ask, in a catechism fashion; has any progress been made over the past 25 years in education?  The answer, of course, is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in terms of access to post-primary education and so on and in the elimination of primary school terminal leaving, which was a working-class phenomenon.  That has been ended and that is some social progress. The other major question is: has equality of opportunity &mdash; which after all was the aspiration in the 1916 Proclamation, in the 1919 Democratic Programme and of successive native Governments &mdash; been achieved?  That answer is clearly not.  This is still an unjust society obviously in the economy, but just as clearly in education. The inequalities of opportunity in education at first, second and third levels anyway, perpetuate the unjust society that we have.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Conference of Major Religious Superiors &mdash; which is one of the aliases of their Lordships, the Catholic bishops of Ireland &mdash; have taken the initiative in sounding the tocsin against this blatant injustice in our educational system and the basic inequalities <Col N="1679" /> in our educational structures.  Perhaps I would not have expected this some years ago but I welcome their eloquence and passion in hitting out at this inequality &mdash; equally their similar preoccupation with the fact of poverty in our national life.  It is a change &mdash; as someone said &mdash; it is a profound change that the belt of the crozier should now be feared for its social repercussions, no longer for infringing the moral code but for the Government's failure to meet the fundamental problems of poverty and social justice.  I am very glad to welcome the Catholic Church into the area of social reform.  Considering that in the thirties, forties and fifties too often they lifted their voices against reform, against overt interference by the State in the social and economic field, now they are demanding that the State intervene to take action in those matters. I am very glad at the change that has come about, which, indeed, some of us have been calling for a long time.</P>
    <P>What I want to do here is to endorse the calls now being made from all sides in recent weeks that the budget should address above all, as a matter of absolute urgency, the question of poverty.  I want to confine my remarks to that simple issue.  I do not need to go into the details. They have been spelt out by such bodies as the Conference of Major Religious Superiors, the Combat Poverty Agency, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and a wide spectrum of political opinion.  They all have the same message &mdash; that we have a scandalous situation where people have not got enough to eat.  This calls for immediate action.  The Government, I understand, have already drawn up the main lines of their budgetary policy but it is not too late to make the most generous adjustments to deal with this scandal in our community.  A Fianna Fáil Government particularly has a historic obligation to do this, to act not only for humanitarian reasons, but out of enlightened self-interest.  Senator Harte referred to the fact that sooner or later the one-third who suffer this indignity and deprivation are simply going to do something about <Col N="1680" /> it; with far less justification perhaps in the fifties they took political action of a certain kind.</P>
    <P>While the Government should act out of enlightened self-interest they should also act, being a Fianna Fáil Government, in accordance with their historical tradition.  One of the reasons for their foundation was that they should be a socially reforming, populist Government, that they should put an end to tophattery and social privilege and should give a chance to the poor man, the man perhaps if not of no property, the man with very small property.  No historian would deny that Fianna Fáil have reneged on that tradition for several decades now and it is time they should get back to that. As I say, I suspend judgement on all the wider implications of economic policy and economic philosophy.  I am pleading for a relief of the most pressing problem &mdash; an gad is gaire don scornach.</P>
    <P>This is a fertile land.  It is inexplicable and scandalous that anyone should go hungry in this fertile land.  We referred at the outset of the proceedings to the fact that next Saturday will be the 70th anniversary of the convening of the first Dáil Éireann which on its first day presented for adoption a radical programme of social reform &mdash; the Democratic Programme.  I corrected Senator Ryan's enthusiasm this morning when I pointed out that, alas, the Deomcratic Programme was not really an integral part of what that Sinn Féin revolution was doing but they were making a gesture at least for people's craving for social equality and social justice.  I cannot think of a more appropriate way to mark next week's commemoration of the 70th anniversary of that Democratic Programme than to try to begin to realise some of its principles.  A budget in January 1989 which would be generous, imaginatively generous, to the poor in our society would be the fittest tribute one could pay to the Democratic Programme and to the convening of the first Dáil.  Let the Government begin to end poverty in the budget next week and it will have done the finest deed of its period in Government to date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivianOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to refer to the broad spectrum of political activity that has been addressed here today and, indeed, on the last occasion on which we discussed this subject, and to say that it is significant that there is a fair measure of agreement that a certain amount or a good deal has been achieved, depending on which side of the House the contribution is made. In general the main thrust of what is being said here today is that a lot has been achieved and that the ship of State has been, at least for now, steered off the rocks.  It is interesting to note that Professor Murphy referred to the first Dáil. I looked at some of the literature issued during the course of the second election campaign quite recently and one of the posters issued stated in a graphic way that the ship of State was on the rocks.  I think that is the difficulty that this particular administration was confronted with on taking office some 18 months ago.  As I said at the outset, a lot has been achieved and this fact appears to have been recognised not just in this House or in the Dáil but indeed by the public, if one can attach any credence to opinion polls.  We are all aware of how fickle they can be but at least it seems to be recognised by the general population that a reasonably good job is being done.  As a representative of the Government party in this House I think an exceptionally good job is being done in difficult circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Professor Murphy was probably correct in saying that it has not been a drawback to the Government that they are a minority Government.  They have received a fair measure of co-operation from the Opposition, who have acted very responsibly.  I think that fact should be recognised and it is significant that it has been recognised by a number of speakers today.  A certain number of the Government's measures, if not all, have been very effective and have produced the intended results.  Of course, the next phase is to maximise the benefits to be gained &mdash; to use the much hackneyed phrase &mdash; by putting the State's finances back in order.  The question now is: in <Col N="1682" /> what direction do we go from here?  The Government are obviously pursuing many programmes, and as I said, these have met with a lot of success, but this Government will be judged on what they do from here.  I think that there are a number of areas &mdash; the Government identified these on coming to office in their own <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>&mdash; that can derive the benefits from whatever economic development takes place in the wake of the current wave of stringent activities on the part of the various Government Departments.</P>
    <P>Many speakers today touched on the impact the cutbacks have had in various areas, be it health, education or local government.  Indeed we are all aware of the impact they have had on the quality of life of so many of our citizens.  There is no doubt about this and, of course, those on the Government side of the House have taken the brunt of the criticism. The last administration, obviously, also had to face this criticism.  The public have had to suffer a great deal of discomfort but by and large they have taken it on the chin and they are to be congratulated for this.  As I said, there is a fair measure of agreement on what has been achieved, but they need to see some light at the end of the tunnel and they need to be assured that as a result of the sacrifices they are being asked to make benefits will accrue for them and for their families.</P>
    <P>The public are expecting a fresh and imaginative approach to be adopted in tackling the problems confronting this country at present.  A number of approaches have already been touched on and I will not go into them in any great detail this evening.  Certainly one thing we need to do and this has not been touched on to any great degree here today, is to reform local government. If there is to be real democracy in this country it has to percolate down and affect every citizen but at present that is not in evidence on the ground.  Indeed successive Ministers for the Environment and Ministers for Local Government, before we changed the label on that Department, had promised imaginative <Col N="1683" /> change but, of course, we did not get it. The present Minister had also undertaken a detailed examination of where he believes these significant changes need to be made, and I believe they very definitely need to be made.</P>
    <P>The Minister has approached the whole phenomenon of housing development in an imaginative way.  Local authority householders have been encouraged to buy their own houses.  This was an extremely imaginative initiative and the consequence of it is that something in the region of 43 per cent of local authority tenents will own their own houses by the end of the year.  These houses have been offered to them at what can only be described as a knockdown price.  Of course, in the long term this will have the effect that Government housing stocks will be significantly depleted.  I suggest that what will be a good development in that the time will then be ripe for an appraisal of where we should go next in relation to our next public building programme, and there will be one.  If we continue to dispose of as many houses as we are currently disposing of, then that vacuum will have to be filled and I believe it will be filled in the next phase of development.</P>
    <P>I know that the number of houses being built this year is insignificant &mdash; that is the only way one can describe it &mdash; but it has to be contrasted with the fact that in many urban areas large numbers of houses are unoccupied and recently Cork Corporation had to take steps to reduce the impact of vandalism in vacant houses. This area needed to be addressed and because many local authority houses are now being disposed of and Government housing stocks will be depleted we will need a new housing programme.</P>
    <P>I hope that in 1989 the Minister will bring forward the concept of a new public housing programme.  Not alone will it cater for the housing lists which will again start to build up as a consequence of not enough houses being built this year but, of course, it will also mean a significant capital injection into the building industry. Of course, local authority building <Col N="1684" /> programmes made a considerable contribution to the building industry in this country over many years.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the coming year the Minister for the Environment will address the whole problem of housing grants.  I think everybody would agree that the concept of the last housing grant scheme was an excellent one in that many people availed of the grant and improved the quality of their houses; in some cases beyond recognition.  Of course, the tragedy of that concept was that it was too generous; and many people did up their summer homes, took out teak windows and replaced them with PVC and aluminium windows.  I believe that very often these improvements were unnecessary and as a consequence the bill for this scheme went through the ceiling. On coming into office the present Minister had to face a bill of something in excess of £160 million and even when he stopped the scheme there was still a tag of £150 million to be addressed.  Because of that situation we lost sight of the fact that tragically many people in this country could not afford to do up their own houses, and still cannot do so today because there is no Government assistance available at this time to people whose houses are in a deteriorating condition. That is a serious anomaly in local government administration and it is an anomaly that needs to be addressed.  I have no doubt the Minister will address this subject in the months to come.</P>
    <P>Obviously the next programme will have to be a less grandiose one than the last one.  I do not think anybody should have been entitled to get a grant to do up a summer house or a second house.  That was never intended to be the idea but, of course, like every scheme it was open to abuse.  Now that a two year period has elapsed during which no reconstruction grant has been available to anybody I believe, the time has now come to fill that vacuum.</P>
    <P>In the general context of local government, I believe there is a need to give back a greater say in the administration of local democracy to county councils <Col N="1685" /> and corporations.  The development post-1977 of the removal of rates and so on contributed to a gradual decline in the impact local authority members could make on the quality of life in their own areas.  They were dependent entirely on the Department for block grants for housing, roads, sanitary services and so on and, as a consequence, they had very little input into where the various appropriations should go.  We are aware that the Minister is carrying out an appraisal of the need to change local government.</P>
    <P>I believe it is vitally important to improve the status of local authorities so that once again they can be a decision-making group.  Public confidence in local government is being eroded by the minute and one has only to attend public meetings to witness the deterioration of the public's perception of the effectiveness of local authorities and their members.  This problem needs to be addressed.  Many other European democracies, particularly our EC partners, have already addressed this subject and one has only to read the extremely imaginative way the Danes addressed this subject in the early part of this decade and by transferring a significant amount of national administration back down to local regions to realise that we need to do the same here.  We have only to look at the historical contribution local authorities have made in this country to know that we would be leaving that administration in good hands by giving it back to them.  We need to do that.</P>
    <P>There is more centralisation taking place in the distribution of our allocations from the various European funds at present.  The hand of the Department of Finance is in everything; everything has to be channelled through that Department. When one asks local organisations or groups to make submissions as to how various schemes should be funded and so on, it is disconcerting to find that at the end of the day somebody 300 miles away will ultimately decide how they should be funded.  This phenomenon of centralisation has slowly but surely been creeping into various Departments of State and it needs to be addressed.  I have <Col N="1686" /> absolute confidence the Minister for the Environment has the imagination to address this subject in a meaningful way and not just to make passive adjustments and allow county councils to increase service charges and so on and make the difficult decisions.  If we are going to have local administration let us have meaningful local administration.  It is one of the priming pumps needed to dovetail with the Government's thrust forward in this area.</P>
    <P>The other areas identified by the Government on coming to office were tourism and fisheries.  I will not dwell too long on these areas now but I should like to touch briefly on them.  The Government have had significent success in their efforts to resolve the deterioration which was creeping into the tourism industry. Successive Governments and two Government White Papers, one in the seventies and one in the early eighties, identified very clearly the need to resolve the single fundamental difficulty which had confronted the tourism industry for many years, that was the expense of getting here.  Every expert who was employed to find out why we were not getting our share of the expanding tourism cake identified the expense of getting here as the main reason for this.  Fortunately that has changed very dramatically and, in fact, this year it was a good deal cheaper to bring a husband and wife and three children to Ireland on some shipping routes than it was in 1981. The same theory was applied in relation to the request to the hotel sector to keep their prices down and there has been no significant increase in hotel prices now for almost two years.  The budgets have not significantly increased drink prices over the past three years.  All these things have occurred in response to the constant complaint we had from the tourists that it was too expensive to get here and that we were basically an expensive destination. Ireland will remain a relatively expensive destination but having said that, the type of specialist tourist we are now beginning to address is prepared to pay that little bit extra.  It is not comparing like with like.  We cannot compare <Col N="1687" /> ourselves with the sun spots of Spain or the Canaries.  The Government have had significent success in that this market is now at least accessible.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other things that need to be done and it is an opportune time to debate them on the basis that they can be tied in to the submissions that we are currently making under the European Social Fund, Structural Funds and so on.  We have a golden opportunity here and it is appropriate that the Minister of State of this particular Department is here this evening.  The Office of Public Works have an amount to contribute in this area, and I am happy to say that they are already doing so, in identifying significant aspects of the Irish tourism product.</P>
    <P>We will have to resist the temptation, going into the nineties, to adopt a kind of pepperpot approach to various schemes, giving £1,000 to this festival and £500 to somebody else and to Mickey Mouse schemes all over the country when what we need to do is to focus on five or six sizeable national projects.  We have already embarked on one in Limerick in a sizeable urban renewal programme that was launched there in the last few weeks. That is the kind of concept that will attract tourists into this country in the future.  We must stop measuring ourselves against Corfu, the Canaries and Marbella and these places.  There is no comparison.  We cannot offer what they have got and they most certainly have not got what we have to offer.</P>
    <P>We must focus on the need to develop items of significant historical interest.  We are lucky in that many of these are still sufficiently well preserved to be of great interest to tourists.  Our environment generally has an important role to play. It is not enough for the Minister to bring in environmental campaigns, such as the anti-litter campaign, if funds are not provided to carry them out.  The same applies in the area of agricultural pollution.  We are trying to bring in tourists to fish, but quite often they find long stretches of the rivers, they can get access to at present polluted.  We have been stabbing at this, <Col N="1688" /> but we must create the awareness among the public that we cannot be indifferent to its future just because we have a relatively unpolluted environment.</P>
    <P>If there is any single aspect of life in Ireland that will deter tourists in the future it will be our indifference to preserving the environment.  We only have to come to the periphery of any town at present to see indiscriminate dumping and litter.  We have problems but, slowly but surely we are solving them.  Apart from our desire to improve the quality of life for our citizens, the contribution it will make in the development of the tourism industry is significant.  As I said in the beginning of my contribution in relation to tourism, we must focus nationally on five or six or maybe ten big programmes every two or three years, set them up and fund them properly and finish them.  Then we can say with certainty when we invite tourists here, when we circulate brochures internationally and participate in international trade fairs, whether in Dusseldorf or New York, that such a facility is in place in Wexford, or in Connemara or in Glengariff or wherever.  That is the only way it will work.</P>
    <P>We need to address our shortfall in the area of wet-day facilities.  We have seen where a Dutch pension company can come to Trabolgan in Cork and set up a facility.  We have been talking about it for the last 30 years, and they can come in overnight and make a success of it. That is the kind of thing we need to address.  As I said here before Christmas there are three and a half million registered hill walkers in the UK alone.  There are not even a dozen packages available in this country at present to attract hill walkers; yet we have the finest hill walking terrain and environment in the world here and we have not addressed that subject yet.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of this tourism product we need to develop.  The Government have addressed successfully surface and air transport problems in a reasonably successful way but other aspects need to be addressed now and we are anxious to get European funds to <Col N="1689" /> assist us in developing because we cannot do it on our own.</P>
    <P>We have three million tourists a year visiting the <i>Mary Rose</i>.  We have many of those wrecks off the coast of Ireland that could be brought ashore.  There are many examples but I will not labour this point this evening.</P>
    <P>In relation to the fishing industry, again it is not enough to talk in pious platitudes about a desire to improve fishing.  It is significant that BIM have produced a very comprehensive programme in the last few months which, if it is realistically funded, can be significant and successful. It can only work with funds and it is not enough to say that the fishing industry has got a realistic chance to provide jobs onshore and so on.  We must address it and address it seriously.  At present the bulk of our mariculture product is being shipped to the fresh markets of Europe. That is good in itself, but there must be a contradiction in terms there somewhere when we are not processing onshore ourselves.</P>
    <P>Mariculture is a relatively new phenomenon here and there is no excuse for shipping that product to the UK or to France to be processed for their markets; we should be doing it here.  In Denmark for every one job at sea in the fishing fleets there are eight jobs ashore.  We have got less than one and a half here. It is not enough to identify the growth potential of fisheries if we are not prepared to put the funds into it.  I am satisfied that the Minister and his Minister of State are addressing it in a realistic way, but we must create confidence in the industry itself.  We must be conscious of the dangers of monopolies getting into some aspects of our processing industry where in excess of 70 per cent of the processing of one species of fish is owned by one company.  That is the kind of thing we have to be careful to avoid in the future.</P>
    <P>There is a particular need to develop our mariculture industry.  We have a unique environment particularly on the western seaboard and in the south-west where the benefits of the Gulf Stream make it a particularly important location <Col N="1690" /> for the development of mariculture.  Of equal significance is that we have so many inlets where it could be of benefit to the small farmers of the area to general off-farm income.  There are a number of species of fish that we have not even looked at yet apart from the ones that we have been developing like mussel rope culture and oysters and so on, species that we are aware of.  There are many others like velvet crab that has only been recently introduced here from Brittany which are going to be huge if we provide onshore processing, if we provide facilities for these inshore fishermen to develop relatively small farms.  It has been very successfully done in the west of Scotland.  I know our own Department have been looking at it and I hope we will have a meaningful approach to the whole business of mariculture.  It is not enough to talk about it, we must provide the funds as well.  I have no doubt that now that we are getting this degree of stability in the economy the various Departments in 1989 and 1990 can look for realistic budgets to address these particular subjects.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to touch very briefly on the Department of Energy and to say that there is a great need to develop a coherent energy policy.  I refer particularly to our dependence on the importation of oil.  We do not have national oil storage facilities.  We are dependent on storing oil abroad.  That is not a healthy situation for this country to be in.  We all saw in the mid and late seventies the type of crises that were created in this country because of oil shortages and so on.  We are all aware of the volatile nature of politics in the Middle East and it would take only a minor upheaval out there to upset the balance of our oil supplies.  We have a need to develop our own national oil store; we have one in my constituency and I hope that in 1989 we will see a reopening of this facility from a national point of view, apart from the obvious boost it would be to the local economy.  I am aware that negotiations are going on at present and I hope they will come to fruition in the near future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1691" /> In conclusion, I would like to congratulate the Government on having got this far.  It has not been easy.  Indeed, it has not been easy for the Opposition either and it has not been easy for the public who must be uppermost in our minds.  They have taken a lot of this on the chin and have been very patient.  We are aware of the difficulties created in the health services and in some facts of our educational service and so on but this is the only way to proceed.  The public and the Government recognise that as do the majority of the Opposition parties. Slowly but surely we are getting back on the rails.  It is important now that we have one foot back on the rail, that we do not become overtly generous and that when funds become available to the various Government Departments they will be used in a meaningful way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the last two contributors I am not sure that I live in the same country as they and that we have the same Government.  I congratulate the Minister, wearing his Board of Works hat, on what has been announced in the House today regarding the advances that have been made on the restoration of the Seanad Chamber.  In his other capacity he is here as a representative of the Government and anything critical I may say of the Government would be intended to be helpful to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last speaker referred to two matters; one was that people acknowledge the position we are in and are prepared to take it on the chin.  I can assure the Senator that there are people taking it in places that are more hurtful than on the chin and are still reeling and bent over after some of the blows that have been administered on them by the present Government.  He referred to the ship of State having been on the rocks and slowing getting off the rocks.  During the reign of the Coalition Government, who were trying to keep the ship off the rocks, Fianna Fáil, in Opposition, were acting as a tug pulling it onto the same rocks. They continued in that vein throughout <Col N="1692" /> the term of that Government.  If one looks back on the record one will see that they did not want this country to be saved. They wanted to bring down that Government at any cost.  When they talk about redeeming this country from the state it was in they are really talking about redeeming this country from the state they contributed to driving it into even when in opposition.  The opposite is the case now when the Opposition are making a positive contribution.</P>
    <P>It has become customary in this type of debate, for one to make a state of the nation speech as one sees it and from the point of view of which side of the House one is on.  I see it as someone from County Donegal would see it though I do not intend to be parochial because the state of the nation so far as I am concerned is the state of the people I represent at another level as well as the state of the people I live among.</P>
    <P>We had a reference to tourism by the last speaker.  On this day last week a deputation from Donegal had a meeting with the second in command in Bord Fáilte in an effort to persuade him and the board that Donegal has not been getting its fair share of tourism in bad times. The published figures suggested that there was an increase in tourism last year but Donegal did not benefit from that.  I venture to say that if you went through this city and lifted at random 20 tourist publications &mdash; whether tourist guides or advertisements &mdash; you would hardly see a reference to any part of Ireland north of the Dublin-Galway line and certainly not north of the Sligo line.  This is so true that it is damnable and yet we in Donegal would claim to have some of the nicest beaches in Ireland, some of the best golf courses in Ireland and numerous middle standard golf courses that would be very attractive to middle handicap or high handicap golfers.  Tourists claim that we are flying in people to four major courses in Kerry and that that is what is harnessing that golf potential.  In Donegal we do not see it that way.  While we would have three or four courses that would rival the three or four courses in Kerry we also have ten, 11, 12 or 16 smaller <Col N="1693" /> courses but the golfers are not getting to Donegal.  It has become clear that in Donegal we must bring tourism up to some acceptable standard.  An airport is needed at Letterkenny.  The present Taoiseach, both as Leader of the Opposition and as Taoiseach has said he would see to it that funds were provided for such airport.  I believe he will.  I am asking the Minister to bring that request to the appropriate authorities and to the Taoiseach because the county needs an airport.</P>
    <P>We realise we have disadvantages not least of those being our proximity to Northern Ireland and the general conception of Donegal as being that far north.  One could get to Donegal and be half way back again quicker than one would get to Dingle but people do not see it that way.  The fact that Northern Ireland lies between us makes the distance appear longer but there is the real difficulty of Donegal being surrounded by British camps.  I am not talking politically about the Northern Ireland situation or about Britain but the presence of these camps generates a fear to the extent that people are reluctant to pass through the various checkpoints.  The only way we can get them in is to fly them in for their first trip so that they can at least see Donegal once and then make up their minds as to whether they want to come back.  I note that time is running out but I will move on quickly to the matter of housing.</P>
    <P>The last speaker referred to housing in Cork where, he said, there was a surplus of housing.  Senator Harte referred to a surplus of housing in this city.  The situation in Donegal is that there are 1,500 applicants at present seeking local authority housing, that represents approximately 5,000 people.  The last speaker said the Minister for the Environment was imaginative.  The Minister, Deputy Flynn, has an imagination and a very healthy one, if he thinks that the housing problem is being solved either by stopping the construction of houses at local authority level or by selling off the housing stock.  I am not sure that it is a good thing to sell off housing stock, whatever <Col N="1694" /> private benefit there may be to the individuals concerned to become the owners of their homes.  In fact I suspect it is very bad.  When the tide rises people in those situations will eventually purchase their own houses and move into private housing. Then those other houses will be vacant for rehousing those on the housing list.  The present Government on taking office promised an injection to the construction industry and what they gave them was a lethal injection.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Éireann&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Noting the 40th Anniversary of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, and noting that Chinese police on 10th December, 1988 in Lhasa fired point-blank at a non-violent parade of Tibetans marking the said anniversary resulting in the death of several Tibetan monks and the injury of nearly thirty other people, including a Dutch tourist, and</P>
      <P>(2)  Noting the Irish Government's support for the fundamental rights and very existence of the Tibetan nation at the United Nations, with particular reference to Resolutions 1353 (XIV) of 21st October, 1959, 1723 (XVI) of 20th December, 1961 and 2079 (XX) of 18th December, 1965, and</P>
      <P>(3)  Noting that an estimated 1.20 million Tibetans have been killed since the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1949.</P>
      <P>(4)  Concerned that an estimated 2,200 monks, nuns and lay Tibetans were imprisoned without trial, interrogated and tortured following demonstrations in Lhasa in October, 1987 and March, 1988&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  strongly condemns the Chinese regime for its grave violation of human rights in Tibet and <Col N="1695" /> calls on other international bodies to protest these actions,</P>
    <P>(b)  urges the Irish Government to support all international measures for establishing peace and the respect for human rights in Tibet,</P>
    <P>(c)  calls on the Irish Government to instigate a motion in support of the Tibetan people at the United Nations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have an apportunity to move this motion relating to Tibet and I am very grateful to the Senators who have joined in tabling the motion so that it is a very broadly supported motion drawing attention to a situation that has not received any substantial comment in the Irish media.</P>
    <P>The recent history of the Tibetan people is one of the saddest examples of major violation of human rights and, indeed, of the right to self-determination itself.  However, surprisingly, Tibet is not on the current political agenda, and despite earlier concern about the treatment of Tibetan people, Ireland has been silent in recent years and has not expressed any concern at international level.  This is particularly strange because much of what has happened to Tibet should evoke deep chords in the Irish people.  The suppression of a whole people, so that their independent religious, social and cultural ethos is denied and that they are subjected to the humiliation of being colonised and indeed substantially planted upon to such an extent that the Tibetan people have become a minority in their own country, should evoke an immediate response from us.</P>
    <P>There is also a practical reason for tabling this motion and seeking debate at an early stage in 1989.  In March of this year there are likely to be major demonstrations commemorating 30 years after the uprising in Tibet against Chinese occupation which had taken place ten years earlier in 1949.  It is extremely important that there be no violence or <Col N="1696" /> repression of any peaceful demonstrations which may take place.  It will be noted that the motion refers to the incident on 10 December last, which was the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, where there had been violence displayed against a small peaceful demonstration. It is quite likely that the only reason we know about that is because a Dutch tourist who was present on that occasion happened to be injured and then the world press learned about what occurred.  There is no doubt that it is difficult to obtain accurate information about the current situation in Tibet, but such information as does come out gives us cause for concern.  It is appropriate that in the Seanad we should look at the situation in some detail.  I hope there will be broad support for this motion and that the Minister will state the official position in relation to the issues raised.</P>
    <P>Tibet differs from Ireland in size in that the area inhabited by the Tibetan people covers some 500,000 square miles, that is an area as large as western Europe, and is surrounded by high mountain ranges. There is a political dimension even to a description of Tibet.  Since 1965 Tibet, as far as the Chinese are concerned, has consisted merely of what is known as the Tibetan Autonomous Region, which is a much smaller area, leaving out substantial provinces which have been incorporated into other Chinese provinces and deprived of their sense of identity as part of Tibet.  In this motion what we are concerned about is not in a narrow sense what is now known as the Tibetan Autonomous Region, TAR, but the area comprising the Tibetan people as a whole.</P>
    <P>Although there has been little attention in Ireland to the situation in Tibet it has been the subject of recent parliamentary debate and scrutiny in western European countries.  For example, there was a very clear account of the Chinese violation of human rights in Tibet in a report prepared for the Parliamentary Human Rights group at Westminster by W.P. Ledger that was published in paperback form in late 1987 under the heading <i>The Chinese and</i><Col N="1697" /><i>Human Rights in Tibet</i>.  It gives a very good overall account of the situation, including an historical account, and ends with a conclusion on page 35.  I want to quote part of that conclusion because it focuses on one of the issues of concern in relation to this motion.</P>
    <P>Although the UN is not going to attempt to enforce its declaration in the forseeable future and Western Governments steer clear of criticising the Chinese directly, 1987 saw a considerably build-up of pro-Tibetan opinion.  All-Party Parliamentary groups are now prepared to raise the issue more forcefully and after the widespread publicity of the Chinese handling of the events of October 1987, Beijing may consider a relaxation, though at present it seems committed to Sinicisation and engulfment.</P>
    <P>The single greatest threat to Tibet and her indigenous population is the continued influx of Chinese immigrants. The next few years will determine whether Tibet lapses further into a state of apartheid and the Tibetans go the same way as the North American Indians and the Australian aborigines, or whether they are left to themselves to restore their culture, religion and language, their agricultural practices, to respect [sic] human rights, and to exercise the rights of self-governments in a truly autonomous regions.</P>
    <P>That is the stark choice that is beign faced as far as that report to the human rights committee of the Westminster Parliament was concerned.</P>
    <P>More recently, on 21 October 1988, a written declaration on the situation in Tibet was tabled in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.  It is worth referring to the terms of that declaration which was signed by 13 members from different countries.  It recites as follows:</P>
    <P>The undersigned members of the Assembly,</P>
    <P>1.  Aware of the disturbances in Tibet and the Tibetan people's wish to <Col N="1698" /> strengthen its national independence and rights to survival as well as to the development of its culture;</P>
    <P>2.  Concerned about the risk of the disappearance of national identity and culture;</P>
    <P>3.  Welcome the fact that the Government of the People's Republic of China is apparently willing to negotiate with Dalai Lama;</P>
    <P>5.  Appeal to the Government of the People's Republic of China to promote the peace process in Tibet, respecting the human rights of the Tibetan people, its culture and civilisation.</P>
    <P>It may be noted that the terms of that written declaration are somewhat conciliatory in welcoming the fact that the Government of the Peoples' Republic of China are apparently willing to negotiate with the Dalai Lama.  It should be clear that, in tabling this motion and expressing very real and deep concern about the human rights issues and the suppression of the individuality and culture of the Tibetan people, the concern really is to promote reconciliation with China and to hope that China will open up the borders of Tibet both to Tibetans who wish to return there and also to outside observers.  The motion is not hostile in its thrust to the People's Republic of China. It is though deeply concerned about the situation there, and about what has occurred, and has been verified as having occurred, in recent years and in recent months.</P>
    <P>It is obviously regrettable that the Oireachtas does not have an established joint committee on foreign affairs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which could prepare its own report on the protection of human rights in countries such as Tibet, and thereby provide a genuinely independent voice in the world promoting the need for protection of civil liberties and the right to self-determination.  It would be greatly to Ireland's credit internationally and to our standing if we had a <Col N="1699" /> committee on foreign affairs which could prepare detailed reports and consider such reports.</P>
      <P>I am aware, however, that the Ireland-Tibet Support Group have been in communication with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Brian Lenihan, earlier this month and have posed a number of specific questions relating to Ireland's earlier record when Frank Aiken was the delegate to the United Nations, where he clearly championed the cause of the Tibetan people.  It may be useful to refer to one of those questions posed to the Minister because I hope the opportunity will be taken to answer those specific questions on the record of this House as well as in correspondence to the Ireland-Tibet Support Group.  The questions all adopt the same format and seek confirmation that the Irish Government endorse and continue to support the statements made in 1965 and earler by Frank Aiken.</P>
      <P>The first question is representative of the others and is as follows:</P>
      <P>Does the Irish Government still accept that: &ldquo;Tibet can rightly claim to be historically an independent country, and that the relatively short periods in the course of the last 2,000 years in which it was partially occupied cannot be held to constitute a denial of its right to independence&rdquo;?  (Reference: Delegate of Ireland, Frank Aiken, addressing the United Nations on 14th December 1965.)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remainder of the letter seeks clarification of the present position of the Irish Government and in particular notes that the reference to Tibet is to the area governed by the Lhasa Government prior to 1949, including the provinces which have now been separated, and does not refer to the smaller Tibetan Autonomous Region created by the Chinese in 1965.  It would be helpful if the Minister would clarify the current approach of the Irish Government and hopefully confirm that the clear expressions of policy at an earlier stage <Col N="1700" /> are endorsed and, secondly, that any references to Tibet would be to the broader concept of the Tibetan people.</P>
    <P>There have been earlier occasions when the issue of Tibet has been highlighted. For example, in October 1973 the Dalai Lama paid an official visit to Ireland and was received at Government Buildings by the Taoiseach and at Áras an Uachtarian by the then President. Subsequent to that, since Ireland opened diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1979, there has been a remarkable silence on the plight of the Tibetan people.  One of the concerns in relation to the Tibetan people is that they are totally different from the Chinese in race, language, religion, culture and in their desire to be independent and to have their own right to self-determination.</P>
    <P>It may be asked why the Chinese invaded the country in 1949 and have remained in control of it.  The answer has been well documented in the reports and studies that have been made.  It is clear that China makes very considerable use of the natural, physical, mineral and other resources of Tibet which is very resource-rich as an area.  China has situated her main strategic nuclear missile silos along the Tibetan Himalayas and apparently also uses Tibet for chemical weapons testing.  As I have said, Tibet is a land rich in mineral and natural resources and vast amounts of both minerals and timber have been exported from Tibet by the Chinese every year.  Much of this is obtained by using Tibetan forced labour.</P>
    <P>Two major reports were published in 1988 on violations of human rights in Tibet by Asiawatch, an independent organisation which is particularly concerned about the protection of human rights in different Asian countries.  A major report called &ldquo;Human Rights in Tibet&rdquo; was published in February 1988, following a mission to Tibet in 1987 to examine the position there, and that report was very critical.  It was followed by another major report in July 1988, a supplement to the February report, because of the increasing concern in April <Col N="1701" /> 1988 about evidence of continuing violations of human rights and indeed repression of demonstrations in March 1988 and the further closing off of means of communication.</P>
    <P>We have had reason to be concerned in recent months about events in Tibet. It is appropriate to take stock of the history of Tibet since the invasion by the Chinese People's Liberation Army in 1949.  Basically, the history is a very chilling and a very sad one of repression of a people.  As I have already mentioned, there was a major uprising against the Chinese occupation in March 1959 and that was repressed with major loss of life, thousands of Tibetans being executed for their part in that uprising.</P>
    <P>The cultural revolution between 1966 and 1976 had an enormous impact on Tibet.  It resulted in the total destruction of nearly all of Tibet's 6,500 monasteries and the suppression of all manifestations of Tibetan language, religion and culture. There was also widespread famine at the time because of a policy of substituting the growing of wheat for barley, which was the better crop for Tibet and had been traditionally the crop there.  A very substantial number of Tibetans were moved to labour camps and so on.  There is no doubt that there has been some improvement of the position in the past ten years but nonetheless the reality for the Tibetan people in the so-called Tibetan Autonomous Region is that they are outnumbered now by the Chinese and that a kind of apartheid operates in that they have poorer housing, less access to education and poorer or no health facilities in rural areas.  The population is approximately 1.8 million Tibetans and 2.5 million Chinese in that region.  It is very clear that some of the major concerns are about the very low standard of education, access to health care and so on of the Tibetan people and the striking contrast between them and the Chinese migrants there who are paid very substantially for moving to Tibet and who benefit very substantially from living there.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of reports from Tibet in recent years by visitors <Col N="1702" /> which give thought for increasing concern that even tourists are under very close surveillance.  It is believed that if tourists have conversations, for example with monks in monasteries or even with Tibetans they encounter, this is closely monitored and may result in action being taken against the Tibetans who have in any way communicated or interacted with foreigners.  So there is great fear and great suppression of ordinary interaction. The reality for Tibetans is that they do not have freedom to come or go, nor is there the access by the world media to Tibet.  This may be one of the reasons there has not been more reporting on the kinds of suppression of demonstrations etc.</P>
    <P>I referred to the recent very serious occurrence on the 40th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; that was on 10 December last.  It appears that Chinese police in Lhasa shot at point blank range at a small, non-violent parade mainly of Buddhist priests and nuns marking the 40th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It appears several monks were killed and among the 30 or so people who were wounded was, as I mentioned, a Dutch tourist.  This led to the event becoming known in the world and, indeed, there were major articles in the <i>Observer</i> and other English newspapers and in American journals about the event because it became known in that way.</P>
    <P>In March 1988 there were much more substantial demonstrations in Lhasa which apparently led to mass arrests and torture at that time which went virtually unobserved in the western world.  I think there is reason to be very concerned about what may happen in Lhasa, and indeed elsewhere in Tibet, in March which, I emphasised, is the 30th anniversary of the uprising against Chinese rule.  That uprising took place in March 1959; it is commemorated in Tibet, and a 30th anniversary will be particularly commemorated.  It would be appropriate that the Government consider sending an observer to Lhasa on that occasion, simply to be present and to observe what may transpire in the course of what are <Col N="1703" /> known to be the proposed peaceful demonstrations of the Tibetan people.  If there is a genuine anticipation of problems, then we should be aware of this and seek to monitor and examine the position.</P>
    <P>The motion has been phrased to note not only the incident on 10 December last which I have referred to, but the very clear statements the Irish Government made in support of the fundamental rights and the existence of the Tibetan nation at an earlier stage when Frank Aiken was the relevant Minister of the Irish Government.  The motion calls in a practical way for steps to be taken for a condemnation by Ireland of grave violations of human rights, for an initiative to be taken by the Irish Government in looking for support for the establishment of peace and respect for human rights in Tibet.  In that regard it would be intended that the Irish Government would seek reconciliation and the possibility of a genuine opening up of debate between the Chinese authorities and the Dalai Lama and his representatives so there could be a better basis for the maintenance of peace and respect for human rights in Tibet.  Finally, the motion calls on the Government to instigate a further motion in support of the Tibetan people at the UN, in other words, the kind of initiative we were prepared to take in the late fifties and mid-sixties on the subject when we either moved or supported such motions, so that the position of Ireland on this subject can be very clear.</P>
    <P>It may seem to some that this is a very remote issue to the Irish people, that we have enough problems of our own, we have enough poverty in our own country and enough areas of concern.  However, issues of human rights are the concern of all people, and in expressing our concern and identifying with repression elsewhere we bear witness to our own history and advance the quality of our own respect and concern for human rights.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this issue and the support of the Senators who have already put their names to the motion.  I look forward to the Minister's <Col N="1704" /> contribution to the debate and to the contribution of other Members of the House.</P>

      <P>I will definitely not exceed my time; I may not take up the entire 15 minutes.  I was glad to sign this motion and I am happy to second it, for two reasons.  The first reason is that the motion is correct in itself.  It raises an issue of political rights, cultural rights, religious rights, human rights of a people small in terms of numbers but a people with a considerable cultural, religious and artistic heritage.  It also raises interesting questions about the general high level of talk about human rights that characterises much of what would pass for the foreign policy of the western world today. I will come back to that in a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to set clearly on the record, largely because from my understanding the Government of the People's Republic of China would dispute this, that Tibet has a long history as an independent nation.  Indeed, it has a history in this century of independence and of continual attempts to interfere with that independence from a variety of sources, from Mongolia, from India, from Britain when it had a controlling interest in India and from China.  There never has been, as far as I can see, any doubt about the fact that Tibetan people saw themselves as an independent people and not as an autonomous area within China or any other large political unit.  They have always seen themselves as a separate people.  In fact, they were not that much concerned about external events.  I have had a passing interest in the history of Tibet and it has been stimulated by reasons which I shall outline later.  That interest shows that the Tibetans are a people who developed a very specific form of life, a very religiously orientated form of life and in this century close to <Col N="1705" /> one quarter of the population could be described as members of religious communities. They follow a highly individualistic lifestyle which in some cases has been described as a theocracy.</P>
    <P>However, there can be no doubt about their independence, their separate identity and their belief in that separate identity. As the motion states, Irish Governments in the past have supported at the United Nations the fundamental rights and the existence of the Tibetan nation.  It is important that that part of history should be put in context because it is that part of history that is disputed by those who, in my view, have imposed an imperialist occupation of Tibet.</P>
    <P>Tibet is also of increasing interest to the West because of the fact that Tibetan Buddhism has become of increasing interest to many of those I regard as amongst the great spiritual thinkers of the second half of the 20th century.  One of my great heroes, and great inspirations, is a man called Thomas Merton who, from the quite rigorous confines of a Cistercian monastery in the United States, managed to develop a broad and increasingly excited interest in the insights of Buddhism.  Ironically, on the only travel of his entire life, which resulted in his death, he want a long way to meet the Dalai Lama to discuss what he regarded as the extraordinary overlaps between western contemplative prayer, western practices of meditation and western insights into meditation and prayer. He wrote extensively about those insights.  It is difficult to stand back when one becomes aware, as I have had the good fortune to, to a limited extent of the depth of the religious development of the Tibetan people, of the sense of religious unity that draws them together. It is difficult after that to turn one's back and ignore what has happened to them over the past 40 years.  That is why the motion deserves support.</P>
    <P>The motion is about a small people with an individuality and identity long developed over centuries and with a sense of their own place in the world, a people who have been effectively, until recently, wiped off the memory of the world.  Their <Col N="1706" /> sufferings have been ignored or have been kept from us for the best part of 40 years, particularly for the best part of the last 30 years since the uprising was suppressed.  However, the beginnings of a revival are apparent and it is important for that reason that the record is clearly stated.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote from the report of Amnesty International for 1988, a body that is, to say the least, careful in what it says.  Part of its great credibility in the world is that it never says something it does not believe can be sustained on the basis of the evidence.  The 1988 report which does not incorporate the more recent, and more savage, repressions states:</P>
    <P>Several hundred people were detained in Lhasa, the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, after three public demonstrations and a riot in late September and early October [1987]. The demonstrations were led by Tibetan monks carrying flags and calling for Tibet's independence.  The demonstrations were reportedly peaceful, but a riot broke out on 1 October after police arrested a group of demonstrators and beat them publicly. A crowd gathered around a police station where the demonstrators had been taken, threw stones and set the police station on fire.  According to eye witnesses, the police then opened fire, killing a number of people, including children and some monks.  Chinese officials later denied that the police had opened fire...</P>
    <P>No official information was made public about the number of people detained during the protests or about the charges against them.  Unofficial sources, however, suggested that between 300 and 600 Tibetans were arrested during October including participants in the 1 October riot and others held after demonstrating peacefully. Some were released after a few days, but many were still in custody at the end of the year, apparently held incommunicado.  Some were reported to have been tortured in detention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1707" /> The report gives an account of the imprisonment of a 74 year old Tibetan lama for advocating Tibetan independence.  He is reported to have died in prison on 4 November 1987 having reportedly, been ill-treated in detention on several occasions.  His death was denied by the Foreign Affairs Office of what the Chinese call the Tibetan Autonomous Region but Amnesty are satisfied that his body was handed over to relatives for burial.</P>
    <P>That is a carefully studied description of what happened in one short period. I can just about remember the Tibetan uprising which resulted in the forced exile of the Dalai Lama.  At that time Red China was top of the list of demonology, Stalin having been dead for five or six years.  China invaded Tibet and because of that many people were against them. However, there has been a change and it is worth thinking about it.  Some facts are worth considering.  I understand that 1.2 million Tibetans have been killed since 1949 and an estimated 2,200 monks, nuns and lay Tibetans were imprisoned without trial following the demonstrations in October 1987 and March 1988.  People engaged in non-violent protests have been fired on but, throughout the western world there has been a surprising, to say the least, political silence in regard to this.</P>
    <P>When the Dalai Lama visited the United Kingdom recently he was a somewhat embarrassing visitor.  There were no enthusiastic eulogies about the rights of the Tibetan people to have their human rights protected; there were no eulogies about religious freedom in Tibet; there was not a welcome for a hero of human rights like Andrei Sakharov received in the last 12 months.  Indeed, there was an embarrassed and uncomfortable tolerance of his presence in the United Kingdom.  It is worth reflecting on that, and this is a good week to do so.</P>
    <P>We have had the considerable, and worthwhile, huffing and puffing about human rights in Europe which culminated in the Vienna Agreement in the last few days.  The human rights failings of <Col N="1708" /> many of the countries of Eastern Europe were hung out, well analysed and well underlined.  Those in the Soviet Union, in Czechoslovakia and in Poland have been talked about at great length.  It needs to be said however that neither in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia nor in Poland in recent years has anybody suggested that the police have opened fire on unarmed demonstrators, has the religion and culture of a people been so assiduously punished, or has the autonomy of the people been so strongly denied. There are not the same reports of widespread detentions in Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, Poland, or in Hungary for that matter.</P>
    <P>There are not any of the extreme manifestations of repression that are now identified in Tibet, and yet we have a continuously vocal organised lobby of demands from western countries for a further improvement in human rights all over eastern Europe.  We would all welcome and subscribe to that but, as Senator Robinson said, one's position on human rights is universal or it is meaningless. Either human rights are always important, or one's attachment to them becomes no more than political opportunism. It appears that what has happened is that we have run into a difficulty about our espousal of human rights and that difficulty is that on the one hand we have found that the identified opponent of the past four years, in particular the Soviet Union, is becoming more and more difficult to criticise on this issue and so we have begun to push up the ante. At the same time the erstwhile ally of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, has now been more or less enticed if not to be on our side to be at least somewhat on our side and to be with us in being suspicious of the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>Because these human rights abuses in Tibet are being carried out by people now not deemed to be entirely against us, but who are seen to be partially on our side in being against the great enemy, we are now reluctant to criticise and so we have the almost catatonic silence of all the western powers on the suppression of Tibet, the extraordinary position where <Col N="1709" /> the western powers join with China in attempting to pretend that Pol Pot is somehow still the legitimate leader of the Government in Kampuchea and it is written into international documents where Domocratic Kampuchea for instance becomes the potential recipient of international aid even though Democratic Kampuchea does not exist.  All of this, simply because the Peoples' Republic of China, which is not nearly as liberal or as open a society now as the Soviet Union is actually in the awkward position of being somewhat of a friend rather than the identified enemy.</P>
    <P>That would be fine if this country were part of a major international alliance but we are ostensibly a neutral country, a country which takes its own position on international affairs.  The slogan used to be that we were not ideologically neutral. That was acceptable because there is no such thing as ideological neutrality, but it appears that in recent times as we become more and more entangled in a co-ordinated foreign policy we are being morally neutered.  How can a country with our history, with our experience of being colonised and suppressed, undergoing religious persecution and attempts to suppress our national identity by a large power close by, ignore what is being done to the people of Tibet?  It is not explicable on any grounds other than that of international and political convenience.  It is time we got off the fence.</P>
    <P>It is right that we defend human rights in eastern Europe, in Central America, in South Africa and it is also right that we defend human and political rights and the right to life of the people of a small country who are being consistently oppressed by a large and expansionist neighbour.  I call on the Government to accept the motion and to take action to draw to the attention of the Government of the Peoples' Republic of China the increasing concern of this country for the well-being of the people of Tibet, and our concern that these people should be allowed to live in peace and freedom in the sort of religious and political structures they choose for themselves.</P>

      <P>I was pleased when contacted by Senator Mary Robinson to participate in this motion which is a significant motion.  As the proposer and seconder have stated, it is about a very fundamental issue, that of human rights. I formally subscribe to the philosophy of the brotherhood of mankind under the fatherhood of God.  It behoves all of us to exhibit concern and where possible to take action in areas where our fellow humans have their rights threatened by others.</P>
      <P>In common with a great number of Irish people I first really became aware of Tibet when Dervla Murphy from Lismore in County Waterford published what I think was her first major work and revealed Tibet to a wide readership.  I have a vivid memory of treasuring that book as a young girl and of being excited by its exotic contents.  Dervla Murphy was adept at conjuring up visions of saffron-robed Buddhist monks, peaceful quiet monasteries where the lamas prayed their beads and meditated and lived a life that was so very strange and different from the lives we lived.  Dervla Murphy provided a certain window on Tibet for people in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that there is an awareness of Tibet and a groundswell of sympathy and support for those people, a certain understanding of its culture and traditions and a realisation of the value and importance of the culture and traditions of Tibet.  Irish people will be pleased to know that Tibet is being debated tonight in this House, that the Minister and the Department are being reminded of its significance and that the Government are being asked to instigate a motion in support of the Tibetan people at the UN.  For some reason there has been an extraordinary silence on this issue worldwide and from successive Irish Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan when questioning this silence spoke of international political convenience that made it rather awkward for countries who are busily trading with the People's Republic of China to adopt a critical and upfront position on the denial of human rights in Tibet.  I have <Col N="1711" /> another view of that in addition to seeing that there are elements of political convenience at work.  From time to time certain issues become fashionable and, as a consequence, other issues drop to the bottom of the agenda or indeed fall off the table.  I think this is what has happened to Tibet.  It just has not been a fashionable issue in the area of human rights.  I hope that this debate this evening will push it up the agenda and that the Minister, when responding to this debate will give a firm indication that our representatives at the United Nations will instigate a motion in support of the Tibetan people and will be seen to move swiftly and to reflect the concerns of the Members of the Oireachtas who have spoken here this evening.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to have the briefing material from the Tibet Support Group. I would like to mention the importance and the value of support groups in this country.  As solidarity movements they have exhibited their strength and influence in relation to many countries over the last number of years.  I can think of the support group for Chile, one for Nicaragua, one for EI Salvador, and I suppose the father of all such support groups &mdash; anyway the one that has been around the longest and which has just celebrated its twenty-fifth birthday, so to speak &mdash; is the Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement.  Were it not for such groups &mdash; and in this case I speak of the Tibet Support Group &mdash; I do not know if there would be a useful level of debate about Nicaragua, El Salvador, Tibet and South Africa.  As Members of the Oireachtas we are indebted to people who come together, in solidarity, to inform themselves about a particular country, to raise the profile and awareness of that country among the population in general.  In particular I would pay tribute to them for alerting Members of the Oireachtas to the actual conditions pertaining on the ground in so many Third World countries. In this case I would like to express my gratitude publicly to the Tibet Support Group who have prompted debate on this important issue here this evening <Col N="1712" /> and, of course, the debate will be continued next week.</P>
    <P>Really what we are dealing with is backyard politics.  It is about a major power moving in on another area because of greed, of self-interest, of aggrandisement, ambition and, as a consequence, shoving aside and trampling all over the rights of the indigenous population.  We have seen backyard politics manifest themselves in Central America, in Southern Africa, and wherever major powers and/or superpowers choose to flex their muscles.  Perhaps the example closest to home is Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>The atrocities of the Chinese in Tibet have been spelled out for us here this evening.  It is true to say that perhaps the latest onslaught would not have been made known to us in the West had not one of the victims been a Dutch tourist. As a consequence of that the happening was reported in the European press.  Had the non-violent parade ended in such a way that those who had been maimed and killed were Tibetans only, given the level of clamp-down and the distance involved, it is highly likely that we would never have heard of it at all.  It is quite shocking to think that 1.2 million Tibetans have been killed since the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1949 and that an estimated 2,200 monks, nuns and lay Tibetans have been imprisoned without trial, interrogated and tortured following demonstrations in Lhasa in October 1987 and March 1988.</P>
    <P>In voicing our condemnation of the repression, the violence and the denial of human rights which has been perpetrated on the Tibetans by the Chinese, we should not, as Senator Robinson has said, appear to go on the attack against China and neglect to emphasise the fact that our reasons for raising this issue and for having this debate are ones of immense concern for the almost annihilation of a race which has so much richness, which has contributed and will contribute, if it is given a chance to do so, to the diversity and richness of the whole of humanity. This motion should have the effect of urging the Irish Government not only to support all international measures to <Col N="1713" /> establish peace and respect for human rights in Tibet but to take a role of initiation in this area.  I get rather weary of hearing the phrase come glibly from the lips of successive Government Ministers that we must act in concert with our fellow EC partners&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and a clear stance on issues of foreign policy?  We are slipping up very badly.  We have a wonderful position from which to exert that moral authority.  We are independent.  We have been colonised.  We understand what that is about.  We have a deep and abiding folk memory of that time.  We have emerged from that chrysalis.  We are, supposedly, non-aligned though I often wonder have we aligned ourselves so much with out own self-interest, with commerce and with our perceived allies that we have forgotten about that moral authority which we have and could use to such good effect in the many fora in which we are equal, important and significant members.</P>
      <P>My contribution to this debate is to urge the Minister to re-examine our role in foreign policy particularly in relation to the issue of which we speak this evening, to have courage and conviction and a certain steadfast moral approach which would allow him to speak clearly in a very determined, sure way about the issue of the Tibetan people; to assist and push for change so that that people can live freely, with pride and dignity, reasserting their ancient historic value in this world.  If they are assimilated by the Chinese, if they are forgotten by Western governments, if their culture and humanity is not part of us we will all be impoverished. That is why it is with great pleasure that I participate in this debate and I add my few words to this discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Had a joint committee of the Oireachtas on foreign affairs been established this motion might never have been tabled.  I think this motion might not even appear on the Order Paper but rather would be debated by that committee. A lot of information may have to be solicited from the support groups before we will be able to have a much fuller debate not only on the problems facing Tibet, but also on all the other areas we should be concerned about, such as civil rights and so on.</P>
      <P>One Senator expressed the view to me that if the Russians were to do what the Chinese have done, there would be an outcry and a call for economic sanctions, but given our small amount of trade with the Chinese, that approach would not prove to be effective.  We do, however, have an effective voice.  As Senator Bulbulia has said, we are neutral and understand what it is like to be colonised.  On the other hand, we also need to take a look at the position in China.  It is appreciated that the Chinese lived under one system for a thousand years or more before having a different system imposed upon them, but this hardly excuses them for brutalising the people of Tibet, for plundering their natural resources or murdering them in their thousands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should expect more of the Chinese who have in fact experienced many difficulties themselves down through the centuries.  In times gone by they believed themselves to be supreme and for many centuries held that particular belief.  They suffered at the hands of western imperalism and it was the task of the government under Chiang Kai Shek to liberate the country, unify it, advance its economy to equal those in the West and to rebuild its military strength so as to ensure that the country would never again be despoiled.  It is to their credit that they did all of those things and could face the world once again with pride and confidence.  Now that they have reembarked on this style of oppression against the people of Tibet, we should lean very hard on them.  I am not saying we do this by way of imposing economic sanctions as that would be unrealistic, but <Col N="1715" /> by using our voice in the United Nations, by rallying support, we can highlight the issue which is what we are doing here in this House today.  Perhaps, a debate could also take place on this issue in the other House.  It is good that this motion is being debated in the sense that, no matter what party we are a member of and no matter what our religion may be, we can never because of our background and history feel free when others countries of the world are being raped and plundered and atrocities being committed against their peoples.</P>
    <P>Following the Chiang Kai Shek period, the communists did in fact contribute to the adjustment Chinese society needed and worked to help build up their confidence and to help them in rebelling against what had happened in the past. In my view it is obvious that we should demand that those Chinese who took over from the colonisers, who took over large areas of their land should not start to inflict punishment on or usurp another nation.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that the Chinese lost control over many parts of their own country and had to cede large parts of their land to neighbouring powers, including Russia, and the colonial authorities who took over along the outer fringes of the country.  The Chinese are concerned about their relations with the Russians and hope for improved relations with the West, and with the United States in particular.  To this end they have embarked on a programme of cultural exchanges and have adopted new trading arrangements.  This has not happened in the past and it makes them more vulnerable to the pressure being brought upon them by countries such as Ireland through the United Nations.  We should never, as a small nation, make any apology for highlighting the disastrous events that occurred following the invasion of Tibet by China.  We should never under any circumstances feel ashamed for doing so.  We should never be anything but firm in our condemnation of any regime who bring about the deaths of innocent people and lock people up for indefinite terms <Col N="1716" /> without trial: many people still remain in prison for reasons unknown to them. There is evidence, available through the support groups, to suggest that atrocities are still taking place.  These have been well documented and taped.  We cannot sit idly by and allow this merciless repression to take place without raising our voices.  As I said, we should unite with other nations and try to bring about effective results and to ensure that this crude dictatorship becomes much more lenient.</P>
    <P>We have been told by the support groups that China denies that torture takes place.  Is that not always the case? We are under no obligation to believe the Chinese when they say that torture does not take place.  If we are not happy with the information the support groups have dug out and if we are sceptical about the validity of the documented reports and tapes, we have the right to have the issue fully explored and investigated and brought out into the open.  When sufficient evidence is available the United Nations should take the appropriate action, because the Chinese are now very dependent on the West.  All the natural resources of Tibet would not be enough to meet the needs of the Chinese but that does not stop them from raping the country of its resources.</P>
    <P>We cannot, on the other hand, get into an argument about whether Tibet is part of China or <i>vice versa</i>.  The fact is that Tibet is a part of China.  We cannot change that situation for them by way of this motion but we can let the people of Tibet know that we have a special relationship with them because they are being oppressed, that we as a nation do not tolerate oppression by anybody, that despite our small population we will generate discussion on this subject and encourage other nations to look at what exactly is going on, that if China does not come to heel it will be condemned internationally and will lose a lot of the ground it made up over the years in trying to change many western countries to its way of thinking.</P>
    <P>You cannot take a people's language away from them; you cannot take their <Col N="1717" /> geography away from them; you cannot take their way of life away from them; you cannot put nuclear weapons along their borders and leave them exposed to the manufacture and testing of chemical weapons, etc.; you cannot leave them exposed to military borders; you cannot allow a nation's vast amount of timber to be exported without any benefit to that nation and you cannot allow the situation to develop where an invading nation starts calling for abortions when there is more than one child in a family.  Things like that would not be tolerated anywhere in the West.  Therefore, tonight's discussion places on us the responsibility to state publicly and as quickly as possible that we believe what the support group say.  If anybody does not believe what they say, the support group are there to be questioned and there is substantial evidence to show that since 1949 a substantial number of people in Tibet have been subjected to terrible carnage; if that is the word to describe it.  They have been subjected to famines, persecutions, malnutrition, TB, etc. and we cannot afford to ignore this and not rally to their cry when they come to us.  I do not think the Minister or the Department of Foreign Affairs can work wonders but they should have regard to the fact that we have had some contact with the support group, that we are sincere about this matter and will not be happy just to get a statement back from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  However, we will be happy to know that the matter is being brought up in the proper forum, that is to say the United Nations, where real weight can be put on the Chinese people so as to alleviate the great distress under which the Tibetan people are living at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with some sadness that I rise to speak on this motion because I have always had great respect for the Chinese people and indeed for what the Chinese have done since they threw off the yoke of colonialism and endeavoured to try to re-establish among their own people their own way of life in a free manner.  That we should be debating this <Col N="1718" /> issue is a sad reflection not only of the Chinese but of the times we live in. Having said that, I should like to remind everyone here that this year is the 40th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 70th anniversary of the sitting of the first Dáil and the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution, with all that that meant for equality, liberty and brotherhood.</P>
      <P>Returning to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which is related to the Charter of the United Nations, Article 76, section (c) of that Charter asserts the need to encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion and to encourage recognition of the interdependence of people all over the world.  It is not enough to pursue or encourage countries to respect human rights; it is also necessary for us to recognise that our interdependence demands of us that we interfere fearlessly in so far as these human rights are not being respected in other terrorities.  Therefore I feel that the Irish Government can do a lot in this respect, as indeed they can in many similar situations in the world, provided it continues to establish the moral authority of an independent, peacemaking positively neutral state.  I must say that in recent times I have had cause to wonder whether we will be able to sustain that status for very much longer.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the kernel of this motion lies in paragraph 4 (c) in which we call on the Irish Government to instigate a motion at the United Nations in support of the Tibetan people.  People have said we have to be realistic as to what we can or cannot do but we can certainly do that and if we feel that the case of the Tibetan people is one that is valid and one that needs to be addressed, surely a people who are celebrating the 70th anniversary of the Parliament that gave them their own self-respect should be able to mount such a motion and to call for such debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a peripheral interest in Tibet in that almost by chance in 1963 I went overland as far as Singapore.  While I did <Col N="1719" /> not enter Tibet I ended up in the northern part of Kashmir on a famous houseboat known as the Houseboat Sunbeam with full flush system.  After I had been in it for 24 hours I found out that it was the houseboat in which the Dalai Lama had stayed after he emerged from Tibet.  I dare say there are many <i>Mayflower</i> type houseboats but the point I am making is that anyone who has experienced life and living on the road in the Orient will realise that the Orient, and indeed Africa, has perhaps far more to give us in the context of the way the world is at presently moving then we have to give them. Therefore, it is not a question of not taking away from people what they are. It is perhaps necessary to look at it from another point of view.  It is essential to preserve what such people have, what they are so that they can be part of the interdependent experience of the global community and we will be the better for that.</P>
    <P>There is a fear that China, in the process of its second great change in the last 50 years, will become westernised in its attitudes and that the Yin and the Yang which they talk about in China, the balance, will be lost.  We need the oriental feeling and appreciation of life and living and we also need the occidental.  One cannot live in today's world without the other and it is balance which we should be establishing; one does not get balance without reflection, without meditation, without retreat, without silence, without solitude, the things which are embraced in the monastic life.  I have only a peripheral association with Tibet, but when we think of Tibet, we think of the value of the monastic.  Not so long ago, religion was equated with religiosity, the imperalism of religions, the oppression of religions but at this time people are beginning to realise that it is in the metaphysical world that we may find our salvation in what has become a highly mechanised and highly mechanical age. Therefore, it is absolutely vital for all sorts of reasons, that the unique distinctiveness of these people is preserved and that we are seen, as a State claiming <Col N="1720" /> a philosophy of positive neutrality and claiming to be a peace-making nation, to show our respect for this uniqueness by bringing this motion before the United Nations at this time.</P>
    <P>The Chinese people, if they reflect on it, cannot be satisfied to be doing in Tibet what the USA did in Vietnam or what Russia did in Afghanistan.  It does not matter whether we are dealing with the atrocities of the Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran, the atrocities of the racist regime in South Africa, or what has happened in Tibet.  It all amounts to the same thing, the completely illogical repression of one set of people by another.  I speak now as a doctor and as a person who, hopefully, in spite of all the privilege that I have been fortunate enough to acquire through life, can relate to a pro-life outlook in its widest sense but perhaps the worst aspect of this is that we have the Chinese imposing on the Tibetans, who have become a minority in their own land, forced sterilisation in order to ensure that they do not produce more than one child per family.  Perhaps this is an insurance policy because now they have flooded Tibet with Chinese they might begin to wonder what would happen if the Tibetans were free to have families in the way in which they believe it is right to have them and what effect this might have on the Chinese when they return home or communicate with home. In any case it is for the Tibetans to decide whether this is appropriate for their need. By bursting into Tibet, the Chinese arrogantly subsumed the rights of Tibetan people.  By colonising Tibet they are guilty of the style of imperialism and colonialism against which they claim to be opposed and against which they have shown themselves in the past to be honourably opposed.  By swamping Tibet and squeezing the Tibetans into a minority in their own country, they seem to be in the process of doing what Europeans did &mdash; and let us not forget it &mdash; to aborigines, Maori's and American Indians, a very neat conversion of moving from initially minority colonial rule into majority colonist rule.</P>
    <P>This must highlight, if nothing else <Col N="1721" /> does, in this year when we celebrate the UN Declaration on Human Rights, the travesty of domocracy which goes with the concept of majority rule.  Majoritarianism is dead and buried so far as an understanding of democracy is concerned. We have learned that lesson in Ireland.  We know that the future in Ireland depends on us appreciating it, that it is as wrong for us to equate democracy in Ireland with the right of the Irish majority to rule over the Irish minority as it is for the Northern majority to rule over the Northern minority.  Without consensus democracy means nothing. Having said that, I take the opportunity once again of reading a motion which has now been on the Order Paper for some seven years and awaits with considerable Northern patience its turn for debate, and that is Motion No. 32:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann, recognising the significance of the right to self-determination in giving freedom to the peoples of the world, observing with concern the social and political conflict which has been caused in many nation states by domination of minorities by majorities, urges the Government to recommend to the United Nations the amending of the first sentence of Article 1, Clause 1 of the United Nations Covenants on Human Rights by adding to the words &lsquo;all peoples have the right to self-determination&rsquo;, the words &lsquo;based on the achievement of consensus&rsquo; and to press urgently for a suitable definition of consensus and also for wider publication of the means of achieving it and methods of assessing it.</P>
    <P>How much worse does it become when the majority is the invader and the minority are the indigenous people?</P>
    <P>We have had a list of the atrocities committed against the Tibetan people and it is appropriate for us, as Irish people, who know the effects of oppression both on the oppressed and on the oppressor to remind ourselves of how the people in this country felt about the destruction of their monasteries, to <Col N="1722" /> remind ourselves of how the people felt when they had no rights to determine what type of future they would have for their children.  Let me appeal then in addition to the Government's bringing this motion forward to the United Nations for the establishment of a joint committee on foreign affairs as other Senators have suggested.  We should go forward in this year, the anniversary of so many signposts from the past, to respect human rights, to respect them with courage and, fearlessly, to play our own independent role in the affairs of the world so that we can ensure that that independence which recognises our interdependence with all peoples is not just lip service to paper but can be seen to be something which comes from the heart and is relayed to the world with sincerity and with action.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator John Connor that he proposes to raise the following matter: the need for the Minister for the Marine to relocate the national air and sea rescue services from Baldonnel to Connaught Regional Airport.

      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirlgh, for allowing me time to raise this important issue.  I am somewhat unhappy about the title of the matter raised because it was hurriedly submitted on Monday and I would not want to give the impression that I wanted all the air and sea rescue services relocated away from Baldonnel.  What we are seeking here is that a portion or a significant part of this service be located along the west coast.</P>
      <P>The matter raised on the Adjournment this evening is prompted into extreme urgency by three sea rescue dramas off the west coast and one off the south coast last week.  Sadly, at least four lives were lost.  For several years now there has been a debate to relocate some sea rescue helicopters from their present location at Baldonnel to a location on the west coast where most of the life and death emergencies at sea occur.  Last week's three dramas, tragic and all as they were, that took place immediately off our shoreline at the Aran Islands, Tramore and Valentia Island were pretty typical of what frequently takes place off our coasts during storms, particularly in winter.</P>

    <P>The Atlantic Ocean is often a cruel and bad-tempered neighbour and it is on that area of sea around us that we must concentrate most of our sea rescue services I submit.  For that reason I am requesting in raising this matter that the Government now move three of our Air Corps and Naval helicopters to the west coast and I propose that Connaught Regional Airport at Charlestown, County Mayo, is the ideal central location for these emergency services.  There are proposals to locate helicopters at Shannon where the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Service is and at Finner Camp near Bundoran, County Donegal.  All these proposals have their merits but both places are rather lopsided in location in relation to the rest of the western coastline. Connaught Regional Airport has none of these lopsided characteristics.  It is in the middle of the western coastline and there is no valid argument that it is too far inland as the airport is only minutes in flying time from the sea.  The <Col N="1724" /> board of the airport are willing to allow a helicopter or helicopters to be based here and are willing to improve apron facilities if the need arises to accommodate aircraft.</P>
    <P>The Minister may argue here this evening that it is costly to relocate helicopters to the west coast but in matters of life or death, which happen frequently, costs &mdash; and they are not enormous &mdash; must be seen as secondary.  Last year there was one well publicised case where an unfortunate man died of injuries on board ship off the Mayo coast.  Had he been picked up sooner by helicopter it is generally agreed that his life would have been saved.</P>
    <P>In the last five years our sea rescue helicopter service has been called out on 317 occasions.  Many of those calls would not be life or death cases in the accepted sense, but many of them were and the majority of these life and death emergencies were off the western seaboard in the Atlantic.  That fact, more than any other, makes the case for locating the larger part of our sea rescue services close to or on the coastline where most of the emergencies occur.  We do not argue that the services should be fully removed from Baldonnel.  We argue that the greater part of the air/sea rescue services be moved to where they can have the maximum proximity advantage, to where the problems mostly occur.  In that context the Connaught Regional Airport has that proximity advantage more than any other place.</P>
    <P>There is one other very compelling reason to locate services on the west coast.  The west coast is very poorly served by the lifeboat service which is by and large a voluntary service.  Of six lifeboats operated by the Royal Irish Lifeboat Institute only two operate from west coast ports.  This country needs larger and longer range helicopters attached to our Air Corps and Navy.  This week we commissioned two new Navy ships: the <i>LE Orla</i> and the <i>LE Ciara</i>. This is a positive development not just in conventional defence terms because that function is almost redundant nowadays. We need these ships to use with onboard <Col N="1725" /> helicopters for fishery protection, for marine rescue and, of course, to control smuggling of shiploads of lethal arms as, for example the <i>Eksund,</i> and drugs.</P>
    <P>When we allocate funds again for new defence purchases our priority must be for the purchase of the long-range helicopters of the Puma and Sea King type. We should use these craft with the naval ships <i>LE Eithne, LE Orla</i> and <i>LE Ciara</i> as a single unit or corps primarily for fishery protection, marine rescue and control of lethal smuggling.  Some of these latter points I admit, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, are not included in the request in the Adjournment Matter. Nevertheless they are germane to protecting our coasts and the people who for one good reason or another must use the waters around this island and especially the cruel sea off the west coast.</P>
    <P>There our case rests.  We believe our arguments would be difficult to gainsay. Last week's events brought the problem once again into public focus.  Last year, and indeed almost in every year that we can remember, there were events that brought home to us the inadequacies of the location of our sea rescue services. On all past occasions we failed to act.  If we are to take any lesson from last week's events then we must act now.</P>
    <P>From what I have heard the Minister say publicly I believe he is moving in the direction of relocating the major part of our marine rescue services and I urge him to get enough Cabinet support to make reality out of this very urgent life and death request.  We hope that what we call this enlightened decision that not just I but many others are making is taken before the ripples of last week's events dissipate and disappear.  We hope the Connaught Regional Airport will be the new central location for relocated services and that we will be servicing the very exposed and very dangerous west coast waters of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>The <Col N="1726" /> matter on the Adjournment raised by Senator Connor refers to the need for the Minister for the Marine to relocate the national air and sea rescue services from Baldonnell to the Connaught Regional Airport.  This surprised me, but Senator Connor has clarified his position.  Before I make specific reference to the Connaught Regional Airport, I would like to make some general references to the search and rescue services.</P>
      <P>The Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre, known as MRCC, is responsible for the reception and dissemination of information relating to marine distress signals originating in the sea areas covered by the centre and for the co-ordination of marine rescue measures in these areas.  The centre is located at Shannon Airport and is operated on a 24 hour basis by the Department of Tourism and Transport's air traffic services.  The system of marine search and rescue in the State involves a number of agencies, including the Air Corps, the Naval Service, the Coast Life Saving Service, CLSS, the coast radio stations, port authorities, the Garda Síochána, and the RNLI.  The MRCC can also ask for assistance when needed from the British Navy, the RAF and the British coastguard.  In addition, shipping in the vicinity of a casualty, and in a position to assist, may be called upon by the centre.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the facilities that are available on the west coast.  The Senator referred to two long range lifeboat stations: there are in fact four there and the fifth is coming on stream in County Mayo.  The four are situated at Arranmore in County Donegal, Galway Bay, Valentia in County Kerry and Baltimore in County Cork.  The effective range of these four stations has been doubled in recent years by the installation of fast modern craft.  In November last the institution decided to established a new station at Ballyglass, County Mayo, and station a 52 ft. Arun class lifeboat there. With this new station the entire west coast will have lifeboat coverage up to the required standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fifteen of the 54 CLSS stations are located on the west coast from Waterville <Col N="1727" /> in the south-west to Greencastle on the north-west coast.  All CLSS stations have been progressively modernised in recent times and a programme has been undertaken which will provide each station with up-to-date rescue and communications equipment and train volunteers in their use.  A highly trained cliff rescue unit of CLSS is based at Doolin, County Clare, and a similar unit is at present being trained at Greencastle, County Donegal. It is appropriate to refer to the CLSS, because they carried out the successful rescue of 11 crew members of the motor fishing vessel, <i>Big Cat,</i> at Valentia last week.  Some countries have decided to dispense with the services of the CLSS, but they may review that now in view of recent events off Valentia.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service and the Air Corps also provide assistance when requested. Three of the five Dauphin helicopters are dedicated to search and rescue operations and now have a 24-hour capability.  While the <i>Gladonia</i> off Tramore, to which the Senator referred, was in no imminent danger last week, I would like to make the point that four of the crew were airlifted to safety by the Air Corps Dauphin. This is evidence of advances being made in the night rescue skills by the Air Corps crew.  Anyone who saw the reports on television would have been aware that the ship was actually beached and the crew were never in any danger.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence, the Minister for the Marine and I set up an interdepartmental committee comprising of officials of my Department, the Department of Defence and the Department of Tourism and Transport to examine and report on the development of search and rescue helicopters.  While deliberating, we also took fully into account the report of the West Coast Search and Rescue Action Committee.  I would like to pay tribute to the West Coast Search and Rescue Action Committee for their report and to thank them for their commitment, dedication and their initiation of public concern.</P>
    <P>The Senator referred to the death of John Oglesby on board his motor fishing <Col N="1728" /> vessel, the <i>Neptune</i>.  A meeting in Killybegs last Easter resulted in further initiation of public concern.  The chairperson of that committee has taken a particular interest in this and is with us tonight in the Public Gallery.  I would like to thank her and her committee for their work in compiling the report.</P>
    <P>The Irish Marine Search and Rescue Committee also advised us on the question of helicopter deployment, having studied the West Coast Search and Rescue Action Committee's report.  The committee have put forward a number of options for improving search and rescue helicopter coverage on the west coast. The latest position is that the Government are urgently considering the various options presented by the committee.  I am sure the House will appreciate my position of not being in a position to elaborate further.</P>
    <P>With reference to the suitability of Knock Airport <i>vis-à-vis</i> Shannon Airport or, indeed, any other airport, the interdepartmental committee considered the suitability of various locations for deployment of search and rescue helicopters. Connaught Regional Airport at Knock was one of the locations considered. While, geographically it is the centre of the west coast, there are other factors which have to be taken into consideration &mdash; for example, secure hangars for helicopters are not available.  Connaught Regional Airport at present has limited hours of operation, mainly daytime with occasional extensions, the tower is staffed only during the hours of operation of the airport, navigational equipment is not at the same level as at Shannon, there is no radar, VOR, VHF omni-directional radio range whereas Shannon has security, 24 hour lighting facilities, and MRCC.  The meterological data at Connaught Regional Airport is rudimentary and is sometimes unavailable and forecasts and weather information for the casualty location must be obtained either from Dublin or Shannon.  In Shannon 24 hour forecasts and weather reports are available at all times.  This may cause difficulties when the Connaught tower is unmanned.  I would like to assure the <Col N="1729" /> Senator that all these factors have been considered.  It is also a fact &mdash; not an opinion of mine &mdash; that Shannon has the lowest rate of diversion in Europe while there is quite a high rate of diversion in Knock.</P>
    <P>The Senator referred to recent rescues and the events of last week, and I would also like to refer to them.  These events have shown the extent to which Ireland as a nation on the edge of the Atlantic, which lies to the west, south and south-west of the country is exposed to the dangers of maritime threat.  As one who comes from the north-west coast, I am only too well aware of the exposure on the west coast.  Looking back over some 15 years, as far back as the disaster of the <i>Evelyn Marie,</i> followed by the <i>Carrig Una,</i> followed by the <i>Skijford</i> a number of individuals were lost on boats.  There was also the <i>Boy Shaun</i> and the <i>Creevy</i> disasters and the one to which the Senator referred, the <i>Neptune</i>.  There were many other cases in which there were casualties and where hospitalisation and medication should have been available immediately. As one who comes from an area which, like other parts of the coast, has suffered too many tragedies, I am more than anxious that we try to improve the position.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Valentia tragedy, unfortunately three lives were lost on the <i>Big Cat</i> in Valentia Bay and that is a matter of great sadness.  I commend the skill and bravery of the local members of my Department's coast life saving service who rescued 11 of the crew.  They clambered along rocks on Beginish Island and hauled the crew men one by one from the wrecked vessel by breeches buoy. When the lifeboat could not get alongside the vessel in distress, the coxswain ferried the Valentia CLSS across to Beginish Island.  I would like also to commend the bravery of the Valentia lifeboat crew in this instance.  This co-operation between different agencies is a feature of good search-and-rescue practice.  Here was an example of a successful mission achieved with the skilled use of relatively unsophisticated equipment when weather conditions made a direct helicopter rescue <Col N="1730" /> impossible.  It is unfortunate that we were not in a position to save all the crew.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out in regard to the tremendous work of the CLSS, the helicopter arrived some two and a half hours after the ship foundered by which time the local life-saving service had rescued the men still on board.  If it were not for the CLSS possibly more than three lives would have been lost.</P>
    <P>In relation ot the <i>Yarrawonga</i> I must also praise the magnificent feat of those involved in the rescue of the crew of this bulk carrier.  This particular rescue was among the most daring that I have seen and no amount of praise is adequate for the helicopter crews which participated in that exercise.  The thing that is interesting in the light of the developments of the last week is the extent to which both national and international agencies become involved in rescue activities.  This is an example of SAR knowing no boundaries. This is a reflection of the technical capability of the various maritime nations involved and of the range of technical equipment available to them.  By pooling resources an enormous amount of work can be done and, if I may say so, the past week has been a testimony to the extent that co-operation, willingly given, can produce great results.</P>
    <P>The exercise involving the monitoring of the <i>Yarrawonga</i> after its abandonment was also an exercise involving co-operation among a number of State agencies and the private sector.  My Department were in consultation over the entire weekend with the Naval authorities and the Air Corps to ensure that a Naval vessel and an Air Corps helicopter; together with an Air Corps reconnaissance plane, were in a position to establish the position of the <i>Yarrawonga</i>.  A combination of arrangements involving all these executive arms of the State resulted in the use of an Air Corps helicopter to ferry salvage personnel from the tug <i>Typhoon</i> to the <i>Yarrawonga</i> with two Naval personnel on board as well. These efforts ultimately resulted in the placing of a tow on board and from that moment on the whole outlook began to improve.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1731" /> While I must admit that the matter of major concern to me and to all of us was the saving of human life, Senators will not be surprised if I admit that the threat of pollution or of a wreck being washed up on our shores was also of grave concern to me.  It was with great relief, therefore, that I saw the <i>Yarrawonga</i> taken in tow, escorted by our Naval vessel, out of our territorial waters.  It has been outside our economic zone since 6 p.m. this evening. I do not want to try to score any points because this is a very serious matter but I would have to say that the action taken here is in sharp contrast with the action which was taken when we had a similar problem with the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i>.  If the same action had been taken in that case we would not have had the difficulties that we had off the south coast.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to record my concern to provide the best possible search-and-rescue service for Ireland, consistent with our resources, to give credit to the excellent service already provided by the agencies involved and to assure the Seanad that the Government will decide on improvements in this area <Col N="1732" /> after proper and full consideration of the facts.  Proposals are with Government and are under urgent consideration.  They are considering the various options presented to them.  I would like to repeat, lest one would think I am being evasive, that while these proposals are before Government it would be wrong of me to give any indication whatsoever regarding the matter.  I hope the House, and in particular Senator Connor who raised this matter &mdash; I am very pleased to have the opportunity of replying &mdash; will appreciate that I am in an impossible position while these proposals are with Government and am not in a position to elaborate.  I am fully aware of the problems and of what is necessary off the west coast and I hope there will be a response in the near future.</P>
