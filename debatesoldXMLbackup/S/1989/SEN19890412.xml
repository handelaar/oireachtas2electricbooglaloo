      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make an announcement for the information of the House.  I have received a final progress report on the reconstruction work on the Seanad Chamber from the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works report that the work of restoring the Seanad Chamber is continuing to progress well and is running at or very close to programme. The restoration and redecoration of the ceiling has been completed.  The floor of the Chamber has been laid.  Most of the carpet has been laid and the benches have been returned and fixed in position. Work has commenced on the installation of the sound system for the Chamber.</P>
      <P>Apart from the installation of the sound system which commenced on Monday last and is programmed to take three weeks, including one week for changing over the system from the temporary Chamber to the restored Chamber and commissioning it, the principal works now remaining to be done are: the completion of the decoration of walls, decorative wall mouldings, windows, window shutters, etc. and other refurbishment works such as installation of lighting fittings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="786" /> These works are now going ahead concurrently and, while it is not the ideal way to proceed, with so many trades working in such a restricted area all at one time, the work is progressing satisfactorily and the target date of 3 May for the reoccupation of the Chamber still seems achievable at this stage, but there is no margin for delays.</P>
    <P>Every effort was made to undertake the noisiest of the work during the recess and this has largely been achieved. However, it is inevitable that some noisy work will continue to arise on the site from time to time.  The padding and screens which had been in position to lessen noise penetration into the temporary Chamber have had to be removed to facilitate laying of the carpet and decoration of the doors.  There is, as a result, a risk that noise from the site may penetrate into the temporary Chamber.  Site staff have been instructed to keep noise to a minimum especially while the Seanad is in session.  If, despite all precautions, it becomes necessary to suspend some work on the site due to the noise factor every effort will be made to make up any time lost.  However, the overall programme is now so tight that it might become necessary to defer the reoccupation of the Chamber for a week in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>I ask for the co-operation and patience, as we have had throughout, of all Senators for the final phase of this work. The Committee on Procedure and Privileges will meet next week about arrangements for the first day back in the Chamber.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Joe O'Toole that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The anomaly of withdrawing social welfare payments including disability benefit scheme payments, assistance and pay-related payments from unemployed persons suffering from gambling addiction because they voluntarily enter a rehabilitation and treatment programme for compulsive gambling which is recognised as a disease.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator O'Toole as suitable for discussion and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, may I say I am delighted at the return of this House to the Seanad Chamber.  I accept what the Chair has said in relation to that move.  I think it is very important that you keep us up to date.  I do not think there should be any problems.  If there are any problems I hope that news will be conveyed to us, as you told us the good news today. It is intended to take Items Nos. 1 and 2 and Item No. 3 which will be taken from 6.30 to 8 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last session there was a query by Senator Fennell about, Item No. 15, the Interpretation (Amendment) Bill, 1989. I will just say we will take that at an early stage in consultation with the Whips. There were two other queries that were made prior to the Adjournment.  One was the Report on Press Freedom and Libel by Professor Boyle and the other one was the ozone layer.  On each of those we will have an early debate, taking into account the business for the next two weeks.  We have Item No. 41 on the Order Paper and we will give it a reasonable time.  In view of the fact that there is a large volume of public opinion which would suggest that we should debate the <Col N="788" /> National Development Plan, I propose at this stage that we devote next week to that matter, unless there is urgent business or unless the House wants to discuss something else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>First, on the Order of Business, may I thank the Chair for the very full statement and say we are all very anxious to get back to the Chamber. Would the Cathaoirleach consider perhaps some suitable special debate or special event to mark the return to the Chamber?  Perhaps the Committee on Procedures and Privileges could look at that.</P>
      <P>On today's Order of Business there are two hours and five minutes remaining on the motion, Item No. 3 and perhaps if other business ends before that could we start that at 6 p.m.?  Perhaps the Whips can talk about that afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, could the Leader of the House at some stage &mdash; and he has been very helpful today &mdash; give us some indication of the legislation which it is proposed will be before this House during the coming session to enable Members to prepare themselves for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to welcome the Cathaoirleach's statement on the return of this House to its proper Chamber.  Secondly, may I ask what is the position with regard to Item No. 27, which I have asked about on many occasions before?  I do not wish to be irritating about it, but the situation with regard to planning compensation is an increasingly serious one and the measures here contain the Taoiseach's own proposals some years ago for amending it. In the light of this, I would like to ask in an extension of what Senator Manning asked with regard to the programme of legislation, if there is any indication as to what time the Government's own proposals in this area will be coming before this House and whether they will be capable of reasoned amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="789" /> I would like also to ask with regard to Item No. 30, which is a motion in my name and that of Senator Ross about the possibility of the Government conferring honorary citizenship on Raoul Wallenberg. I ask this because I think this is now a much more serious matter.  It may have appeared merely theoretical but I now have possession of facts which would enable this technically to be done.  I would like an indication, if possible, as to whether the Government would make time available for an all-party Bill to be introduced.  I have in my possession such a Bill from Senator Nurgitz of Canada. The reason I say this is because previously it was stated that there was a constitutional bar&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>You do not ask a question and go on then to make a speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel a Chathaoirligh, with the greatest respect, that I have to provide some additional reason so that I do not merely get the same answer I got before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Your judgment of asking a question and making a speech and mine are certainly different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I will conclude with a question addressed to yourself because I would like some advice from you and the Leader of the House on what I take to be a very serious matter concerning the procedures of this House and concerning the accuracy of the record of the House in terms of matters of fact because I am now in possession of information that a senior Minister misled this House on an important matter of fact on the Incitement to Hatred Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. It is certainly not for the Order of Business here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>What I wish to do, with the greatest respect, is to ensure that factual misstatements which affected the <Col N="790" /> processing of legislation through this House are actually corrected on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Norris is totally out of order in his allegations against senior Ministers.  I ask him to withdraw his allegations against a senior Minister.  I think that unless he does that he should be asked to withdraw from the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot fly in the face of fact.  There must be room in this House for truth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris may not raise this matter in this way.  We have a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges next week and he has a representative on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think a very dangerous allegation has been made by a Member of this House and I ask the Senator to withdraw the remark unreservedly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an allegation made against an unnamed person.  There is no precedent in this House for the withdrawal of allegations against unnamed persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been stated that a senior Minister misled this House.  I will not have that allowed in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understood it &mdash; and the Senator was immediately beside me &mdash; he asked you, as Cathaoirleach of this House, for guidance on the matter. The matter that was raised was one which concerned a Minister who was not named.  It is alleged by Senator Norris that there was a factual misleading of this House.  It is a matter that he is perfectly entitled to raise and seek the guidance of the Chair on it and that is what he did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Incitement to Hatred legislation, he is referring to a specific Minister.  He is not referring to &ldquo;any&rdquo; Minister.  He referred <Col N="791" /> to a specific Minister and it is deplorable that that should happen in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, you have been asked to rule on this.  You have said it can go to the Committee on Procedures and Privileges.  It is over as far as we are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>He made a specific allegation and I think it is deplorable in this House if he is allowed to continue in that vein.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, Item No. 36 concerns the situation with regard to dental benefit for spouses and I wonder if we could have time to discuss this?  It has become a very serious issue since the motion was put down and I would like if we could have some information on the situation at the moment. Regarding Item No. 42, a motion in the names of Senator Norris and Senator Ross, can the Leader of the House give us any indication as to when we shall have the Patents Bill which is due and has been promised in the Dáil?  I wonder if he could give us any information on the situation regarding that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like the Order of Business to conclude without bringing to the attention of Senators the fact that a young girl of 15 was killed this morning at Warrenpoint by a no-warning bomb. Thirty people were injured and had to go to Newry Hospital.  I remember when Judge Gibson was blown up almost two years ago to the day &mdash; at least about this time of the year &mdash; not far away from Warrenpoint &mdash; a lot of things were said. I do not think we should reserve our condemnation only for judges and high-ranking citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is an appalling reflection on affairs in Ireland that we are enduring this continual carnage after 20 years.  We <Col N="792" /> all have got questions to ask ourselves, no one more so than the Provisional IRA. They were once, perhaps understandably, in a somewhat hubristic state at the time of the fall of Stormont but I would say now they are &ldquo;the pits&rdquo;.  They should ask themselves, for the sake of their families and the rest of the people of Ireland, just how they feel by perpetuating this atrocious campaign, particularly in the light of what happened to that nice girl this morning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I must press this point about the allegations that have been made by Senator Norris which are totally and utterly against the rules of this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Will Senator Norris, just for the sake of peace and harmony in the House, withdraw the remark?  It was pointed &mdash; I did not realise this immediately &mdash; directly at a specific Minister. The Senator did state that he did not name him but just not to start off on this note at the beginning of the session I would ask him to withdraw the remark until we have the meeting next week of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and he can take it further there through his respresentative.  The Senator did indicate the Department and that was sufficient.  I ask him to withdraw the remark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to take your advice. I am happy that this matter, which I regard as being of the utmost seriousness, should be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I hope and I presume that the committee will make a report to this House on the matter and it will then become a matter of debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, there was a very serious allegation made against the Minister.  I am not accepting what has been said by Senator Norris.  I want to press the point that he either withdrew&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am engaged for the rest of the day and I cannot call an emergency meeting but I ask Senator Norris again to please withdraw the remark and then we will get on with the business for today.  Senator O'Toole, I am dealing with Senator Norris and I do not need your assistance.  Senator Norris, will you withdraw the remark?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>My only difficulty is this: I do not want to weaken the position that I have taken in this matter.  If I withdraw the remark &mdash; and I prepared to do this because I do not want to waste time in the House &mdash; it will, I am afraid, be a temporary withdrawal.  I will put it this way: I am quite happy to withdraw the remark from this forum so that I can make the allegations to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The withdrawal is not an unreserved withdrawal.  I cannot accept what Senator Norris has said.  Unless the Committee on Procedure and Privileges asks Senator Norris to appear before them, there is no way he can appear there.  He has a representative as a member of the Independent group and the member of the Independent group who is on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges can make the point for Senator Norris.  I will not accept the withdrawal with reservation of the remark.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This is tantamount to an interference with the democratic process.  A Member of this House, duly elected, asked for guidance to deal with a matter which he has discussed and raised over the last fortnight.  The rabble will have their say, I am sure, one after the other, if they wish to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw that unreservedly. I would say that advice was sought from the Cathaoirleach as to how to deal with a particular matter.  The Cathaoirleach gave advice that it should be raised at the CPP.  The Leader of the House is now ten minutes later repeating the same advice.  As the Senator who raised the matter said, that was quite acceptable to him.  We do not understand how the matter is still continuing.  The Senator sought advice, the Cathaoirleach gave advice, the advice was accepted and that should be the end of the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I really must object to this.  In the interests of fair play, all Senators are entitled to make their case here and to have a hearing.  We have to find some way out of this.  I am repeating my request for an emergency meeting today of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to sort this matter out once and for all.  I propose that the Senator be invited to make his case at that meeting.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, the Leader of the Opposition asked about legislation coming forward within the next few weeks; there are a number of Bills coming forward.  What I am saying is that today and tomorrow we have an Order of Business and for next week we have an Order of Business.  There are a number of Bills which will be coming into the House, including those dealing with the Shannon Authority and the Shannon Development Plan.  What I would say is that over today and tomorrow the Whips can meet and an Order of Business decided.  I was trying to be helpful today by saying what was happening today and tomorrow and what would happen next week.</P>
      <P>Senator Nuala Fennell asked about the Dental Bill.  There is a motion on dental benefit, Item No. 36.  This is an emotive issue at present and I am sure the Minister for Health is taking the basis of this motion into account when he is dealing with the benefits for spouses and various other things.  There are a number of problems attached to that motion but we will discuss it with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Patents Bill, the reply given by the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, <Col N="796" /> to a debate here prior to Christmas when he mentioned the problems associated with the Patents Bill should be circulated to all Members and then we can discuss where we go from there.  There are difficulties and they are not associated with this or the order House.  There are difficulties with the Patents Bill which are to do with European conventions on patents.  I am not a legal person but I am sure Senator Robinson is well aware of the difficulties.  It is something that is not exactly in our area.</P>
    <P>Item No. 30 about Raoul Wallenberg is not a matter for this House.  It is a matter for the Government and I will leave it to the Government to decide where to take that particulare motion. Again, Senator Robb's intervention is a timely one and all we can do here is agree with all his sentiments.  Unfortunately, the sentiments expressed in this House regarding the killing of anybody seem to fall on deaf ears.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (1) (d), lines 26 to 29, to delete all words down to and including &ldquo;work,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation is so comprehensive and the Minister is so determined to find ways and means of serving notices and that notices would be served, including summons notices, orders, etc. or anything required under the legislation, that he is doing it in a flexible way.  We feel that when you get down to the question of worrying about looking for addresses, etc. measured against the other parts of the section there could be quite a lot of delay and in the intervening period <Col N="797" /> something could happen that would make the particular intention less effective.</P>
    <P>What we are saying here is that instead of worrying about the address where such person ordinarily resides if it cannot be ascertained by reasonable inquiry and notice is required to be served on him or given to him in respect of any place of work, section (d) should merely say &ldquo;by delivering it to a person over the age of 16 years of age resident in or employed at a place of work or by affixing it in a conspicuous position on or near the place of work.&rdquo; We think the Minister is going out of his way here.</P>
    <P>Overall, if you read through the legislation in general it is very substantial and comprehensive and is very good indeed. The Minister is not tying himself down in, for example, section 3(1) (a) by saying that the notice must be delivered to the person in the same way as you would say a summons is to be delivered but that it can be delivered to a partner and it still has the same effect.</P>
    <P>In section 3 (1) (b) the Minister makes it valid by saying that it can be served by leaving it at the address at which the person ordinarily resides.  That is fair enough but when you come down to the question of subsection (1) (d) we are talking about what happens if the person cannot be found.  It seems you go on a bit of a tour looking for the person and, as we see it, this would cause some delays. We are not terribly hung up on it; it is just that we feel it would be much more direct to say: &ldquo;Forget about looking for the address: it is not the same as serving a summons in a certain way.&rdquo;  Therefore, we suggest you could start off by saying delivering it to a person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have given some consideration to this amendment and I thank the Senator for his remarks about the legislation in general. I would like to explain in some detail our considered view on this amendment. The purpose of section 3 is to standardise the requirement relating to the service of any documents, including summonses <Col N="798" /> and notices under all the relevant statutory provisions on safety and health at work.</P>
      <P>The section closely reflects other recent legislation &mdash; for example, the provisions of section 38 of the Fire Services Act, 1981. This section provides a wide range of options to the Authority as an enforcing agency or an inspector, as the case may be, to ensure that documents can be served through several possible ways, so they do not have to limit themselves. It covers the service of notice on individuals, partnerships and bodies corporate and unincorporated, as Senator Harte has stated.</P>
      <P>It provides for the service of notice either by direct delivery to a named person or to any partnership or by leaving it at a place of business.  A notice can also be left either at a person's residence or be sent by registered post to that address &mdash; for instance, to a registered office.  If there is a problem about finding out an address which, needless, to say could arise, the notice can be handed to a person over 16 years of age living or working at a place of work or in those circumstances a notice can be fixed on or to the workplace.</P>
      <P>None of the options provided for in section 3 takes precedence over the others; they are a range of options and the Authority and inspector in serving a document will obviously choose the method which is considered to be the most appropriate in the circumstances of the case.  The important point is that the section provides a range of options as regards the method of service to be used. In the case of a range of matters covered by the Bill, such as improvement directions, which is in section 35 of the Bill, or improvement notices in section 36, or prohibition notices as in section 37, or section 42 where it is notice requiring information, the relevant document may be issued to the person in control of the activity in question or some other relevant person.  In other words, the document may not necessarily have to be served on the employer himself at his business or other address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="799" /> The provisions of section 3 are designed to strike an appropriate balance between the needs of the Authority and the inspectors in discharging their functions effectively and the needs and rights of the recipients.  Subsection (1) (d) is the only one of the options provided for with this in mind.  If the amendments tabled were to be accepted, the remaining provisions of subsection (1) (d) would add very little, for example, to the provisions of subsection (2) (b).</P>
    <P>What we are trying to do in section 3 is to give as wide a range of options as is absolutely possible so that the Authority or the inspectors can then follow that range.  From experience and knowledge over the years, the inspectors have to deal with all the people who would be trying to avoid their authority or trying to avoid taking a notice.  We believe this covers all of those options and, at the same time, gives a flexibility to the Authority or an individual inspector in dealing with the issue.</P>

      <P>Yes.  With section 3 it is not just one day it is the whole range of areas.  From debates and discussions we have had on this particular aspect what we are attempting to do is to narrow <Col N="800" /> down and eliminate, if possible, any doubt about our being able to track somebody down or being able to issue the summons.  We are quite satisfied with it.  There were some issues raised about multinational companies and people outside the country and other difficulties like that.  However, I think in section 3 we have given ourselves all the possible options and, from the legal point of view, as far as it is practical to issue and to serve documents, we are satisfied that this will be conclusive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically relating to repeals of statutory enactments and statutory instruments, I have two questions for the Minister.  First, in relation to the various sections of earlier legislation, they are to be repealed when the provisions of this Bill come into operation. It would be helpful if the Minister could indicate how it is envisaged this will come into operation.  The Minister has power to bring in different parts of it at different times.  Could he give an overall indication of what the timescale is likely to be for bringing in the various provisions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second question relates to subsection (2), which revokes provisions of a number of statutory instruments set out in Part II of the Second Schedule.  The revocation is in relation to penalties.  It is very worrying that there are a number of statutory instruments adopted under the European Communities Act, 1972, and therefore exercising the very wide power available to Ministers, being amended by this measure rather than being incorporated into it as substantive provisions. In other words, the power to bring in statutory instruments to implement our obligations under the European Communities may be necessary at the time in <Col N="801" /> order to implement the particular directives within the timescale permitted by the EC.  But it certainly has been the consistent view of the Joint Committee on EC legislation that when an Act of the Oireachtas is brought forward the provisions of the statutory instrument should be incorporated in what then becomes a codified statutory measure, whereas we have now got this measure establishing the new Authority relating to safety, health and welfare at work but it was to be read with a considerable number of statutory instruments dealing with issues that could have been incorporated into this legislation in relation, for example, to the safety signs in places of work regulations.  Why are safety signs at places of work in a statutory instrument rather than in the main Act?  In relation to classification of packaging of dangerous substances, why is this not incorporated in the main legislation?</P>
    <P>It is an important issue because the statutory instruments in question are never properly scrutinised by the Oireachtas.  They are examined by the Joint Committee on Legislation as statutory instruments but that is a much less public, a much less rigorous and much less adequate scrutiny.  It is not desirable that a major statute of this kind relating to safety, health and welfare at work would be built on a whole network of statutory instruments, indeed amend those statutory instruments, so it is even harder to know what is the state of the law.</P>
    <P>It seems to be a very bad policy and approach, particularly in this area.  Not only is the Bill concerned with a most important area of health and safety but also it is important that people understand it and that its provisions be ones that can be fully comprehended both by employers and employees.  I would like to know if this is a matter that has been considered by the Department and what the reason is for not having a genuine codifying measure at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Robinson asked two questions.  The first is straightforward. Most of the powers would come <Col N="802" /> in under a commencement order which will be undertaken immediately.  It is on the record generally that we would have a work programme, which we have a agreed with the social partners, to implement the legislation on as early a date as possible.  On the passing of the legislation we would commence with setting up the Authority and then try and bring in as many of the provisions as possible by commencement order.  It is my intention to stick rigidly to that programme.</P>
      <P>On the question of the statutory instruments there are in this area, as Senator Robinson will appreciate, a huge number of statutory instruments and this is a framework legislation.  If we had to look at all the statutory instruments and the various regulations we would probably never get around to implementing this legislation.  I take Senator Robinson's point on general legislation.  Having served on committees over the years, I am aware of the view of both Houses on EC regulations.  Part IV, section 27, of the Bill sets out the regulations, codes of practice and review of legislation which will have to be undertaken by the authority. The Authority will look at all of the statutory instruments that are there and, by regulations, will amend those regulations which they are prepared to go along with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Social Affairs Council of the Community in the past few years we have spent practically all of our time discussing new regulations under safety and health because it is a problem, and particularly so in this country.  This Bill will help to highlight the importance of safety and health.  Particularly in Germany and in other countries safety and health have for a number of years been the focus of social legislation.  There are a great number of regulations which have not yet been discussed in depth here.  We believe our legislation will be in line with those regulations but there will be a great amount of work to be done on their implementation. In reply to Senator Robinson's question, the Authority will have to undertake a review of the statutory <Col N="803" /> instruments and, by regulation, implement them under the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for responding to my question. The Authority is given power under this Bill to review the legislation &mdash; indeed it has a duty to do so under section 27 &mdash; but these particular statutory instruments, which are set out in Part II of the Schedule and are amended by the revocation of certain provisions by this Act are all required by our obligations as a member of the European Communities. We have got to implement them either by statutory instrument or by statute.</P>
      <P>My question was a different one.  It is not that you replace these statutory instruments with a different statutory instrument: we could do it by statutory instrument initially because it is implementing our obligations of membership and there is a time scale problem and the European Communities Act, 1972, empowered that way of implementing obligations.  But in fact that is contrary to the normal position where Ministers cannot legislate, as the Minister is well aware.  I think it is highly undesirable from a policy-making point of view, and potentially unconstitutional.  That issue is now being raised by a number of academic writers, and I think they have a point.  To implement, and think it is entirely satisfactory, major issues of substantive law by statutory instrument just because they are part of our obligations of membership may not be compatable with the Constitution.  It was understandable in 1972, because we had to implement a whole backlog of legislation going back 15 years to bring us up to date with what had happened since 1957 or earlier for the Coal and Steel Treaty. However, it is not a satisfactory situation and I do not think the Minister has answered the real point I was making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real point is that substantive measures such as the requirement of certain safety signs at places of work or the actual updated provisions on the preparation of <Col N="804" /> dangerous substances and their marketing and use should be in the main legislation.  The main legislation should, where necessary, empower the Minister to make implementing regulations under the parent Act.</P>
    <P>A number of the measures covered by these European Communities statutory instruments are substantive new law, not law made by the Oireachtas but law simply made by statutory instrument.  It is time to review the way in which this operates.  It is not satisfactory, and is positively detrimental to the full implementation of this Bill and its intention to protect workers in their safety and health, by doing so in a measure that amends a whole series of statutory instruments rather than introducing into the main statute the particular substantive provisions and then allowing the Minister to supplement that in the normal way by regulations, but under the tight control of the parent Act.</P>
    <P>It is very curious at the moment how strict the Irish courts are about Ministers exercising powers.  As the Minister will be well aware, there have been a number of challenges to an Irish Minister acting <i>ultra vires</i> the powers of the parent Act in a statutory instrument in much less significant areas than the areas covered by the range of statutory instruments in the Schedule.</P>
    <P>What I ask the Minister &mdash; he may not wish to give an immediate answer &mdash; is that it is not a case of the Authority substituting a different statutory instrument for the statutory instruments in the Schedule.  It will be important for consideration to be given to a consolidating Bill which takes the existing statutory instruments which implement our obligations under the Community and incorporates them in primary legislation at an early opportunity so that this could then be read with that consolidating Act as representing as far as the Oireachtas is concerned the law in question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be prepared to consider what the Senator is saying.  It is sensible that we take some advice on how that can be done.  It is a valid point but I <Col N="805" /> do not think it affects the Act.  In recent months we have brought in statutory instruments dealing with, for example, lead and asbestos to implement European directives.  That is the way we have been operating.  The Authority should look at all those directives and statutory instruments and consider consolidation. Probably the most suitable time to do that would be at the end of the present European review.  This legislation is, hopefully, broad and flexible enough, but it is still detailed and the regulations which will go with this legislation will be extremely detailed.  Having been in the Department of Labour and having observed the officials who had to draft the various regulations to correspond with our commitments under EC directives, I can say they are, at the very least, highly technical and complex.  Therefore, to have them finally in a consolidated Act would seem to me to be eminently sensible.  I would be prepared to seek advice and to look to the Authority.  Ultimately having a review of the directives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's willingness to look further at this matter.  That is a very helpful response. If I could just add one more point, since the matter may be looked into either by the Authority or by the officials of his Department.  I fully accept &mdash; and there are numerous examples of it &mdash; that it is quite common for our obligations, under whatever provisions or directives, to be implemented by statutory instrument; but section 3 of the European Communities Act, 1972, which authorises that, is couched in very broad terms.  It has never, as such, been examined by the courts.  If that measure itself is necessitated by our obligations of membership, it gets immunity under the amendment to the Constitution in 1972.  When that was passed, there was a very good argument for the need to broaden the power to implement by statutory instrument. But I think the question has to be asked now: why would it be necessitated by our obligations that we do it by statutory instrument?  Could we not do it perfectly well by the normal procedure of an Act <Col N="806" /> of the Oireachtas?  Where is the element of it being in some way necessitated by our obligations that we would do it that way?</P>
      <P>The Constitution very expressly states that it is the Oireachtas which has the sole power to make laws for the State and yet, increasingly, we are doing it by statutory instrument.  Our use of statutory instrument in that regard is much wider than under a comparable system &mdash; that is why I refer to it.  The tendency of the Parliament of the United Kingdom is to use primary legislation, Acts of the Westminster Parliament, to implement obligations.  It is not very useful to pursue that comparison too much because they do not have a written Constitution, so the issue does not arise but, as a matter of parliamentary policy, they leave it to Parliament to implement substantial changes in United Kingdom law, whereas for us it is not just a matter of policy; it is a matter of constitutional interpretation.</P>
      <P>I would just put out a signal.  It may well be that there will be a challenge to the use of statutory instruments to implement substantive changes in the law of Ireland.  Simply invoking the power to do so under section 3 of the 1972 Act would involve a constitutional challenge and there would be quite an onus on anyone who did so.  The basis is that the Oireachtas is the sole law-making power, but that measures can be taken if they are necessitated by membership of the European Communities.  But how can you argue that it is necessary to do it by statutory instrument at this stage when Parliament is perfectly capable of doing it?  It is important that there should be consideration of these statutory instruments and, more importantly for a measure such as this, we should not have a significant number of statutory instruments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one looks at Part II of the Second Schedule, it is clear that a number of the statutory instruments made under the European Communities Act amend earlier statutory instruments, so you have as well a series of statutory instruments amending each other.  That is all the more reason why it is desirable that it would <Col N="807" /> be incorporated in primary legislation, particularly when it relates to matters like dangerous substances and the use of dangerous substances which are very important areas for the law to be clearly ascertainable.  I have added those few words if the matter is going to be reviewed by the Department, which I hope it will be.  I sound a note of caution that the power to implement by statutory instrument may not be quite as copperfastened and as immune from potential constitutional infirmity as was thought.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not get into what might or might not happen in a constitutional argument in the future.  As it stands now, under section 2 of the European Communities Act, 1972, the position is: &ldquo;From 1 January 1973 the Treaties governing the European Communities and the existing and future Acts adopted by the institutions of those Communities shall be binding on the State and shall be part of the domestic law thereof ...&rdquo;.  Section 3 of that Act allowed the Minister of State to make regulations to enable section 2 to have full effect.</P>
      <P>The arguments put forward by the Senator may or may not come to fruition. It is hard to know what would actually happen in that case, but as of now the position is quite clear in the 1972 Act.  As I said earlier, a primary Act is always far clearer.  The great example I have seen in this House was back in 1981 when the Social Welfare Acts from the time of the foundation of the State, along with many of the Acts we had inherited from the previous administration prior to the foundation of the State, were all consolidated. I sat on that committee for about a year when it was consolidating these Acts.  I have held the view since that a consolidated Bill is always of far greater benefit and ease for everybody. Having had a great interest in that particular Bill, I do not think I will ever change that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is a difficulty.  In our system, if you do not use statutory instruments and use regulations, all the time <Col N="808" /> going back to a primary Act, you can have very long delays.  It has always been a feature of our legislative system &mdash; right or wrong, but probably wrong &mdash; that if something is not of immediate need the sections that would normally go into a statutory instrument or regulation would be held until there would be a main Act, and that could be several years.  We have probably all seen examples where a main Act is coming up and a lot of little sections are put into that Act for that reason. While the statutory instruments, as the Senator quite rightly says, can be used for anything and might have powers that should not be there, at the same time I would not like to lose that flexibility whereby we can implement EC laws into our regulations by statutory instruments. If we were to do it the other way, perhaps we would not be so up to date in our EC commitments as we should.  However, I will review what the Senator has said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section, I have a general question that covers a number of the sections.  I know it was examined in the other House to some extent, but it appears that the actual formulation of the general duties of employers is watered down by that formula that is much discussed, &ldquo;as far as is reasonably practicable&rdquo;. I would welcome some clarification from the Minister as to whether the codes of practice which the Authority will have power to adopt are intended to make that more specific or how is that particular formulation to become a more precise duty, particularly on employers in this instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be best if I read the full note because we have debated this.  The section imposes general duties of care on all employers with regard to <Col N="809" /> their employees to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, their safety, health and welfare at work.  The setting down of general duties in the Bill is a departure from the traditional approach in existing safety legislation, such as the Safety in Industries Act, where the requirements and prohibitions were set out in more specific terms.  This resulted, for example, in a comprehensive range of provisions relating to matters such as the guaranteeing of dangerous parts of machinery but relatively few provisions in relation to other hazards, such as the removal of specific hazards, fumes or dust.  The Barrington Commission highlighted the lack of any expression of general principles or body of common provisions applicable to all workers in the existing Acts or regulations and were strongly of the view that it was necessary to set down a foundation of fundamental principles or a common framework for all situations.</P>
      <P>This objective is enshrined in section 6 and indeed in the other provisions of Part II of the Bill relating to general duties. The duties set down in the sections qualify for the phrase &ldquo;in so far as is reasonably practicable&rdquo;&mdash; a term which is also used elsewhere in the Bill, as Senator Robinson has said.  This term has already been in use in domestic safety and health legislation.  The reason for this approach is that in many instances the employer or the person charged with observing the provisions has to make judgment between the size of the risk and the measures necessary to counteract or eliminate it as well as the benefits likely to accrue to those measures.  While there is no precise definition, Redgrave's <i>Health and Safety in Factories (Second Edition) 1982</i> gives the following commentary from a judgment handed down in the British court:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Reasonably practicable&rdquo; is a narrower term than &ldquo;physically possible&rdquo; and implies that computation must be made in which the <i>quantum</i> of risk is placed in one scale of the sacrifice, whether in money, time or trouble, involved in the measures necessary to <Col N="810" /> avert the risk, which is placed in the other, and that if it be shown that there is a gross disproportion between them, the risk being insignificant in relation to the sacrifice, the person on whom the duty is laid discharges the burden of proving that compliance was not reasonably practicable.</P>
    <P>This computation falls to be made at a point of time, the happening of the accident complained of.  The qualification &ldquo;so far as is reasonably practicable&rdquo; does not dilute responsibility for safety and health. What it does is to allow the particular circumstances of each situation to be taken into account in the context quoted from Redgrave's book.  As the Senator says, the term is used throughout the Bill as a reasonable term, but that is the balance it seeks to give in the legislation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Whenever two or more employers undertake activities simultaneously at the one place of work, the person or company who has overall control of the place of work shall be responsible for co-ordinating safety and health measures.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>What we are trying to deal with in this amendment is that it would be possible to nail somebody down hard and fast.  In other words, you would distinguish who was in control.  For example, in section 8 (2) we talk about the duty of each person whereas here we are saying whenever two or more employers undertake activities simultaneously at the one place of work, the person or company who has overall control of the place of work shall be responsible for co-ordinating safety and health measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody has to have overall control. <Col N="811" /> We do not think this is spelt out hard and fast enough.  We would like to see something being inserted, not necessarily the exact wording we have suggested but something that would nail it down to ensure that one person would be responsible for the co-ordinating of safety and health measures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We are seeking the same objective as Senator Harte, to try to avoid loopholes and to get some order into an area that for some years has been very difficult to operate.  In work activities which involve multiple employers and workforces such as a large construction site which is normally the example taken as it can present particular difficulties as regards security, safety, health and welfare because of the additional difficulties posed by the type of activities that go on in such sites, it is important that there should be proper consultation and co-ordination of work activities by different employers.  I agree with what the Senator says.  Where, for example, one employer is carrying out work activity under permit to work system, all other employers and their workers at that location whose activities may impinge upon the permit of work system should also be fully conversant with those requirements and should not be allowed to carry out their functions in such a way as would by-pass the permit system and put workers at risk.</P>

    <P>Section 6 of the Bill already sets down general duties for all employers in relation to their employees.  Section 7 imposes general duties on all self-employed persons and employers in relation to themselves and persons other than their employees.  This is the fundamental change in this legislation.  I am sure everybody in the Seanad would have examples of an inspector going onto a building site and trying to establish who is responsible and who a person is working for.  With the system of sub-contractors and people working for subcontractors, it can be very difficult. Section 7 imposes general duties on all self-employed persons and employers in <Col N="812" /> relation to themselves and persons other than their employees so they cannot get away by trying to pass the buck from one to another.  Clearly where there is more than one employer carrying out a work activity at a particular workplace each employer will, at the same time, have a general duty of care under the Bill both to their own employees and the other employees.  There is a designated responsible person.  This has not been in the legislation up to this.</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the Bill relating to safety policy statements further illustrates the duties of employers and self-employed persons other than to their own employees.  Employers or self-employed persons are required to bring to the attention of their employees and other persons at the place of work who may be affected by the safety statement in practical terms by their work activities, the terms of the safety statement.  The extent of the obligation on employers and the self-employed is also reflected in the penalties provided for in the Bill which are the same for breach of duty in relation to employees or non-employees affected by the work activity.  The obligation of each employer will only extend to matters within his control and that can be determined fully having regard to the particular circumstances of each case.  Each case will be investigated by the inspector but he can then implement the legislation because he can identify who is responsible.</P>
    <P>The problems caused by different employers working together at the same time at a place of work is more common to some types of work than others.  Construction sites have been a particular problem.  There is a need to ensure that work activities carried out simultaneously by different employers at the same location need to be co-ordinated properly.  Some employers would meet their obligations under section 7 of the Bill as it stands but I am not convinced it would be equitable to impose the primary responsibility on any one employer where several share the workplace.  The courts have quite a degree of experience in deciding which employer has been <Col N="813" /> responsible for occupational safety and health in particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Senator's aim is for a preventive approach in co-ordinating safety and health activities but I think we already have that basis in the Bill.  The fundamental point is that one can now identify who or what responsibilities an employer has, even when there is a number of employers on the site.  I accept that there will be a need for the Authority to develop appropriate advice and guidance in these matters including, if necessary, appropriate regulations or codes of practice.  However, on the basis that section 6 and 7 of the Bill already meet the Senator's objective I would ask him not to pursue this amendment because I think we have covered the point he has made.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the views of the Minister.  I know how difficult it is to tackle a situation like this.  I would also see difficulties for a building construction firm or a big engineering firm doing a job in, say, a brewery or a distillery.  I would find it amazing, apart from this section, if somebody could bring them to court and nail somebody down.  Somebody would have to be responsible.  That is where I would see confusion arising.  I would say it would be very difficult for the direct employer, if he decided to issue a handbook on this new measure to write into an employee's handbook that if there are any problems, if a person is not carrying out the general duties laid down, they can take on the builder and the distiller. However, I appreciate the reply given and also the comprehensiveness of the legislation.  I withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>Senator Harte knows how employers will go to great lengths to deny that a particular individual is their employee.  In the case of machinery on a site, it is very difficult to find out who owns a machine, who hired it, who is responsible, who is working with it.  If the inspector investigating the incident is unclear as to who carries the can and who is responsible, under this legislation he can take the whole lot of them to court. <Col N="814" /> The difficulty on a building site is that it is often hard to find out who the subcontractor is working for.  If you ask on the building site if he is working for the main contractor he keeps moving around. The inspector now can at least proceed, confident that if people are not coming clean with him he has the power to pull in all the relevant people and let them sort it out in court.  That gives him a power which he has not had.  Up to now he could be tossed from Billy to Jack and not know who was responsible.  An inspector will in future, with this Bill, have confidence that if he sticks at it at least he can get his prosecution and he cannot be codded, as has happened in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 8, and the question also relates to section 6 and 7, on the general duties of employers and persons, is it envisaged that the general duties as so framed will lead to increases in insurance cover by employers and self-employed persons and persons in the context of section 8?  I note that the Bill provides that it will not affect, in itself, the potential civil liability of employers but has the fact that there are these specific general duties set out, as far as the Minister is aware, given rise to an issue of potential increase in insurance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think so because they are general duties that should be common law at present.  Overall, the view is that the legislation should lead to a reduction in insurance at the end of the day; I refer to the massive claims and the difficulties that arise in safety and health generally because of people not following the rules and regulations on protective clothing and so on &mdash; the legislation should help, with a lot of work by the Authority.  It will not just happen.  One of the important things will be the PR of both the social partners. Even since we had the last debate here in the Seanad &mdash; I think Senator Manning <Col N="815" /> raised the matter of explaining this to the workforce &mdash; the FUE, I understand, have been in various regions explaining this legislation: it should certainly not cause an increase in insurance.  We would be hopeful that in due course it will reduce insurance, particularly liabilities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 9, it is really the same point only this time it is a duty on the employees.  Has there been any concern as to whether the spelling out in a fairly specific way of the general duties of employees might affect the liability of the employer by perhaps affecting the extent to which there might be concurrent liability on the employee, that the employee might, in fact, find that because of the specifying of a general duty there was a contributory negligence on the employee's part?</P>
      <P>I am reading this with the provisions of section 60 in relation to civil liability, but it does not expressly refer to this question.  It provides that nothing in the Bill should be construed as conferring a right of action in any civil proceedings in respect of any failures to comply with any duty imposed under these sections that we are dealing with or (b), as affecting the extent, if any, to which breach of a duty imposed by any of the existing enactments is actionable, but it does not specifically deal with the question of whether it might affect the contributory negligence of the employee.  Once you start specifying general duties on employees it may be that that would have an effect and it might be that that is a matter that could be dealt with in section 60.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fair question but these are general provisions which are in the 1980 Act.  They have not created a problem.  The same provisions were in <Col N="816" /> the Safety in Industry Act in 1980 and that has not caused a problem.  The important point to add to that &mdash; it was raised on Second Stage by a number of Senators and it was raised in the other House &mdash; is that it is very wrong that employers should be seen to be the only people who have responsibilities. Employees have duties and responsibilities. It is important that we clearly understand that they have duties and responsibilities and that the Safety in Industry Act or this Safety, Health and Welfare Bill is not a litany of rules for employers.  From an insurance point of view it has not created difficulties and we do not believe it will.</P>

I do not know whether it is relevant to this section or not, but I am thinking in terms of the general duties of designers, manufacturers, etc. with regard to articles and substances for use at work.  It is a borderline question, if you like, but the Minister can decide if he wants to answer it under this section, or he might be able to address it under some other section.  What I am concerned about is in regard to the health boards. Will the legislation, for example, include things they will use or the installations they might have on health board premises? For example, would any environmental officers or health officers or medical officers or health inspectors have any input at all into the whole question of protection with regard to designs and substances and so on?  I do not know which is the relevant section but I have not found anything in the Bill that would give me some information on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little bit puzzled on how this section will operate in practice. Obviously, when a place of work is being constructed and designed in the present day especially architects, builders and so on are going to strive very hard to ensure that it is a safe place to work. The only place perhaps I can see conflict coming is where corners are being cut in the interests of greater efficiency or greater profit.  Perhaps the best example of that is in the case of some of the more recent sea-going ferries, which are places of work for large numbers of people and where the evidence to date &mdash; I do not want to prejudge the tribunals &mdash; would suggest that in recent years the interests of commercial maximisation and of profit and so forth have resulted perhaps in design and construction which put safety second or third down the line.  There may be other areas also &mdash; I cannot think of any at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic question I am asking the Minister &mdash; this section is largely in the <Col N="818" /> form of exhortation; it is saying something everybody would agree with &mdash; will there be guidelines &mdash; and this could be a very complicated job &mdash; to architects, to builders and to those who construct outlining in specific areas what constitutes what is desired by this section? Will there be sanctions against people? Who will judge whether they have transgressed?  If they have, will there be sanctions against them or is this what it appears to be which really strikes me as being an exhortation to architects, to builders and others that safety should be uppermost in their thinking when they are designing a place of work?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This section places a general duty on persons who design and construct places of work to ensure that they are, so far as is reasonably practicable, safe and without risk to health. If necessary, guidelines will be issued but it is an offence.  There are fines that will be imposed if people are found to be negligent or not to have complied with the section.  It still is an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>How would an offence be established under this section?  Would it be through the normal courts, through a tribunal or by what mechanism?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, it reflects Barrington.  I have been advised that safety should be designed in to a particular construction but if, say, ventilation in the building was not up to standard in the planning system or if it was found not to be satisfactory or I assume if there was something that proved afterwards not to be in line with normal safety standards which are mentioned throughout this Bill, there would be prosecutions.  I do not want to go into examples but I presume it would also apply to health hazards, to sanitary areas and other areas that should normally be covered in planning specifications.  I do not know if it would extend to areas like building by-laws or to matters that are not safe in that regard but the fact that it is a general duty on persons who design and construct buildings to ensure that <Col N="819" /> they are safe as far as is reasonably practicable, leaves it loose and flexible enough.  If something afterwards was found not to be safe, under the section they would not have complied with the Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation as described in this section is the ideal that should operate in any well run concern. Every employer has a total vested interest in seeing that safety is maximised. He wants to see that the health of those who work there are protected.  Clearly in economic terms and in terms of productivity, all of that is very much in his interest.  What is described here is something which probably should not even need the force of law to back it up, it should operate almost from the start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a number of queries about the <Col N="820" /> way in which this might operate in practice. I am sure the points I am raising will only occur in a minority of cases but in section 3 it says that the employees may from time to time select and appoint from among their number at a place of work a representative to represent them in consultation and so forth.  Is an employer obliged to accept the person who is so selected?  The situation I have in mind here is where, say, there is somebody who is the safety person, who has been trained, who has the confidence of the employer and a situation of bad industrial relations may arise where the appointing of somebody else by the workforce or by part of the workforce may be a part of the industrial relations battle.  The only question I am asking here is in a situation like that under this law is the employer obliged to accept the person who is chosen from among the workforce as the safety officer?  What happens, say, where there are two or three competing unions? Is a simple majority of all workers of all categories and all grades balloted who will decide who is the safety person?</P>
    <P>Under the same section, is there anything in this to protect an employer against a situation where vexatious, frivolous and excessive demands are being made upon him?  Again, I am talking about a situation which would not be the norm, where there is bad industrial relations and where this could become a weapon against the employer.  Is there anything which will indicate what is reasonable in terms of the amount of consultation?  I would say commonsense should dictate what would happen but under the law is there anything?  Subsection (8) (b) says:</P>
    <P>An employer shall afford a safety representative such time off from his duties as may be reasonable.</P>
    <P>Who is to judge what is reasonable in this?  Are we left with commonsense or is there some sort of guideline that an employer might have there as to what might be reasonable because we have seen in some situations where the right to mandatory meetings, consultation during working hours, was abused.  It was abused <Col N="821" /> in a number of areas and with consequences which were often fairly horrific.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>First, on the point about the nominee from the workforce, that nominee would have to be accepted by the employer.  Under the Act it is their right to nominate somebody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>And a majority of all the workforce voting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be but under subsection (3) there could be a number of unions and a number of staff organisations and perhaps even some nonunion people.  Normally what happens in these cases is that the unions concerned who are affiliated to the Congress of Trade Unions come to an agreement themselves.  They have their own rules governing where the representative should come from, perhaps the largest union, or they will allow people to propose names and then they will agree at their works council level.  However, if it is not agreed or if there is difficulty, regulations could be set, or a code of practice if necessary, to provide practical advice and guidance in selecting the number and functions of safety representatives required at the workplace. The Authority probably will draw up guidelines on it anyway which would be far better than having the difficulties which you have stated will inevitably arise in at least some enterprises and, as you say, hopefully very few.  What was the question the Senator asked on the responsibilities of the safety representative?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Who will judge as to what is a reasonable time off to do training courses and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I think that should be built into the type of regulations of code of practice.  If there was a difficulty perhaps the Authority should lay down some of these guidelines and regulations.  I would agree with what the Senator is saying, that it is unlikely to happen in this case because he is really <Col N="822" /> talking about time off for seminars or training, which is an identifiable time.  It would be far better if the Authority were to set down at an early date what they consider to be reasonable standards, that they would get that right from the start so that people will not attempt &mdash; very few people do in industry &mdash; to overplay the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree to his Authority having a sort of vigilant role at an early stage in trying to solve problems like this which may arise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would rather put it that they should in codes of practice or in regulations set down what they consider to be reasonable standards under these sections of the Bill.  I have some answers and data.  Rather than that being a back-up to the Bill it would be far better put into it.  Since this Bill the Authority had such co-operation between both sides of the social partners that should be followed through to the Authority.  When the Authority will be made up primarily of both sides of the social partners it would be best in these contentious areas, or potentially contentious areas, to specify and stipulate what their understanding is because I do not envisage the workers closely following each of these sections.  It would be far better to have guidelines and set out what would be considered to be reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation in course, I think Senator Manning will agree, would be inappropriate to capture the precise regulations, as it were, governing the question of the selection and the time off.  In relation to the selection of safety representatives, the democratic nature of the intention of the Bill and actual custom in practice, which is of critical importance in the industrial relations field, would of course suggest that the selection should be done by the employees themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Picking up the point that the Minister made, rather than the Authority reacting to problems as they arise, I would like to <Col N="823" /> think that the Authority, being a joint body, would use its expertise to initiate in a number of areas, including procedures for both selection and reconciling, if you like, multi-union representation and who should represent the employees involved.  With regard to time off, that can be abused.  That is true and it is a valid point.  Again, the Authority should prescribe and anticipate, if you like, appropriate procedures for the implementation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the codes of practice, let us take the report of the Commission on Industrial Relations long since published. It became clear from that that one of the few areas where both sides can easily agree is the area of codes of practice. Anything in this safety area, as in many other areas, that will lead to more formality and, with the initiative of the Authority, facilitating the establishment of codes of practice, can only be a step in the right direction.  Through a consultative process, they will develop a type of ownership for what has been agreed and that under our voluntary system of industrial relations certainly offers the best prospect for good practice in the future.</P>

    <P>Sections 14 to 35, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 36.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 30, lines 31 to 34, to delete subsection (6) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) An improvement notice shall take effect&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  if the notice so declares, immediately the notice is received by the person on whom it is served,</P>
      <P>(b) in any other case&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  if no appeal is taken against the notice, on the expiration of the <Col N="824" /> period during which such an appeal may be taken or the day specified in the notice as that on which it is to come into effect, whichever is the later; or</P>
    <P>(ii)  in case such an appeal is taken, on the day next following the day on which the notice is confirmed on appeal or the appeal is withdrawn or the day specified in the notice as that on which it is to come into effect, whichever is the later.</P>
    <P>(7) The bringing of an appeal against a prohibition notice which is to take effect in accordance with subsection (6) shall not have the effect of suspending the operation of the notice: provided, however, that the appellant may apply to the Court to have the operation of the notice suspended until the appeal is disposed of and on such application, the Court may, if it thinks proper to do so, direct that the operation of the notice be suspended until the appeal is disposed of.</P>
    <P>This section is very important, as are all the sections.  Our only concern with it is not that the Minister has not gone far enough but whether the actual wording, particularly the wording contained between line 31 to line 34 subsection (6) will do the job that the overall intention of the section is aimed at.  To be quite frank about it, there is no intention to press this amendment but rather to extract information from the Minister, rather than have an argument or debate about it.  I would like to know whether the Minister could give us some indication as to whether the language used in the section satisfies the overall conditions he is trying to apply in this area of the legislation, which is very important indeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is as Senator Harte says, extremely important.  I will explain the section and if there is any question then arising it can be dealt with.  The first point in looking at this section and dealing with the amendment is, there is a fundamental difference between the purpose and circumstances for which <Col N="825" /> improvement notices and prohibition notices are intended.  They are entirely different and it will be a matter for the inspector, subject to the overall policy and guidance of the Authority, or an enforcement agency as the case may be, to decide in the particular circumstances of the case whether to issue an improvement notice under section 36 or a prohibition notice under section 37.  They are fundamentally different.</P>
      <P>An improvement notice is intended to be used in circumstances where an inspector believes that a contravention of any of the relevant statutory provisions on safety and health has occurred but where the deficiency may be remedied over a period of time without posing serious risk to the safety or health of persons.  An example is where an inspector finds himself doing routine visits to sites and factories and perhaps finding them untidy, perhaps finding instruments left lying around, safety notices not in the right position or covered by something where it is not creating an immediate danger to life and limb.  The inspector would be happy to issue a warning, that would be an improvement notice, not to be heavy-handed but to say that this is not satisfactory, to seek an improvement and to issue an improvement notice and probably say he would return again or keep a check on the matter.  A prohibition notice, on the other hand, tends to be used in circumstances where an inspector believes there is risk of serious personal injury to persons arising from the activity in question.  Where an inspector considers that such a risk is imminent he may bring the prohibition notice so that it will have effect immediately it is served.</P>
      <P>The bringing of an appeal against such a notice will not in itself lead to its suspension until the appeal is disposed of. Only the courts may grant the suspension of such a notice and then only following a specific application in that regard.  This procedure will ensure that the protection intended under a prohibition notice for workers who are in imminent danger will be preserved until the courts have considered an application, if any, for suspension of the notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="826" /> The point to make about the fundamental difference is that the gravity of the circumstances for which improvement notices and prohibition notices are intended is reflected in the period set down during which the appeal to the courts may be lodged, which is 14 days in the case of an improvement notice, under section 36 (3), and seven days in the case of a prohibition notice under section 37 (6).  There is a large difference, where one is just a warning to an employer, an owner or responsible person in an enterprise to undertake improvement of something that is not in line with the legislation but is not causing immediate danger as against the prohibition notice where the inspector perhaps may feel that he cannot leave the site without starting the process of a prohibition notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the Minister but on the question of appointments I wish to restate the point I made on section 10 but not in the same way.  On the question of appointing ordinary members of the Authority, it says the Minister shall appoint three persons nominated by such organisations representative of employees, three persons nominated by such organisations representative of employers and four persons representative of such Government Departments, State agencies and other bodies, whose activities are concerned with matters relating to any of the purposes of this Bill, as he considers appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I should have asked about the <Col N="827" /> input of health boards under this particular heading?  I wonder if the Minister can be drawn a bit on the part of the Schedule relating to his own Department? The Minister mentions State agencies.  Having regard to the role of environmental officers, health officers, etc., is it the intention to improve their effectiveness or does it mean that the State agencies will be at the discretion of the Minister?</P>

      <P>The Authority, as the Senator has stated, is representative of the social partners and both the Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers' will nominate people.  The other members and the chairman would be nominated by the Government.  The Senator is primarily concerned that the health boards be involved in some way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think to give a straight answer they would have an input but on the interim board the Departments involved were the Department of Health, <Col N="828" /> the Department of the Environment, the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Department of Labour, a range of Departments and agencies.  The advisory board and the Authority will be anxious to have agencies involved but the mechanism they will use for that will be a matter for the Authority.  They will be endeavouring to involve all of the State organisations, the employer bodies, which are directly involved through the Federated Union of Employers, and the workers through the Congress of Trade Unions.  After that the way they will involve others will be a matter for them. I have no doubt they will, because they will endeavour to include the entire workforce, both employer and employee, which will be covered under the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express my thanks to the Members of the House who contributed so constructively to the debate today and on Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am especially pleased with the consensus approach which both Houses of the Oireachtas have adopted in relation to this measure.  This, I am glad to acknowledge, has been a feature of the whole process of the development of the legislation, commencing with the work of the Barrington Commission of Inquiry on Safety, Health and Welfare at Work right through to the work of the interim board for occupational safety and health.  It is essential that this spirit of co-operation and dialogue should continue so that the <Col N="829" /> new legislative and structural safety and health system is effective in reducing the occurrence of accidents and diseases in the workplace.  Because of the operation of the commission, the interim board and bodies such as the representative national industrial safety organisation, I am confident that such co-operation will be readily forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The Bill is the most radical measure on occupational safety and health ever considered by the Oireachtas.  It will ensure that a legislative framework exists through which safety and health standards can be implemented at the workplace which will take into account such vital factors as technological change and requirements arising from the development of integrated social policies within the European Community.</P>
    <P>I have said before that the Bill has one clear objective &mdash; to help to reduce the toll of accidents and ill-health at work which gives rise both to human loss and suffering and to heavy financial costs.  I must emphasise that the legislation is not expected to provide a panacea for all our safety and health problems at the workplace.  What I expect it to do is to provide a sound basis where employers, workers and the self-employed can solve their problems in a spirit of co-operation with the support and guidance of the State.  The primary responsibility, however, will remain with those who create the risks at the workplace.  In addition, where advice and guidance fails to have the desired impact the possibility must exist for appropriate enforcement controls and sanctions.  I believe the Bill allows for that type of balanced approach to the problem.</P>
    <P>In contrast with existing safety legislation, the Bill does not set out a detailed series of specific requirements and prohibitions as regards safety and health to be observed at each place of work. Instead, it sets out broad general duties of care for all employers, employees and the self-employed.  Broadly speaking, those general duties of care involve the provision of a safe place of work, safe plant and equipment and a safe system of work.  Other requirements include <Col N="830" /> adequate training and information for those at risk about the relevant hazards and the steps taken to deal with them. The Bill also places broad general duties of care on those who design, manufacture, import, supply and install articles and substances for use at work.</P>
    <P>In this debate I think we have covered all the general duties in the Bill.  I want to assure the House again, because during the debate a number of Senators asked about this that they may be supplemented or amplified, as necessary, by regulations and codes of practice developed under the Bill covering an extensive and diverse range of issues.  It is anticipated that there will be frequent recourse to the use of codes of practice under the new system.  It is likely that such codes can be better attuned to the needs of those at the place of work than detailed sets of statutory regulations. Regulations, by their nature, may not be easily understood by those who are affected by them.  It should be possible to indicate in clear terms in codes of practice possible ways of compliance with the relevant statutory provisions.</P>
    <P>I am very aware that the new national Authority will require adequate resources if it is to be successful in carrying out its functions.  Expenditure on safety and health matters, whether at national or workplace level, is an investment which is essential, not only to prevent human loss and suffering, but will also be repaid in monetary terms by reduced insurance premium which we discussed earlier with Senator Robinson's question &mdash; fewer legal actions, less disruption at work and fewer occupational injury benefit claims.  In seeking resources for the national Authority I will emphasise strongly the positive and essential role it has to play in the economic life of the country.</P>
    <P>The successful implementation of the new safety system will also give rise to the need for a substantial and sustained exercise of training, information and education. I share the Barrington Commission's view that the legislation on its own would be ineffective without such an exercise.  In this regard several initiatives <Col N="831" /> have been taken, even in advance of this legislation, in the voluntary, private and public sectors, particularly in the crucial areas of information, education and training.  I know that in the course of the debate a number of Senators asked that that be done, and it has commenced. Employer organisations, trade unions and private enterprise provide the necessary training.  Under the aegis of my Department, a multi-disciplinary course in occupational safety and health was instituted at third level education.  NISO, the National Industrial Safety Organisation, a voluntary body in safety and health, broadened its horizons and its range of activities.</P>
    <P>Initiatives such as these are welcome. Not alone will they contribute towards overall public awareness and expertise but they will also help to relieve the direct burden on the State and on employers as regards achieving the objectives of the new system.</P>
    <P>The passage of this Bill by the Oireachtas will mark an historic development and it also represents the beginning of a new challenge.  It will require concerted effort by all concerned in development and implementation of appropriate safety and health standards within the framework which the legislation provides. I am convinced with the proper commitment we can meet those challenges. This legislation will make a major contribution to economic and social development of the country.  I would like to thank the Cathaoirleach and the Senators for their help and co-operation during the course of this debate.</P>

      <P>Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Order, 1989</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Seanad Éireann on the 14th March, 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 23 of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, as amended by section 21 of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1988, empowers the Minister for Labour, after consultation with the Minister for Finance and other appropriate Ministers, to prescribe by order the number of directors or board members of State bodies covered by the acts including the number of employees to be appointed after election by the workforce.  The acts require, broadly speaking, that elected representatives should make up one-third of the membership of each board.</P>
      <P>The present order sets the board size and the number of worker directors of Aer Rianta.  The effect of the order is that from the date on which it is made the size of the board of Aer Rianta will be set at nine, with three directors to be elected by the workforce.  The board size has been set after consultation with the Minister for Tourism and Transport who, in turn, consulted representatives of the unions in Aer Rianta.  The Minister for Finance has also given his approval to the proposed arrangements.</P>
      <P>I will also be making a related statutory order the effect of which will require Aer Rianta to hold worker director elections under the worker participation legislation in 1989.  These elections will be held later this year.  This will bring to 11 the number of State-sponsored bodies which have worker directors appointed under the Worker Participation Acts, and completes the list of bodies specified for board level participation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="833" /> In addition to the provision of board level arrangements, the 1988 Worker Participation Act provides for the introduction of sub-board participative arrangements in a range of State enterprises. I regard this as a very significant development and I am glad to say that Aer Rianta and a number of other bodies have already made significant progress in this area.</P>
    <P>I recommend that the House approve the draft order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On this side of the House we have no difficulty in supporting this measure.  In fact we welcome the extension to Aer Rianta of the principle of worker directors.  The operation of worker directors in our State companies has now ceased to be an experiment.  It has been in place since the mid-seventies and, as the Minister said, this is the 11th such State company to make this move. At this stage it would be of interest if perhaps the Minister's own Department or, indeed, Senator Hillery in his other capacity as Professor of Industrial Relations might embark upon a study on the effectiveness and the impact of this experiment to date, to see to where it has worked, what the difficulties and dangers have been and perhaps to chart areas in which the experiment could be extended into the private sector.  Having said that, I welcome this development and wish it every success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, warmly welcome the order before us which fixes the number of directors for Aer Rianta at nine, of which three will be worker directors after the elections.  Picking up a point the Minister made about the initiative and the ground work already laid by Aer Rianta in this connection, I think it is indeed a company which has been preparing for worker participation for many years past.  It has been the company philosophy to secure greater co-operation between employees and management. The staff are encouraged to participate in the workplace and the open style of management, which includes disclosure of information, has characterised the <Col N="834" /> conduct of business affairs there for many years.  This is in sharp contrast with the practice so common in the past in this country and elsewhere, where orders were issued by management without question and indeed employees proceeded in the workplace without even understanding what were the policies.</P>
      <P>Unions and management in the company have shown exceptional initiative in identifying what participation is all about and how to go about building the foundations for change in the company.  This has been greatly facilitated by the establishment of a joint working party on participation, composed of representatives of both management and trade unions and facilitated by an officer of the Irish Productivity Centre.  This group is developing and promoting forms of worker participation suited to Aer Rianta.</P>
      <P>Speaking of suitability to Aer Rianta, I think this is in accord with the Act we passed here last year, the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1988 providing for sub-board structures. The Minister in that Bill said the intention was to leave it to individual companies to tailor participative arrangements suited to their own philosophy and their own practices.  Aer Lingus matches this legislative intention exactly in what they have been doing.</P>
      <P>The ability to introduce change in the late eighties is, of course, a requirement for many companies and the open approach of management, combined with the co-operation of unionised employees in Aer Rianta, have helped to advance changes in areas like reorganising Departments, with introducing new work practices and procedures and improving training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I had the pleasure in my capacity as Professor of Industrial Relations at UCD of addressing the Aer Rianta staff at Shannon some 18 months ago at a seminar on worker participation. The seminar was part of the ongoing study and development of participative structures within the company.  I feel that the company philosophy and the commitment and response of the workers have contributed greatly to its success <Col N="835" /> and indeed to its most recent important business initiative in the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta featured prominently in the recent visit of President Gorbachev and their management of the duty-free airport at Moscow is an example of the type of expertise we have which can be very usefully applied abroad.  Furthermore, it seems that the expertise and experience which they have got which is now being utilised in Moscow can and probably will be extended to other parts of the Soviet bloc.  Aer Rianta have led the way for further business and trading links between Ireland and the Soviet Union and full credit is due to the management and staff of that organisation. They are committed, involved, business-orientated people and the election of worker directors should supplement, and will supplement, the very important initiatives in the participative area on which they have been engaged for some years past.</P>

      <P>Before I call Senator Harte, this is one of the times when, as Cathaoirleach, I am at a disadvantage. I would like to put on record, whether I break rules or not, the extraordinary commitment of workers and management of Aer Rianta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the order.  In the final analysis we have been arguing about what type of participation might suit each particular plant or what might suit a State enterprise which might not suit a private enterprise etc.  Professor Hillery made the point that enterprises should tailor participation to their own needs.  I think this is what has been happening.  They have been looking at it and trying to tailor the system to their own particular needs.  Because of the dialogue the great thing we find is that the unnecessary conflict that existed is being gradually eliminated by this whole concept.  The Minister is playing no small part in it but the fact of the matter is that once you are heading in that direction this unnecessary conflict begins to diminish.  Workers came to <Col N="836" /> realise that they are not only getting wages out of the company: they are getting the things they have been denied for a long time, information and some sort of control and input in an area of their own lives that had been affected by decisions in which they had no say and about which they had no information or understanding.  The fact is that we are behind our European partners in this area but we are fast catching up.</P>
      <P>I would like to finish on this note but not in an antagonistic way.  The private side of enterprise should decide to try to make progress.  There is a little hesitancy there on the private side.  There is still a lot of a &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; attitude in the private side of enterprise which can be eliminated by eradicating such problems. For example, somebody feels that his business is being bought out by some smart person who has a few million pounds and suddenly he decides on redundancies.  That person has nothing to aim for beyond the worry of whether he is going to be out on the street and he has no information to disseminate down to his fellow workers, if he is a representative. There is a lot of ground to be made up on the private side.  At the rate change is occurring if something is not done very quickly it may be too late, not too late in the sense that we will not have industries but too late in that the development of democracy itself as a concept will have been denied in the private enterprise area.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Senators for their promptness in dealing with the order.  In answer to Senator Harte's question, I agree that one cannot ever extend worker participation too much.  It is something that is ongoing.  It is important in passing this order that we put on the record for those who sometimes argue for worker directors and seek to bypass the process of the 1988 Act of the sub-board structures that in the case of NRB and again in Aer Rianta we are showing by the unanimous views of all parties in the Seanad that if State organisations are prepared to operate the system at sub-board <Col N="837" /> level then the Government are prepared to consider and bring to the Houses of the Oireachtas the concept of worker-directors at full board level.  I do not think there is wisdom in bringing worker-directors straight from an area where there is no concept of worker participation on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Senator is talking about the private sector.  I do not disagree at all but the point I am making is not in contradiction of the Senator.  We have now, following the passing of the Worker Participation Act, some 38 or 40 enterprises where there is worker participation at sub-board level.  A great many of those have started the process of making it work but there are others who have not started that process.  Many of them would say, &ldquo;Why bother at sub-board level?  Let us come in with the big boys and be worker directors and run the show.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great need for people to do as Aer Rianta did and that is to work the system for a great number of years through their democracy council.  It is equally fair to put on record a tribute to the great role played by Aer Rianta and the good work they have done.  The democracy council would be a strong union group and they have been part of the great success and achievements of Aer Rianta in recent years.  There are other examples of it also and there are clear signs in favour of worker participation of worker directors.  Participation between both sides can convince the Government that they should have worker directors, can convince both Houses of the Oireachtas, and the Departments of Finance, Labour and Transport that there is clear support from everybody in the system for the principle of worker participation.  However, people have to work at it.  By definition it is participation and one cannot go from A to Z without going through all the steps.  Aer Rianta have done that and are <Col N="838" /> to be commended for their work.  It is for that reason that people have passed this order which allows the elections to take place in the months ahead.</P>

      <P>I see no difficulty in supporting the motion before us and to enunciate Government policy with regard to nonalignment in military alliances and with regard to our commitment to neutrality. Senator Manning asked in his contribution to the debate why this motion had been put down.  I think it is timely that it was put down.  We have come to accept neutrality as part of our tradition. We have come to accept that we are not aligned to any military alliance but, as against that, over the past number of years there have been calls by people in authority, by people who are perhaps genuinely motivated, that we should consider abandoning neutrality, that we should consider joining some alliances, particularly organisations such as NATO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With 1992 approaching us and since the <Col N="839" /> Single European Act has been passed, it was questioned whether we should give a further commitment to Europe by joining in a defence of what was called Europe &mdash; and I notice the words &ldquo;so-called European commitment&rdquo; in the motion.  Many of the people who speak in this way have, I am sure, a certain amount of idealism, and perhaps there is a certain degree of morality involved. Some of them went so far as to say that there would be a financial benefit to us if we joined in some European alliance such as NATO.  We should give them credit for putting their cards on the table.  It gives us an opportunity to restate our commitment to neutrality and our commitment not to become involved in any military alliances, be they alliances of part of Europe, of the totality of Europe, or more international alliances.</P>
    <P>The official policy is there.  Ministers and the Government have enunciated that policy and the people have consistently supported it.  It has never been questioned in Government.  It is important to note that the Government have given no commitment to the abandonment of that policy, nor have they been asked, so far as we know, in any European conference or any European setting to abandon what has become our traditional policy of neutrality and of non-alignment.</P>
    <P>There is general acceptance perhaps among the older generation that our policy of neutrality began with the Second World War.  This is emphasised by the way we remained neutral during the Second World War but I think it goes back further than that.  You could argue that our policy of neutrality goes back to the First World War, with the great anti-conscription campaign and the pro-neutrality campaign.  It has been stated by some people that this was an anti-British campaign.  I do not accept that at all.  It was anti-British in so far as many of the people involved in the campaign were people of the 1916 Republican tradition but the anti-conscription campaign was as enthusiastically fought in Belfast and in what is now the six northern counties <Col N="840" /> of Ireland as it was in the most southerly counties of Ireland.  It embraced a united Ireland against conscription, a united Ireland in favour of neutrality.</P>
    <P>Even during the Second World War conscription was not brought into the Six Counties by the British Government, which is very interesting and perhaps augurs well if we could develop an all-Ireland neutrality and an all-Ireland non-commitment to military alliances as such. We were in a different position during the Second World War in that we had our own Government and they took a conscious decision not to become involved.  That decision was backed up by 99 per cent of the population of the country at that time and by a very large proportion of the population since then. There were some mavericks at that time, as there are some mavericks today.  The most notable mavericks of that period would have been James Dillon, who was in favour of joining the Allies against Nazi Germany.</P>
    <P>The policy of neutrality during that period was an excellent policy for the Government and an excellent policy for the people.  It had some very beneficial results for the whole people of Ireland. It made us self-reliant, independent and self-sufficient.  The factories and the industries had been created during the thirties.  We had to rely on them to provide us with work and with food.  We had to rely on our shipping to provide the raw materials for our industries.  Organisations such as Bord na Móna were built up in order to provide fuel and energy and that made us more self-reliant, more respected and more self-respecting.</P>
    <P>Some people during this debate have said that it made us more introverted but I take the opposite view.  I think we became much more independent.  We were able to stand up as equal partners in Europe afterwards because we had come through a holocaust that involved the whole of Europe.  We had been saved from the massacres in Europe, but we had to give a great commitment to our country, to what we had in our country and we had to make ourselves self-sufficient and independent.  But I think it <Col N="841" /> put a bit of bone and marrow into us at the time.  During that time, it should be remembered, our Army was built up to hundreds of thousands and there were such other organisations as the LDF, the ARP and various other auxiliary forces at that time.  Thus there was a great commitment not only to our policy of neutrality but also to the State.  It was a very young State, having come through the War of Independence and the Economic War of the thirties, to be landed into a world conflict in which we were able to stand independently.</P>
    <P>The main logical reason put forward at that time for our stance was the question of Partition.  The will of the people was to remain neutral and not to take sides. One of the logical reasons proposed at that time was the Partition of our country, imposed on us despite the will of the people in 1918 and still lingering to this day with all of its sad effects.  It is important to emphasise that our neutrality and the question of Partition at the time was not a question of being anti-British. Indeed, I suppose our neutrality could be looked upon during the Second World War as a benevolent neutrality towards Britain and a benevolent neutrality towards the Allies fighting Nazi Germany at that time.</P>
    <P>As well as that, it was a principled stand.  When America became involved in the war and when it tried to involve us in that war &mdash; and America was always looked upon as our friend &mdash; the Government of the day took a very principled stand.  They had taken their stand on neutrality, they were going to see that stand through and they kept their word, despite the machinations of such people as the then American Ambassador to Ireland, Mr. Gray, and despite the threats at times and the blandishments at other times of people such as Churchill. Just as the people had rallied together, just as they had built the backbone of the nation and just as they rallied to the armed forces at the time to protect our country so, too, the Government stood their ground.  Despite threats and blandishments, such as Churchill's famous offer, if it could be so termed, that he <Col N="842" /> would look again at the whole question of Partition provided Ireland joined the Allies against Germany, the success of de Valera in withstanding the threats and blandishments of that time was to be admired.  It gave this country that backbone which enabled us to withstand the difficulties we encountered in the fifties and sixties and the difficulties we are now encountering.</P>
    <P>Today since, thankfully, there is no war on in Europe and since nobody has asked us to give any commitment whatsoever to joining any military alliance and, as far as we know, we have not been asked to abandon our policy of neutrality, I think it is important that especially the younger generation would scrutinise and investigate our past neutrality and perhaps the reasons for our neutrality at present.  Most people would take it that neutrality is now a traditional aspect of our foreign policy, a tradition most people would say goes back to the Second World War but I would argue that it goes much further back even to the First World War.  Even in these circumstances that the tradition is there, a lot of people do not want to be involved.  They are seeing the havoc war has wrought on Europe.  We see the havoc that war has wrought on various countries throughout the world, because there is no period, no time, no day that a war is not going on somewhere.  I think the consensus here, as would be the consensus, I would say, in many European countries today, is not to become involved in any other conflict, even what is termed &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; conflict, not to talk about nuclear conflict.</P>
    <P>There is also the financial side, that we could not afford the type of armaments that are common in many countries today, even though the other argument is put forward by those who would ask us to question our neutrality and question whether we should not be aligned, that there could be beneficial results in the siting of bases in Ireland, for example, for American or other forces.  I do not think this would be profitable to the country even financially, not to talk of the total abandonment of a policy that has withstood the horrors of the Second <Col N="843" /> World War and has stood us good over the past 20, 30 or 50 years.</P>
    <P>The Border had a relevance in the Second World War.  I think it still has a relevancy today because it could be argued, and argued fairly strongly and logically, that as part of a combination of states &mdash; I said it could be argued &mdash; there should be a commitment by us to defend the perimeter of that combination particularly the perimeter of that combination which would be our own territory &mdash; for example, the island of Ireland.  But I think there could be no commitment from us, from the Government or from anybody in the country to defending a border which was imposed on us and which has been kept there for the past 70 years and which has caused so much trouble and so much suffering to all the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Our stance on neutrality and non-alignment has been appreciated and has given us a standing far in excess of what we really deserve as a very small insignificant country in world terms.  Our standing in former colonial areas, in areas such as the Arab world and so on has given us a position far beyond what we would have expected had we not been neutral or had we been aligned.  In this way it is great to see our Army accepted in tough spots all over the world in their role as peacemakers with the United Nations.  It is good to see them as observers in various areas and it is good to see our Garda Síochána now taking an active part in United Nations affairs such as in Namibia. It gives us a standing far beyond our size and beyond what would be considered our influence.</P>
    <P>I note as well, as I said previously, that the words &ldquo;so-called European commitment&rdquo; are included in the motion.  I presume that &ldquo;so-called&rdquo; refers to &ldquo;European&rdquo; rather than to &ldquo;commitment&rdquo;. We should realise that there are changes taking place at present particularly in the eastern bloc countries and, hopefully, these will lead to greater democracy in these countries and, therefore, the threat that seemed to be posed to the western European states from the eastern European states and from Russia <Col N="844" /> seems at least to be less now than it was ten, 20 or 30 years ago.  This is to be welcomed, and the degree of democracy that will be allowed to the various republics within the Soviet Union, such as Estonia, Latvia and the Ukraine, should also be welcomed.  The developments there are most interesting.  To a person with an Irish background, particularly with regard to language, the developments there are very interesting.</P>
    <P>I notice that Senator Murphy used an amended phrase from Parnell when he said that no politician should set bounds to the march of Europe.  If we looked at the Parnell Monument we would get the correct quotation.  Amazingly enough, in nearly the next sentence Senator Murphy started lecturing the West Germans not to be thinking of a united Germany.  That is rather strange, in the same way as it is rather strange that we at times are being lectured not to be thinking of a united Ireland.  However, I think it is very important that in the context of what we have as the present European Community that that is not sacrosanct, that there are new people looking for accession; and I think it would be very helpful to us if the accession of such states as Austria, and perhaps even Sweden, became a reality.  We would have then a good nucleus of neutral powers within the Community.  This should be looked upon in a positive way, not just a negative way, a positive way of building up a strengthened Europe, but a Europe that is committed to neutrality, that is committed not to military alignments but committed to peace.  If that were to take place with an expanded Europe, all the better.  Initially perhaps we could think of it in terms of having a neutral all-Ireland which I think would be acceptable to people of all persuasions North and South.  It would be a great beginning perhaps to peace within the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>First all I would like to thank Senator Murphy for putting down this motion.  Although neutrality and our non-involvement in a military alliance appear to be accepted by all parties in this House almost without question it is <Col N="845" /> important that it is reasserted from time to time, especially in the light of some of the statements which have been made by Members of the Opposition recently.  It is important that we debate it and that we re-examine what we mean by it.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I would like to say how much I enjoyed Senator Bromell's speech, except I think it is regrettable that he had to bring in the idea of an all-Ireland neutrality in this.  I find it a pity that Senator Bromell would refer under this motion to what he calls our own territory up there which he refers to as the island of Ireland.  If members of the Government or the Opposition are going to talk in those terms about Ireland they should also have the perspicacity to mention not just the territory of Ireland but the people who live on it.  It is very easy and glib to say &ldquo;Well, that is our territory and our territory should be included in neutrality&rdquo;, but what ought to be recognised is that there are a million people up there who perhaps do not wish to take part or participate in that neutrality and who perhaps want to be part of a military pact.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that we should be debating this motion at this time.  What is happening in the world was highlighted by the Taoiseach's meeting with Mr. Gorbachev recently.  If our non-involvement in a military alliance is to be highlighted in any concrete way, the Taoiseach did us a great service by pointing it out with the symbolism of that meeting.  If that proved anything it proved that our involvement in a military alliance is now not only not expedient but that it is simply no longer necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we talk about involvement in military alliances we do not mean joining the Warsaw Pact, we mean becoming members of NATO or we mean becoming members of some European defence unit.  The significance of what happened in the meeting between Mr. Gorbachev and Deputy Haughey is simply that Mr. Gorbachev and the Soviet Union are no longer our traditional enemies but they are now our friends, that Mr. Gorbachev threatens us in no visible obvious way militarily.  Therefore, it would be absurd for us to become part of a military pact <Col N="846" /> which points in an aggressive way towards the Soviet Union.  Those days, I think, are over.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the Russians or the Warsaw Pact or any military alliance throughout the world is a threat to Ireland.  Whereas we may in the past have felt a strong ideological commitment to the United States and its way of life, I do not think that recent events would push us in the direction of joining them in a military pact.  What we have seen I suspect is not the solidifying of old alliances, it is not that NATO or European defence will get stronger, but we are seeing the breaking up of alliances throughout the world, the breaking up of defence commitments. What I suspect we will see from the new era in Russia, who is after all the old enemy, the enemy against whom the military alliances were formed, will be new alliances in Europe and a less threatening neighbour on the eastern flank of Europe.  It is not inconceivable that so-called eastern and western Communist and non-Communist states will form alliances in the future and that the Berlin Wall itself may be dismantled.</P>
    <P>This, I think, is the sort of far-reaching consequence of what is happening in the world today, and we have played our part in bringing this about by that meeting.  I do not believe it is in any way relevant any longer for Members either of this House, of the other House, or indeed where I think it happens a lot, of the European Community, to start talking in terms of us becoming part of a military alliance.  The tide of ideology and the boundary movements in the world are certainly against this and if ever it was the right time to debate this and reassert this I think it is now.</P>
    <P>It would be inconceivable now that some sort of a pan-European war could break out.  Whereas the Cold War existed after the Second World War when the Iron Curtain was raised &mdash; that Cold War has been thawing so fast that the threat of any sort of a European war is no longer there and for Ireland to start thinking in terms of sacrificing its neutrality now <Col N="847" /> would be utterly wrong, utterly impracticable and would be moving completely against the trend in the world.</P>
    <P>We should be looking towards new ideological trade and political alliances, not military alliances.  I hope the European Community as such, which was set up principally as a defence mechanism after the Second World War, should now be regarding this no longer as a priority. The European Community has perhaps a great role to play in terms of trade, but in terms of a political and a defence union it is probably no longer significant or relevant because the threat which the European Community was set up to defend itself against no longer appears to exist.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I think we should look at where our foreign policy is leading us and whether it is leading us dangerously close to a lack of independence and a loss of neutrality in foreign policy.  The Minister has heard me say this before in this House on other issues and maybe this will be the first time I can say it without interruption or without several interruptions. However, I think I should say this: I think we are dangerously close, because of our common foreign policy with the European Community, to being considered almost <i>de facto</i> in a military alliance.  I say this because on issues which we have discussed in this House on foreign policy &mdash; Iran and Nicaragua I can think of immediately &mdash; possibly it would have been more convincing to those of us who trumpet our neutrality had we not taken a common line with the European Community on all these particular issues.  It is often a diluted line and it seems to indicate that Ireland is not a completely independent state in terms of foreign policy.  There are, obviously, good practical reasons &mdash; indeed, I think in the case of Iran the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Minister made it known quietly that this country was not fully behind what was stated by the European Community.  It might be beneficial to ourselves and it might give our voice more strength if we were from time to time &mdash; I think it has happened only once &mdash; to break from the European <Col N="848" /> Community on foreign policy and on issues like that.</P>
    <P>Senator Bromell touched on the history of our neutrality.  I think I shall be the first speaker here not to give the House the professional version of the history of neutrality.  There are very good reasons for that because I do not rate so highly as my predecessors in this debate on that particular issue.  However, I do feel that those who say that neutrality is not a sacred cow are wrong.  I think it is deeply embedded in many Irish people that if they do not support neutrality they are not somehow fully nationalist.</P>
    <P>There is a confusion between neutrality and not joining military pacts on the one hand and nationalism on the other.  It has been very much the case in the Fianna Fáil Party.  I remember going on television with a member of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party who waxed absolutely lyrical about neutrality and how it must not be touched.  When asked why not, he said it was part of our tradition since the Second World War and beforehand but he gave no good, concrete reasons why it is there.  It is folklore and, therefore, it ought to be thought through.</P>
    <P>We ought to produce the good reasons &mdash; and there are good reasons &mdash; why we should be neutral rather than the traditional belief which is confused with the neutrality of the Second World War which was to some extent and in some people's minds based on the anti-Britishness. There was undoubtedly a feeling abroad that we would not fight Britain's wars for her, a feeling which was based on 800 years of history.  It was an understandable feeling.  That feeling was there and it is still confused in the public mind with being a patriotic Irishman.  That, I hope, is going.  Indeed, it is healthy that members of the Fine Gael Party have attacked neutrality.  I happen not to agree with them, but it is healthy that they have done that.  It is healthy that many of them believe we should become members of a military alliance because it is challenging the preconceptions upon which we have been brought up.</P>
    <P>I will sum up by saying that if we were to join a military alliance, which God <Col N="849" /> forbid, we should be able to point out what the possible concrete advantages to Ireland would be and the only possible concrete advantages which have been suggested which are credible to me are that it would provide jobs in military bases.  This is not a good enough reason. Others say it would be a realistic reflection of what we believe in because we have a capitalist way of life and because we have an American versus a Communist way of life.  That would not justify us in moving into a military alliance.  I think what would happen would be that we would have no voice within that military defence pact, we would be protected without being able to offer a voice, whereas outside it we have a small but influential voice which we can maximise by maintaining our neutrality and our independent foreign policy.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should just like to say that it is important that we debate this and it is important that Fine Gael debate this because as Senator Murphy so rightly said at the beginning of his speech, Fine Gael, the Opposition party here, has spoken with many voices on this particular issue and it is an open secret that there is confusion in the Opposition on this particular issue.  What should be seen at the end of this debate is an unambiguous commitment from the Opposition party to non-involvement in military alliances.  What should be seen and should be exposed is whether that party speaks with one voice on this or with several.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate.  I think the recent visit of President Gorbachev to Shannon has highlighted for the Irish people developments which are taking place in the international sphere and it is important having just experienced that visit and all that it involves that we would discuss our neutrality in the light of these international events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened very carefully to Senator Murphy's contribution and to that of Senator Ross.  It does not sound right when I say this, but I would have to say <Col N="850" /> that I fully agree with what they have said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I always knew the Independent Senators were independent but I had a kind of sneaky suspicion that they were independent against Fianna Fáil and its policies and traditions. However, I am glad to say that on this issue I was wrong in that view and I agree with their sentiments.</P>
      <P>Senator Murphy in particular outlined how the concept of neutrality has changed.  This is of crucial importance. An understanding of the changing definition of neutrality, particularly with regard to the Irish situation, is extremely important.  Many Senators have expressed the view that there is confusion with regard to Irish neutrality and I would agree with that view.  It is of vital importance that we agree on a definition of Irish neutrality.  It would be fair to say that the concept of Irish neutrality has changed and evolved so that in 1989 it means something much different from what it meant earlier this century for many people.</P>
      <P>As I said already, there is some confusion with regard to what Irish neutrality means so an understanding of the definition is essential.  Senators have given their version of the historical evolution of the concept of Irish neutrality and at the risk of boring the Seanad, I too, propose to give an historical narrative in this regard.</P>
      <P>The new Irish State which came into existence in the 1920s was highly dependent on Britain and during our struggle for independence neutrality became part and parcel of the separatist movement. Neutrality at that stage, I would suggest, was anti-British in nature and the fact that we proclaimed a policy of neutrality meant for many people that we were demonstrating our independence of Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By 1935 the concept was evolving further. In 1935 Italy invaded Ethiopia and the whole concept of collective security had failed.  Mr. de Valera at that time declared Ireland to be neutral with regard <Col N="851" /> to the oncoming war.  Churchill bitterly condemned Ireland and our neutral stance at that time and from then on neutrality for the Irish people became a moral virtue.  It represented much more than the avoidance of military alliances; it represented the rights of small nations and it represented the wish of most people to work for international peace. By this stage neutrality had become a moral virtue and had evolved from the mere avoidance of military alliances.</P>
    <P>In the 1980s a more fundamental neutrality emerged again.  The whole idea of working for peace and justice and human rights in the world became even more prevalent.  The rise of the CND movement also contributed to this new idea. The whole movement for nuclear disarmament and so forth became more prominent and this, again, had its influence on the evolving definition of Irish neutrality.  Senator Murphy in his contribution refers to this neutrality as the new neutrality which was positive and fundamental and pacifist.  I would certainly agree with him on that, that the neutrality which we have today means much more.  It is positive, it is fundamental, it represents a desire to see peace and justice throughout the world and it represents a desire to work for human rights and so forth.</P>
    <P>Neutrality today is not just the avoidance of military alliances but a moral policy involving the promotion of peace, justice and human rights.  In effect, those who propose the abandonment of our policy of neutrality may not know what they are proposing given the new fundamental neutrality which has emerged in the 1980s.  Are they, in fact, proposing that we do not work for peace, justice and human rights and so forth in the world?  I suspect that if they thought they meant that, they would not be advocating the abandonment of our neutrality.</P>
    <P>We now live in an inter-dependent world and recent developments in the Soviet Union clearly demonstrate this fact.  The question now needs to be asked: what role has force to play in this new inter-dependent world?  It would be fair <Col N="852" /> to say that force will probably always have a role to play in international politics and international affairs but I would like to believe that the role of force is decreasing, that changes in the world economy and so forth have meant that we now live in an increasingly inter-dependent world. This is important when discussing this issue.</P>
    <P>As I have said already, the Gorbachev visit to Shannon demonstrated clearly to the Irish people what exactly is happening in world affairs.  Our policies with regard to nuclear disarmament, for example, seem to be very much in line with what President Gorbachev said at the United Nations recently.  It would be fair to say that everything has changed with regard to world politics and changed for the better.</P>
    <P>Some Senators have already asked the question, and I think it needs to be asked: just how important are military alliances in the 1980s.  Who is going to attack Europe or who is going to attack Ireland? These questions are now becoming much more relevant and would certainly seem to suggest that the more fundamental neutrality is much more important today. The moral aspect of neutrality will have to be stressed from now on.</P>
    <P>We are, in fact, playing our full role in a world characterised by multilateral conference diplomacy and inter-governmental organisations.  Ireland is playing a full role both in the United Nations and the EC and, again, our history has meant that we promote peace and mediatory tasks throughout the world.  We are to the forefront in calling for arms reduction and universal nuclear disarmament. Ireland does have a mission and we are determined to pursue that in every possible multilateral and inter-governmental organisation.</P>
    <P>Ireland is still criticised both by politicians in our own country and abroad for sitting on the sidelines.  It is said we are not playing a role in defence, that we are opting out of world affairs and that we are isolationist.  This is not so.  As I said, we have a mission.  We have a mission in world affairs to promote peace, justice <Col N="853" /> and human rights.  In particular the sending of our peacekeeping forces, through the vehicle of the United Nations, clearly demonstrates that we are not isolationist, that we are determined to play a role in world affairs.  Therefore, the argument that we are isolationist certainly does not hold when seen against that background.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal specifically with the question of the European Economic Community.  Contrary to what some people suggest, the new Irish fundamental neutrality had a role to play both in the EC and EPC.  Neutrality, as I said, is evolving.  It is fair to say that, from the Irish point of view, the fact that the EC does not deal with the military aspects of security is of fundamental importance to us.  Whereas before we were a small country which was rarely listened to in world affairs, now we can have our voice listened to through the vehicle of the European Economic Community and the whole process of EPC.  We have brought out unique tradition to that process and we are now able to influence world affairs and to promote peace, justice and so forth.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act was passed by the Irish people on 1 July 1987.  The Tánaiste when speaking in the Seanad late last year said that the European Community is a means to bring about a radical understanding among nations who have for so many centuries been ravaged by division and conflict.  That is a very important statement.  It shows that the whole process of EPC and the EC leads to a reduction in tension, to more understanding and to more consensus which must be a good thing in today's world.  We participate in the EC's development assistance activities and this accounts for a significant proportion of Ireland's total aid effort.  Ireland plays a role in the formulation of Community development policy.  The signing of the Lomé Convention and so forth clearly demonstrates that Ireland can now play a role with regard to world affairs whereas we could not do so before.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act deals with the whole process of European Political Co-operation.  Title III in particular deals <Col N="854" /> with co-operation in the sphere of foreign policy.  That whole process, however, works on the basis on the consensus so, again, we can bring our unique tradition to that process and work on the basis of consensus, which is of fundamental importance to us.  It must be clearly stated that the scope of Title III is confined to the political and economic aspects of security.  It does not affect our long-established policy of military neutrality.  That is of vital importance to us.  This whole question of the EC and our neutrality needs to be looked at further.  Our neutrality is evolving and given that we can now play a role we can promote our mission and our unique tradition with regard to world affairs through the vehicle of the EC.  That is important.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been to the forefront in promoting nuclear disarmament, in promoting human rights and in trying, for example, to find a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict but where I see neutrality playing a particular role through the EPC process is with regard to South Africa. The 12 member states have agreed to the total dismantlement of apartheid and to its replacement by a genuinely democratic non-racial system of government. In 1986 the 12 decided to ban imports of South African iron, steel and gold coins as well as new investment in South Africa.  Again, we can see that that policy with regard to apartheid would have been our policy in any event were we not a member of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>There is one last aspect which I would like to deal with and I think other Senators have touched on it briefly also, namely, the whole question of Irish neutrality and how it relates to the question of Partition.  At this stage when dealing with this subject we are going back to the military alliance aspect of neutrality and not the new, more fundamental neutrality which has emerged.  In 1949 the then Coalition Government were approached about joining NATO and Seán MacBride, then Minister for Foreign Affairs, categorically stated no, that as our country was divided we could not have a military alliance with a State <Col N="855" /> responsible for that Partition.  Every so often the question of neutrality with regard to the northern question is discussed and in the context of a British withdrawal.  It was mooted again in 1980.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying it is important that we would look at the military aspects of our neutrality in the context of a united Ireland and a further constitutional conference. Given that we rejected NATO in 1949 because of the Northern situation, were there a possibility of a constitutional conference and a British withdrawal, we would have to look at neutrality and military alliances again but that is another scenario.  It is down the road and we certainly do not have time to discuss it here tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Our party welcome this debate at this timely juncture given our acceptance of greater integration in the development of a new Europe and an awareness among European leaders of the need to develop a non-belligerent European Community common defence-security policy outside of NATO.  I suppose in many people's minds NATO is perceived as a confrontational and belligerent organisation.  The kind of western European defence union that certain people in what is called the Western European Union nowadays envisage would be a defence-security arrangement to defend the Community against internal disorder and aggression possibly from some outside power.</P>
      <P>I happen to believe that for this country, if we are honest about our participation in the greater economic and political cohesion of the European Community from now until 1992 and beyond, we must consider some form of participation in internal security and external defence, always remembering that defence in the context in which I am talking has no expansionist intent, has no aggressive intent or has no belligerent intent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate on neutrality in Ireland has been characterised by what I would call tactical pragmatism quite often but most of the time it has been characterised by <Col N="856" /> pure hypocrisy.  I am something of a student of politics of the world after World War II.  There arose in the world a new political concept of neutralism.  Newly emergent or independent states came together and called themselves non-aligned or neutral.  Chief among those were India, Indonesia, Yugoslavia.  They held some famous conferences; one in Bandung in 1955 set down the principles of neutrality.  They held another famous conference in Belgrade, I think in 1961, but was Ireland, so-called neutral Ireland or non-aligned Ireland, at any of these conferences?  Not a bit of it.  It would have been unthinkable that we would even send an observer to a non-aligned conference or to a neutral nations' conference during the great era of the non-aligned nations in the 1950s and 1960s. Quite unthinkable.</P>
    <P>I submit to the House that our neutrality has its origins in anti-British sentiment. Michael Collins said, and I am thankful to Professor Edward Walsh for reminding us of this in his recent lecture:</P>
    <P>The Irish struggle has always been for freedom &mdash; freedom from English occupation, freedom from English domination, not for freedom with any particular label attached.</P>
    <P>Mr. de Valera said in 1920:</P>
    <P>An independent Ireland would see its own independence in jeopardy the moment it saw the independence of Britain seriously threatened.</P>
    <P>In effect, Mr. de Valera was saying that at any time the security of the United Kingdom was threatened from outside, it would embroil Ireland in its effort to defend itself and to defeat any attack from enemies.</P>
    <P>Neutrality was not an issue in the newly independent State for the first 20 years, as far as one can see.  The 1937 Constitution was an excellent opportunity for Mr. de Valera to enshrine neutrality as a principle of Irish foreign policy but he did not.  Thus, there is no constitutional basis for our neutrality, although let it be said in tribute to the founders of the State that their vision of independence led them to <Col N="857" /> formulate an independent foreign policy to demonstrate to the world that this was an independent state, not necessarily influenced by the quite overwhelming influence of our next-door neighbour in the affairs of the then post-World War I world.</P>
    <P>It has been said, and I think it was Professor Walsh who said it recently, that our neutrality in World War II was Mr. de Valera's great political stroke.  It was a stroke of luck, I submit, and no more. Of course, it was a pragmatic policy, if it was not a very moral one.  We must remember that Belgium and Holland proclaimed their neutrality at the beginning of World War II.  So did Greece but that was a fat lot of good to Belgium or to Holland or to Greece when it suited the war purposes of Hitler or Mussolini to occupy them in turn.</P>
    <P>The same would hold true for us.  If the demands of war were such by either power, a fat lot of good our neutrality would have done to defend us from the ravages of war between 1939 and 1945. We can speculate again on our neutrality. If, for instance, this island of ours was located in the middle of the North Sea during the war years, with Britain on our western flank and Hitler's Reich on our eastern flank, we can just imagine what good our neutrality might be.  We would be like Belgium and like Holland.  We would be in the cockpit, we would be occupied and our neutrality would be worthless.</P>
    <P>So I say in all seriousness that maybe we should in many ways view our neutrality during World War II more with shame than with pride given that it was a neutrality towards Hitler's Third Reich, which was possibly the most evil regime this world has ever known.  I, for one, cannot see the morality of that kind of neutrality explained away by what is called the pragmatic needs of keeping clear of the quarrels of the big powers.</P>
    <P>After the War, strangely, our neutrality and the reasons for our neutrality shifted and it became closely linked to Partition.  Seán MacBride, the first Coalition Minister for Foreign Affairs &mdash; he has been mentioned on a number of <Col N="858" /> occasions &mdash; held out the possibility of our joining NATO except, he said, that the then Government could not involve themselves &ldquo;with a military power responsible for the Partition of this country&rdquo;.  In 1951 Mr. de Valera, when asked about joining NATO said, like Mr. MacBride had said before him, that Partition was the obstacle to joining, not any particular principle of neutrality&rdquo;. However, events and attitudes moved on to the extent that in 1962 Mr. Lemass, the then Taoiseach, after we had first applied to become a member of the then Common Market, said:</P>
    <P>We recognise that a military commitment will be an inevitable consequence of our joining the Common Market, and ultimately we would be prepared to yield even the technical label of neutrality &mdash; we are prepared to go into this integrated Europe without any reservation as to how far this will take us in the field of foreign policy and defence.</P>
    <P>I am quoting Seán Lemass in an interview with the <i>New York Times</i> on 18 July 1962.  Eight years later on our accession to the EC, Mr. Lemass's successor, the then Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, had this to say:</P>
    <P>Being a member of that Community, we would naturally be interested in the defence of the territories embraced by the Community.  There is no question of neutrality there.</P>
    <P>That was stated by Mr. Lynch, as Taoiseach, on 23 July 1969.</P>
    <P>The debate on neutrality faded almost out of existance with our gradual accession to full membership of the Community in the 1970s.  Although the Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1978, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, told the Dáil in November of that year that:</P>
    <P>In the event of a situation arising which one would hope would never arise, the Community of which we were a member were under attack, then obviously we would have to face our obligations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="859" /> The debate came back again in the early 1980s at the time of the Falklands War. It was referred to briefly by Senator Haughey.  Deputy Haughey's Government in 1982 depended for survival on the vote of Deputy Blaney and others who could probably be described as republican Members of the Dáil.  The Government, with their dependence on these votes for survival in those summer days of 1982, decided to invoke neutrality again when Britain demanded a common European stance for her dispute with Argentina.</P>
    <P>Our declaration of neutrality then, I submit, had nothing to do with the principles of neutralism or with the principles of neutrality but it had all to do with the then Government's instability and their need to keep the vote of Deputy Blaney and a few others.  Also at that time &mdash; strange times in Ireland &mdash; the Minister for Justice was advising that M15 and M16 were abroad with agents of this country and so, it became necessary to take extraordinary measures to keep an eye and indeed an ear on certain &ldquo;collaborations&rdquo; as they would be termed &mdash; some of them in the Press and some of them in the Cabinet itself.  Because of all of these strange happenings it became necessary to assert our sovereignty by asserting our neutrality.  I am no admirer of Margaret Thatcher but I certainly find her more acceptable than General Galtieri, who is now in jail.</P>
    <P>We might remind Deputy Haughey that a Senior Minister, the Minister for Finance in a Fianna Fáil Government in the late' sixties, said that a political union in Europe without a defence commitment would be meaningless.  Now the debate is coming back again in the event of the Single European Act and the new era of <i>détente</i> in Europe is the beginning of what some of us hope may be a new age of reason in the world.  Who would have thought even five years ago that the most popular political leader in the world in the mind of the people in the west would be the President of the Soviet Union and that his popularity would be earned by <Col N="860" /> his extraordinary attempts to make the Soviet system an open society and his attempts to start a dialogue in the world to rid this planet of weapons of mass destruction and of belligerent military alliances.</P>
    <P>A dozen years ago Austria announced its intention of joining the EC.  What would the Soviet response be?  Possibly, the sending of tanks to Vienna to guarantee for them, the Soviets, the terms of neutrality they had laid down for that country on the withdrawal of their troops in the early 1950s after World War II which set up an independent state &mdash; many would say the quasi-independent state of-Austria.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to support this motion, particularly as I have had very strong feelings about the whole issue of neutrality for a very long time.  It was difficult for me because I was brought up in a tradition which very much associated itself with the British Imperial Empire &mdash; building tradition and participated in the wars of England with a considerable degree of enthusiasm.  It was only when I began to understand the problems of Ireland and the history of Ireland that I began to see the wonderful opportunity there is for Ireland to promote for itself a role in the world as a neutral peace-making state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can start &mdash; I am sure this has already been stated by some Senators &mdash; by saying that Ireland seeks first to establish its independence.  This was achieved through its role in the League of Nations, through distancing itself from the various provisions of the original Treaty between the Provisional Government of Ireland and Lloyd George's cabinet, through a self-conscious ware-time neutrality and subsequently by breaking with the then British Commonwealth. The Twenth-six Counties in this part of Ireland had managed to establish unequivocally, against an enormous amount of opposition, an international recognition as a sovereign independent nation.  The reputation of the Irish Republic in this respect was confirmed by the world community when it was <Col N="861" /> admitted as an independent nation into the body of the United Nations and subsequently by entry in advance of Britain into the European Community.</P>
    <P>In spite of the fact that 60,000 Southern Irish volunteers went along with 40,000 Northern Irish volunteers to fight against the forces of fascism during the 1939-45 holocaust, this part of Ireland retained a neutral position in that conflict.  While many disliked it, others poured ridicule on it and some even sought to despise Ireland because of its neutrality at that time, any student of history, in particular of the history of the Anglo-Irish relationship, would concede that this self-conscious assertion of independence of Britain tied up very much with now dated concepts of sovereignty in order to establish a position for people who had been so dependent for so long on the management, control and in other ways of a very powerful neighbour.</P>
    <P>However, I would add that it is possible to argue that the obsession with the need to act absolutely and totally independently of Britain apart from being as unrealistic as it is unattainable did little to promote constructive thinking on the Partition issue.  The more stridently this independence was proclaimed by a State for whose ethos they had so little empathy and about whose intentions they held so much suspicion, the more prone were the Irish minority &mdash; the Northern loyalist community with which I am associated or from whom I have come &mdash; to back away from unity with the State.  Therefore, there is today little, if any, justification for neutrality on the grounds that it was being pursued 40 years ago and this point has been eloquently made by a number of Senators.  In any case, in today's world the concept of absolute sovereignty is absolute nonsense and anyone who proclaims it could hardly claim to be living in the real world.</P>
    <P>Nuclearism, the new mobility of peoples, the new communications technology, common global consequences of destructive ecology, ensure that we are aware today of living in an inter-dependent world.  The concept of NATO <Col N="862" /> has now become dated so that the references which have been made to statements such as that of Seán Lemass in 1962 that Ireland was not neutral in its ideological commitment but simply did not belong to NATO because of a complex quarrel with one of its neighbours is of times past.  Seán MacBride had even earlier indicated that although Ireland had not joined NATO in 1949 when invited, she might be willing to do so if Partition were ended.</P>
    <P>The world has changed in the past 40 years and the way in which one looks at Partition has changed.  The relationship with Britain has changed and a new era is beckoning.  The relationship with Britain is more and more a relationship between equals.  The concept of NATO, as Fintan O'Toole pointed out in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 6 April, is about the situation in the world of 40 years ago.  In those 40 years Irish neutrality has often been proclaimed in a voice of sanctimonious piety and, as Senator Connor said and I would add, like most assertions of that nature not without a little ring of hypocrisy.  We have been neutral in favour of some and against others, with a wink and a nod here and there, whether it be in favour of the USA for fear of losing its favour, against the Communists for fear of losing votes at home, or neutral towards the atrocities of Iran for fear of losing the beef trade.  We should not be in the business of competing in the virtue stakes for neutral purity.  Rather, we should be defining an international role for Ireland as attractive to the young people of the North, as it would be to those living here.  This role should be based on a clearly defined policy of uncompromising positive neutrality with a clear idea of what we mean by that.  It should be the central pillar to a peace-making pro-life philosophy which the planet so urgently needs.  The controlling influence of the USA in world affairs starts to recede as <i>perestroika</i> and <i>glasnost</i> open up the vastness &mdash; and I emphasise the vastness &mdash; of the USSR.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not, western Europe is changing fundamentally also. Nation state-ism is dated and indeed <Col N="863" /> Ireland will have to confront the problem soon of whether we are going to leapfrog over it or whether we are going to try to have it as a short term option until we move on to what the rest of the world is looking for.  This has an important significance in relation to how we look at the problem of the North at the moment. Autonomy, Fourth World consciousness, ethnic awareness, the right to be different, these replace in the minds of people the idea of belonging to a uniform nation. Yet those who hold power cling to the concept of aggrandisement at the centre, whether it is the centre of the old idea of a nation state or the centre of a conglomoration of nations.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about positive neutrality.  Now is the time, I submit, to define it.  Neutrality should be central to our peace-making mission in this world, a role for which Ireland is uniquely fitted because of its relationship with the Third World, because of its understanding of post-colonial problems, because of its relationship with the USA and more recently the developing relationship with Canada, the relationship with members of the Commonwealth of nations and now, by a freak of good fortune we find ourselves with a seat as a neutral at the table of the European Community.</P>
    <P>One Irishman, Raymond Crotty, almost prevented the European Community from taking shape and we should applaud him for he demonstrated the power of the individual against the mighty political machine.  Now that we are there, however, we must never, ever allow the Community to disrespect Ireland's commitment to the neutrality which we seek to establish for ourselves and our children.  There is a role for everyone in positive neutrality.  This is something that gives us the right to feel we have a distinctive part to play as a small nation in the affairs of the world. This peace which we earnestly seek must start with ourselves, healing the split that Senator Ross talks about, the split inside ourselves, before we heal our division from others.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="864" /> Our holy men must, therefore, be helped to encourage us to find in the spiritual dimension of living the real peace which mankind so urgently needs. Our young people must be prepared to fulfil peace-making obligations in exchanges, through the learning of the languages of other people and not least through the learning of our own ancient language as well.  If every Irish school were to teach a different world language we would have a cadre of youth able to go out to the four corners of the globe and communicate.  We must have respect for the environment, distaste for excessive consumption, awareness of the sources of our energy and our material goods, a clear understanding of human rights and their development, awareness of the deployment in number and power of world weaponry and we must stand on principle.  This is where I would disagree profoundly with Senator Connor as a person who believes and who would uphold our right to be a pro-life, peace-making nation in the world.</P>
    <P>I supported Deputy Haughey, then Taoiseach, over his stand on the Falkland Islands.  Unfortunately, I cannot develop the reasons here and now but I would still support him were the circumstances the same.  We must try to develop our understanding of the reasons for the fundamental splits in consciousness which have led to so much bad blood and unhealed wounds between the different sections of mankind as world history has evolved.  There is a need for the politics of repentance, a whole new way indeed, of looking at the world.  This is what we should be trying to grapple with when we talk blithely about positive neutrality and peace-making.</P>
    <P>We should, therefore, be inculcating in our schools the need for transformation and how we look at life on our planet.  Without this transformation, nuclear holocausts or ecological disaster will render extinct all life on earth.  We must ask ourselves, need it come to that? The role played by centralism and &ldquo;gigantism&rdquo; in our present discomfort must be faced head-on.  Universities and colleges have a fundamental obligation to look at <Col N="865" /> the reasons for the individual and collective community lack of self-confidence that makes us feel insecure and threatened, that makes us politically violent. The territorial imperative, in other words, needs redefinition.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying that constructive Irish neutrality is very much linked up with the need for the resolution of our own conflict, the establishment of consensus democracy throughout the island as a whole.  It is the best guarantee we can give in relation to the security of our immediate neighbour, a peaceful Ireland which is also neutral.  Also, in contrast to alignment, it provides the least pretext for further destabilisation within Ireland.  More important, however, is how we decide to use it, whether it should be an active or passive form of neutrality.  Until this accommodation is achieved between the Irish majority and the Irish minority &mdash; that is, the Northern loyalist community &mdash; the island will remain unstable and such instability will remain a source of anxiety with regard to Ireland's neutral status. By the same token, if Ireland were to become a pawn in the power bloc game, it would take on board a further dest-abilising factor prior to a settlement and a serious cause for potential destabilisation.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I have no hesitation in supporting this motion and I hope all other Senators will do likewise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, may I join those Senators who felt that this motion was timely.  I feel the motion was also very timely and I would like to thank all of the Senators for what were in the main very positive contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that Senator Robb has taken Senator Connor to task &mdash; although that might be too strong &mdash; because I was going to do so.  Senator Connor referred to a new age of reason.  I feel he should also move into that age and forget what may have happened in the early eighties and certainly not refer as he did to a Government who, for very sound reasons, took a stance in the early eighties that <Col N="866" /> was completely against that of the Community. That Government were proved right after a number of months.  The decision the Irish Government took at that time was taken not for the devious reasons that Senator Connor ascribed to them and I am surprised at him.</P>
    <P>Essentially, this motion is a call for a reiteration of the policy of successive Governments, a policy which all the political parties still say they support.  I welcome the opportunity this debate offers to restate the Government's well-established, long-standing position.</P>
    <P>The first part of the motion urges the rejection of &ldquo;calls for Irish involvement in a so-called European defence commitment&rdquo;. Senator Murphy mentioned some Irish politicians and others who, he says, are advocating such a course. However, I feel this is not a new development. There have always been people who questioned our neutrality policy. That, I suppose, is to be expected.  What matters is that the policy of military neutrality is firmly maintained by this Government.  It is important also to note that there is no external pressure on us to make a defence commitment or to force us into a defence alliance.  Senator Manning and Senator Bromell, and indeed Senator Robb also referred to this matter.  I am glad that they did so.</P>
    <P>The values for which Ireland stands and which are enshrined in our Constitution, that is, respect for human rights and liberties under democratically enacted laws, peace and friendly co-operation among nations based on justice, morality and the rule of law, correspond with those of the other liberal democracies of Europe and the west.  Our economic interests are linked to those of the western industrialised world so, we are clearly part of that world, ideologically, politically and economically.</P>
    <P>We also pursue a policy of military neutrality.  That policy and the distinctive role we have been able to play in international affairs have earned Ireland respect and a standing in the world of which we can all rightly be proud.  We <Col N="867" /> are committed to the promotion of disarmament and arms control.  We emphasise the importance of the United Nations for maintaining international peace &mdash; in particular through our participation in UN peace-keeping operations.  We are contributing to the greatly improved climate of east-west relations through the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.  We promote respect for human rights world wide.  We advocate respect for the rights of newly independent and developing countries.  That the role we play is welcomed by other nations was recently confirmed to both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste during their visits to Washington and Ottawa and by President Gorbachev in Shannon. Our European partners, too, are happy to have this Irish dimension as part of the evolving joint foreign policy of the Twelve.</P>
    <P>Our policy of military neutrality continues to be a positive element in Ireland's international standing.  Like our predecessors, this Government, therefore, are fully committed to that policy and we will maintain that commitment. It is clearly in the national interest that we do so.  Neither our membership of the European Community nor our involvement, together with the EC member states in European Political Co-operation obliges Ireland to act in a way incompatible with our policy of military neutrality. The Community has no competence in defence or military matters.</P>
    <P>European Political Co-operation is the process which has been evolving since 1970 by which member states of the Community, operating on the basis of concensus, exchange information, consult together and where possible seek to adopt common positions and to take joint actions on the main foreign policy issues of concern to them.  On this I can assure Senator Ross &mdash; and in his absence I am glad to acknowledge the fact that in this particular motion we seem to be at idem &mdash; that we can, as stated by Senator Haughey, put forward our own view and <Col N="868" /> do put forward our own view on particular issues that arise in European Poltical Co-operation and the position the Twelve adopt takes account of Ireland's views.</P>
    <P>As far as the remaining matters are concerned, the scope of European Political Co-operation is limited to political and economic aspects.  Military aspects are excluded.  This provisions has been made explicitly to take account of Ireland's position.  To the extent that some of our partners wish to co-operate more closely on security matters beyond the scope of what is appropriate to European Political Co-operation, they do so in the fora appropriate for such co-operation, that is, the Western European Union or NATO, of which Ireland is, of course, not a member.  All of this is set out in Title III of the Single European Act.</P>
    <P>When depositing the instrument of ratification of the Act in 1987 the Government at the same time lodged a declaration that put our position beyond all doubt.  It noted that the provisions of Title III did not affect Ireland's long-established policy of military neutrality and that co-ordination of positions on the political and economic aspects of security did not include the military aspects of security or procurement for military purposes.</P>
    <P>There has been, of course, much debate among NATO and Western European Union member states and much speculation by commentatory in recent years about improving the organisational arrangements for their defence, strengthening NATO's European pillar, as it is often described.  No doubt at some level some of our partners would like to see the Twelve have a role in defence and military matters.  Many Members of the European Parliament are also of that view.  Some of the calls for an Irish commitment to some form of collective defence to which Senator Murphy referred reflect that thinking.  This debate does not involve Ireland or any other neutral state in Europe although we naturally give it close attention.  There is no question of our being involved in a <Col N="869" /> European defence commitment or a military alliance of any kind.</P>
    <P>Many of those on the right who call for a reconstruction of our neutrality do not pay sufficient attention to the dramatic changes taking place in the world today between east and west.  They are still trapped in Cold War concepts.  As Senator Robb has stated, we are far removed from the tense situation that obtained not just in the forties but even at the beginning of the 1980s.  The militarisation of the European Community and the shift of a neutral country like Ireland into a military alliance, which no one from outside is asking us to do at present, would send all the wrong signals, particularly with regard to the process of greater openness and democracy in eastern Europe.  De Gaulle had a vision of Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals and, while that remains a long way off, now it is not the time to be talking about creating or reinforcing a new military bloc which could make political and economic co-operation between the European Community and eastern Europe far more difficult, a point which was touched on by very many Senators.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the Government have no difficulty in calling for rejection of calls for Irish involvement in a so-called European defence commitment or in reaffirming unequivocally the national policy of non-participation in military alliances.  I fully support this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  Naturally, the Labour Party are in support of the <Col N="870" /> motion.  We are at one with regard to the whole question of our modern-day attitude.  It is just as well as that we put it on the record that not only has Ireland a long-standing position on neutrality but the question of political debate and controversy arises again.  It is necessary in that sense for me to put a few matters on record with regard to the Labour Party's attitude.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party unequivocally reiterate commitment to a neutral role for Ireland, not alone in the sense of abstention from any form of military alliance but in terms of active political philosophy. As early as 1918 the Labour Party adopted a wide-ranging statement on foreign policy in terms relevant to the world and national issues in that troubled time.  That statement proclaimed the adherence of Irish labour to the concept of peace, on the basis of genuine democracy, the real self-determination of all subject peoples, no annexations, no indemnities and no undemocratic or secret treaties.  The party committed themselves to the work and ideals of the International.  That is going back to 1918.</P>
      <P>In their policy documents in 1969 the Labour Party set out some brief outline statements and had a fundamental stance which I could summarise very quickly, that is, Labour's foreign policy should be one of independence and neutrality, it should recognise the need for social revolution on a world scale and oppose the forces of counter-revolution in periods of racism, that Ireland should regain its independence of speaking and voting at the United Nations; that Ireland should use this independence in the service of peace and the freedom of small nations and social change; that Ireland would vote for the seating of the Peoples' Republic of China and China's seat in the Security Council and in the General Assembly of the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not new for the Labour Party to back motions of this nature or to take some action on them.  They updated their policy again in 1978.  The actual updating <Col N="871" /> of it is too long for me to go into it but I might add that in 1980 their annual conference went further again on the question of neutrality.  They set out the fundamental and positive principles of Ireland's national and international policy which is intertwined with their stance on neutrality.</P>
    <P>The current debate on neutrality arises from a number of causes, the state of world tension and so on.  It is not new for the Labour Party to be very concerned about the whole question of neutrality. It will be admitted that the party have been very far-seeing in their attitude to the whole question of neutrality and nonalignment. The problem for us all along is that this has not been a constitutional issue but more a policy stance.  Whether it is practical to make it a constitutional issue is another matter. &mdash; I speak as an ex-soldier who went through the war and I do not want ever to see or hear tell of a war again or violence of any description. One of my concerns &mdash; perhaps it is my own lack of education, or understanding of the situation &mdash; is that with the great interdependence in the EC the more freedom people have, the more security and economic assistance there is, the more you owe them and consequently, one may not be able to be a conscientious objector. That is a thought that runs through my mind.  I often wonder whether with our present involvement we will be able to live with that.  I believe we can, as we have done so up to now.  We have set a great example from Frank Aiken's time onwards and that is the way we should continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Harte for leaving some of his time to me.  First, I welcome the speech of the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs.  It was a very important speech, particularly in its concluding section, with which I agree thoroughly.  I had a little more difficulty with the opening of the speech because I think that perhaps the <Col N="872" /> Minister is disingenuous where he makes remarks such as the comment &ldquo;It is important to note also that there is external pressure on us to make a defence commitment or to force us into a defence alliance&rdquo;.  That depends upon an interpretation of the word &ldquo;pressure&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I believe there is a growing pressure in Europe for us to get involved in a military commitment following the completion of the internal market in 1992.  I say this because no less a person than Jacques Delors, President of the Commission, has made it perfectly clear that following 1992 it is his intention to try to ensure that there will be some degree of move towards the creation of a pan-European currency and the eradication of local currencies. At the same time, there will be full political union and he has specifically mentioned defence commitments in this. It is a question of whether or not you would interpret that as being pressure.</P>
      <P>That does worry me, although I fully accept and I am very greatful that the Minister reiterated the fact that we entered a special provision at the time of the signing of the Single European Act and the entry of that particular instrument was one of the things that enabled me and many other people to vote for that Act.  Despite that, it is very important for us to look back at what has been said in previous times.  For example, at the time the referendum which enabled us to join the European Community was being introduced, the former Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch said on 16 July, 1969 column 622, Volume 24, of the Official Report of the Dáil:</P>
      <P>We have no traditional policy of neutrality in this country like countries such as Sweden, Switzerland and Austria, who have declared themselves to have permanent policies of neutrality.</P>
      <P>On 23 July, at column 1157, Volume 241 of the Official Report of the Dáil he said that in the event of our entry into the European Community:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="873" /> we would naturally be interested in the defence of the territories embraced by the communities.  There is no question of neutrality there.</P>
    <P>It does seem that we are on dangerous ground, particularly if one takes this together with the debate in the Dáil on 11 March 1981.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from &ldquo;A Singular Stance: Irish Neutrality in the 1980s&rdquo;.  I can give the Official Reporter the specific reference subsequently.  It was during the referendum debate. During the course of the debate on 11 March 1981 in the Dáil Deputy Haughey accepted that a particular hypothetical situation, which is the full political union of European Community states &mdash; that is one direction in which we are clearly moving; some perceive it to be at a greater pace than others but it is certainly the direction in which Europe is moving at the moment &mdash; would involve the end of Irish neutrality.  There is another hypothetical case &mdash; Irish reunification &mdash; in which Deputy Haughey made clear defence arrangements for the whole island would have to be reviewed.  These three items taken together make me worry becuase I believe there is some degree of external pressure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish politicians have not fully come to terms with some of the complexities and contradictions of our much vaunted stance on neutrality.  Externally this contradiction is perceived, is confusing to our allies and leads to the application of pressure from abroad, even in those subtle forms currently being engaged in by Monsieur Delors.  This worries me precisely because everybody who speaks in favour of neutrality speaks about a kind of tactical neutrality.  We are taking about military neutrality and tactical neutrality. Very frequently we hear that <Col N="874" /> whereas we are militarily neutral and tactically neutral, we are neither ideologically nor morally neutral.  The confusion that this leads to is made clear in the case of the situation in the Falkland Islands.</P>
    <P>If you look at the documents that were produced by the Swiss Government detailing their attitude towards neutrality, they draw a difference between &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; and &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; or &ldquo;standing&rdquo; neutrality.  &ldquo;Oridinary&rdquo; neutrality is just the legal status of a country which does not happen to be at war or refuses to be engaged in a particular war whereas &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; neutrality involves an obligation not to begin a war, an obligation to defend the neutrality of the country and its independence and the secondary duties or antecedent effects of permanent neutrality.  I am not convinced we have embarked upon permanent neutrality. We have embarked on what really only could be called a tactical neutrality while reserving also the right of ideological or moral neutrality.</P>
    <P>I would also like to place on the record what I see as some dangerous consequences of a possible defence commitment within Europe.  Suppose we were to enter into a military arrangement. I accept and I am extremely glad that the Minister has so categorically placed on the record such sentiments as that the militarisation of the European Community and the shift of a neutral country like ours into military alliance would send all the wrong signals, particularly in regard to the process towards greater openness and democracy in eastern Europe.  Hear, hear, say I.  I notice the Minister has once again slid into that context the statement that no one from outside is asking us to do so at present.  I am not quite so convinced of that.  I would like to point out, for example, what the consequences would be, supposing we were so asked and agreed.</P>
    <P>I have in my possession a table drawn from the World Development Report, 1981: The World Bank, which makes it <Col N="875" /> perfectly clear, by a comparative analysis between five neutral countries, including Ireland, and five small NATO countries, including obviously comparative countries such as Belgium, Denmark, Norway and Portugal that were Ireland to join any form of defensive military alliance within Europe it would automatically lead to a tripling of the defence budget. That tripling of the defence budget would mean that we would be more than one-third over the amount that in 1992 we would receive as a subvention from central funds in the European Communities. I would like to place very clearly on the record of this House that for us to engage in any form of defence pact within the European Communities there would involve a very substantial bill for the Irish taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a suggestion.  I was very heartened at the notion that there is a general consensus &mdash; with a few notable and distinguished exceptions in the House &mdash; that we should remain neutral. I would like that neutrality to be a full, positive instrument of foreign policy. That is very important.  I am not totally hoodwinked by the wonderful phraseology about the Constitution because I actually believe that a number of our actions in foreign policy terms are in conflict with a very vague element of the Constitution, that is, the Christian as well as the democratic element of our constitution. That, of course, depends on one's understanding of Christianity, I suppose, but I have no doubt that some of our actions have not met this test &mdash; certainly as it would be applied by me.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about our neutrality and if we want to shift it from being this rather vague, puzzling concept, not understood by many of our own politicians, certainly not understood by the people of this country, unquestionably not understood by many of our allies, why do we not enshrine it in our Constitution? We have enshrined far more contentious elements than this one, about which there <Col N="876" /> appears to be very considerable debate still possible.</P>
    <P>I should like to end with one or two final observations.  The first is that I believe we have an obligation, not only externally, as an instrument of foreign policy, to make clear our position in this matter.  I believe that if we really believe in neutrality &mdash; and I listened with great interest to what was said by many Senators, including Senator Robb and Senator Haughey &mdash; then there should also be an internal policy, a policy of educating our own people through the school system so that our citizens, as they come to maturity, should not just have a catchphrase about neutrality but should know why the Irish people have adopted it and why it should become a permanent feature of our foreign policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy to speak on this motion.  May I say also that I am very happy with the part of the Minister's speech that Senator Norris has just quoted.  It is a very strong and vigorous reaffirmation of one of the views I hold, that is, that simply to talk at this stage about another new military bloc in Europe is among the crazy, daft ideas I have heard.  At a time when there is enormous impetus towards demilitarisation, I am absolutely flabbergasted that anybody could talk in terms that we should build up something to defend the concept of Europe against some external threat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am extremely happy that the Minister has put the Government's view on the line, that to talk about increasing militarisation at one of the most hopeful periods in the entire history of Europe &mdash; particularly the history of Europe since the Second World War &mdash; to suggest that we should somehow be talking the European Community into some sort of defence alliance which would defend itself against a threat I know not from where at this stage &mdash; the Minister indicates perhaps from above because there is more likely to be a threat from there <Col N="877" /> than from anywhere else &mdash; is wrong.  The idea, for instance, that we would have our military heading for the borders of Germany to defend us against some aggressor from the east, when the overwhelming evidence in West Germany is that the citizens perceive no threat to themselves from the east at present and indeed were clearly on record as believing that they were far more threatened by President Reagan than my Mikhail Gorbachev, is nonsense.  The whole idea of talking ourselves into some sort of romantic commitment to defend this new Europe is an unutterable collection of twaddle.  It is glorified and dressed-up militarism being given a cloak of ideological idealism, that we are going to be part of this grand new concept of Europe and, therefore, we must defend it.</P>
    <P>The whole presumption that we must have militarism forever, the whole presumption that we must have large-scale armies and large-scale weapons of destruction forever, is a presumption which is articulated only by one significant figure on the world stage and that is Margaret Thatcher.  She is the only one I know who has consistently argued over and over again that we need nuclear weapons to preserve the stability of the world.  The rest of us have copped on to the fact that she needs nuclear weapons for reasons to do with her own perception of her own role in the world, but that we do not need defence alliances, we do not need weapons of mass destruction.  We do not need any of that to defend the sort of vision we have of peace and stability in Europe.</P>
    <P>We are being led by some people, in particular by a former Taoiseach of this country, in a direction which is contrary to the interests of the whole of Europe, contrary to the interests of this people.  It needs to be said that it will be an interesting exercise to watch how the Members of this House vote on this motion.  Quite clearly, if this House passes this motion without dissent, the members of Fine Gael have quite clearly <Col N="878" /> repudiated the views of Dr. Garret FitzGerald.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, A Chathaoirligh. If I assert that the sky is blue I do not have to produce a quote if it is that widely known that Dr. FitzGerald had said he would not support, and that he did not believe we should support, Austrian membership of the European Community if they were not prepared to accept a commitment to defend Europe. If he did not say it, I am quite happy to withdraw it; otherwise Senator Manning is distracting the House and distracting me.  It will be very interesting, therefore, that if Fine Gael support this motion they are making it clear that they take a different view from that.  I am very happy about that becuase I am extremely worried that a major political party in this country, or <Col N="880" /> at least influential voices within it, should be talking us into accepting something in slightly romantic terms which is nothing more than an attempt to militarise Europe.  It is tragic, and Senator Norris has underlined in very clear and specific terms one of the consequences of that which is to destabilise our public finances again at a time when under circumstances of pain to considerable numbers of people they are beginning to be stabilised.</P>
      <P>I did not anticipate the level of interruptions I got on it.  I understood that Dr. FitzGerald's views were well advertised and well known.  I must conclude Senator Manning accepts that what I said is correct representation since he does not assure me and will not tell the House I am Wrong.  Therefore, I can simply say that whatever the reasons, it is welcome that Fine Gael are coming around to the position the rest of us have always held. I am, therefore, very happy to support the motion.</P>

      <P>In winding up the debate I want to express my gratification at the numerous contributions that have been made and the near unanimous feeling of the House on this matter.  I am particularly pleased at the unequivocal response of the Government to my motion.  I take Senator Norris's point that perhaps some residual reservations about what may lie behind one or two phrases but I think that is being ungenerous.  I am struck by the fact that for the first time the Government have not said we are neutral, of course, but some time in the future if we are expected to undertake our share of defence then, of course, we will.  In other words, the Government have now effectively dissociated themselves from that string of statements which began away back with Seán Lemass and were continued through by Dr. Hillery, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, when Foreign Minister and Mr. Lynch when he was Taoiseach and so on.  It seems to me that we have a new <Col N="881" /> position being expressed by the Government, certainly not the full positive permanent neutrality to which Senator Norris and I and many other Senators subscribe, certainly not that far but a great deal further in that direction than the Government have yet gone.  This is quite an historic statement from the Government.</P>
      <P>I think it is equally important that Senator Manning in his contribution to this debate almost a month ago was also quite unequivocal about the support of his party for neutrality.  He was quite vehement that there was no intention on the part of Fine Gael of modifying that support or getting rid of neutrality, assuring us there was no conspiracy of any kind whatsoever.  In fact, Senator Manning's contribution was equally important is clarifying the issue.  May I recall briefly what he said: &ldquo;While in Government and in Opposition we in Fine Gael have always sought disarmament and peace and we fully support the peace-keeping operations which were possible largely because of our policy of neutrality&rdquo;.  He went on, &ldquo;the very strong majority view in the Fine Gael Party is in favour of the policy as I have enunciated it and this is the policy of the party leadership&rdquo;.  I think it was a very clear speech.  In fact, towards the end of his contribution he said something which I could not have said better myself, difficult though that may be to believe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>He said that it is because &ldquo;I believe that many of our partners in the Community see us as being far more useful within the European context as a full neutral country because we are capable then of intervening and making points at the United Nations which they could not do.  It is a distinctive aspect of a European presence&rdquo;.  I think that is a very good definition of neutrality in this dramatically changed period through which we are now living, that <Col N="882" /> Irish neutrality is a distinctive aspect of a European presence.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased with Senator Manning's contribution.  I regret if he thought my original opening remarks smacked of snide abuse or anything of that kind.  That is not my style.  Perhaps sometimes when I feel forcefully about something I am <i>fortiter in modo</i> as well as <i>fortiter in re.</i></P>
      <P>I hope Senator Manning's contribution will have the effect of causing the individual members of his party to think again. If, as seems probable now, Fine Gael support this motion, if the House is unanimous in this motion, then it seems to me that the Fine Gael Party officially are sending a signal to the individual members of the party who, again and again, over the past year particularly have attacked our neutrality policy. Maybe they will think again about what they mean by the defence of Europe.</P>
      <P>This glib word is never defined, we are never told what are our obligations of defence.  As Senator Ryan says, are we to suppose that we send an Irish Army-contingent to the Rhine, who is threatening Europe, and so on?  These things are never talked about.  What is talked about obscenely in these contributions is the economic benefits of military research, the economic benefits of job creation through participation in a military pact.  We are talking about an industry of death, that is what we are talking about and how people can subscribe to the immorality of that is certainly beyond my comprehension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to exacerbate the tension that grew up about Dr. FitzGerald's position. I am not a betting man but I would willingly place a modest sum on Dr. FitzGerald's attitude in this matter and that it was at the Schuman lecture that he said more than once, but certainly once, that it is irresponsible to encourage Austria's application to become member of the Community because her neutrality is incompatible with the aims of the European Community.  I think that is his position. It would be interesting to see his <Col N="883" /> own reaction to what I hope will be a unanimous vote of the House on this matter.</P>
    <P>We have been overtaken in a way by the events of the last month.  Since I spoke last all kinds of things have happened, the European Free Trade Association has been making interesting overtures to the European Community heralding perhaps the wider Europe which we all desire.  Austria has made it quite clear that she has every intention of pushing forward her application for membership of the Community while retaining her neutrality.  The leader of a West German parliamentary delegation who is in the country at the moment has entirely approved of that and hopes that Ireland will support Austria's application. It seems that those of us who are on that side are enormously encouraged by these developments.</P>
    <P>Most of all, of course, the Gorbachev meeting had all kinds of significance.  One of the most interesting people who was there on that day and who was interviewed briefly was Mr. Brendan O'Regan whose commitment to Ireland as a peace centre, as a model of peace, as a centre for summits between the great powers and so on is well known and is linked in his mind with his great work in Co-operation North.  That Gorbachev occasion again pointed how important this country is in the wider context of the world, in the Afro-Asian context, the Soviets and so on.  That has been enormously important.</P>
    <P>Again and again, what was quoted here &mdash; this was done by Senator Connor also &mdash; were the remarks of various Fianna Fáil eminences over the decades from Seán Lemass, with characteristic brusqueness, onwards who said that Ireland would shed its neutrality ultimately in a European defence.  What I am suggesting is that these statements were made in a very different time.  They were made, in effect, in the context of a continuing Cold War.  The scene has <Col N="884" /> changed enormously and the Government, I think, understand that the scene has changed enormously.  They are no longer bound by what was said by Seán Lemass and the others in talking about an ultimate commitment to a defence pact.</P>
    <P>This has been a very significant debate. There are two basic questions.  What kind of a European Community do we want? It has been made quite clear in this House that numerous Senators do not want a militarised Europe and that talk of European defence is about militarising Europe.  The other question is that Ireland has a non-European presence in the world as well as a European importance. One of the reasons we must maintain neutrality is because it serves the ends of our contribution to the world outside Europe.  Despite 1992, we will still have our relations with the small nations of the world who lie outside Europe.</P>
    <P>This has been the first stage in a new debate on neutrality.  We heard repeated calls for various people that we must debate the taboo and the sacred cow.  Well, we are debating it and this has been a vigorous first instalment.  Let the debate go on throughout the European election campaigns.  In the meantime, it has been particuolarly gratifying for me, gratifying from the point of view of Senator Manning's contribution and gratifying from the Government's stance because whatever other political issues I have changed my mind on over my years in public life I am absolutely in no doubt whatsoever that neutrality in its fullest sense is the historic destiny that this country should be pursuing in the international sphere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter I wish to raise on the Adjournment with the Minister is the matter of compulsive gambling and its connection with the social welfare system.  I intend for the record to say a few words about compulsive gambling.  I will describe what kind of a disease it is and the fact that it is a disease.  I have done some research into it.</P>
      <P>Compulsive gambling is, first of all, a very debilitating disease.  As I have said in other places, to ask a compulsive gambler to stop gambling is the same as asking somebody with two broken legs to get up and run.  That is the only way I can describe it because the Department of Social Welfare look upon compulsive gambling as a sort of self-inflicted occupational hazard and therefore, they will not recognise it as an illness.  Compulsive gambling is a disease which causes lack of control over impulses, lack of impulse control.  It is a progressive behavioural disorder in which the individual has a psychologically uncontrollable preoccupation and urge to gamble.  That is precisely what the disease is about &mdash; an urge to gamble which is uncontrollable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also a disease which goes through the same identifiable type of development and stages as other diseases of addition.  It goes through three main stages.  First of all, it is the same as any substance addition: it goes through the high phase, big roller, the big wins.  The analogy would be with the person shooting up heroin; it is all good times, good story, it is all &ldquo;a high&rdquo;.  It is a good feeling and it is &ldquo;a high&rdquo;.  In terms of the next stage of the illness &mdash; it is precisely the same with alcohol addition or with substance addiction and with many other diseases of addition &mdash; there is what is loosely referred to as the roller coaster stage, the ups and downs, the excitement, everything moving and the thing moving <Col N="886" /> on.  That is the second stage of the illness of compulsive gambling.</P>
    <P>The third stage is the stage which people know most of all.  The third stage is the &ldquo;low&rdquo; where you hit ground, when the compulsive gambler hits the ground and in fact is there for keeps.  It is at that stage the family falls apart, that the personal life falls apart, that the person's job or vocation is threatened.  It is at that stage that the gambler uses all sorts of subterfuge in which to take or dip into family finances &mdash; pawning, stealing, rearranging finances, dipping into the overdraft, increasing the overdraft.  Finally, at the work stage, perhaps, if it is a job which involves handling of money, getting involved over his or her head with an amount of money which he or she is not able to give back.  Very often if somebody is involved in a club or in some other outside activity, because the disease of compulsive gambling is one that actually facilitates the person to be very clever and to get into situations where money becomes available, the result may be the same.</P>
    <P>That is the way the disease develops and I think people are fairly well informed about it.  It is a disorder of impulse control.  In other words, it is not just a case of &ldquo;Why does this person not stop gambling?&rdquo;  I spoke to one of these people, who had been cured and is now in a highly responsible job, and he has been in a highly responsible job for years. Sometime recently he had occasion in the course of his job to walk into an amusement arcade.  He told me he was shattered by the experience.  It was his first time in one for something like five years.  He said that the flashing lights, the sound of the machines, the jingle of the money and the stuff going in and out made him feel totally out of control while he was there.  This is a man who has not gambled for years and he lapsed &mdash; as it is called &mdash; on that day.  But it was only for a day and, thankfully, it did not affect his job.  However, I want to explain that.</P>
    <P>What does it do?  There is very much a <Col N="887" /> power thing involved.  There is this feeling of power, this feeling of excitement, this feeling of intense arousal and it leads to irrational thinking, the thinking that &ldquo;I will win&rdquo;.  There is this irrational approach and, finally, there is this great sense of being part of the action.  This is the sort of feeling that people go through. That is all I wish to say about the actual disease itself, but I want to get across to people that this lack of emotional control, this interference with normal functioning, this lack of control over normal impulses is a disease.  It is an illness and it has been defined as an illness and accepted as an illness by many different groups.  It has been so accepted by the American Psychiatric Association for years; it is now included in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders of the association and so on.  It is accepted by the VHI as a disease or an illness for which they will recompense people after due claim.</P>
    <P>This brings me very closely to the point at issue and to the problem this is creating in the social welfare system.  The best way I can explain it is to give an example. This happened to a person I talked to.  I discussed this matter a number of times during the week with officials of the Department of Social Welfare and I would like to put on the record that they could not have been more helpful.  They pointed out to me the difficulties they were acting under and the problems the law presented for them.  We also have a duty to identify the problems with the law and to get a commitment from the Minister or from the Department to do something about it.</P>
    <P>The problem is this.  We have an anomaly here and the anomaly is simply the withdrawal of social welfare payments of various kinds &mdash; disability benefit scheme, assistance, pay-related or whatever &mdash; from unemployed persons who suffer from gambling addiction or <Col N="888" /> compulsive gambling because they voluntarily enter a rehabilitation and treatment programme for compulsive gambling, which is an illness as I have pointed out.  We have arrived at the ridiculous situation where the Department of Social Welfare claim that compulsive gambling is not an illness but some form of a self-inflicted condition &mdash;&ldquo;inflicted&rdquo; is probably the wrong word &mdash; which people lead themselves into.  We could describe a lot of things in that way.  We could say the same about syphilis or many other illnesses, where people act on a particular impulse that is not controlled at the time.</P>
    <P>Compulsive addiction is a most serious behavioural disorder and is recognised as such by doctors, psychiatrists and psychologists and is recognised as an illness by the VHI.  The Rutland Centre which treats this complaint is one of the hospitals for which the VHI will pay or will meet claims.  Society sees compulsive gambling as a huge problem.  From Donegal to Dublin it is a topical issue which is discussed time and time again. Families suffer because of its effects. Society sees it as a huge problem.  Compulsive gamblers are regularly dismissed from their jobs because of problems created by the illness.  In fact, everywhere it is seen as an illness by people in general but it cannot be seen, because of present legislation, as an illness by the Department of Social Welfare.  It gives rise to an untenable anomaly in the operation of social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>Take an example; a worker is dismissed from his job because of his compulsive gambling habit &mdash; that is the first point. The second point, after some time on pay-related benefit he is offered a job by a sympathetic employer on condition that he takes treatment and is cured of his illness.  After enrolment for a course in the Rutland Centre, which will be six weeks or more, all social welfare payments are stopped.  The sort of perverse logic that supports the withdrawal of the <Col N="889" /> payment is as follows: because compulsive gambling is not accepted as an illness the claimant is not entitled to disability benefit.  Therefore, that is disability benefit gone out the door.</P>
    <P>The second reason is that because the claimant cannot be &ldquo;available for and/or actively seeking employment&rdquo; while he or she is in the clinic, the claimant is then not entitled to unemployment benefit or such other benefits attached to unemployment. Therefore, we are now in a situation where the person cannot involve him or herself in rehabilitation treatment without losing six weeks' income.  The person cannot afford to do without six weeks income, does not do the course, continues gambling, and the net result is that for the rest of his or her natural life is receiving unemployment assistance or other appropriate assistance from the Department of Social Welfare when he could be working.  Where is the logic of a job lost, a family shattered, a man on the scrap-heap because the Department of Social Welfare refused to accept the reality which is so clear to the rest of the population?</P>
    <P>That is just one aspect of this matter. It leads to other things as well.  It leads to people, because they are now aware of the fact that they will not be entitled to benefit while they are participating in a programme in some place like the Rutland Centre, becoming dishonest, tampering with medical certs, giving the wrong reason to the Department of Social Welfare, putting down a stress-related illness or depression or something else instead of the illness of compulsive gambling.  In terms of honesty, the single most important element of honesty that is demanded of such persons is when they decide to change their lives on an issue like this, and to start off on a lie takes from the whole value of it.</P>
    <P>In my discussions with the Department of Social Welfare during the week it was pointed out to me, quite reasonably, by the people concerned that they were sympathetic to the problem but that they <Col N="890" /> were, in a sence, caught by this accident of legislation &mdash; I do not believe it can be any more than that &mdash; or in some way stymied by the fact that certain medical officers were not prepared to accept it as an illness.  As far as the Department were aware, people had not lost out.  I know that information was given to me in good faith and I accepted it in good faith, except that this afternoon I got further information on this issue.  I have here before me a number of letters and one of them to a doctor by a named official in the Department states:</P>
    <P>Dear Doctor&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I am writing with reference to the above-named person.  You have given medical certificates for him for an incapacity described as addiction to gambling. However, addiction to gambling is not regarded as an incapacity under the social welfare Acts and Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; has been advised that payment of disability benefit cannot be made on these certificates.</P>
    <P>I have a letter to another person which states:</P>
    <P>... please note that &ldquo;compulsive gambling&rdquo; is not regarded as a specific illness or incapacity under the social welfare Acts.</P>
    <P>That is again signed by a named official. I have two or three more.  I spoke to a man today who went through precisely the same procedure.  He lost his job because of compulsive gambling.  His brother who was involved in another industry was prepared to give him another start in a similar kind of job provided he took treatment and got rid of his habit.  I checked this out just some hours ago.  This man went into the Rutland Centre and before going into the centre he contacted the Department of Social Welfare and got back a similar letter saying that compulsive gambling was not an acceptable incapacity etc. etc. and he was not entitled to benefit.  The only reason that man was able to go <Col N="891" /> through the course &mdash; which he did very successfully sometime early last year &mdash; was that his brother and his brother's family and the rest of his own family gathered round and supported his family for the six weeks he was in there.</P>
    <P>My objective here is not to embarrass the Department of Social Welfare.  I just want to point out and highlight a real difficulty.  I am not talking about any kind of a scam and I do not want the Minister to come back to me in a defensive way. I know what the problems are; I think I have stated them.  What I want to hear is how the Department tend to approach it and how the Department intend to respond to it.  Will the Department be prepared to say that this anomaly which has developed because of old legislation is something that must be addressed?  Can it be addressed by ministerial orders? Does it need a change in legislation? What do the Department intend doing about it?  Those are the questions I ask the Minister?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to explain I am reading this script on behalf of the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Michael Woods who is unavoidably absent.  I would, therefore, like to thank Senator O'Toole for his very comprehensive contribution and accurate assessment of the awful problem of compulsive gambling and also to emphasise that I am very concerned about the plight of people who have a compulsive gambling habit.  In my reply I will set out first the position as it stands in relation to my Department's disability benefit scheme and then go on to talk about the situation as it applies in relation to the unemployment schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, I would like to explain in the first instance that the disability benefit scheme provides for payment of benefit to persons who are incapable of work. <Col N="892" /> The term &ldquo;incapable of work&rdquo; is specifically defined in the social welfare legislation as meaning &ldquo;incapable of work by reason of some specific disease or bodily or mental disablement or deemed in accordance with regulations, to be so incapable&rdquo;.  This definition is the key as to who can and who cannot be paid benefit under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Thus, unless a person is certified by a medical practitioner to be suffering from an incapacity that falls within the terms of the definition I have just read out, no benefit can be paid.  &ldquo;Gambling&rdquo; as such does not render a person incapable of work and so there are no grounds on which my Department can rely for paying benefit in respect of certification that would describe &ldquo;gambling&rdquo; as the stated cause of incapacity.</P>
    <P>To depart from the well-established criteria of the scheme and to admit as incapacities matters that do not satisfy this criteria would be a radical departure from what was originally intended to be covered in the scheme.  The scheme is for people who, to put it simply and starkly, are sick and unable to work.  There is nothing that prevents a person who gambles being able to work in the ordinary course of events and his or her fitness for work need not be materially affected by entering what the Senator describes as a rehabilitative and treatment programme.</P>
    <P>However, in any situation where there is an underlying medical condition that can be accepted as a cause of incapacity for work, my Department will readily entertain a claim to benefit.  I am not aware of any case where a person on disability benefit had their payments withdrawn because they entered a programme of the type mentioned by the Senator.  If benefit was in payment before a person entered such a programme it was undoubtedly because they were suffering from a recognised ailment which might be attributable in whole or in part to gambling or some other cause and it would seem unlikely that this position <Col N="893" /> would be altered by participating in a programme.</P>
    <P>On the question of unemployment payments, all claimants to unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit must satisfy the statutory condition of being capable of work.  As I have already stated, &ldquo;gambling&rdquo; as such does not render a person incapable of work and, therefore, a claimant to unemployment assistance or benefit with a compulsive gambling habit would be regarded as capable for the purpose of entitlement under these schemes.</P>
    <P>In addition to the condition of being capable for work, the unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance schemes also require that claimants be available for and genuinely seeking work. Claimants who are compulsive gamblers must satisfy this statutory condition in the same way as all other claimants.  I can assure the Senator, however, that there is ample scope within the legislation to enable any claimant with an addiction and who undergoes an approved course of rehabilitation to continue to receive his or her entitlements.</P>
    <P>As an example of this I would refer to a special arrangement with the National Rehabilitation Institute for the payment of unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit to persons undergoing training at centres operated by the institute.  The arrangement is that the centre notifies the employment exchange of persons who are due to attend training programmes.  In the normal way there is never any difficulty in approving payment. Thereafter, payment is sent each week to the centre in respect of unemployment benefit or assistance claimants attending the course.  Similar arrangements exist for other rehabilitation centres who run approved courses.</P>
    <P>The detailed procedures for making payment and notifying changes are agreed locally but I am assured that overall the arrangement operates very well. In this regard, I am not aware of any local difficulty encountered in recent times but <Col N="894" /> if the Senator has a particular case in mind or is aware of any cases generally where a problem is being encountered, I will have the matter investigated immediately on receipt of the particulars.  Obviously from the Senator's contribution, he has particular cases in mind and if he gives us details we will pursue each case individually.  The Senator also said that some of these people are left without income for six weeks after the claim. There is entitlement under the Supplementary Welfare Act for people to obtain an income from the health board. That is available to anybody who needs an income and may have been refused under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    <P>I have made no secret of my determination to introduce an optimum degree of flexibility into the social welfare schemes.  A good deal has already been achieved in this regard.  For instance, in the past few years I have arranged for unemployed claimants to continue to receive their payments while on holiday abroad or while representing Ireland in sporting events.  Other initiatives have been the part time job allowance and the voluntary work option.  I was very pleased this year to be able to include a provision in the Social Welfare Act, 1989 which enables me to make regulations to deem claimants to unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit who engage in certain activities to be available for work or to exempt from that condition.</P>
    <P>In summary, therefore, in regard to the subject of the motion, the position is that anyone who is in receipt of unemployment benefit or assistance and who wishes to go on a course of the type mentioned by the Senator will receive sympathetic consideration by my Department. Equally, any person already in receipt of disability benefit can continue to remain in benefit if he or she embarks on one of these courses.  Finally, if anyone who is not on any of these payments goes on one of these courses, the Department will, provided they satisfy the usual insurance contribution conditions, pay <Col N="895" /> disability benefit if appropriate medical certification is submitted, that is certification that relates to their physical or mental condition as laid down in the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    <P>I am very sympathetic to the plight of people who are compulsive gamblers and my Department will not hinder any steps they take to overcome their problems.  In the normal course of events my Department try to ensure, and will continue to do so, that nobody is adversely affected by participating in programmes designed to assist those who are compulsive gamblers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would thank the Minister for a very comprehensive reply. I will make three simple points.  First, what worried me slightly about the response is that there is no distinction made between gambling and compulsive gambling.  I am not saying that gambling is a disease.  I gamble myself &mdash; too much perhaps &mdash; but I am not a compulsive gambler and that is the difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to clarify one point.  I have the letters here which say that people have been stopped payment and I met people who have been stopped payment.  If <Col N="896" /> somebody is accepted in the Rutland Centre to do this very intensive and very difficult course &mdash; I know the Minister has been very sympathetic about it &mdash; can the Minister say the Department will see that the payments, whatever they were entitled to before going in, will be continued while they are in the centre?  If the Minister can answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; on that, then it has been a good night's work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department have given an undertaking to look at the individual cases.  I am personally not aware of the cases the Senator has before him but if he gives us the details of those cases we will have each one individually sympathetically considered.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Thank you very much. They were last year's stuff which I shall certainly let the Minister have.  I am more concerned about the future.  I think the reply has been positive and I thank the Minister very much.  I am sure I will be in contact with the Department.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 13 April 1989.</P>
