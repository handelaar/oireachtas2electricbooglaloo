      <P>I have notice from Senator Nioclás Ó Conchubhair that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to sanction the extension to the vocational school at Knock, Inverin, County Galway, because of severe overcrowding and poor condition of the school.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Katharine Bulbulia of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to recognise the grave situation facing the Waterford Teachers' Centre which may have to close if sanction cannot be given for a full-time director with adequate remuneration.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator John Connor of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Tourism and Transport to confirm that no obstacles will be placed in the way of the proposed flights originating in New York, via Reykjavik, and landing at Connaught Regional Airport, Charlestown, County Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="542" /> I also received notice from Senator Philip Hogan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to intervene immediately with the Revenue Commissioners so that the ban on the postal stamping services can be lifted forthwith.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Ó Conchubhair, Bulbulia, Connor and Hogan as suitable for discussion.  I have selected the matter raised by Senator Ó Conchubhair and it will be taken at the conclusion of business tonight.  Senators Bulbulia, Connor and Hogan may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>It is intended to take Items Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 today and that we take Item No. 4 from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m.  I have ordered the Social Welfare Bill which will be completed in the Dáil at 7 p.m. and we may take that this evening between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. if we have time and if the business allows.  We will work from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. in any event if there is business which has not been concluded by 6.30 p.m.  On Item No. 3, we may take all Stages of that Bill but we can have a chat about that with the Whips immediately after the Order of Business.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, may I extend to you my congratulations on being chosen to represent the Government in Paris on St. Patrick's Day in this year of the Bicentenary.  I am sure you will do us all proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Order of Business, may I ask the Leader of the House for specific answers to specific questions?  I know being specific is not something that comes easy to him.  Will he tell me the status of the Interpretation Bill?  He promised he would have some information for us this week &mdash; that is Item No. 15 on the Order Paper.  Does he agree that the item on the ozone layer which was mentioned last week could become an all-party motion which could be taken in the first week after the Easter recess?  Does he also <Col N="543" /> agree that the motion in my name where the House is asked to note a report on freedom of information and the libel laws could also become an all-party motion and could be taken in the second week after the recess?  If the Leader of the House could give me specific answers on these questions I think we would all leave in a happier frame of mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too sure I should give specific information when I do not know exactly what the situation is regarding Ministers for the first and second weeks after the recess.  However, I do not think there is any problem in turning the motion on the ozone layer into an all-party motion.  We will have to have discussions on the actual wording of the motion.  There is no problem with the freedom of information motion because it just asks that we note the report.  I am afraid I still have no word back on the Interpretation Bill but when I get information on it I will convey it to the House. We can try to have the motion on the ozone layer in the first week back and in the second week we may take the freedom of information but I cannot give a specific commitment on that until I discuss it with the Ministers.</P>
      <P>On a point of information, I have just learned that the Social Welfare Bill is being amended in the Dáil so the text of the Bill will not be available to us and so we will not be taking it this evening.</P>
      <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leydon) Terry Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leydon)</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (3) of section 9 of the Health Contributions Act, 1979, provides that the Minister for Health may vary the income ceiling which determines the amount payable by an individual, in a particular contribution year.  Subsection (5) of section 9 of the Act requires that a draft of the proposed regulations shall be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and that the regulations shall not be made until a resolution has been passed, by each House, approving of the draft regulations.  The draft regulations now before the House shall apply in relation to the contribution year commencing on 6 April 1989.</P>
      <P>The income ceiling is at present £15,500, and it is proposed to increase this to £16,000.  In determining the proposed increase in the income ceiling I have taken into account &mdash; as required by the Act &mdash; the most recent information available regarding the average earnings of workers in the transportable goods industries, since the last income ceiling was adopted.  The latest recorded information on average weekly earnings in those industries relates to June 1988, when the average figure was £206.13, which was an increase of 4.76 per cent on the June 1987 figure of £196.76.  When this percentage increase is applied to the current £15,500 ceiling, a figure of £16,238 emerges.  I propose, therefore, to set the new ceiling at £16,000, an increase of £500 which is equal to the amount of last year's increase.</P>
      <P>Following upon the increase in the ceiling, the maximum contribution payable by any individual will be £200 that is 1.25 per cent of £16,000.  Persons with incomes of £15,500, or less, will not be affected by the increase.  Those with income over £16,000 will pay an additional £6.25 in the coming contribution year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional income which is expected as a result of the proposed <Col N="545" /> increase in the income ceiling will be slightly under £1 million in the contribution year 1988-1989.  Most of this will accrue to the Exchequer in the first quarter of 1990.  Senators will be aware that a new assessment and collection procedure has now been introduced for the self-employed.  Income tax, social insurance contributions, the employment-training levy and the health contribution are now being collected in one payment, based on self-assessment.  This streamlining and integration of the arrangements for collecting the various receipts will lead to greatly increased efficiency and help to ensure prompt payment by all those who are liable for contributions.</P>
    <P>As announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement on 25 January, the Government have decided to permit small-scale employers to opt for an annual remittance basis for PAYE, PRSI and VAT.  Application of the new procedures will be at the discretion of the Collector General of the Revenue Commissioners but the procedure will be optional for the employers selected. Before 6 April next, I will be making an amendment to the Health Contributions Regulations, 1979 to give effect to this decision in respect of health contributions.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have been responsible for the collection of current health contributions from all sectors since 6 April 1984.  The health boards remain responsible for the collection of arrears due from farmers, for periods up to that date.  Health boards can retain these arrears as additional revenue for local health needs.</P>
    <P>The total amount owed by farmers to health boards at 31 December 1988 was about £4.6 million.  The amount outstanding at 31 December 1987 was £5.7 million.  While the amount which is still outstanding is a cause for concern I am pleased that this amount has been reduced by more than £1 million in the past year.</P>
    <P>The Health (Hospital In-Patient charges) Regulations, 1984, came into effect on 1 June, 1984.  These regulations <Col N="546" /> allowed for an admission charge of £100 to be levied on persons admitted for hospital in-patient treatment in a public hospital who were in arrears with health contributions.  This amount was increased to £150 from 1 July 1986.  This has proved to be quite an effective measure in inducing defaulters to pay their health contributions.  However, it is important to mention that persons in arrears are not refused admission to hospitals, but the collection of the admission charge and the arrears is pursued later.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that outstanding arrears should be collected as soon as possible as it is clearly unfair that those who do not honour their obligations with regard to health contributions should continue to obtain health services at the expense of others.  Health boards are continuing their efforts to recover these arrears.  It has been necessary for them to initiate legal proceedings in some cases.</P>
    <P>I shall be reviewing shortly the income limit for free consultant's services.  I am not, as yet, in a position to say what the limit will be.</P>
    <P>I now ask the House to approve the regulations before it in draft.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>These regulations vary the income ceiling which determines the amount payable by an individual in a particular contribution year.  This is something that comes as a procedural measure before both Houses of the Oireachtas every year.  It would be easy to accept this measure just as a procedure but at a time like this it is important that we should question the progress of the health services and by and large, see what exactly people are getting for their contribution and ask what is happening in our health services.  I will very briefly do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question is, how can our health services survive the present rate of cutbacks, the present restrictions.  Indeed the restrictions have gone on for two years.  While I accept that savings must be made and that the general policies that are being implemented now by Fianna Fáil are in line with the policies the direction of which we agreed in the Tallaght <Col N="547" /> strategy &mdash; we know there is a need for savings &mdash; we would question the manner in which these are carried out.</P>
    <P>In the context of those savings, those cut-back measures, we all need to assess how the health services are coping with them.  There are a number of areas that cause concern, not least the lack of hospital beds in specific areas and the risk that involves people who are looking for hospitalisation, perhaps not as an emergency. The present situation in many hospital would unfairly, and perhaps dangerously, disadvantage patients.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point beyond which you cannot go.  The Senator is near to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what we are talking about is fairly general.  We are talking about health contributions and the benefits. We had an example in Limerick recently with the ludicrous situation of one hospital being auctioned off in one part of the city while in the other part of the city there was an attempt to refuse admittance to all except emergency cases.  There must be something manifestly wrong when this sort of situation develops.</P>
      <P>It is worrying to find this type of policy in public health.  If people, and indeed doctors, feel that there is no place for their health problems in the system, how can they cope, where can they go?  In this category are people waiting for tests or investigation who are presenting symptoms. Will they go away and put up with discomfort and maybe even pain, helpless in the face of local difficulties?  Certainly into this category would go people waiting for hip replacements.  There are 8,000 people waiting for over three years for this operation.  Children waiting for heart surgery would also come into this category. There is a way out, of course, but it is through private health care and many who cannot afford it must borrow to finance health costs if their need is great enough.  This, however, is not an option for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of those now unable to get health <Col N="548" /> care are the old who made payments for health benefits all their working lives. There is a tendency, whether we like it or not, to regard the health problems of the old as not a great priority.  At present there is a crisis of accommodation for the old and dependent.  Life can be good for the healthy elderly but when they get that they cannot care for themselves and begin to examine what are the options it can be a depressing picture.  Because there is only a poor structure of community care in most localities here, such old dependents have to seek institutional care.  The depressing reality is the cost of this care.</P>
    <P>We have all seen the dramatic growth in the number of new nursing homes opening in the country.  This trend has developed due to the numbers of young people who are moving away from the home environment and because they no longer want the responsibility of caring for their elderly parents.  For this reason, substitute care has to be provided.</P>
    <P>We need to monitor the regulations and legislation governing old people's homes and make necessary changes but we should also come to grips with the need for community care provisions.  This is most essential to the proper and efficient operation of a health service.  In every other European country the need for a community care structure is accepted.  Not only is it accepted, but it is developed to a very highly sophisticated degree.  I am thinking of one service I know well, the community health service in Holland, where the needs of the old, the handicapped and socially disadvantaged are looked after.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the greatest respect, Senator, if I allow this to go on we will have a debate which should not take place.  I am always slow to stop someone but the regulations before the House are quite specific and deal with increasing the income limit for the individual contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand and I certainly would not want to be out of order.  I have very strong views about regulations. When they come before the House nobody can change them, they are there. I suppose this is not one that would be open to change.  When we have regulations and there is no time limit on us in this House, it is only fair I think that we should discuss issues of importance to us. I will be finished in a few minutes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important, as I am sure you will agree, to make a case for the old people and the difficulties they are experiencing.  Most of the difficulties they are experiencing are directly due to costs and the unavailability of money at local authority level to develop community care or provide homes for them. They have done this in other countries and I have to say that our position is very regrettable.  Too often, we forget about the old.  I just want to put in a commercial here to suggest that there is a report available on recommendations from the working party which was given to the Minister in October 1981, dealing with the needs of the old.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course there are difficulties in many other areas of the health services.  There are serious cutbacks in VHI, a crisis in the dental service and there is the fact that the recently extended facility for spouses of insured workers is not operating. I am not opposing these regulations, I should say; I am just using the debate to highlight a few areas which I feel quite strongly about.  In this context, <Col N="550" /> I have to look at the Minister's speech. Once again, he gives us information about the situation regarding the collection of the farmers' contributions.  This came up again in last year's debate.</P>
    <P>It is very regrettable that the health boards that have responsibility for collecting these arrears have not been able to recover them.  We now have a situation where on 31 December 1988, farmers owed the health boards some £4.6 million. The amount outstanding on 31 December 1987 was £5.7 million.  I think this is an absolute disgrace and I wonder if the Minister has some discretion to move to remedy this.  It seems to me that it is at local level that spending needs to take place in a whole range of areas that could support and back up our health services.  To think that £5.7 million is being withheld is disgraceful.  Some machinery or means should be found, if the health boards cannot collect it, whereby central Government can go in and be as effective as they were in collecting the large income tax take they got last year.</P>
    <P>We are not opposing this motion and I welcome the regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion gives us the opportunity to look at the means by which the health services are financed.  In 1970, the late Deputy Erskine Childers was Minister for Health and he brought in the Health Act.  That Act was primarily concerned with the health contributions and it was believed by him at that time, and by many more in the Dáil, that this health contribution would figure significantly in the financing of our health services.  Unfortunately, it made very little impact.  We find that the health contribution and the proportion of the health services financed by it is ridiculously small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did a study recently which revealed that the health services cost the average taxpayer in this country some £22.50 per week; that includes the health contributions. The Irish health service is only a free health service for 35 per cent of the population.  In Britain, the cost is £23 for a full national health service.  The <Col N="551" /> Government are paying out enough money &mdash; more than enough money &mdash; but the service is not there.  This is what we have to question.  It costs the taxpayer in Britain £23 a week and they have a full national health service, free family doctor, free hospital service and all the other ancillary benefits that are available. Here it is £22.50 per week but we get very little in return for it.  There is need for a public debate as to how the health services will be financed &mdash; maybe as an extension of this health contribution scheme &mdash; and also a need to examine how the money is being spent.  Perhaps we could also establish new priorities in the health services, based on the financing of same.</P>
    <P>It would be a unique role for the Seanad to hold public hearings on the health services and invite submissions, both oral and written, from various interest groups throughout the country, including the public in general.  It could take six or 12 months to do this but I believe it would be worthwhile.  We need to consider this seriously.  I do not wish to step outside the limits here and I recognise your difficult role, a Chathaoirligh. I fully understand and sympathise with Senator Fennell in the problems she had.</P>
    <P>There is something radically wrong because we are not getting value for health costs.  It is not the State's fault because more money does not necessarily mean more health.  If health contributions were doubled I am not sure it would necessarily mean a good service.  I would say to surgeons, in particular: they do put people on waiting lists for operations which need not necessarily be done.  I have talked to many patients, who have not gone ahead with their operation after my advice against it.  These lists might be reduced considerably. When one reads about the long lists of people waiting for a long time for operations, it appears we are an uncaring inhuman society whereas, in fact, in many cases it might be in the patient's best interest not to have the operation.  I say this as an aside to the consideration that when we are establishing priorities <Col N="552" /> and establishing where the money is going we might be able to get better value for what is being spent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Connell has raised a few interesting points which open up the whole debate before us.  I do not want to be out of order but I would submit that the Minister, in introducing the regulations dealt not alone with the raising of these contribution limits but with health contributions to health boards and the in-patient charges for hospital services which came into effect.  That brings us to the question of what people who now pay this contribution are eligible for, what are they entitled to receive as a result of the increasing of the ceiling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ferris, Dr. O'Connell's contribution was certainly absolutely based on finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed this whole instrument is about finance.  The Minister dealt with it by pinpointing what was outstanding by way of contributions to health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not get me wrong.  I feel as strongly as you do about health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be absolutely specific.  I am responding to the Minister's statement and to the motion.  As a matter of principle, the Labour Party would have no objection to the raising of these limits but on this occasion we will have to oppose them because in every preceding year up to now, in line with the raising of the limits on ceilings for health contributions from PAYE workers and the self-employed, there was also a corresponding increase in the actual level of hospital services cards which were issued. The Minister said he was not yet in a position to notify us about the limits that would be set for hospital services card.  I believe these two directly linked matters of contributions and eligibility are now being separated by the Government for some reason.  That is why I will be asking that these regulations be rejected.  These <Col N="553" /> two limits have always been linked together.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he would be reviewing the income limit for consultant services which brings us to the reason the Minister raises these limits.  It means that the income limit at which the contributions taken from PAYE workers would stop has been raised by £500.  I have no objection to it being raised further, because people would then know that by being within this ceiling limit or, indeed, paying a PRSI contribution towards the health services they would not be at the level at which they would be required to have VHI contributions.</P>
      <P>In regard to what Senator O'Connell has said &mdash; that there were some consultants who were making arrangements and increasing waiting lists for people who did not require services &mdash; to whom can the consultants, or the Government, or the people who depend on professional advice turn to for decisions as to whether health services are required or whether operations are required for people?  We are depending on the authenticity of opinion from consultants and medics to know whether a service is required, whether a prescription is required, whether hospitalisation is required or whether in the final analysis a full surgical operation or intervention is required.  We must depend on somebody, and it is extraordinary that one of their colleagues in this House makes this statement.  He would be considered by some people to have at least an opinion that would be closer to the real truth than anybody else. I will not say he has a vested interest, but there is certainly a conflict of interest as far as consultants are concerned.  We have to take very seriously what he has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do know that when surgical interventions took place in the past there was this procedure that consultants always insisted on seeing the patients two or three times after carrying out the operation. This in itself often put a strain on waiting lists at out-patients departments and indeed a strain on the provision of <Col N="554" /> transportation for people in eligible categories back into hospitals to be seen by the consultants.  That often brought about stresses and strains and, as chairman of the health board at the time, I suggested that people should see their own GP as soon as they were discharged from hospital and that if he considered it was necessary to bring that person back into the out-patients department with a consultant in the hospital, that should be the procedure.  That would eliminate waiting lists with people sitting around for hours in queues in hospitals every day.  Strain would not be put on hospital transport services which the health boards were unable to continue to provide.  People in need of hospital transportation are now being debarred from it, particularly in relation to going back to out-patient departments.</P>
    <P>In regard to the statutory instrument before us, if we take it that that income limit is increased it means that PAYE workers will have to pay on a further element of their salary but it does not include a corresponding increase on the hospital services card.  The hospital services card is requested by the surgeons in order to determine whether they can now charge the patient a special fee over and above what is paid to them by the public service for their consultancy work in the hospital, which averages out about £50,000 per annum.  It now indicates to them that there are people in categories over certain income limits who are now required to pay them.  That is why people when they get their P60 have to get a hospital services card.  I today do not know whether the limits are going to be tied or whether they are going to be different.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the public perception of the hospital services card, now that it is pretty useless, because basically it entitles you to none of the things it entitled you to when this Government came to power.  Hospital services cards in the past ensured that people who paid contributions under PAYE and PRSI were covered for all hospital in-patient and out-patients services, including consultants, hospital, nurses, food and every <Col N="555" /> other aspect.  That is what the hospital services card and the PRSI contribution were for but this Government changed all the rules in relation to people's entitlements in hospitals.  It means that people who do not have a medical card but who do have a hospital services card and are under these limits now set by the Minister for the payment of health contributions now have to pay £10 a day for the first seven to ten days.  They have to pay £10 for out-patient visits, which the Minister has referred to in his speech.</P>
    <P>Not alone is the hospital services card becoming completely irrelevant, it is also now being perceived to be an element of double taxation.  The health contribution section of PRSI is taken for one's gross pay, as is PAYE.  Therefore, the health contribution element is now double taxation and those paying it are receiving less for their contributions than they did in the past.</P>
    <P>Whereas Senator O'Connell worries about the Government putting more money into the health services, what we are suggesting from this side of the House is that people who are working and contributing out of their weekly pay packet, people who have no opportunity to evade their health contributions or anything else, are now paying on a larger salary but are getting less for what they are paying.  Not alone are they getting less, but they are faced with major cutbacks in the health services, in the units to which they are asked to go, in the hospital beds and wards in which they need attention, in the hospital surgeries where surgical intervention is required to be carried out as instructed by a consultant.  That is what they are getting simply because there is an increasing amount of money being taken from working people for the service. yet a lower level of service is being provided by this Government.</P>
    <P>If they cannot rationalise this problem to ensure that the service is there for people who pay for it and are entitled to it, then, in regard to health they are shirking their national responsibility to people.  This Government have closed <Col N="556" /> hospitals throughout our region in Munster. They have closed hospitals in Tipperary, Waterford, Limerick, Cork, Kerry, Clare, they have closed them all over the place.  In my town of Tipperary alone Fianna Fáil members of the health board closed the district hospital to which this hospital services card would be applicable and where people could get a service at the lowest sub-acute level. They removed it by one vote proposed by a Fianna Fáil member and in fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we are getting for the increased limits on the health contributions and we do not even know yet what we are getting by way of a hospital services card.  All I am saying is that the availability of the services is beginning to falter.  The Minister for some reason has kept the limits secret from us today, because they were always linked together.  We now do not know at what level a person on PAYE will be asked by the consultant surgeon to pay an additional fee in addition to this money he pays through the tax system. In another place in the Oireachtas they were not allowed to debate this subject. I am going to avail of the opportunity to debate it because this is the House of the Oireachtas where these matters should be debated.</P>
      <P>The public are entitled to know what they are getting for their contributions or indeed when this new demand will be made by consultants for additional income.  This means that more people could be forced into the VHI system. People who are already in that system are complaining to me that, in spite of of having VHI contributions, they are now being asked by some consultants for additional payments over and above all that. otherwise they will not get into a hospital for an operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made statements and I have the right to reply to them.  I am dealing specifically with the items he did raise in his contribution. Unfortunately, the Minister linked them to the Health Contributions (Yearly Reckonable Income) (Variation) Regulations which are before us.  You cannot separate the two.  The Minister mentioned that by raising the limit he now raises the contribution to £200.  I am suggesting that for that £200 people are getting less by way of health services than they did when they paid less.  There is <Col N="558" /> nothing unfair about spelling out the truth in this House or any place else in regard to the serious decline in the health services and the initiation of a two-tier system.  If the Minister has not seen fit to tell us at what limits the consultant services payment comes into play, then surely we are talking about a two-tier system of health care?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <P>Now, Senator, you are well aware that you have gone far wide of the subject matter of the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I did submit to you initially, a Chathaoirligh, that as the Minister had broadened the scope of this debate to cover these aspects it should be appropriate to respond to them, because there is definitely a feeling abroad that, no matter what working-class people pay by way of contribution, under this new variation clause they will not get the service. They are getting less service, but they are being asked to pay more by regulations which the Minister himself referred to. That was the In-patient Hospital Services Charge Regulations of 1984, which imposes a £100 charge on people who do not pay their health contributions but which also charges people on a daily basis even if they are paying these health contributions. That is a change and people know it is a change.</P>
      <P>I know it is embarrassing for the Government to have it repeated that it is a change, but it is a diminution of people's rights in this most important area of health care and what it costs.  We are not talking about the limits for medical cards. You could say that 48 per cent of the population now have medical cards.  We all know how difficult it is to get them: it means that up to 48 per cent of the population are almost in poverty, because now you almost have to be in a poverty trap before you can get a medical card.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not dealing with medical cards.  I want to confine myself specifically to what is here in front of me.  I am suggesting that there is something happening between the relationship of the income limit for consultants and the raising of <Col N="559" /> this ceiling.  The Minister will have an opportunity at the end of the debate to reassure me that my fears are groundless in this regard.  I cannot understand it.  Is there some problem now with consultants that they do not want to be linked to this particular income limit being set by the Department, which, as Senator Fennell said, was sort of index-linked every year? I said initially that we had no objection to that principle.  As a matter of fact, I would advocate that most people should be given the opportunity to pay a health contribution.  It tapers off at a certain limit &mdash; it is now £16,000 &mdash; over which people will be required to have VHI cover.</P>
    <P>I have told the House of the difficulties of people in that category who now cannot even get service at that level because of the closure of beds and the lack of hospitalisation, the lack of consultant services as close as possible to the people.  Surely we are not heading back to the Fitzgerald Report, which advocated the provision of three or four major hospitals in the country where everybody could go if they wanted or else could stay out of them?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, Senator Ferris, if you continue to proceed with the debate as you are going you are going into a general debate on health.  I am as well up in the health field as you are.  In fairness, you have said what you have to say.  If you are going to continue to keep repeating it and if you arrive at the Fitzgerald Report, my blood pressure shoots up.  You will have to confine your remarks or resume your seat.  I feel as strongly as you do about the health service but I have before me what is before me and that is where I have to make my ruling.  If the Minister puts something in the speech that has annoyed you, I am quite sure he is more than capable of answering in his reply.  While your contribution is being made I have to insist that you keep to the motion rather than a general debate. That is why I made my ruling in a less harsh way to Senator Fennell, hoping that this would not develop into a general <Col N="560" /> debate on health services, whether we have or not have them.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about a reference you have just made.  In regard to Senator O'Connell's contribution, I was certain he was on finance. In fact, I let him drift a little because I thought his suggestion was worthwhile for this Seanad perhaps at a later time to take up.  But, so be it.  He did not go off on a general health discussion on our services and all the loopholes in it.  I hate interrupting you Senator, but at the same time I cannot have a general debate on the services, whether they are right or wrong at the moment.  That is all I am asking of you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  I will continue. Regarding the contributions from the self-employed referred to by the Minister where he points to an outstanding deficit at the end of 1988 of £4.6 million owed by the farming community, he suggested that in 1987 that was £5.7 million and he looks upon that as an increased income of £1 million.  I am suggesting that the people included in these draft regulations have no opportunity whatsoever of opting out of their responsibility or of <Col N="561" /> paying at the end of the year or four or five years down the road.</P>
      <P>I acted responsibly when I was involved in a health board until the present Government removed me from that office &mdash; but that does not worry me either; we just carry on regardless.  Irrespective of that, I had meetings with the farming organisations to explain to them the importance of ensuring that their arrears, if any, which they may not have disputed legally or otherwise, should be paid in the overall interest of the health services.  I would say I was responsible for negotiating with the then Minister for Health the provision that the Minister now refers to &mdash; that any money outstanding under these headings could be retained by health boards for the internal revenue of the boards.  I would claim responsibility for having done that, and it was a welcome breakthrough because health boards were at their wit's end to try to maintain the service.  The Department were at their wit's end trying to collect this money refered to in these regulations and trying to distribute it, along with further taxpayers' money, to ensure that the health service continued.</P>
      <P>Farmers did object to the method which the Department had initiated, which was that they would pay health contributions, health levies, youth employment levies and other such levies out of gross income before account was taken of capital investment.  I tried to show that PAYE workers also paid their health contributions and PAYE on their gross income before any deductions were made.  There was also a corresponding equivalent appropriation by the Department of what income should be determined for health contributions. Unfortunately, it was difficult, if not impossible, to convince some farming organisations that this was a fair way and they wanted health contributions to be equivalent to income tax, which is a tax on income, while a health levy is not a tax on income from the point of view of the self-employed; it is a tax in another form, not necessarily on income which is subject to taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that there would be a <Col N="562" /> certain amount of goodwill if it were explained properly to the farming community. I look forward to the day when the outstanding money, if still legally due, will be paid to the health boards to help them overcome some of their problems. The figure is running at about £1 million in the South-Eastern Health Board, and this year they have been told by the Minister that they will have £2.2 million less to spend on health services.  Here we are today increasing income limits to get more money from people and yet there is a smaller allocation in the health estimate for the South-Eastern Health Board.  I am concerned about that as a representative for that area.</P>
    <P>I represent people in that area who are in need and who are bringing to my attention on a daily basis the lack of services provided by the Government.  I would not mind increasing the ceiling if there was a contribution from people in reasonably high income brackets provided that the health services was intact and available.  Whether the Government like it or not, it is true that the health services have degenerated into a two-tier system irrespective of whatever changes are made in the limits for consultant services which the Minister is going to announce.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if discussions are taking place with the consultants about the income limits in respect of people who do not have VHI? If their income is over the limits specified here, or the limits to be announced by the Minister, will they then be faced with bills from consultants?  Those are the questions we want answered.  The Minister has raised these questions today.  I need to be informed, because when I attend my clinic next Saturday what do I tell my constituents &mdash; that the Cathaoirleach would not allow me to ask these questions.  I do not think they would live very long with that kind of attitude.  I need to know and I am entitled to know.</P>

I wish to examine within my area, which is the only thing you have left me to do, a Chathaoirligh, what services are available to the people in the North Western Health Board and, more specifically, in County Donegal.  Like Senator Ferris, my party in County Donegal was ousted from all health boards and from the health committees when they existed.  The net effect was that there was not one Fine Gael representative on the health committee in Donegal, which was a despicable situation, but perhaps not as despicable as the fact that there is no longer a health committee there at all for anybody to make a contribution to.  Had I been on <Col N="564" /> that committee I would have been expressing my concern to the Minister about the situation that exists at present in three places: in the General Hospital in Letterkenny, in St. Conal's Psychiatric Hospital in Letterkenny and in Fanad dispensary.

Assuming that they entitle one to attend the General Hospital in Letterkenny and St. Conal's, what I want to say to the Minister is this: could he give me an assurance in this House or in writing at some future time that Letterkenny General Hospital is not being downgraded?  It would appear to me and to many others that Sligo Hospital is being upgraded to the status of a regional hospital.

      <P>In fairness, and with all the ignorance I may plead, we are talking about a contribution that entitles people or does not entitle them to certain services and we are entitled, therefore, to discuss those services.  There is nothing contrary in what I am doing.  If I disagree with increasing the contributions, as I do, it is only because they do not entitle the people I represent to avail of the services it is suggested are available to them.  The services that this £500 extra limit might make available to other persons in other parts of the country are not available to the people in County Donegal because of the downgrading of Letterkenny General Hospital and the imminent closure of St. Conal's Psychiatric Hospital.  If there is a contribution to be made by somebody living in Fanad Head or Malin Head and if at the end of the day that person has to travel outside Donegal to a hospital in Sligo that is being upgraded, then surely I, as a representative of that area, can put on record my disagreement with that policy.</P>
      <P>We have a situation in Letterkenny General Hospital where wards are closed and people are lying in corridors.  Is that what the contribution entitles one to?  We have a situation where the Chief Executive of the North Western Health Board, Mr. O'Shea, in response to suggestions that the closure of St. Conal's Hospital in Letterkenny was imminent, said no, it was not, because he had not the money to close it.  He had not got the money to close a hospital, he had not got the money to provide a service in the community that would be necessary as a result of the closure of the hospital, despite the fact that it is not yet known with any degree of certainty that community psychiatric service is the appropriate service.  He was saying that if he had the money he would be closing St. Conal's Psychiatric Hospital in Letterkenny.</P>

      <P>The remarks made by Senator John O'Connell were very profound in the sense that he said it was not a question of money alone and that money would not do the job.  I accept that and I understand it.  In regard to the question of the provision of hospital services, I appreciate that the services can vary from one region to another.  It is very likely that if the right type of research were done we might find that somebody died in one particular area which somebody in another area in similar circumstances was saved because the services were properly organised.  I can understand Senator O'Connell's concern as a doctor and as a legislator.  He said something very profound indeed and it opens up the whole question of the health services as a whole being debated.</P>
      <P>If you come into a factory and start closing it down or bringing somebody in to do a hatchet job without examining the consequences or difficulties that may arise, then you can run into all sorts of problems.  I can understand how Senator O'Connell feels and I also understand that we cannot go into a very wide debate on the question of the health contributions. I understand the depth of feeling that arises as a result of the way the health services are being tackled and I understand why people raise these issues, particularly when it affects their own areas.  I accept that the Cathaoirleach must try to keep the debate in order, that the Minister has to present his case and the Senators have to try to argue the question of the health contributions.  We cannot start arguing from the general to the particular point of view in a debate like this and, therefore, I am not going to abuse the privilege.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister whether he considers he has made sufficient advances in getting the arrears that were due under the health contributions since 1966.  As I understand it, the arrears have only been reduced by £1 million since then.  I would like to know how <Col N="568" /> the charge of £150 to people who are in arrears with health contributions is working. Has the Minister got accurate figures on it or is it just a generalisation in his statement that it is working better?  These problems are relevant to the health contributions and do not take away from the argument I made earlier that giving a good service is not all a question of money.</P>

      <P>I would like to be associated with the words of welcome from the Government side of the Oireachtas.  As a Member of the Lower House I would like to say I am delighted to see Senator Paul Sheehy, his wife Molly, and his colleague from Massachusetts. They are very welcome.  I hope they will enjoy St. Patrick's Day and their stay in our great country.  I would like to thank the Senator for all the work he has done for us in the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="569" /> I wish to thank the Senators for their interesting comments during the debate. I will respond to each one separately.  In relation to the general discussion, what we are talking about here is the actual contributions to the health services.  As far as hospital service cards are concerned, we will discuss that again.  I would like to give an example of the relevance of the health services and to be positive for a change.  Quite a number of people tend to be negative.</P>
    <P>I will give you a personal example of how the health services are working for the average person.  On Monday, 13 March my own brother had a serious accident at his home.  He was brought within 30 minutes to our local county hospital in Roscommon.  He was treated extremely well by the consultant surgeon, Mr. Michael Relihan, by the anaesthetist Dr. Maura Casey, by Dr. Slevin, the radiologist, by the radiographers and all the staff who treated him in a proper fashion.  As the situation was serious he was transferred to an orthopaedic hospital yesterday morning and he was operated on today.  He went to Merlin Park Hospital under Mr. Kelly.  He has a hospital service card and he is getting excellent service from the State.  This is the positive side of the health services.</P>
    <P>We always hear the negative side but we are providing a health service second to none.  Nowhere in the world, I believe, is there is a health service equal to what we are providing here in Ireland.  We should be proud of what we have achieved and we should stand up in the Oireachtas and other places to commend those in the health services who are providing such sterling service.  The maximum charge with a hospital service card is £100, that is £10 a day for ten days.  That is the maximum charge that can apply.  If you had the equivalent treatment in the United States you would find that an enormous amount would be required.  That is just a very personal response to some of the points which were made.</P>
    <P>Referring to Senator Fennell, the arrears from the farmers are being collected, if necessary by legal action.  The <Col N="570" /> difficulty is that much of the £4.6 million outstanding refers to very old accounts going back to 1971 in many cases.  Indeed, many of the farmers involved are unfortunately deceased.  I would like to stress, however, that the health boards are making every effort to collect the arrears. It is in their best interests to collect the arrears because we, in Government, have decided to allow all the arrears collected to go towards local health services in each health board area.  I would appeal to those who have outstanding accounts to come forward and make payments.</P>
    <P>Senator John O'Connell raised the question of efficiency, savings and value for money.  The Government are making every effort to encourage innovative, practical and cost-saving initiatives.  The Department's costs containment unit has been studying more effective ways, in liaison with the health boards, in relation to efficiencies and purchases and supplies. Senator O'Connell also raised some general issues regarding the role which the Seanad could play in debating health service issues.  This is a matter primarily for the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris also referred to the health contributions.  The health contributions we are debating here to day do not confer any entitlement whatsoever to services.  They are simply a contribution to the health expenditure.  He also referred to the June 1989 eligibility limits. They were introduced at a later date in June to give employers an opportunity to issue the tax documentation to employees.  This system is for when they apply for hospital services cards.  You must remember also that eligibility limits use a previous year's income and this is a further advantage to a person seeking a hospital service cards allowing for payment of £100 per year maximum for the services in hospital and also £10 for outpatient treatment when required.  We receive excellent service in the public hospitals and again I would like to compliment all the consultants and the staff for providing the services at these hospitals.</P>
    <P>Health contributions will bring in about £113 million in the current year <Col N="571" /> and may form an important element of the health services financing.  Just to elaborate further on that, the post budget non-capital provisions for health is £1,251.4 million.  The budget adjustments account for about £9.1 million made up as follows: £8 million in lieu of income generating measures through increased charges: £1 million to allow a 3 per cent increase in cash allowances to disabled persons etc. with effect from July 1989; £0.1 million towards the agreed restructuring of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.  The Exchequer contribution included in the overall provision amounts to £1,109.9 million and Appropriations-in-Aid account for the remaining £141.5 million.  The provision for health services expressed as a share of total funds for non-capital supply services has increased in 1989 over 1988.  This represents a clear recognition by the Government of the high priority of our public health services.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer provision for capital expenditure in 1989 is £35 million.  The non-capital provision I have just outlined will support a net expenditure of £1,256 million.  When account is taken of local income of £107 million available to the health agencies, the total expenditure of £1,363 million can be generated.  This level of expenditure will allow for the continuation of key services at existing levels and provide for the phased introduction of some major new facilities in the acute hospital areas.</P>
    <P>Senator Loughrey raised many issues some of which I have dealt with already and some which I feel would be more appropriate in some other debate possibly in the Seanad as well.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte spoke in relation to Senator O'Connell's suggestion that it might be appropriate to bring up a wide-ranging debate on the health services in the Seanad.  As I mentioned earlier, the Health Contributions Regulations would not seem to be the appropriate debate because we will not be in a position to respond to all the contributions.</P>
    <P>Every effort is being made by the health boards to collect the arrears and <Col N="572" /> indeed people who are members of health boards can play a role in this.  It is vitally important to ensure that those contributions are made.  Regarding further charges for non-payment, I will not go into much details about that because generally I think I have outlined exactly the situation regarding the collection of funds.</P>
    <P>I could make a very long contribution in relation to the health services but the situation is that this debate is not the opportunity for that and at a later date if these points are raised in a debate we will be in a position to respond.  I commend the motion to the House and seek its acceptance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 31, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to section 6 of the Principal Act which deals with regulations for the purposes of section 4 and section 8 of the Principal Act.  Basically, section 4 deals with the licences for the discharge of trade and sewage effluent into water.  Section 8 deals with appeals against this.  The amendment seeks to provide that section 4(2) of the new Bill would read:</P>
      <P>(2A)  Regulations under this section shall make provision for&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the payment to a local authority of a fee of such amount as may be specified in respect of an application to it for a licence under section 4, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="574" /> (b)  the payment to An Bord Pleanála of a fee of such amount as may be specified in respect of an appeal to it under section 8,</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter of deleting the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substituting the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; arises on many occasions.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used to give the Minister discretion to act or not to act.  I consider it more appropriate that section 4 of the Bill should seek to provide general enabling powers in relation to regulations and the payment of fees for licence applications rather than to impose a rigid obligation on the matters to be addressed by such regulations.  The charging of fees for services is now a normal feature of the public sector.  The provision in the Bill is intended to allow local authorities to offset some of their costs in processing licence applications by charging fees determined and prescribed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Substantial costs may be incurred by local authorities in processing such applications, depending on the nature of the effluent discharge and the complexity of the production costs involved.  I can assure Senators that it would be my intention to bring forward regulations at an early date on the payment of fees to local authorities in respect of licence applications made under section 4 of the Water Pollution Act, 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision regarding the payment of fees for appeals to An Bord Pleanála will similarly tend to offset what can be substantial costs.  In fact, a fee of up to £36 is payable for appeals at present under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Fees Regulations.  The Water Pollution Act specifically making provisions in relation to the payment of fees for appeals, which is provided for under <Col N="575" /> section 4 of the Bill, is intended to consolidate and simplify the statutory basis for the charging of the fees.  Perhaps in those circumstances the Senators might agree to the withdrawal of this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 5, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;Planning permission for developments on sea water within the distance of 3 miles from the nearest shore line shall be required to be obtained from the relevant Planning Authority in whose functional area the said shore line is situated.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident the Minister will have no difficulty in accepting this amendment.  I put it down because I believe it is a matter which should be governed by planning permission.  I have particularly in mind the developments of fish farming cages and other apparatus associated with fish farming.  There should be planning control on this matter because of the danger of pollution of beaches and damage to scenic amenity areas, particularly areas of high scenic amenities like Connemara, and indeed the Minister's own constituency, west Mayo.  The Minister is well aware of one location I have in mind, the beautiful Killary Harbour which divides his constituency from my own. The developments there are, to say the very least, damaging to the scenic amenity. If one travels the road from Letterfrack to Leenane along the beautiful Killary coastline for about three miles, one sees all types of irregular cages, boxes <Col N="576" /> and floats destroying what is probably the most scenic area in Connemara and indeed in Ireland.  We as a county council on either side of Killary have no say in what goes out there because those matters are not subject to planning permission.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to accept this amendment because I believe it would give a guarantee to the planning authorities of the area that no such irregular developments could take place in their area and that those developments could be controlled by the planning laws.  If along that area a farmer wanted to erect a bungalow or a sheep shed he would be subject to planning law regulations.  In fact, from my own experience in that area he would be refused planning permission on scenic amenity grounds.  Yet, anybody driving along that road is naturally looking out on Killary so there is a serious case to be made.</P>
    <P>There are other cases I could mention. Recently a licence has been granted to a fish farm development in Murvey Bay near Roundstone beside Dogs Bay and beautiful beaches in that area.  These projects should be subject to planning permission from the local authority.  The Minister should accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivianOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not entirely clear on the point the Senator is making and whether I should support it or not. Are his comments related to floating objects on the shoreline or are we actually talking about fixtures on the shoreline itself?  Obviously those are entirely different matters because one would be related to county council planning permission and the other would not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to floating objects &mdash; I am open to the direction of the Chair on this &mdash; there is a serious problem in relation to pollution.  I would be concerned with visual pollution rather than pollution of seawater.  Senator McCormack was making the point that it has a visual impact on the landscape.  There is an additional problem of course.  In many parts of the country there are mussel raft developments on a large scale and mariculture development which in their own <Col N="577" /> way are contributing to forms of inshore water pollution not covered in this Bill. As far as I am aware, county councils in the main do not have authority over matters off the shoreline.  The high water mark is not subject in any way to planning permission as is referred to in the motion here.  Senator McCormack's point is very valid, but I do not know if it is covered in this Bill.</P>

      <P>Section 5 amends section 7 of the 1977 Act.  It is a good amendment.  Previously the local authorities could only review licences at a minimum frequency of three years, or otherwise only if licensees agreed to review.  Now local authorities can review a licence at any time, given reasonable grounds for doing so.  The grounds for such a review appear to be very comprehensive but there is apparent drawback. A system of fees is suggested for various types of review, but who pays the fee?  Before a review can be carried out, the fee for it must first be paid.  Therefore, if the licensee is the person to pay the fee and he refuses to do so, then the review cannot be carried out.  Is this correct?  If so, amendment No. 5 (c) needs changing.</P>

That is the thrust of the amendment that is down here. Senator McCormack is concerned about fish farming activities which are carried on at sea and I will be dealing with that in amendment No. 7 which is also proposed by Senator McCormack.  I do not know whether it is appropriate to deal with that now, but it is planning legislation we are talking about and I will deal with it more comprehensively under that <Col N="578" /> section.

I know the Minister may go into the matter more fully under No. 7, but if we wait and lose the amendment by passing on to No. 7 we will be closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. We will have to deal with section 5 now and this amendment.  The Minister says it is a separate matter but I think it is a most reasonable request.  I understand that in Scotland where some of the snags and problems relating to fish farming have been discovered recently, legislation has been introduced whereby planning permission is required for any development within a two to three mile distance of high water mark.  Apart from the scenic amenity I am concerned about it from the point of view of the danger of pollution of beaches and inlets as a result of those developments.  The local authority who will be the body responsible for following up those matters ought also to have responsibility for structures in the sea within that distance from land.  They should also have responsibility for whether or not planning permission would be granted and the conditions that would attach to those and the order in which they would be kept after permission is granted.  From that point of view I cannot lose the amendment now <Col N="579" /> and I am prepared to debate it with the Minister now if it is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the Senator is speaking on his amendment No. 7 about licensing of the type of operation he referred to.  In this amendment to section 5 he is really talking about revising planning legislation which is not appropriate to what we are talking about at all.  Under the question about the amendment dealing with licensing I will talk about that but as far as I am concerned what the Senator is suggesting here is not relevant in so far as planning permission is not an appropriate matter to refer to at this time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>If planning permission or controls of planning can lead to pollution, this is what this Bill is about. I take this as a reasonable opportunity to have every safeguard put into this legislation so that we could have control over any matter on the sea or near the coastline that would be likely to cause pollution. Even though the Minister says he will deal with it in planning legislation I think it is a matter we should include in this Bill and I think it is a reasonable request that we provide in this Bill that those developments would be subject to planning permission.  I put this amendment down so that local authorities would have some control over likely causes of pollution within their areas.</P>

The question is dealt with quite adequately as far as I am concerned under marine legislation, 1980.  It is not appropriate to deal with this matter now in so far as revision of the planning legislation is concerned and in so far as it affects this type of operation to which I presume the Senator is referring, such as fish farming and aquaculture of various kinds.  I must ask the Senator to consider withdrawing that.  We can deal with the question of licensing and the appropriateness of how that is done and the <Col N="580" /> safeguards it provides in regard to pollution &mdash; which I take it is the principal reason the Senator is advancing it anyway &mdash; under existing marine legislation.</P>

I am a member of a local authority and therefore a member of a planning authority and it is not in the control of that planning authority.  The planning authority do not give out licences.  If I felt the matter was dealt with adequately in the marine legislation of 1980 I would not have put down the amendment here nor would I be pursuing it.  This is an opportunity for us if we are serious about guarding against pollution to see that under the legislation planning permission would be required for such developments and that it would have to be obtained from the relevant local authority.  That is the only way in which the local authority or the people of the area can have a say in what developments take place along their shoreline.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say in response to that is that there is sufficient law there to deal with this matter.  In very exceptional cases, I might add, where there is extreme pressure, the Minister could under the Local Government Reorganisation Act, 1985, make an order to extend the maritime jurisdiction of local authorities for certain purposes.  There is no question of needing extra legislation to do so; it is already in place if one were to decide to do it.  There has only been one instance of that to date relating to Bantry Bay.  The law is there if the Minister chooses to use it, if there were exceptional circumstances attached to what he is saying.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that the law is there to protect the interest I am talking about.  If the law is there, is the Minister satisfied with what he sees in the Killary Harbour area as he drives past it?  It is like a battlefield left after a crowd of itinerants had pulled out.  There are all kinds of irregular developments <Col N="581" /> and cages.  There is no doubt at all in my mind apart altogether from the possible pollution aspect that it has destroyed the scenic amenity of a beautiful area.  We as a planning authority on each side of Killary &mdash; the Minister on one side and myself on the other &mdash; have no say whatsoever in what goes out into that bay.  I am asking now that we should have a say in that.  That is a reasonable request to make and I am pursuing my amendment on that ground.</P>

      <P>In page 5, line 29, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These two amendments deal with section 7 of the Principal Act which is concerned with the reviews of licences under section 4 of the Principal Act.  Essentially we are talking about licences for the discharge of traders' sewage effluent into waters. When both amendments are taken together section 5 (a) (2) would read:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act or any condition in a licence under section 4, any such licence shall be reviewed at any time and no later than every three years by the local authority that granted it....</P>

      <P>This is a good amendment.  Previously, the local authorities could review licences at a minimum frequency of three years or otherwise only if licensee agreed to review.  Now the local authority can review licences at any time given reasonable grounds for doing so.  The grounds for such review appear to be very comprehensive but there is an apparent drawback. A system and fees is suggested for various types of review, but who pays the fee?  Before a review can be carried out, the fee must first be paid.  Therefore, if the licensee is the person to pay the fee and if he refuses to do so, then the review cannot be carried out.  Is this correct?  If so, then amendment No. 5 needs changing. Perhaps the Minister might clarify that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate seems to take place on every section where &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; arise, but it is enabling the Minister to have some discretion in the matter because he might not want to proceed for certain reasons.  I will give a good example.  In so far as section (2) (a) is concerned, it might be reasonable to expect &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to apply there in certain circumstances, but if one were to apply it to (b), (c) and (d), then it would be entirely inappropriate to use it because where a material change took place for the better, &ldquo;shall&rdquo; then would make a nonsense of him having to do things he did not want to do.  It would not be right to do it in those circumstances because the material change would have been to the better.  The same might apply in (c). Suppose there was an improvement, why then would the Minister be mandated to do certain things?  He may do it if he so wishes but if it were going in the other direction and it was disimproving, then it would be proper for the Minister or the local authority to act in those circumstances. That is the basic reason for having &ldquo;may&rdquo; inserted in legislation.  It gives discretion to the local authority, or to the Minister, whichever circumstances apply, to do whatever is necessary or proper in the circumstances that exist.  If <Col N="583" /> you think things are disimproving, then a good case is made for having &ldquo;shall&rdquo; but if things improve in certain circumstances, it will make a nonsense of having &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  From a technical point of view that is the basic reason it is worded that way.  Senator O'Shea recognised that in the past and I expect that he would again.  That is the reason I am asking him not to pursue the question in regard to &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>May I respond to a matter raised by Senator de Buitléar in regard to fees?  While detailed consideration has still to be given to the nature of a system of fees for licence review, the intention is that fees would only be introduced to cover situations in which the review has been necessitated by the actions of the person making the effluent discharge into the water, for example, where there has been a material change in the nature of the volume of the discharge or where the licensee applies to have the licence reviewed.  Non-payment of fees should not hinder the review process where it is necessary to review a licence on public health or environmental grounds, and the circumstances in which fees will be payable are expected to be quite limited, for example, cases in which the licensee <Col N="584" /> applies for the review.  I hope that answers the question raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Salmon rearing cages and other aquaculture activities located in the sea are controlled by the Minister for the Marine under the Fisheries Act, 1980. The procedure outlined in the 1980 Act requires the Minister to publicise his intention to make an order designating an area within which it would be lawful to engage in aquaculture in accordance with licences granted by him.  The public may make representations or object to the proposed designation order.  Usually a sworn public inquiry is held and the Minister decides whether to make the order and whether to include all or only part of the area initially proposed on examination of the inquiry report.  The Act allows a period of 28 days after the making of a designation order during which appeals may be made to the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aquaculture licences in respect of specific areas within the designated area are issued by the Minister for the Marine following detailed consideration within his Department, including examination by a special aquaculture licence vetting committee and consultation with other State interests.  Where it is proposed to issue a licence the applicant must give notice in a local newspaper of his intention to engage in aquaculture and indicate that any objections should be submitted within 21 days to the Department of the <Col N="588" /> Marine.  Any objections received are considered before the decision on the licence application is finalised.</P>
    <P>Conditions may be attached to licences, including requirements in relation to fish numbers, monitoring of the operation and its environmental impact and other safeguards.  In view of the legislative controls at the disposal of the Minister for the Marine to deal with salmon rearing enterprises located in the sea I do not consider that it would be appropriate to introduce parallel controls under the Water Pollution Act, 1977. That would be duplication.</P>
    <P>I must also point out that the licence control system available under the 1977 Act is intended to cater for fixed point discharge sources and would not be a suitable mechanism to deal with effluent and other waste arising from salmon rearing activities at sea.</P>
    <P>I must oppose the amendment.  Perhaps that explanation is a good indication of the existing control of licence arrangements, oral hearings and considerations that apply in all these matters.  It does not require to be strengthened at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I had better not refer to what has happened in the past because we have lost that amendment now anyway.  I do not think there would be sufficient control from what the Minister has said.  It is all right to say that areas have to be designated and licensed and that there has to be a period of 28 days in which to allow people to appeal and so on.  We have now established that we have no control in local authority areas. In other words, this is a matter outside the control of local authorities.  In these circumstances and in view of the fact that the other amendment relating to planning permission was not accepted, it would be reasonable to accept this amendment as a little safeguard to the rights involved. It is all right to say that conditions will be laid down as regards controlling the number of fish, monitoring and so on.  In regard to controlling the number of fish, can one go out to the installations and count the number of fish that is in them? <Col N="589" /> This is a vague, difficult area.  Off the Galway coast I know of installations that have far exceeded the limitations placed on them when the licences were granted. As regards monitoring, who is going to carry this out?  Who is responsible for monitoring the situation in those areas to ensure that the developers are not exceeding the guidelines laid down when they got their licences?</P>

      <P>I do not wish to prolong the debate except to say that I would put it to Senator McCormack, in so far as the counting of fish is concerned, that if the Department of the Marine are not able to count the fish in the cage the local authority would hardly be able to do so. In so far as monitoring of cages is concerned, that is a matter for the inspectorate attached to the Department of the Marine.  If one were to pursue the line suggested by Senator McCormack, you would be simply transferring the workings of the system that is in operation to the local authority.  It does not seem a right thing to do as far as I am concerned. Senator McCormack would have to agree that the regulations and the legislation set down in so far as the granting of licences and the whole procedure regarding people's rights and objections are concerned, and right up to court proceedings, if necessary, are to say the least, adequate.  To add another layer would be duplication and therefore I would have to oppose the amendment.</P>

I am not satisfied that the legitimate objections of people are being taken into account when those licences are granted.

      <P>In page 9, subsection (2), line 8, after &ldquo;fine&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;exceeding £250 but&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is a basic principle to all these amendments.  In regard to conviction on summary offences, we are seeking that there would be a minimum fine of 25 per cent.  Regarding the fines on indictment we are seeking that there would be a minimum fine of 10 per cent.  The Minister may be aware that a number of convictions in my own county in Waterford over the past few years have concerned many of us as there have been inconsistencies between the various courts as regards fines.  There was one case in County Waterford where a very large quantity of animal blood was dumped into a feeder river to a water supply and a £100 fine was imposed by the court. Fines like this are soul-destroying for the excellent people in our environmental department of the local authority who try to ensure the highest standards.  When fines of this order are imposed by courts it is likely, I believe that people will continue to commit these offences.  I earnestly request the Minister to take these amendments on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments provide that a person shall be liable on summary conviction of an offence referred to in the sections in question to a fine of not less than £250 and where convicted an indictment to a fine of not less than <Col N="592" /> £2,500.  These amendments would constitute an unwarranted interference with the discretion of the Judiciary to deal with each case on its merits.  I have the greatest confidence in the ability of the Judiciary to apply a sensible sentencing policy when dealing with water pollution offences and feel that the imposition of a mandatory minimum fine in such cases could lead to an unnecessary rigidity in the law.  There will always be exceptional cases where particular mitigating circumstances exist which would justify the imposition of a small or even a nominal fine.  For instance, if a person is convicted of non-compliance with a notice under section 12 of the Principal Act the fact that the person may be able to provide evidence that he has complied substantially with the terms of the notice in the interim between the issue of the summons and the hearing of the case might be such a mitigating factor.  I cannot, therefore, accept these amendments.</P>
      <P>It is also important to relate this to the question of expenses under section 28 where the full cost can be recovered. There are other sections of this legislation that deal as well with the possible amount of money that an individual might or might not have to pay but to tie down the Judiciary in the fashion suggested would be too rigid and would not allow for the exceptional circumstances that might exist.  I would ask the Senator to recognise that.</P>

      <P>I want to be constructive about the Bill.  I acknowledged previously that I believed the Minister was making every effort to get the Bill into the best form possible.  There are four incidents that I am aware of where fines were derisory. Can the Minister give me any encouragement that that type of fine will not continue to be imposed?  I accept that we all have confidence in the Judiciary but I wonder sometimes do members of the Judiciary take such offences seriously enough when imposing fines?</P>

      <P>Section 7 (8) (g) may answer the Senator's questions.  It <Col N="593" /> covers projected losses.  It means that any consequential losses must also be made good.  This might perhaps include losses due to reduced recruitment which would result from mortalities occasioned by the actual discharge.</P>

      <P>The Senator mentioned some cases where he felt the fine was not substantial enough but I would have to draw his attention to other cases.  A recent judgment was given of an 18 month jail sentence in a pollution case in County Cork.  I do not know if the Senator noticed that in the recent past there has been a general increase in the penalties being applied by the Judiciary in matters connected with pollution and environmental matters.  That is an indication from the Judiciary that they, too, recognise the new awareness that is required in so far as environmental protection is concerned.  We have noticed in the Department that the level of penalty being imposed has increased quite substantially. We are making the point that there will be exceptional cases where, for whatever circumstances that exist, it might not be the right thing to do.  In those circumstances we should not tie the hands of the Judiciary in applying their discretion.  It has always been the case that discretion was allowed to the Judiciary in these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that the experience in the Department, viewing the scene nationally, is that the Judiciary are imposing fines or jail sentences more consistently, fines that relate to the offence?  For instance, there were two cases where industrial effluent was released into a bay in my area and two-figure fines were imposed.  The effluent was 1,000 times the level permitted by the licence.  I am concerned that the people who are employed by Waterford County Council, or indeed any county council, to impose standards should have the backing of the court, when they succeed in bringing people before the court, in having these people convicted.</P>

      <P>I think I know the case the <Col N="594" /> Senator is referring to.  I keep an eye on these matters from an environmental point of view.  It has been our experience, particularly over the last year or so, that the general level of penalty imposed by the Judiciary is substantially higher than heretofore.  They had to take notice of the importance of certain aspects of life and they apply measures in accordance with that.  I do not think we should be talking about how the Judiciary apply the penalties available to them under any particular legislation except to say that with environmental matters it appears there is a better understanding of the need to apply severe penalties and that is happening.  I cannot go into individual cases but we are happy that the system is working properly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) the deletion of &lsquo;shall&rsquo; and substitution therefor of &lsquo;may&rsquo; in subsection (2),</P>
      <P>(b) the insertion in subsection (2) of the following paragraph&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(d) require the person to or on whom the notice is served to submit in writing to the Local Authority concerned&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  maps, plans, drawings or photographs showing the location, nature, extent and condition of any facilities for the collection, storage, treatment or disposal of the effluent or other polluting matter and any <Col N="595" /> other premises from which polluting matter may enter water, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  such other particulars as may be specified in the notice of the matters aforesaid, including particulars of the arrangements, systems and methods in use or proposed for the disposal of the effluent or other polluting matter, and of the times and rates at which such disposal is effected.&rsquo;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Both these amendments relate to what I think is a practical problem that arises <i>vis-à-vis</i> sections 12 and 23 of the Principal Act and Statutory Instrument 348-84. Basically what we are seeking to do with the first amendment &mdash; and we are back to &ldquo;shall-may&rdquo; again but on a different basis &mdash; is to change &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to &ldquo;may&rdquo;. The reason is that if this new subsection were included it would remove flexibility from the local authorities in terms of dealing with section 12 notices.  I am giving the Minister's argument in reverse at this stage.  Basically works carried out on foot of a section 12 notice are exempt under the Planning Acts for development under the statutory instrument which I mentioned.  That statutory instrument, I suggest, was brought in for the right reasons: in other words, if there is a pollution problem it would need to be dealt with quickly.  It has been stated to me that some farmers are almost asking local authorities to serve section 12 notices on them so that they are removed from the necessity of applying for planning permission. Basically as the position stands, if a section 12 notice is served on a particular polluter he can carry out works which will satisfy the pollution aspect but which could be aesthetically very damaging to the environment.  That is one aspect.</P>
    <P>The other aspect relates to what we are seeking here.  Under section 12, as distinct from section 23, the local authority may require information from a polluter or a potential polluter and may also look for particulars as to how the polluter intends to deal with the problem; in other words the works that are to be carried <Col N="596" /> out.  As matters stand, if a local authority want to compel a polluter or potential polluter to carry out certain works, a section 12 notice is served.  If the local authority want information regarding the extent or scale of the pollution and details as to how the polluter intends to remedy the problem they must use section 23 to get that information.  If it were all brought together under one section it would mean there would no longer be a need for two managers' orders for two separate notices.  This gives rise to certain legal difficulties.  I would suggest it would be much more straightforward and reasonable for a local authority, under a section 12 notice, to compel somebody to do something but give him reasonable time to come back with information and detailed plans as to how a certain problem is going to be dealt with.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on this item.</P>

      <P>The deletion of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and the substitution of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; could weaken the Principal Act, in my opinion.  The amendment is a good one in section 9.  It strengthens the power of the local authority to regulate or restrict the disposal of polluting matter on lands where such disposal could result in entry of polluting matters to waters.  It is open for the recipient of a section 12 notice to make representation to the local authority in respect of the notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The quick answer to the Senator on that matter is that the things that need to be done following the issue of a section 12 notice, such as structures for the making or storage of silage and similarly, provision for effluent discharge are exempted.  There are a whole range of other activities which are exempted as matters stand in regard to planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The statutory instrument which was introduced in 1984 exempts all development in compliance with a section 12 notice.  That is the basic point I am making.  The statutory instrument relates to the Planning Acts.  I am pointing out that a problem arises for local authorities in that something that may <Col N="597" /> satisfy conditions from the polluting aspect may be aesthetically unacceptable from a planning point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The planning authority controls all that.  How does the Senator see that as a difficulty?  Is he worried that it might not be acceptable aesthetically?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a separate issue to the amendment but I am making that point because I think it is relevant.  The local authority have not got jurisdiction over what the polluter does.  A certain type of tank is seen by the sanitary authority as solving the problem but as regards the structure &mdash; the local authority have no say in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether I follow the Senator exactly.  When a section 12 notice is issued to somebody it means that they are at fault in some way and they have to carry out remedial works.  Those remedial works are exempted development.  Those agriculture things I mentioned and a lot of other operations are exempted development, but, under the principal Act, the notice that issues from the local authority can specify the measures so that the control is there already with the local authority in the specification of what has to be done under the principal Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was it necessary to bring in a statutory instrument in 1984 to exempt works carried out on foot of a section 12 notice from the planning laws?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be the normal practice in so far as agricultural developments are concerned within the curtilage of the property attached to the development &mdash; it was exempted development. That is included in a planning situation as it now exists.  If you want to change that you are talking about an entirely different matter.  What we are talking about is that those items that are going to be put in place under section 12 notice are specified by the local authority and because of their exemption they do not <Col N="598" /> require planning permission.  I agree that some of them might be ugly looking but not all agricultural buildings would be the subject of oil paintings.  We are talking about farm development and farming activities.  I do not see why the Senator is pursuing this now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only for this reason. Say a certain type of tank is designated. That may be overground or underground or it could be overground in a scenic area and interfere with the scenic quality of an area.  Developments under this section should be subject to the planning Acts but that is something the Minister can do without legislation by rescinding the statutory instrument of 1984 under the planning Acts.  That is not directly related to the amendment and I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is as simple as this: the Senator is worried that if certain remedial works are carried out they might not be aesthetically beautiful in high amenity areas.  The authority can adjust their attitude to that in that they control the specified remedial works they are asking to be carried out under the order.  They can say what is to be done so they could take the Senator's point into account.  The local authority would have the authority to adjust the order to make sure that the work was aesthetically acceptable in particular areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to labour this but under the section 12 notice what goes out would be a technical solution to a pollution problem whereas it cannot deal with an aesthetic problem because it is exempted from the planning Acts.  I do not accept we are splitting hairs.  This is the real problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The real problem is the control of effluent and what I am saying is that when a section 12 notice issues it is to deal with the pollution problem that might come from the bad usage of effluent or the way it is treated.  We can demand that certain things be done in certain circumstances and those items are, because of what you say, exempted <Col N="599" /> development.  I suggest that it is much more important to have the remedial works put in place and remove the pollution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>

So, what is the problem?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator O'Shea's problem is that quite often section 12 is used as in a crisis situation and as a consequence of that, aesthetic considerations are not borne in mind. The Minister's point is equally valid when he says that it is up to the local authorities to ensure that they are borne in mind. The Minister should be aware that certain farmers in sensitive areas deliberately provoke use of section 12 so that they are automatically exempt.  I have seen that happen in a few places and in my own area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments deal with a problem that could arise regarding payments under paragraph (b) of this section.  I <Col N="602" /> would be very concerned that there would be regulations laid down by the Minister which would ensure that the payments did not vary from local authority to local authority.  What we are talking about here is discharge of trade effluent into sewers.  For instance, if one local authority decided to drop its payment by way of attracting industry into its area and another local authority that was going along more willingly with the whole spirit of this legislation was at a higher level of payment, the attractiveness of one area versus another for a potential industry could be affected.  So, I believe in the interests of achieving the objectives of the Bill, uniformity of these payments between local authorities is desirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a wide variety in the nature of discharges to sewers and in the degree of treatment undertaken by sanitary authorities.  I suggest that it would not be feasible to make regulations which would provide for the determination of payments in respect of all the discharges in the country.  It is my intention, however, to issue guidelines to local authorities on the manner in which such payments should be calculated, taking account of the variations that might be involved from one area to another.  It should be remembered that any payment specified by a sanitary authority will form a condition of the licence issued under section 16 of the principal Act and accordingly may be appealed to An Bord Pleanála; that is already in place.  Therefore, it is reasonable to ask that the Senator would not press the amendment.</P>

      <P>In relation to the Minister's response, I would hope that we are not at variance on the point we are discussing.  I made a point earlier <Col N="603" /> in the debate that when the Minister is considering introducing specific categories he should be particularly mindful of hospital effluent discharge.  This is a problem that has not been addressed specifically in the Bill for obvious reasons.  It is a particularly offensive area that has not been addressed at all.  Either a county council can be empowered to treat the sewer on behalf of the health board or the health board itself could be obliged to treat the effluent emitted from a hospital into a sewer because it might have particularly damaging effects on maricultural industry in towns where there are hospitals.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 17, before section 17, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;17.&mdash;Section 22 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (2):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(3) The results of all monitoring under subsection (1) (a) and all information collected under subsection (1) (b) shall be available for inspection and copying by any member of the public who so wishes.&rsquo;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to section 22 of the Principal Act which relates to monitoring by local authorities and sanitary authorities.  It seeks to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;(3) The results of all monitoring <Col N="605" /> under subsection (1) (a) and all information collected under subsection (1) (b) shall be available for inspection and copying by any member of the public who so wishes.&rsquo;&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can identify with Senator O'Shea's effort to ensure a greater openness &mdash; that is what is involved here &mdash; in relation to data gathered by official agencies of the State on the state of our waters and the nature of discharges which affect them.  I also appreciate his concern to secure public access to that data.</P>
      <P>The Senator will probably be aware of the extent to which the public already have access to applications for effluent discharge licences and to the registers of licences issued which are maintained by the local authorities.  Provisions in this regard are already contained in the Water Pollution Act, 1977, and in regulations made under the Act in 1978.  I am committed to securing greater openness on environmental matters generally.  This is essential if public authorities are to enjoy the confidence of the general public in the performance of their pollution control functions and if the efforts of Government to tackle issues of global concern are to be understood clearly by the public and supported by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of water quality data, I made specific provisions for public inspections of monitoring results in regulations I made last year, setting quality standards for bathing waters and for designated rivers capable of supporting salmon, trout and other fresh water fish. Extensive monitoring data used in the compilation of the most recent review of water quality in Ireland was published for the first time in 1987.  I intend that this practice will be continued when future national reviews are completed at three to four year intervals by the environmental research unit at my Department. I am concerned to ensure that the right of public access to data on the environment is catered for through comprehensive legislation rather than tackling it in a piecemeal manner in a <Col N="606" /> series of individual Acts dealing with particular aspects such as water, air, waste etc.</P>
    <P>This legislation should reflect the complexity of the issues involved and strike the right balance between public right and the safeguards needed to restrict access to commercially sensitive data, production methods and other matters which, if revealed, could threaten the viability of the enterprise or aid its competitor. I would urge the Senators &mdash; and particularly Senator O'Shea &mdash; to withdraw the amendment in favour of a more comprehensive approach to the matter along the lines I have outlined and which I intend to pursue.  It is a sensitive area &mdash; trying to get the balance that is necessary, giving the right amount of information, the openness that is needed in environment, and at the same time being conscious of the sensitivity in certain commercial sectors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I accept that it is a sensitive area but it is also a sensitive area for the public and I would support the idea of the right of public access to data and monitoring results.  As the Minister has said so many times today, there is a great public awareness now of the dangers and seriousness of pollution and much of the anxieties and fears are because people do not exactly know what is going on.  There is the lack of knowledge in those areas.  Anything that could open up that to the public and allay their fears would be better than a partly guarded secrecy.  Let us not be seen as trying to hide anything if there is anything to be hidden.  I urge the acceptance of this amendment because the worst thing is for people not to know what is going on as regards the possible pollution of the waterways and the water around them. If they knew the facts it would not be such a speculative and secretive area and people would not be so fearful.</P>

      <P>I would just like to express my appreciation of the Minister's commitment to being open; that in itself is very welcome.  We have to try to strike a balance here because too often I found <Col N="607" /> that the environmental lobby &mdash; and I have great admiration for a lot of the things they do &mdash; tend to hit local authorities over the head for this alleged closed door attitude which I could never find and I am a member of a local authority for 17 or 18 years.  They keep saying they do not have access to all the facts.  I cannot accept that except in the case where the individual rights of companies or indeed of privately owned companies who also have significant rights in these areas must be protected.  Any industrialist who is acting through the IDA is acutely aware of the need to jealously guard their industrial secrets and, as a consequence, this balance has to be struck.</P>
      <P>I think this Minister particularly has a great desire to be open because we do not have anything to hide, either the Government or local authorities.  Where water quality management studies are done they are available at county council meetings for the whole world to see.  As I said, sometimes it is convenient for people in this particular lobby to say: &ldquo;We do not have access&rdquo; or &ldquo;We have no confidence in the local authorities&rdquo; or &ldquo;Their environmental staff are incompetent,&rdquo; complaints which we hear regularly at public meetings.  Quite often their desire for information is insatiable, quite often for information that is not available to anybody, I suspect.  I think there is evidence in this Administration of willingness to let some fresh air into this particular debate.  That is very welcome and the Minister's attitude here today is indeed welcome.</P>

      <P>I would like to support this amendment which is excellent. It closes many gaps and extends the powers of the local authority to cover in addition to abstraction of water from and discharges of polluting matter to waters, custody or control of polluting matter and activities or practices which may cause or permit polluting matter to enter waters. The local authorities can now, by written notice, demand all relevant information in relation to work practices or activities. <Col N="608" /> Prior to this, discharge had actually to be entering waters; now actual entry is not necessary.  The provisions are very extensive and they even cover photographs showing conditions of facilities for collection, storage etc. of polluting matter, maps, plans and location of premises which includes lands from which polluting matter may enter waters; methods for disposal, times and rates of disposal, etc.  This can be seen on pages 17 and 18 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>There is just one point I would like to put to the Minister and that is rather than having records available to everybody at this stage I suggest replacing &ldquo;any member of the public who so wishes&rdquo; with &ldquo;authorised persons at all reasonable times.&rdquo;  Instead of having &ldquo;any member of the public who so wishes&rdquo; it would read &ldquo;authorised persons at all reasonable times.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In page 18, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) Notwithstanding anything contained in subsection (1) the Minister shall, by 31st December, 1990, prescribe quality standards for sewage effluents and standards in relation to the treatment of such effluents.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to section 26 of the Principal Act which deals with the quality standards of sewage effluent.  I think the amendment is self-explanatory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Work within the Department on the preparation of quality standards for selected sewage effluents throughout the country is well underway and it is envisaged that regulations setting standards for these discharges will be made in the near future.  However, this amendment would commit me to prescribing quality and treatment standards for all sewage effluents in the country by the end of 1990.  This would, of necessity, involve a massive investment in treatment works for which the financial resources are not available at this time. We would like, of course, to provide the best possible treatment for all sewage discharges today or not later than tomorrow, if it were feasible, but, unfortunately, it is not feasible.  Much progress has been made in providing improved treatment for sewage discharges in recent years.</P>
      <P>Since 1980 it is interesting to note nearly £300 million has been invested by local authorities for this purpose using finance made available by my Department and, as a result, considerable progress has been made in eliminating pollution blackspots.  This programme of action to tackle pollution from municipal sources has borne results.  Water quality surveys show a significant reduction in serious pollution of rivers and streams since 1971 and much of this reduction is directly linked to the investment that has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1989 over £62 million is being provided for the sanitary services capital programme. This provision will allow us to fund work in progress, including some important pollution abatement schemes, as well as giving sufficient scope to approve new urgently-needed schemes. In deciding on schemes to go to construction in this and in the coming years, the House may be assured that due weight will be given to the importance of building on the progress already made and ensuring that the local authorities are enabled to play their full part in the drive against water pollution.  It should also be remembered that while sanitary authority sewers are exempted from the provisions of the Water Pollution Act, 1977, <Col N="610" /> the sanitary authority in question can be prosecuted by the fishery boards if discharges from a sewer are causing pollution. That is a big change and Senators might like to note that.</P>

      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister's commitment in this area because obviously the financial commitment is proof positive of commitment. I would like to say &mdash; and it was in the Minister's original speech when the Bill was introduced &mdash; in commenting on the various areas that were subject to grant contribution right through the eighties, the common denominator in all cases is the fact that they were virtually exclusively inland towns.  While it is obvious that the blackspots would primarily be in inland towns, I would ask the Minister in his review to be conscious, as I am sure he is, of the serious impact that is equally in evidence in coastal towns.  There is a feeling abroad sometimes that because a municipal sewer is going into Bantry Bay or Killary Harbour or wherever that the sewage is put away.  It is not, of course, tragically, it is deposited on the shoreline quite often.  I am sure the Minister is aware of this and, while he would obviously be preoccupied up to now with the removal of blackspots in inland towns &mdash; certainly in my own county a major advance has been made in a number of inland towns such as Fermoy &mdash; I would appeal to him to be conscious of the impact it is also making in the coastal towns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Senator to be assured that I am conscious of that but he will appreciate that the enormous sum of money that has been spent since 1981 had to concentrate on the pollution blackspots where the effluent was being discharged, often raw, into receiving waters that did not have the capacity to carry it. We had to eliminate that area of pollution first.  I am more and more turning my mind to the seaside towns which because of their tourist involvement have enormous intake of people at certain times of the year and the results are not happy from a pollution point of view.  We are <Col N="611" /> doing something about that now.  You will be aware of the capital expenditure that will be going on so far as Dublin Bay is concerned and there are some other locations around the country as well. More and more I am increasing my attention to that element, now that we have carried out such a major capital investment programme on the inland towns in so far as the rivers inland are concerned.</P>

      <P>This is a new section.  The term &ldquo;combined drain&rdquo; should be clearly defined.  It must be assumed because of the statements in the Explanatory Memorandum, pages 6 and 7, that the combined drain does not contain water or otherwise each discharge could be licensed under section 4 for discharge to waters.  It is implied that in a combined drain the two trade effluents will combine before discharge to waters. It is stated that difficulties may arise in identifying the person responsible for breaches in conditions attached to the licence issued in respect of the combined effluent discharged from the drain.  It is contended that by declaring the combined drain to be a sewer then individual licences can be issued under section 16. However, it must be stated that this will not make the individual licences any easier to enforce.  There is a big danger here that too many channels will be described as combined drains and, therefore, may become open or piped sewers.</P>

      <P>We inserted this good defence provision at the request of the Department of the Marine.  They wanted the modified good defence provision to be inserted in section 3 of the water pollution legislation.  It is being applied to the offences under section 171 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, section 25 (2) and that will achieve this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To avail of the good defence it will be necessary for the accused to prove to the satisfaction of the court that he could not reasonably have foreseen that the act or omission concerned might cause or permit deleterious matter to fall into any waters.  The application of the good defence provision to section 171 offences will secure a greater degree of uniformity in relation to water pollution offences under fishery and local government legislation. Public understanding of pollution controls and offences should be improved and more equitable enforcement of the legislation should be achieved by the change.  In view of the limitations on the situations in which the new good defence provision may be availed of, the ability of fishery boards to tackle pollution under <Col N="615" /> the 1959 Act will not be impaired in any way in practice.</P>
    <P>A good defence mechanism is already available under the Fisheries (Consoliation) Act, 1959, in the case of offences under section 172 of that Act. The offences concerned involve the failure of the owner of a receptacle for storing deleterious matter which is located within 30 yards of any waters to provide and maintain such means as will effectively prevent the passage of any of the matter from the receptacle into the waters.  Owners of such receptacles may apply to the Minister for the Marine for a certificate recognising that suitable means have been provided to maintain the receptacle and to prevent pollution. In the event of owners failing to provide and maintain such receptacles, the charges will be dismissed where current certificates are produced.  We are doing this in co-operation with the Department of the Marine, who sought these necessary adjustments.</P>

I agree that it is unlikely, but there could be the occasional situation where one would leave it to the other and as a consequence the polluter escapes.</P>

      <P>The experience has not been that way.  The number of prosecutions promoted by local authorities has increased dramatically, happily so. However, I would like to foresee a day when there would be no prosecutions at all &mdash; but for the right reasons, of course. In the meantime until such time as everybody understands and appreciates that the environment will be protected not just by enforcement but by education &mdash; unfortunately until sufficiently educated people understand precisely what has to be done &mdash; the enforcement element has to be there.  We find now that local authorities are acting, perhaps, because they are benefiting from it in some way by the fines and penalties.  I would rather that that was not the only reason, but it is an incentive in some ways and the number of prosecutions has increased dramatically.  There is quite a good bit of co-ordination between the fisheries boards and the county councils in these matters.  I am satisfied that this will address the problem we all wish to see remedied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill represents the most radical initiative as regards safety and health at work since the foundation of the State. Its purpose is to put in place a comprehensive new approach to safety and health at work.  It reflects the needs of our working populations at this stage of our development and is in keeping with our membership of the European Community. It has one clear objective &mdash; to help reduce accidents and ill health at work and thus reduce both human loss and suffering and the heavy financial associated costs.  It will provide a sound <Col N="619" /> basis where employers, workers and the self-employed can solve their problems in a spirit of co-operation, with the support and guidance of the State.  The primary responsibility will, however, remain with those who sponsor enterprise and manage the workplace.  The new legislation will apply to all persons engaged in work activities of any description, whether those persons are employees, employers or the self-employed.  This is in line with Article 45.4.2 of the Constitution which requires the State &ldquo;to endeavour to ensure that the strength and health of workers shall not be abused&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Bill fulfils an important commitment by the Government in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  It follows closely the main recommendations of the Barrington Commission of Inquiry on Safety, Health and Welfare at Work, on which both sides of industry as well as Government were represented.</P>
      <P>The Bill has been drafted following extensive consultation with the two sides of industry on the Interim Board for Occupational Safety and Health.  I can, with confidence, say that there is overall acceptance of the legislation among those to whom it will apply.</P>
      <P>The Barrington Commission's examination of occupational safety and health was the first such comprehensive study conducted in Ireland.  Its investigations were timely, coinciding with a period of rapid and sustained technological change at the place of work.  The commission found that existing safety legislation was severely limited both in its scope and in its ability to help overcome the safety and health hazards which can arise in the modern workplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is not intended solely as an extension to existing statute law on safety and health.  The Barrington Commission itself queried whether safety and health could be advanced by an excessive reliance on detailed and increasingly complex regulations imposed from outside the workplace.  It accepted, of course, that the law has a role to play but considered that its success depends on a clear recognition by employers, workers, <Col N="620" /> the self-employed and others of their various responsibilities.</P>
    <P>We must accept that, in our society, those who create and manage risks at the workplace are in the best position to take appropriate preventive action.  This can only be achieved where safety and health issues are accorded equal priority with other aspects of the firm's activities.</P>
    <P>Occupational safety and health considerations must, therefore, permeate the whole operational strategy.  The essential elements of this approach are the provision of a safe place of work, safe plant and equipment, a safe system of work and adequately trained and informed personnel who are conscious of the safety risks and the methods of prevention.  The role of the State should be to provide necessary supervision and give support through advice and guidance. This is the fundamental philosophy on which the present Bill is based.</P>
    <P>The legislation is designed to encourage consultation and dialogue at the workplace on relevant safety and health matters.  Consultation and consensus at national level is also a key feature of the Bill.  This will take place through the new National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health, which I will describe later.  It has long been the policy of my Department to promote dialogue between employers' and workers' organisations and other bodies involved in safety and health.  I accept, however, the validity of the Barrington Commission's comments that such consultation may in some instances have been limited as those bodies would be reacting to proposals which had developed in a fairly final form.  Under the new system the social partners, through their involvement in the national Authority, will have a direct input into planning and policy at the highest level from the earliest stage.  I am confident that the spirit of positive co-operation which was evident in both the Barrington Commission and the interim board will manifest itself also in the Authority's operations.</P>
    <P>Our present system of occupational safety and health is geared almost exclusively to factories, mines and quarries and <Col N="621" /> the construction sector.  It covers about 20 per cent of the workforce.  The commission was concerned that areas such as agriculture, forestry, fishing, transport, laboratories and hospitals were not covered.  Also many self-employed persons in construction, commerce, agriculture, forestry and fishing were outside the system.  The commission argued that the new system should, as a matter of principle, cover all workers.</P>
    <P>It is now a feature of our manpower programmes to find persons undergoing training for employment or work experience working alongside employed persons to gain experience and learn essential skills.  Young persons undergoing such training can be particularly vulnerable, given their lack of familiarity with the world of work.  Special provision is made, therefore, to treat them as employees for the purposes of safety and health protection while they are in the workplace.</P>
    <P>The Bill acknowledges that primary responsibility for safety and health rests with the enterprise.  It provides effectively also for the allocation of responsibilities for aspects of safety and health within the hierarchy of the enterprise. The employer has an obligation to provide necessary supervision and to name in the safety statement those persons responsible for performing tasks related to safety and health.</P>
    <P>The growth in the area of subcontracting in many sectors of employment can lead to a degree of confusion as to responsibility for particular accidents or diseases in the workplace.  It could very well be inappropriate to require by law that one or other employer in that situation be held legally responsible overall for all workers in a particular place of work.  While each employer will carry a responsibility in the matter, the requirements in the Bill inevitably mean that the interests of other workers close by must be taken into account.  Ultimately, the courts are in the best position, having had access to the facts in each particular case, to decide which employer is responsible if an accident or disease occurs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="622" /> Owing to the limited scope of the existing legal system overall data is not available on occupational accidents generally, whether fatal or non-fatal.  An indication of the extent of the problem, however, may be got from the limited data available. For example, the total number of accidents reported to my Department in respect of factories, construction sites and mines and quarries is still over 3,000 per year.  These do not include accidents resulting in less than three day's absence from work.  In the case of the 80 per cent of occupations outside the scope of existing legislation there are no reliable statistics to show the number of accidents occurring annually.</P>
    <P>In the agricultural sector, while there are no figures available on the total number of accidents at work, a recent survey concluded that there may be as many as three farming deaths for every fatality in industry.  Non-fatal injuries on farms are comparable with those in all other industries even though there are fewer workers in farming.  Another source of data is the occupational injuries benefit scheme which receives claims in respect of occupational injury or disease at the rate of about 16,000 per year.</P>
    <P>In addition to the serious consequences which accidents at work can have in human terms for the victims and their dependants, they also give rise to heavy financial costs for the individual, the enterprise and the economy as a whole. They can seriously impair the individual's earning capacity and employment potential as well as the quality of his or her life. They can lead to lost production, lost orders and increased longer-term operational costs.  They result in a serious drain on public expenditure through the occupational injuries benefits fund.  They have a direct bearing on the cost of employers' liability insurance cover.  The Barrington Commission drew attention to the widely expressed concern about insurance compensation costs.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> recognised that the enactment of this Bill and its enforcement could facilitate reductions in employers' liability insurance costs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="623" /> The social dimension necessary to achieve a single European market by 1992 means that many of our activities and policies on safety and health are influenced by European Community Directives and developments.  The creation of the single European market will provide an enormous opportunity for economic development provided that we are properly prepared for it.</P>
    <P>While much of the focus of the single market is the elimination throughout member states of various restrictions which up to now acted as barriers to trade, the Council of Ministers places particular emphasis also on the social dimension.  The European Commission has proposed a number of new directives aimed at protecting the safety and health of workers in the context of increasing economic activity.  Our existing safety and health legislation is inadequate to implement many of the European Community proposals as they stand. However, the Bill provides a basis for meeting many of the requirements of those proposals.</P>
    <P>Unlike existing safety and health legislation which tends to deal with detailed specific requirements, this Bill sets out broad general duties of care for all employers, employees and the self-employed. Broadly speaking, those general duties of care involve the provision of a safe place of work, safe plant and equipment and safe system of work. Other requirements include giving those at risk adequate training and information about the relevant hazards and the steps taken to deal with them.</P>
    <P>The Bill also places broad general duties of care on those who design, manufacture, import, supply, install etc., articles or substances for use at work.  A legal framework is provided in the Bill for elaborating on the general requirements, where necessary, by way of codes of practice or by regulations to be made by the Minister.  It will be for the Authority to make proposals to the Minister in this regard, having consulted with both sides of industry.</P>
    <P>The Fourth Schedule to the Bill lists in <Col N="624" /> detail the issues which may be the subject of regulations.  For example, the Authority may recognise a need to provide detailed regulations in relation to the health hazards presented by toxic substances.</P>
    <P>In addition to the general duties placed on employers, employees, the self-employed etc., the Bill also contains other key provisions.  These are provisions relating to safety statements, consultations between workers and employers at the place of work, on safety and health matters and the establishment of a National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health.</P>
    <P>Section 12 is an important provision which requires employers to draw up safety statements based on identification of risks in the workplace and the necessary preventive measures.  The Authority will provide more detailed guidance on safety statements in due course.</P>
    <P>Section 13, which provides for consultation at the place of work, will require employers to consult their employees on matters relating to safety, health and welfare. Employees will have the right to choose the type of consultative mechanism best suited for those purposes.  The Bill specifically enables employees to appoint safety representatives to represent them in consultations with their employer and to carry out a range of other functions provided for in the Bill including the carrying out of inspections and the investigation of accidents and dangerous occurrences at the place of work.</P>
    <P>As regards the consultative mechanisms necessary, the Bill allows for a flexible approach which can be adapted by codes of practice or by regulation for particular sectors of employment.  This approach is more suited to the special characteristics and needs of each particular place of work than was possible, for example, under the corresponding provisions of the Safety in Industry Acts.  Adequate consultation between employers and workers is a key feature of the new system.  The Barrington Commission said that the rigid prescription in <Col N="625" /> the Safety in Industry Acts as regards the size and type of safety committees required could discourage effective dialogue. I believe that the formula provided for in this Bill meets those criticisms.  I would stress, however, that existing safety committees established under the Safety in Industry Acts which function adequately to the satisfaction of the employer and the workers may be endorsed by the Authority as complying with the formula set out in the Bill.  I know that much good work has been carried out in recent years as regards training in the operation of safety committees and the Bill is not intended to undermine those where they are operating satisfactorily and meeting the consultative needs of both workers and employers.</P>
    <P>While the Bill is directed primarily towards employers, employees and the self-employed, it also provides for the safety and health of non-employees affected by work activities.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not cover matters such as general environmental issues, which are properly the responsibility of other Government Departments and institutions.</P>
    <P>It will however have some important applications such as, for instance, in school or university laboratories or in places where young persons help out employers without being employed by them.  In general, however, the Authority being established under the Bill will be expected to concentrate its efforts in the area of worker protection.  In areas where the predominant risk is to the public, it would not be for the Authority to be involved in safeguarding the public against that risk.</P>
    <P>At national level, one of the major changes under the Bill will be the establishment of a National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health.  The Authority will have a clear, identifiable and undisputed responsibility for issues relating to occupational safety and health at all places of work.  It will be responsible for the general administration of the new system and it will be required to provide advice and information for employers <Col N="626" /> and workers to assist them in meeting their obligations.</P>
    <P>The Barrington Commission was very clear in its report that the new system of safety and health, in which a major responsibility would be shared by both sides of industry, depended on the establishment of a tripartite body with executive powers and power to recruit its own staff.  The Authority, accordingly, will be a State-sponsored body.  The board will have a chairman, three employers' representatives, three workers' representatives and four representatives of the State or other appropriate bodies.</P>
    <P>The structure of the board of the Authority gives employers' and workers' representatives a major share in responsibility for the development and implementation of overall policy on safety and health at work at national level.  I intend making provision in due course for employee participation at subboard level in the Authority, in line with the provisions applying to a large number of State bodies under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1988.</P>
    <P>It will be essential for the Authority in developing its policies to be able to avail of the advice of advisory committees representatives of sectoral and other expert interests.  The committees will provide an advisory mechanism through which the Authority can obtain the valuable input of many organisations which have expressed a wish to contribute to the evolution of occupational safety and health arrangements.</P>
    <P>Given the responsibilities to be allocated to the Authority in terms of developing safety and health policy and its enforcement, I concur with the Barrington Commission's conclusion that it should have independent control over its own staff.  The Authority will, therefore, be able to recruit its own staff subject to the usual controls that apply in the case of public sector bodies.  Initially the Authority will be staffed by civil servants designated by the Minister for Labour for employment by the Authority.  The Bill contains the usual provisions regarding preservation of pay and conditions of employment of transferred civil servants.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="627" /> The Authority will be financed by the Exchequer and it will be subject to all the standards accounting and reporting controls that apply to public sector bodies.</P>
    <P>The Authority will have overall responsibility for enforcing the new legislation and the existing enactments on safety and health.  However, other bodies such as local authorities may be prescribed in regulations under the Bill as &ldquo;enforcing agencies&rdquo; to enforce the provisions in lieu of the Authority in specified cases or areas.  In such cases, it will be for the Authority in the first instance to examine the matter and to make proposals to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Inspectors of the Authority and enforcing agencies will have a standard set of general enforcement powers under the legislation, such as the power to enter places of work and to carry out examinations at the place of work of articles and substances found there.  Those powers largely reflect the powers currently exercised by industrial inspectors under the existing safety enactments. Some modifications and additional general powers are, however, incorporated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for a range of new or modified specific enforcement measures which may be used by inspectors, including improvement directions and plans, improvement notices and prohibition notices.</P>
    <P>Where these enforcement measures do not have the desired effect or where there are serious or persistent contraventions of the legislation, it is essential to be able to prosecute.  The Bill provides for a comprehensive range of offences which may be tried either summarily or on indictment.  The Bill provides for a range of penalties which are designed to act as real deterrents.  Many offences under the Bill are liable to attract fines of up to £1,000 on summary conviction in the District Court.</P>
    <P>As amended in the Dáil, the Bill leaves unspecified the level of fine which may be imposed on conviction on indictment. It will be for the courts, therefore, to <Col N="628" /> decide the level of fine having regard to the circumstances of the cases before them.  For a limited number of offences, including breach of a prohibition notice, a person convicted on indictment may be liable, together with or instead of a fine, to imprisonment for up to two years.</P>
    <P>The existing enactments of safety and health at work, including the Safety in Industry Acts, the Mines and Quarries Act and their Regulations, will initially stay in place alongside the general provisions of the Bill.  However, certain provisions of those enactments will be repealed automatically as corresponding provisions of the Bill are brought into operation in order to avoid overlapping or duplication.  The Authority will be obliged to keep existing legislation under review and the remaining provisions of those enactments, based on recommendations of the Authority, may be repealed as necessary over a period of time by order of the Minister under the Bill and may be replaced by regulations and/or codes of practice under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Ensuring safety and health at work does not, of necessity, involve great expenditure.  Analysis of the accidents in industry reported to my Department indicate that many are due to such factors as objects or persons falling, the handling of equipment or goods and people stepping on or hitting objects.  The elimination of these risks is not necessarily expensive and may not call for protective equipment and devices.  Indeed, reduction of accidents may itself reduce workplace costs.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that most low technology accidents can be eliminated if a clear priority is given to safety and health in the workplace, if there is better training and supervision, if good housekeeping practices are followed, and if the hazards are identified and the necessary information given to workers through the consultative process.  Above all, employers must not believe that accidents are inevitable or that they are caused by careless or accident-prone workers.  They must recognise that most often accidents are a human rather than a technical problem and that efforts by <Col N="629" /> them, as employers, to train their workers about how to deal with workplace hazards will be rewarded by a reduction in accidents.</P>
    <P>The Barrington Commission made it clear that, at the level of the State, the large task of ensuring the safety and health of all workers will have to be tackled on a phased basis.  The new Authority will need to decide its strategy for achieving this and to make proposals as regards its resource needs.  The Government will consider those proposals from the standpoint of seeking to achieve, efficiently and effectively, the objectives of this legislation.</P>
    <P>If the implementation of the provisions of the Bill is to be successful in improving the health and safety of our workers, it will require a commitment from employers, workers and their respective organisations at all levels.  The co-operation of workers and employers is central to the success of the proposed new system.  This is reflected in the Bill which provides that workers and employers will be represented on the board of the new Authority.  In this way they will have a major input into formulating and implementing safety and health policy at the very highest levels.  In view of the cooperation which has already been shown during the deliberations of the Barrington Commission and the Interim Board for Occupational Safety and Health, I am confident that this spirit of co-operation and goodwill will ensure the effectiveness of the new system.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a constructive debate and I will consider carefully all reasonable proposals which the House may have to improve the Bill.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I welcome also the very constructive and open approach he has adopted in his speech to this legislation. We in Fine Gael welcome this Bill to the House and commend the Minister for having gone so far in response to the Barrington report.  The Bill has, however, a number of weaknesses which I hope can be addressed by the Minister <Col N="630" /> before the Bill becomes law.  I will return to some of these points shortly.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Bill is to create a comprehensive, legal and structured system as regards safety and health at work.  It has one clear objective; to help reduce accidents and ill-health at work which give rise to human loss and suffering and which create costs both for individual workers and for the economy.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as the Minister has pointed out, is based closely on the main recommendations of the Barrington Commission of Inquiry on Safety, Health and Welfare at Work on which both sides of industry and the Government were represented.  The Barrington commision's examination of occupational safety and health was the first such comprehensive study conducted in Ireland. The commission found that existing safety legislation was severely limited, both in its scope and its ability to help overcome the safety and health hazards which can arise in the workplace.  The commission was convinced that a system which does not clarify who is responsible for what will fail to provide for the safety and health of workers.</P>
      <P>A major objective of the system proposed by the commission was to restore a sense of responsibility and to assign responsibilities where they belong.  A single national body responsible for overall policy, co-ordination and control was considered essential.  The National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health, set up this legislation, is designed to fulfil this need but whether it will or not is somewhat doubtful and I will examine its role in somewhat more detail later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister indicated in his speech, current safety legislation covers only 20 per cent of all employment.  It is geared almost exclusively to factories, mines and quarries and to the construction sector. In assessing the extent of the problem of safety and health at the workplace we are caught by the virtual absence of any statistics in relation to compensation claims, occupational injury and benefits, and so on.  Overall data are not available on occupational accidents generally but <Col N="631" /> there are some fairly startling indicators. For example, although only 20 per cent of the workforce are covered by the present system, there have been over 100 fatalities since 1982 in relation to that 20 per cent.  Also, the Barrington commission estimated that each year between 200,000 and 400,000 damage only accidents occur, between 150,000 and 250,000 first-aid accidents and between 4,000 and 36,000 accidents involving slight injury occur.  In agriculture, alone &mdash; and the Minister pointed this out &mdash; there is one death a week.  These deaths and injuries emphasise the urgent need for adequate safety legislation.</P>
    <P>Obviously the implications of these accidents for the Exchequer are enormous in terms of both lost work hours and the medical cost to the country.  As a result of accidents in the workplace many people who are willing and anxious to work are unable to do so.  Instead of being engaged in productive employment they are now facing a lifetime of dependence on social welfare and the State. Whether expenditure is incurred in enforcing this legislation will be returned one hundred fold with the prevention of accidents and the reduction in the number of days lost in productive employment.</P>
    <P>The philosophy of this Bill is one of consultation and prevention and it is the result of a consultative process involving not just the commission but also the interim board on which employers and employees were represented.  The philosophy of the Bill recognises that there have been tremendous improvements in industrial relations during the past 20 years and that the provision of a safe and healthy environment is of immense benefit to both employers and employees.  We as a parliament must adopt that approach.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets down a preventative approach as regards avoiding accidents and ill-health in the workplace. Employers will have to identify the hazards and set them and the protective measures out in a written safety statement. The Bill sets out broad general <Col N="632" /> duties of care for all employers, employees and self-employed.  These general duties of care involve the provision of a safe place of work, safe plant and equipment and a safe system of work. The Bill also requires adequate training and information for those at risk about the relevant hazards and the steps taken to deal with them.</P>
    <P>We, in Fine Gael, welcome the commitment to consultation in the Bill.  This has been proved time and time again to be the best way to approach all industrial relations issues.  However, we do have some reservations about the Bill.  First, in one sense the Bill is somewhat one sided.  It places little obligation on employees to observe safety regulations. Many industrial accidents occur not because safety arrangements are not made but because they are not observed. There has never been, as far as I know, a prosecution under the Factories Act, the Office Premises Act, the Dangerous Substances Act or the Safety in Industry Acts against any negligent employee, no matter how serious their contribution to accidents may have been.</P>
    <P>The Bill has failed to put sufficient emphasis on the responsibilities of those in employment to observe safety and health regulations, but it does allow for secondary legislation by way of regulation. It fails somewhat to emphasise people's obligations to fellow workers and employees.  Unfortunately, that is a feature of much of our labour legislation. There is much talk about rights but little or not enough talk about responsibilities to fellow workers.  The Bill before us today should, if possible, be strengthened to cover this flaw.</P>
    <P>The second fault in this legislation and, indeed, in almost all legislation going through the Houses of the Oireachtas, is its lack of commitment to enforcement. The National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health set up by this legislation will have representatives of employers, workers and four State appointed directors.  However, there is a real danger that Ministers for Labour and Finance will have too much of a strangle-hold over the affairs and effectiveness <Col N="633" /> of the proposed Authority.  The Authority will, according to the Bill, be responsible for developing and implementing safety and health policies and for administering and enforcing the relevant statutory provisions, but the decisions on general policy will remain with the Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>This relationship between the Minister and the authority does need some further clarification.  Is there a danger that the Minister may well be tying the hands of the authority in some way?  I am sure this is not the Minister's intention, but it may well be the result of what is now in this legislation.  Similarly, the hands of the Authority may be tied somewhat by the Minister for Finance who has control over the revenues available to the Authority and over the salary level and numbers that can be employed by it.  In reality the danger is that the Authority may have little real independence.  If so, its effectiveness will be limited, not for safety considerations but for financial reasons. This may well prove to be in the long run a fundamental weakness of this Bill.  We believe that if the Authority is to be truly effective, if there is to be enforcement of this legislation, the Authority must have committed funds available to it.  It must not be subject to the possible whim of the Minister for Finance.  Safety and health are far too important for that, yet this legislation proposes to give the Minister for Finance that power.</P>
    <P>We are wasting our time if we continue to enact legislation while failing to make proper provision for its enforcement and although the principle of this Bill is more than welcome it will not become a reality unless we make proper provision in the areas of enforcement and observance.  I ask the Minister to consider whether we can make some provision in this Bill which would guarantee earmarked funds to the new Authority to ensure that the Authority will not be tied down, inhibited or obstructed by financial considerations.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed also that this Bill does not cover general environmental issues.  We cannot have a proper Bill dealing with health and safety at work if it does not take account of environmental <Col N="634" /> issues.  Many of the causes of human disease or sickness are man-made environmental problems arising from factories, power stations, nuclear or otherwise, which were often commissioned and designed at a different time, the effects of which were not properly measured or gauged at that time and the consequences of which are only now being felt in part in this country but to a much greater extent in those countries which industrialised earlier and more intensively than we did.  I am convinced that environmental and radiological hazards must be a major concern of any legislation dealing with health and safety at work.  This Bill contains no such provisions and it may well be that the question is such a huge one, and that information is coming in at such a rapid pace at the present time, that this subject may well be part of a general environmental package of legislation which could and should come on the agenda, at some early future date.</P>
    <P>I fear that the penalties proposed in this Bill for breaking safety and health regulations are not a sufficient deterrent. The fine for a summary conviction is only £1,000 but £1,000 may be nothing to an unscrupulous employer in whose interest the breaking of safety and health regulations may well be.  The fine can go up to £15,000 on indictment but even that may not prove a sufficient deterrent to those who lack sufficient scruple. However, may I say to the Minister that we in Fine Gael welcome the principle of the Bill.  We hope that some of the flaws, and they are not great flaws, which have been pointed out will be addressed by the Minister and that its provisions will be actively enforced.  We hope this Bill will lead to an enlightened awareness among all workers of the need to observe safety regulations in the workplace.  More importantly we hope that the Bill will fulfil its promise and lead to a reduction in the number of accidents in the workplace and in the incidence of diseases.  Finally, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, I commend the Bill to the House in principle and I thank the Minister for the open-minded approach he adopted at the outset.</P>

      <P>This, as will be evident from what Senator Manning has said, is not a contentious Bill.  It represents the culmination of, first, the Barrington Commission deliberations which made a very comprehensive study of the whole area of safety, health and welfare in the workplace.  I am happy to have the opportunity to congratulate Judge Barrington and his team for providing such a comprehensive report and of course the Bill closely follows the findings of the commission.  Secondly, and a further reason why it is a Bill based on consensus, is that there was extensive consultation with both sides through the interim board for occupational health and safety.  The result is that we have a legislative measure before us which is based on consensus and enjoys a high level of acceptance by both sides.</P>
      <P>One of the more telling issues highlighted by the Barrington Commission was the limitation of the existing legislation especially in regard to its ability to overcome the hazards of safety and health under the existing system.  Furthermore, of course, it highlights once more that a mere 20 per cent of the workforce was covered by it.  So we only have had a partial picture up to now and the 3,000 accidents reported per year in respect of factories, mines and quarries were not quite complete in that they did not represent disputes of less than three days' duration.  We get some indication of the extent of the problems under the other 80 per cent when we see a report done which would indicate that there are three fatalities in the agricultural sector compared with one in industry.  The broadening of the scope of the coverage of the legislation is one of the more important and welcome aspects of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to 1992 and to the Single European Act.  Clearly this country enjoys considerable economic benefits from our membership of the Community but side by side with that there are indeed social obligations and there are six new directives proposed in the health and safety area at the present <Col N="636" /> time at Commission level and the Minister says that this Bill provides the basis for meeting those obligations.  The concern expressed by the employers, of course, in that respect is that we should not move too rapidly.  We should only fulfil those obligations given our particular circumstances on a phased basis. Perhaps the Minister would have a comment to make on that in his reply.  We do have specific social obligations side by side with the economic benefits we enjoy from our membership with the Community. The Bill, therefore, represents a substantial departure and change from the existing situation and the thrust of it is to provide a broad legal framework in the area of safety rather than very specific rigid requirements.</P>
    <P>As I see it safety is a state of mind. Responsibility for it should be restored to where it properly belongs, to top management, the first line supervision, and of course employees themselves who have indeed got specific obligations.  There are various procedures laid out in the Bill including the requirement for employers to produce a written safety policy statement specifying how safety, health and welfare at work can be secured.  I find the requirement of dialogue and consultation between the two sides particularly welcome.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning referred to the problem of negligent employees.  I feel that the consultative mechanism is absolutely essential because the consultations between employers and employees and the sharing in the ultimate arrangements internally should provide a certain ownership on the part of employees and employers about what has actually been agreed.  In other words the dialogue, it seems to me, leads to a form of commitment that otherwise would not be possible if it were unilateral and statutory provision only.  Indeed the absence of that dialogue was highlighted by the Barrington Commission as a discouragement or a hindrance rather than an incentive to achieving what we are trying to do in the Bill and that is to improve safety and health standards at work.  A consequence of that is of course that the thrust of the <Col N="637" /> Bill is for flexibility, to let both sides through dialogue tailor the arrangements internally within the broad legal parameters and in that regard of course employers clearly have a responsibility for providing a safe place of work, safe plant and equipment and a safe system of work.</P>
    <P>No matter how careful a worker is unless he has the actual setting and requirements for safety at work there will be accidents.  In that context the Bill goes a long way towards meeting the concerns of the social partners and I have particular knowledge myself of the concerns of the Irish Conference of Professional and Services Associations who did make a submission at an earlier point especially in regard to the impact of technological development on the introduction of new equipment and materials, on changes in the nature of job descriptions and on the re-organisation of the work environment. They put forward the case for codes of practice which in fact are specified in the Minister's speech laying down certain standards jointly agreed on health and safety especially in environmental considerations like lighting, glare, noise and so forth.  They are also concerned about electrical safety and the design of office structure, equipment and furnishings. Quite clearly there has been an exhaustive process of consultation and listening on the part of the Minister and the Department.</P>
    <P>Personally I agree that the codes of practice hold out considerable promise in laying down practical guidance for the observance of the legislation.  The code of practice is something that should be encouraged.  It is one of the areas where there can be joint consultation that enjoys a prospect of achievement.  The idea of a voluntary code of practice is acceptable to both sides provided of course that the codes of practice are jointly agreed and implemented and I share Senator Manning's concern about implementation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the national authority for occupational health and safety, one could argue that the functions for the statutory implementation of the Bill <Col N="638" /> could be left to the Department but Barrington strongly advocated a single expert authority for this purpose.  So the administration of the new system and the high level of quality advice and information that will be provided in order to meet the obligations of the legislation will be provided by the new Authority.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Authority will have specific responsibility for the enforcement of the relevant statutory provisions. Given that this will be a tripartite body, it obviously again offers the opportunity for both sides to be committed to the task and obviously it will have a staff to implement it, initially civil servants.  I dare say, of course, as with any other body, it will need the resources to carry out its function.  That, too, is important and that kind of commitment will be necessary from the Department.  Prevention is clearly better than cure and that is where the real focus should be. The national Authority will be providing advice and information and the stimulus to improve practices at the workplace. But there must be a bottom line for enforcement and therefore there will need to be a process like the improvement plan, or the prohibition notice if the improvement plan is not jointly worked out.  There will have to be an end of the line, as it were, where the prospect of prosecution will, in fact, act as a pressure point to bring realism to the behaviour of both parties for the implementation of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Finally, I did say that safety is a state of mind.  It is up to both sides primarily to commit themselves to the improvement of safety and health in the workplace. The costs can be very expensive for the individual worker and for the employer and for the economy as a whole.</P>

    <Title>Policy on Neutrality: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="639" /> That Seanad Éireann urges the Government (i) to reject calls for Irish involvement in a so-called European defence commitment, and (ii) to reaffirm unequivocally the national policy of non-participation in military alliances.</P>
    <P>This is an important motion.  I am glad to have the support of not only my Independent colleagues but, indeed, the Labour Senators as well and some of the Taoiseach's distinguished nominees, so that it is an across-the-board motion, commanding already a substantial section of support in the House.</P>
    <P>The background to the motion is what is now without any doubt an increasing clamour from a section of our politicians, both here at home and in the European Parliament, for closer involvement with what they term the political and military aspects of European integration.  These calls come not from politicians alone, of course &mdash; the latest contributor has been Dr. Edward Walsh, President of Limerick University &mdash; designate &mdash; but from a wide and growing list of politicians.  A politician from another jurisdiction, Mr. Seamus Mallon, who is a British Member of Parliament, made an attack on our neutrality some time ago, although I must say I regard it as verging on the impertinent for a member from another jurisdiction to criticise a long-established national policy.  Mr. Peter Sutherland, of course, has carried the gush of his European enthusiasm into his retirement and is also arguing for, effectively, an end to neutrality as we know it.  The Progressive Democrats have also proclaimed themselves to be in favour of a revision of neutrality but above all it is members of the Fine Gael Party who, one after the other, in recent months have plugged the anti-neutrality line.</P>
    <P>There is no need to cite the day and date for the contribution of individuals, but some of them have returned again and again to the campaign.  Deputies Garret FitzGerald, Peter Barry, Bernard Allen, Gay Mitchell, John Kelly with his inimitable caustic debunking of what he <Col N="640" /> sees as a soft and ambiguous target, and, in the European Assembly, people like Mr. Chris O'Malley and Mr. McCartan have contributed to that.  It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that specifically the Fine Gael Party now are targeting our neutrality and want to change it.</P>
    <P>The peculiar thing is that we are taunted on the one hand with defending a sacred cow, with not wanting to debate the issue, yet when I and other people in public life have thrown down the gauntlet they have, in effect, refused to debate it. They keep on this softening-up process, this chronic sniping at our neutrality.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I submit that it is very timely that we find out what the Fine Gael Party as a whole think of our present policy and whether they are prepared to make a definite stance against it on foot of the motion here in my name and that of others.</P>
    <P>They talk about our defence obligations. What is difficult to pin down here is what exactly they mean by defence. They are talking about an unknown and an unmandated future, but what is quite certain is that they are discontented with, and probably ashamed of, the policy which has become part of our tradition as an independent State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that Senator Manning was not here to listen to the litany.  At the expense of boring the House, I will begin again.  I mentioned, among others, Deputies John Bruton, Garret FitzGerald, Peter Barry, Bernard Allen, Gay Mitchell, John Kelly, Chris O'Malley <i>et al</i>, as well as Mr. Peter Sutherland, who I believe has some rapport with the Fine Gael Party as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention in the motion is to find out whether the party in this House as led by Senator Manning support this attitude and whether also the Government still stand by their commitment to our traditional neutrality policy.  I am flinging down here the gauntlet.  I do not regard <Col N="641" /> neutrality as a sacred cow.  I am inviting the Seanad and, indeed, the public at large to commence this debate in the period leading up to the European elections where, undoubtedly, it will become an issue.  The young voters particularly whose future, after all, it is that we are debating when we are talking about impending European integration with its political and military connotations, are entitled to know beyond equivocation where the party politicians stand on this issue.  I hope the question will be well and truly put and well and truly debated in the next few months.</P>
    <P>Let me comment on the motion.  It has been phrased fairly carefully.  The word &ldquo;so-called&rdquo; is very deliberately used there, because one of the things which confuse people is the notion of European defence.  The Europe we are talking about, of course, is only a part of western Europe, which is why I have dubbed it &ldquo;so-called&rdquo; European.  It is so-called also because the question immediately arises, defence against whom?  Who is going to attack western Europe?  What is the evidence that the European Community is now, or will be as far as the foreseeable future, under attack?  The whole concept is a very vague one, indeed, which is why, leading on to the second part of the motion.  I think the Government should then reaffirm unequivocally the national policy of non-participation in military alliances.  It is a national policy.  Some doubt is being continually cast on this. People have said neutrality is not really a policy, it is not a principle, it is only an expedient which arose out of a historical set of circumstances and it has also become customary for the attackers to bring into question our whole policy of neutrality during World War II.  In other words, by attacking the morality and the propriety of our wartime neutrality they hope to cast doubts on its contemporary wisdom as well.</P>
    <P>It is true that in its origins neutrality was in part at least an expedient.  No historian can put his hand on his heart and say that neutrality is an integral part of Irish national philosophy.  Neutrality in its origins meant staying out of England's <Col N="642" /> wars.  That is what the Irish Neutrality League meant in 1914 and that great demonstration of neutrality, the anti-conscription campaign of 1918, was also a refusal to commit itself to England's wars.  Nonetheless, in part at least, any student of Eamon de Valera's political philosophy must realise that for him, though he never articulated neutrality's high principle, it was far more &mdash; and became far more than an expedient.</P>
    <P>An historian would have to conclude that by 1945 Irish neutrality, however much it acted as a national cohesive at that time, in world terms was isolationist. It was anti-partitionist in origin and it was even to some extent perhaps anti-British. It could be regarded as escapist but let us remember that it developed into something else in the late fifties and sixties, so that neutrality has now come to mean-especially for young people who are involved in various peace movements &mdash; a role in the world which may be pretentious at times, we may be, in <i>Skibbereen Eagle</i> fashion, over-estimating our importance but our neutrality in its modern form has tried to be outgoing, positive, internationalist, anti-nuclear and pacifist.  In fact, it has become something quite different from what it was during World War II.  The only link is one in name, a certain continuity.  In other words, our non-military stance today in international affairs is based on a feeling that we have a special rapport with the wide world, not just with the European Community, that we have a special standing in areas of the world partly because of our colonial past and partly because since Independence, we have not participated for whatever reasons in military alliances.</P>
    <P>In short, what we have is something very valuable in terms of our personality as a nation, in terms of our psychology, and even commercially the perception of Ireland as a neutral country is good for our trade and our commercial prospects in areas like the Middle East and in the states of Africa where, for example, Aer Lingus have a very profitable arrangement with various African states on the <Col N="643" /> grounds that they see Ireland and the national airline as part of this image.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting that neutrality, which is a very unfortunate word, a very unattractive word and a very inadequate word &mdash; that is part of the reason its opponents can snipe at us &mdash; is a national policy, is a traditional policy and that we must not abandon it as we move forward to the new Community in 1992 and after.  Our European partners have no right to demand that we abandon it if they are honest and serious in their assertion that the new Europe will cherish a rich diversity of cultures, attitudes and philosophies.</P>
    <P>Without wanting to prolong the history lesson, I would like to remind the House that the new neutrality, the contemporary neutrality, is something we can be proud of in the international way. It has evolved like a butterfly, it has struggled out of the chrysalis of the old neutrality. It is a complete misconception to think that our neutrality now is anti-British, that our neutrality now is because of Partition.  It began like that but for anyone to think that that is the rationale of it now is a complete misconception.</P>
    <P>I was astonished to read very recently that the Belgian Foreign Minister, Mr. Leo Tindemans, said Ireland was not neutral in any active way and that Irish neutrality is more an anti-British attitude. I cannot give you a precise date for that but it was sometime in November last year.  If Mr. Leo Tindemans has a totally wrong idea of Irish neutrality &mdash; and he is one of the great persons of the new Community of Europe &mdash; then it seems to me that the same misconception must be shared by a great number of mainland European statesmen.  If it is so shared, is it not the fault of our Irish politicians in Europe who have not bothered informing the Europeans about the proper philosophy of Irish neutrality and the reason we cherish it so much, not as a begrudging negative anti-British attitude?  Is it that they are not concerned to explain or that they do not know themselves the present position of our policy?</P>
    <P>During the referendum on the Single <Col N="644" /> European Act which took place nearly two years ago, many of us were very concerned that the Act would mean a further erosion of our neutrality policy, especially Title III, which seemed to many of us incongruously lumped with the economic part of the Act.  We were reassured again and again during that campaign that there was no danger to our neutrality and no question of a defence commitment.  I do not recall during that campaign the Fine Gael politicians, who have since then been so vocal in their opposition to neutrality, being so explicit in their condemnation of it.  The European Commission issued a booklet at that time explaining the Single European Act in which it gave assurances in reply to a question.  I quote from a booklet called <i>The Facts &mdash; The Single European Act</i> published by the Commission of the European Community in Dublin.  The question was if the Act would affect Ireland's neutrality?  The answer which follows in effect says no.  It said:</P>
    <P>Successive Irish Governments have found the formula devised to accommodate Ireland's special position perfectly acceptable and there is nothing new in the Act that would change the situation.</P>
    <P>That is hardly an enthusiastic endorsement of Irish neutrality from the Commission but, nonetheless, a fairly clear statement that the Act was not any threat to Irish neutrality.  More important, the Government issued other reassurances.  I quote from two publications.  A fairly lengthy quotation is warranted because of the importance of the issue.  One is <i>The Single European Act &mdash; An Explanatory Guide</i> which assures us in section 4 (6) that the Single European Act poses no threat to Ireland's neutrality.  Even more positively, in another Government information booklet in May 1987 &mdash;<i>The Single European Act</i>, a different one from the blue covered one, perhaps a development of it, we are assured that Title III does not affect Ireland's long established policy of military neutrality.  This document goes on to state that &ldquo;there is no conflict between our policy of military neutrality <Col N="645" /> and our full and active membership of the European Community.  Statements and fears to the contrary have no basis in reality and serve only to obscure and detract from our national interests and objectives as a full and committed member of the European Community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What I am asking the Government is whether the statements I have read constitute Government policy at present?  Is it still unequivocal Government policy that there is no threat and no intention of altering the policy of military neutrality? What do the repeated assertions of Fianna Fáil Government Ministers over the decades &mdash; from Seán Lemass on through Dr. Hillery, on through Mr. Lynch &mdash; mean when they said that although we are going to be neutral, somehow in the far distant future our neutrality will be gently converted into participation?  That is the suggestion.</P>
    <P>To be fair to Fine Gael Deputies, they at least are straightforward in their attacks on neutrality.  What worries me is that the Government have this long term vision in their heads; that not now perhaps, but sometime in the not so distant future, when European Union becomes more realisable, we will think again. Where do the Government stand on that one?</P>
    <P>One of the things that appals me in the statements which are made from time to time by various anti-neutrality politicians is that they suggest that not only do we owe it to our partners to sing for our supper, as it were putting it crudely, but it will be profitable for us to turn from being a peace-keeping nation without any military or defence structures and to go in for wholesale investment in defence structures.  The job creation prospects of military development have been mentioned by, among others, Deputy Bernard Allen and the other day by Dr. Edward Walsh, President of the University of Limerick &mdash; designate.  It seems to indicate an appalling bankruptcy of economic thought to suggest that this is the way to job creation &mdash; through the manufacture of lethal weapons and the exploitation of the threat of mass destruction. <Col N="646" /> That is what it means.  That is what offering the prospect of employment based on NATO plants or new European defence plants means.  It is very sad, if not an almost obscene, bankruptcy of thought on the employment question.</P>
    <P>We are also being told, that since we are the only non-military pact member of the Community that we do not belong to the fast track nations.  Dr. Walsh upbraided us for not being as forward looking as France and Germany in this regard.  What I am suggesting is that all this thinking, or what passes for thinking, and this new attack on our traditional policy is outmoded, misguided, half-baked and dates from the fifties.  It is old Cold War thinking, not readjusted, and I am surprised that such a lively and vigorous mind as that of Deputy Garret FitzGerald is still stuck in the ice of the Cold War of the fifties.</P>
    <P>When we are told that we should contribute to European defence what we are actually being told is that we should get ready to defend part of western Europe against another part of Europe, which is not even threatening it, that we must be ready to spill European blood of one variety or another.  That is what is meant by saying we should take our part in the defence structures of a new Europe.  It is particularly inappropriate during a period of remarkable European and world <i>détente</i> with the Soviet bloc being liberalised before our eyes, disintegrating in its monolithic tradition before our eyes.  What we need surely is more disengagement and more peace, not contributing our little mite to a Europe already bristling with death-dealing weapons.</P>
    <P>Our new cold warriors seem to have got it all wrong.  Is it possible that they are motivated by a revamped colonial desire to please our new masters, tugging the forelock to the goodies-dispensing gentry in Europe?  Is that part of the new psychology?  Instead, it seems to me we should be enlightening our European partners about our neutrality, telling them it is a good thing for Europe that we should have a non-military tradition, that it will enrich the image of Europe in <Col N="647" /> the world at large, that it has to do with the image of Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals rather than any sectional and capitalist vision of a part of Europe.</P>
    <P>Since we can all talk freely about the future Europe, about which we know nothing as yet, let me now say that the only Europe which will get my allegiance is all of Europe, and no politician should set bounds to the march of Europe &mdash; to adapt a famous phrase.  These attackers of our neutrality ignore the fact that our foreign policy is part of our ethos, is part of our very being as an independent State.  Whatever imperfections and whatever disappointments we have had as an independent State I suggest that the vision of neutrality I have outlined is one of our fulfilments, and we should not abandon it.  We should bring it with us to Europe and give it to Europe.  We should also remember &mdash; indeed the topicality of this motion is further underlined by what I am going to say &mdash; that Austria is now knocking on the European Community door and is, in effect saying &ldquo;we are neutral, we have to be neutral by international obligations but we want to be part of Europe as well&rdquo;.  We are not alone, we are not the eccentric, maverick, irresponsible member state that some of the opponents of our neutrality would like us to be.</P>
    <P>Let the Government reassure us that peace and disarmament will continue to be the marks of our distinctive foreign policy.  Let us take it further.  I see no reason we should not engage fully in the Councils of the European Community instead of absenting ourselves from dinner from time to time when difficult matters are being discussed.  Why not stay there and say to the Germans that their dream of a unification is a grandiose one which is not in the best interests of Europe or tell the French &mdash; and the British if it comes to that &mdash; that their post imperial arrogance with their independent nuclear strikes is not in the best interests of Europe.  We should be in there exercising the voice of a small country.</P>
    <P>On this motion I ask the Government <Col N="648" /> not to be in the slightest apologetic about a national policy which conforms to our best tradition.  After all, Fianna Fáil claim to be the particular custodian of neutrality. Let them give a confident answer, loud and clear, to the new cold warriors among us, the new gaiscígh, an Irish word which I might translate as bellicose yuppies. Let the Government tell them, as their predecessors told people in the thirties and forties, that neutrality is no more for sale now than it was 40 or 50 years ago.  I am confident, in proposing this timely motion, of full Government support.</P>

I do not intend to be specific in regard to what individual speakers either of the Fine Gael Party or any other party have said in the recent past in advocating a change in our stance on neutrality.  I would merely say that I am rather surprised by the stance adopted by Deputy Peter Barry.  I understand that in a debate on this topic in the Seanad when Mr. Barry was Minister for Foreign Affairs he advocated the stance of neutrality and was very firm when stating it was Government policy.  I am surprised at this stage that that view should be changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it is important that we remind ourselves exactly what is our policy on neutrality.  For that reason, I welcome this motion this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are various interpretations of what exactly neutrality means.  There is what is called active neutrality, positive neutrality and so on.  As Senator Murphy <Col N="649" /> said, it is open to people to make different views on what exactly is meant by neutrality. Whatever interpretation one puts on neutrality, it is one of the hallmarks of this country's history particularly in relation to the stance we took at the time of the Second World War.  As Senator Murphy said, we do not have to be apologetic for our stance on neutrality.  It has been recognised as playing a very positive role in trying to bring about peace throughout the world.  In current circumstances the most beneficial thing we can do is to refuse to act, by that I mean to refuse to join any defensive pact or defensive military arrangement because those sorts of arrangements have a habit of converting themselves into offensive arrangements.</P>
    <P>Other people have stated we cannot but have a neutrality stance because of Northern Ireland.  I contend that if partition were ended this minute there should be no change in that stance.  I hope neither this Government, nor any future Governments, will change that policy.  I take this policy of neutrality as being permanent.  It may not save us from the effects of a nuclear war but it is amazing how effective our voice is as that of a very small nation in the overall scheme of things.  Even in the event of a war, this country will have made its contribution to peace by refusing to take part in any military pact or conspiracy.</P>
    <P>Our neutrality can never be over-emphasised. We should promote it on every international occasion and make our people, especially our young people, aware of the importance we place on it. It should be a standard part of our civics and our education for life programmes in our schools.  We do not place enough emphasis on the importance and beneficial effects of Ireland's neutrality on our young people and in our schools. We should try to promote it at every opportunity at that level.</P>
    <P>When one speaks of neutrality and war one immediately thinks of the Super Powers, particularly the US and Russia. Here I would like to put on record my admiration of the efforts made by Mr. <Col N="650" /> Gorbachev, the present Russian Premier, to bring about a reduction in nuclear armaments.  I say that recognising that when agreements have been made, there will be still vast amounts of arms available to both those countries and others.  It is fair to acknowledge that Mr. Gorbachev has tried to revolutionise Russian thinking and attitudes in a very short time.  I am hopeful some good will come out of that.</P>
    <P>There are numerous conflicts throughout the world in places such as the Lebanon.  I want to take the opportunity to congratulate our peace keeping forces who on numerous occasions have served the cause well.  Because we are a neutral country and have no axe to grind our troops are respected when they go on these peace keeping missions.  There are conflicts in other areas, such as Central America, Afghanistan and South Africa, to name but a few, and they show that man's inhumanity to man continues unabated.  If we put those conflicts and their huge costs in terms of financial resources against the background that more than one billion people live in hunger, poverty, sickness and suffer from malnutrition, we can see clearly the futility of the arms race.  All the marvellous efforts being made to help the starving peoples of the world are severely hampered by the lack of funds while billions of pounds are spent each day stocking up arms.  Much of the world's suffering and starvation is man made. Natural disasters can easily be overcome if the will to do so is strong enough in those in a position to help.  However, their priorities always seem to be cast in a different direction.  This is where Ireland as a neutral country has a very important role to play, and should continue to play that role in trying to persuade these other countries that the way forward is through discussion, conciliation and respect for each other's point of view.</P>
    <P>The fact that we have not been part of any military alliance gives us more credence in proposing measures aimed at curbing and eliminating nuclear weapons. Ireland played an important role in <Col N="651" /> the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in 1968.  While the main protagonists at that time were the US, Britain and the Soviet Union, we put forward ideas that those principally involved found acceptable.  As Senator Murphy said, our neutrality should never be negotiable no matter with whom we are dealing.</P>
    <P>We are all very much aware of the problems regarding the ozone layer the use of CFCs are causing and the damage they are doing to the earth's stratosphere. It is a very live topic in our schools at the moment and very few young people are not conversant with it.  It would be a marvellous idea at this time of our development if we could, in tandem with tackling the ozone problem, renew and rekindle our zeal to strive towards the elimination of nuclear weapons.  We must do that as a duty to the human race and to the generations to come.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Murphy when I say we as a country need not apologise to any country or individual for our stand on neutrality.  We should boast about it, we should be proud of it.  It is a clear message to all other countries who put so much emphasis on trying to be stronger and having more arms than other countries, that you do not have to have all those arms; you do not have to be part of any military alliance; you do not have to say, &ldquo;I am stronger than you&rdquo; to be in a position to deal effectively with the human race.  I would be more than surprised if this or any other Government changed their stance on neutrality.  It is one of the greatest assets we have as a nation.  I fully support the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I was somewhat taken aback by Senator Murphy's contribution this evening, but I will try to respond to some of the questions he raised as fully as I can.  At the outset let me say that Fine Gael are committed to our present policy of neutrality; Fine Gael in Government operated that policy scrupulously; within the EC, Fine Gael operated within European political co-operation; Fine Gael in Government avoided any <Col N="652" /> involvement whatsoever in military matters, even if that meant missing the dinners at which these issues were discussed; Fine Gael did not feel they were in a position to lecture West Germany that it should not strive for the ideal of the reunification of Germany &mdash; I think it would have been rather remiss coming from a country which has put reunification at the top of our agenda, for us to feel we were in a position to lecture the Germans that they should not pursue such a policy.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael in Government recognised, and our policy recognises very fully at present that our policy of neutrality is in our national interest, that its operation allows us to maximise whatever small influence we have as a sovereign nation. All that is a matter of fact and record and nothing has changed.  While in Government and in Opposition and within the European Community we have always sought disarmament and peace and we have fully supported the peace-keeping operations of the Irish troops, which were possible largely because of our policy of neutrality.  All of this are matters of fact.</P>
      <P>The Senators raised the matter of different people raising questions about the future of this policy.  I would think it is a normal part of political dialogue and development that questions on major issues of policy should be raised and debated and that is not just a monopoly of the Fine Gael Party.  As long ago as the sixties the late Michéal Ó Moráin raised the question of Ireland's membership of NATO.  The present Tánaiste when in Opposition speculated on a few occasions from time to time on the possibility of closer links.  Various Fianna Fáil Taoisigh over the years have, in the context of the evolution of the European Community and future developments, discussed the possibility of changes in our position at some future date, but change taken with the full consent of the Irish people in a sovereign Irish Parliament. All of that is part of the discussion within normal political development and I do not think we have anything to be ashamed of in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Senator that there is <Col N="653" /> no conspiracy in the Fine Gael Party to foist a policy of abandoning neutrality on the Irish people, that the very strong majority view in the Fine Gael Party is in favour of the policy as I have enunciated it and that this is the policy of the party leadership.  We are not afraid to engage in discussions and indeed we would be in dereliction of our duties if we did not point out that, as the Senator knows well, as members of the European Community we are part of an evolving community and evolving and growing relationships between the different countries.  He mentioned the possibility of Austria becoming a member.  It is our duty, if nothing more, to point out to people here that this is an evolving relationship, that we will be faced with questions in the future as to what our stance is on this matter.</P>
    <P>In pointing this out it is also very important to bear in mind that we always have the option of sovereignty, the option to say no, that we prefer our present position of neutrality.  We are not under pressure from anybody to change that policy.  It is the policy to which the majority of the Irish people, I think, give strong support at present and, as the Senator pointed out, regard with a great deal of affection.  It is perfectly normal that a political party can raise questions &mdash; indeed it is wrong if it does not raise questions &mdash; and it can do so within the context of the clearly stated principles which I hope I have enunciated here this evening.</P>
    <P>Such was the tone, and regrettably so, of Senator Murphy's contribution that there were many sweeping misrepresentations of the Fine Gael position. There was some crude abuse and some snide jeering at the party, such that I am struck by the timing of this motion. Maybe I am being somewhat unworthy in thinking that the new political movement of which the Senator is a supporter may well be seeking to invent an issue for the upcoming European elections.  If they are, I think they will find it very unsuccessful and a very fruitless line of argument, because there is no concern about neutrality in this country.  There is no concern <Col N="654" /> for a very good reason.  No party wants to change the present policy.  All parties are committed to it; all parties see the policy as being in the best interest of this country at present.  For that reason ordinary people outside do not feel threatened, do not feel that there is some conspiracy going on behind closed doors to bring them into some military relationship which will result in the spilling of European blood.</P>

      <P>The timing of this motion reminds me of a very old, now long dead, ex-RIC man whom I knew when growing up in Bagenalstown.  That part of the country had had a fairly quiet record during the War of Independence, but there were a number of people afterwards who traded on their alleged exploits in that war and gloried in having been on the run.  I remember this old ex-RIC man saying to me one day as a young child, &ldquo;They were on the run, but there was nobody after them&rdquo;.  I have a feeling that in raising this issue at the moment the Senator is trying to create a scare, a scare which has no basis in fact.  If we examine the stated position of all the parties, there is no reason why there should be any cause for scare or worry of any sort.</P>
      <P>On the broader question of neutrality, it is a subject that is best stripped of humbug.  I am sorry that Senator Murphy, who has in the past so skilfully and so consistently stripped many of our myths of the hoary growth of years seems in this particular instance to be almost in the myth-making business himself.  I believe very firmly that there is only one principle to be taken into consideration in opting for a policy of neutrality or otherwise, that is the question of national interest properly decided in the sovereign Parliament.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Neutrality is not a value or an end in itself.  It does not confer any <Col N="655" /> sense of superiority, moral or otherwise, on those who practise it.  If we look at the countries in Europe who are neutral, I do not think they are countries that we look to for any sort of moral leadership. Switzerland is a country which has thrived, prospered and grown fat on its isolation, but it is not a country to which anybody else looks for leadership or inspiration.  Austria has not exactly distinguished itself recently in the Waldheim affair.  It is not a country which provides great moral authority in Europe. Sweden, a country which does practise an active policy of neutrality, often very honorably, is also a country which has grown rich, often quite shamefully, as one of the great arms dealers and arms manufacturers of the world.</P>
      <P>I do not think that we should see neutrality as such as a virtue which confers any sense of moral superiority on those who adopt it.  To be neutral is to exercise a tactic, to take up an option.  It is a choice and the right to use it is itself an essential element of sovereignty.  Neutrality is not an immutable fixed principle. It is not there for all time and it never was.  It is something which we can change if we wish after deliberation, if we think it is in our national interest to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are talking about neutrality we have to take other realities into account. Countries which are neutral are usually prepared to spend a great deal of money and involve a great deal of the energies of their people in building up defences. They are prepared to spend a much higher proportion of their GNP on defence than we are.  That is a right we have chosen not to exercise.  We have chosen not to defend ourselves in a way in which other neutral countries have. We all hope that this issue may well become somewhat academic because the past number of years have seen the spread of perestroika, glasnost, the good and cordial relations which have grown up so surprisingly and so strongly between east and west in such a way that maybe we can all hope that the type of cold war rhetoric of Senator Murphy will not be sufficiently real for us to need to <Col N="656" /> talk in the way we have talked about defence pacts and so on.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, we must state, and state unequivocally, that the right to be neutral or not to be neutral, to enter a defence pact or not to enter a defence pact, is one of the most important aspects of our sovereignty.  It is our right as a people to decide in the proper way after proper consultation.  We have opted to go one particular way and in so doing we have created a policy which has the support of all potential parties and of the overwhelming majority of the people.</P>
    <P>Since Senator Murphy did talk about the historical evolution of our policy of neutrality, it is important to be fairly clear as to what exactly we are talking about. We opted to remain neutral in the Second World War because we would not fight side by side with the country which occupied six counties of this land.  That was the policy over and over again.  There is a new book on the market on the evolution of NATO.  I have not got the title of it.  I picked it up in Waterstone's this afternoon.  I went through the references to Ireland.  I was told to look under Éire. Of the small number of references under Éire there was one conclusive reference which said that when in 1947 the NATO countries invited this country to join they were told the reason we would not join was because of the partition of the country.</P>
    <P>We did not opt for neutrality because we were neutral between fascism and parliamentary democracy; we opted initially for neutrality because of the situation in the Six Counties.  The policy grew and developed from that.  Of course it was a policy which was a comfortable policy, it kept us out of the war.  It also, perhaps, in some ways created a sense of isolation, a sense of insulation and smugness over the years.  It cuts us off from other parts of the world but it was a policy which people &mdash; and I would be one of them &mdash; approved of and it allowed us to develop our own independent influence in different ways.  We did not do that very well, we did not do that in any very individual <Col N="657" /> way, we did not do it particularly constructively but what we did we did and it was at least one aspect of our sovereignty.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy knows well that the late Mr. Seán MacBride, as Minister for External Affairs &mdash; this is a matter of historical record &mdash; was quite prepared in the 1940 period to talk to the US about the possibility of a bilateral arrangement in defence between this country and the US, that he was quite interested in talking about some possibility of membership of NATO.  At the end of the day the option was not exercised, but at least then neutrality was again seen as a tactic, as something which could or might not be exercised.</P>
    <P>Again, Senator Murphy quite rightly pointed out the contributions of Seán Lemass as Taoiseach when he applied for membership of the European Community and the possibility of some way ten decades down the line of this question being reopened.  He put it on the agenda. It was put on the agenda by Mr. Lynch. It was put on the agenda by the present Taoiseach when in 1980 with Mrs. Thatcher he talked about the possibility of some sort of possible defence arrangement with Britain, if there was some form of Irish unity, that Irish unity might well have been worth ceding some element on this particular question.</P>
    <P>Basically, politicians have a duty to talk about this.  Serious politicians have never been afraid to talk about it.  We have a responsibility to point out to people that if we want to go in a certain direction within the European Community then certain options are open to us.  It may also be open to us not to exercise them, but it is part of the duty of politicians that we should at least raise these issues so that there is full, serious, mature political debate on them.</P>
    <P>I believe very strongly from my own experiences, reading and talking to politicians in other countries in Europe that there is nobody out there trying to force us into a defence alliance.  There is nobody trying to force us against our <Col N="658" /> wishes to become part of NATO.  It may very well be that certain people here, soldiers, sailors and airmen may very well feel that they would like to be part of the greater NATO capability.  There is nobody, as far as I know, in Europe saying to us, or to those in any part of this country that we must become members of NATO or of the Western Defence Union or that we are any less European by choosing not to join in a military alliance. I do not think that people out there particularly care very much whether we join in a defence alliance or not.  I honestly believe it features rarely, if at all, on the political agenda of our European partners.  In many ways, from my own discussions, I believe that many of them see us as being far more useful within the European context as a fully neutral country because we are capable then of intervening and making points at the UN which they could not do.  It is a distinctive aspect of a European presence.</P>

      <P>I want to say to Senator Murphy that there is no conspiracy; there is nobody trying to force us into any sort of alliance.  The decision, if and when, if ever it is made, will be ours and ours alone.  I am glad that Senator Murphy, in spite of my reservations earlier, has raised this subject.  I believe it is important that we have a full debate on this.  I would be happier if he had raised it without bringing in all sorts of spectres of conspiracy theories, of backdoor diplomacy, of a decision being forced upon us.  My last word on this matter is that our neutrality is probably the single most visible element of our sovereignty but sovereignty also means the right to change our minds and if at some stage, after proper consultation, we change our minds then we are nonetheless sovereign for that.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Adjournment I was in the course of making some final remarks.  I wanted to make the point that the only way one can be assured of 100 per cent safety is not to go to work at all.  Since that is not a feasible proposition, there is one way which is certainly feasible and that is to use preventative measures.  Prevention is clearly better than cure and if one has the state of mind and commitment on the part of employers and employees to implement and uphold safety standards one is a long way towards success in meeting the requirements of the Bill.  The priority that is given to it by both sides at the workplace is of vital importance.  Certainly if they have engaged in dialogue to agree, through consultation, exactly what the practices should be, that commitment to making the thing work is already there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are pragmatic reasons for both sides to be interested in adhering to the provisions of the Bill, but the reality is that both in financial and human terms safety can be a very costly business for the individual concerned, for employers and for the economy as a whole.  As far as employees are concerned &mdash; and I want to pick up the point made by Senator Manning there &mdash; individual employees owe it to their fellow employees to be careful and to abide by safety provisions and safety standards.  If they adopt that mentality and act accordingly they are <Col N="660" /> almost there.  As far as employers are concerned it is necessary for all levels of management to treat safety as an integral part of the management job, to treat it in that serious way, and implement the required standards.  There is the risk, obviously, in recessionary conditions that investment in training tends to be cut back but on purely financial grounds alone, training in safety is money well spent, not least because of the many thousands of claims each year under the heading of occupational accidents and diseases outlined in the Minister's statement. Clearly, employers would save money by actually investing in training and getting a better safety record in the workplace.  I join in the welcome for this Bill and regard it as a very important reforming measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Senators' support for the Bill and I fully agree that there is a pressing need to extend the scope of occupational safety and health legislation to all sectors of work and in particular to agriculture which has an appalling safety record which is not covered under present legislation.  We are all aware of the fatality figures if not the injury figures from the agricultural sector.  The Authority will devote much of their resources to the high risk sectors.  Enforcement will be the core activity of the Authority.  Information, advice, guidance and persuasion will form the major parts of the enforcement chain.  Only when this support is ignored or disregarded will legal sanctions be taken.  This method of enforcement is cost-effective and acceptable to the social partners as well being in accordance with the International Labour Office Convention on Labour Inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wholeheartedly agree with Senator Hillery that safety is a state of mind which can only be developed at the workplace if there is a meaningful dialogue between management and workers.  The safety requirement in the Bill will be a great <Col N="661" /> spur to people to have safety in mind in the normal course of their duties.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning raised a number of questions which I will try to deal with. He spoke about tying the hands of the Authority with too much bureaucracy so that they cannot freely carry out their duties.  The controls provided for in the Bill are standard provisions.  There is nothing exceptional in them.  The Authority will be independent with the exception of the usual provisions for a State-sponsored body.  The Minister is obliged in terms of his protfolio always to continue his interest in overall policy in relation to semi-State bodies, and this is no different.  The Minister for Labour will continue to have an interest in overall policy in the area of safety and health at work.  He will, therefore, have contact with the Authority as regards its broad policy directives.  He will not become involved in the day-to-day matters and the Bill makes clear the responsibility of the Authority for enforcing the legislation. The Authority will decide their priority in this regard.  That was one aspect of the Authority being outside the Department.  Justice Barrington and the interim board argued that the Authority should be free from the departmental structure and should stand on their own with their own responsibilities and rights as far as recruiting and hiring staff is concerned.</P>
    <P>Over all the role of the Minister will be to give strong support to the Authority, to help them to achieve the objectives of the legislation, to make the case in Cabinet for resources.  I agree with what Senators have said about resources but, as the Seanad will appreciate, the Authority cannot earmark the funds. This will be a matter to be worked out on the Estimates and Budget debates in an effort to ensure that the resources are provided.  The Minister for Labour will have to argue for the Authority's resources so that they can carry out their work.  It will be his task to ensure that <Col N="662" /> the appropriate priority is given to occupational safety and health in the national agenda.  The fact that this new Authority has been set up at a time when the Government, with the support of almost all Members of both Houses, is closing up organisations, is an indication of the priority the Government are giving this legislation.  It is the only organisation which is totally new in the life of this Government.  I am very happy that I was able to convince my colleagues in the Houses of the Oireachtas that this legislation is necessary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We obviously got through Bord &ldquo;Snip&rdquo; too.  Section 9 of the Bill sets out the duties of employees as requested by Senator Manning.  These duties may be summarised as requiring employees to take reasonable care of their own safety, health and welfare and that of any other person and to co-operate with their employer and any other person so as to enable them to comply with their legal obligations in relation to safety and health at work.  The general duties as set out in section 9 of the Bill can be amplified and clarified in regulations and code of practice as appropriate. As Senator Manning said, it has not been the practice to prosecute employees under the Safety in Industries Act, not least because the employee is often the person who has suffered the injury.  This may change because both employers and workers' representatives will be involved in policy formulation and implementation at the highest levels. This may result in the adoption of a different policy in relation to prosecutions under the authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the level of fines there has been a lot of debate and no doubt when we come to Committee Stage there will be further debate on this.  I appreciate the concern that an adequate level of fine should be provided for under the Bill.  It <Col N="663" /> is important, however, that the possibility of summary proceedings in the District Court be retained.  This is less costly on the State, which is a good reason to start with.  Despite the limit of £1,000 for District Court proceedings, the fact of taking an employer or a worker to court can have strong exemplary effect because the defendant suffers a loss of image.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning made the point that perhaps a fine would not embarrass him. If a person is going to break the law, the level of the fine, no matter how big it is, will not stop him.  By increasing the fine, you will not necessarily prevent the person from committing the crime again but you provide a deterrent.  The vast majority of decent, honourable people do not like the idea of a prosecution of any kind.  It is a matter of their own self-esteem and pride and that has been proven in a lot of cases.</P>
    <P>The summary proceedings under the Bill should be taken by the Authority or enforcing agents and proceedings on indictment would be taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions if necessary on foot of an approach to him by the Authority or an enforcing agency.  In taking proceedings, a number of important factors would have to be taken into account including, first, the gravity of the matter which gave rise to the proceedings and, secondly, the need to avoid the higher level of costs which would arise in relation to less serious contraventions if proceedings could only be taken to the higher court.  I feel that the facility of taking summary proceedings in the District Court should remain and would be valuable to the Authority in regard to the many offences which can arise under the Bill, even though the fine is limited to £1,000.</P>
    <P>However, the Bill, as I stated at the outset, also provides for the possibility of proceedings on indictment in respect of the more serious offences.  The fines which may be imposed on conviction and indictment are not specified in the Bill. <Col N="664" /> In practice the maximum fine which the Circuit Court may currently impose is £15,000.  The High Court of course may impose an unlimited fine if the accident or the offence is serious enough.  The thrust of this legislation and the whole consensus approach of having the social partners involved is to try to get people to think and act and not just to be seen to be enforcing the law by prosecutions. The Act provides the powers necessary to deal with people who just ignore the whole thrust and spirit of the Bill.  Generally, we are not seeking to obtain under the provisions of this Bill jail sentences of two years or £15,000 fines for people who break the law.  The legislation is based very much on another philosophy which is that of people thinking and acting in a responsible way whether they be employees, employers or self-employed people.  That is the philosophy which I have put forward in this House and the other House and which the Authority will put forward as well.  If it is only based on fines and punishment, people will not necessarily follow it.</P>
    <P>That is what Senator Manning outlined correctly regarding other legislation.  He said if it is based on fines and on imposing fines, you do not necessarily get the corrective action that you need and I would agree with him on that.  This legislation is based on the idea that it is good for everybody.  It is good for your health and safety and for that of your fellow workers and employer.  It also deals with accidents and sadness arising out of those, inconvenience and costs to the individual, loss of wages and salaries and loss of benefits. There are huge savings to the employer as well from the point of view of insurance claims and costs when employees are out of work.  All these things add up to being an incentive for people to comply with this legislation.</P>
    <P>I note Senator Hillery's comment in relation to the six EC Directives which form part of the social element of the completion of the internal market.  These Directives tie in with the provisions of <Col N="665" /> the Bill.  It is not anticipated that their implementation will impose an undue burden on Irish employers.  These Directives will not take effect until 1992 or afterwards.  We had been so far behind in our legislation that only one-fifth of our population were covered by it but so much work has been done, particularly during the last two years in Europe, that we have been able to bring our legislation right up to date.  A lot of movements in Europe, as the Senators will know, took place and are still taking place as part of the social charter.  We are in the unique position that this Act brings us right back up to the forefront in regard to up-to-date legislation.  Certain matters which are not up-to-date can be easily changed in codes of practice and regulations without having to come back to the Dáil and Seanad at a future time.  The legislation can be amended by way of regulations.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning also referred to environmental issues.  He will appreciate that another Minister, in this case the Minister for the Environment, has overall responsibility for environment matters. He enforces a body of legislation dealing with such issues as pollution and waste disposal.  This situation is reflected in the terms of reference given to the Barrington Commission at the outset which specifically excluded an examination of general environmental pollution issues.  Nonetheless several activities on the safety and health side have a spin-off effect in the environmental area, particularly controls on dangerous substances and the operation of large chemical plants.  The so-called Seveso regulations are important in this regard.  Companies must have plans drawn up covering the on-site risk created by such plants and in turn, in liaison with the inspectors, the local fire services, health authorities and the Garda drawn up off-site plans to protect the public and the environment.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill is important in that it places an obligation on the employer or self-employed person in relation to <Col N="666" /> persons other than his employees who may be affected by his work activities. The main thrust of the legislation is however quite correctly directed towards the elimination of risks to workers in the workplace and I do not believe it would be advisable to depart from that central objective.</P>
    <P>Finally I would just like to thank the Senators, particularly Senators Manning and Hillery, for their contributions and support for the Bill in terms of social progress.  It is a radical measure and it will benefit our entire workforce.  I look forward to the debate in this House on the remaining Stages at as early a date as possible.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for having come to the House this evening to hear my representation on behalf of Gairmscoil Cholmcille, Knock, Inverin.  The problem obtaining at that school arose before the present Minister assumed office.</P>
      <P>As a member of Galway Vocational Education Committee and of the board of management of the school I should say we are most grateful to the Minister and her Minister of State for having visited the school during the summer when they saw for themselves the problems obtaining there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="667" /> This school was built in 1955 for a student population of 55.  As the House may be aware, this school is located in the heart of the Gaeltacht laying halfway between Galway city and Carraroe.  It is not only most important to the immediate area of Inverin.  Students attending the school come from as far away as Rossaveel, some even come from Furbo and some from Spiddal even though there is a secondary school in Spiddal, but this is an excellent vocational school whose teachers are of the highest standard. Indeed the results achieved at the school in recent years could be described as more than outstanding.</P>
    <P>When the school was built in 1955 it consisted of five permanent classrooms. Two prefabricated classrooms were added in 1966 and 1967, both of which are now in a very poor state of repair. Over £4,000 has been spent on both of these rooms in order to prop up the roof which was near to collapse about two years ago.  Subsequently, because of overcrowding the school management had to rent office space across the road from Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, there is a regional road linking Inverin with the fishing harbour at Rossaveel, and this runs between the school and the offices they are using at this time.  This makes it very dangerous for the students crossing the road.  The teachers tell me that they are always afraid of some fatal accident happening, but thank God, so far that has been avoided.  In 1966 a pre-fabricated classroom was taken from the vocational school in Cornamona and rebuilt at Gairmscoil Cholmcille.  This is now also in very poor condition.</P>
    <P>Last year there were 214 students on the roll, and according to the numbers applying this year they expect to have 52 students by next September, which will bring the roll up to about 230.  They started with 55 students, in 1981-82 they had 110 students, and now they have <Col N="668" /> approximately 230 students.  That is where the main problem lies.</P>
    <P>The facilities in all the technical subject rooms are obsolete.  Over half the science classes are taught in general subject classrooms.  Physics and chemistry is taught in general subject classrooms, so there are no facilities for practical work. French is being taught in the metal room which is away, in fact, from the school, itself.  General subjects are taught in the typing room which means that the 28 typewriters must be removed from the desktops at the beginning of the classes and restored at the end of each class. Another problem is that the sanitary and toilet facilities are totally inadequate. There are three toilets for use by approximately 100 girls.  There are 24 coat hangers in the toilet room which also accommodates all the coats of these girls. There are three toilets and one urinal for over 100 boys and eight male teachers. There are also 24 coat hangers in the toilet which is the cloakroom for all the boys.  The only sporting facilities available for 214 students is an undersized basketball court.  There are no changing rooms or shower facilities.</P>
    <P>That is a general outline of the problem. This has been a problem for long before Deputy O'Rourke became Minister. I have highlighted it because of the present circumstances.  If we knew that the extension would go ahead, either this year or next year, it would at least give us an idea of what exactly is happening. The students and parents are concerned. The school results have been one of the best within the VEC.  The standard of teaching is very high.  It is an all Gaeltacht school in the middle of the Gaeltacht. We are grateful to Údarás Na Gaeltachta for facilitating us in the office space across the road from the school.</P>
    <P>I am very grateful to the Minister for coming in to the House.  She took it upon herself to visit the school.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm bheith anseo <Col N="669" /> anocht chun an ábhar seo, Scoil Naomh Colmcille, a phlé.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the accommodation problems at the school, having visited there last year with my colleague Deputy Frank Fahey, and indeed you, Senator, were kind enough on that occasion to come to meet us.  We had a very full visit to all of the classrooms and saw the conditions at the school.  Had I the leeway within my capital programme for post primary buildings, I would wish to go ahead with this extension.  The future requirements of the school have been carefully examined by my Department and agreement in principle has been reached on the type of accommodation that is needed.  This includes a new extension with a total floor area of 625 square metres and the upgrading of the existing accommodation.  The accommodation which will be available when the extension and renovation is completed will comprise two general classrooms, a library-classroom, group-remedial room, home economics room, science laboratory, metalwork room, woodwork room, store, physical education hall with changing facilities, and ancillary accommodation such as cloakrooms, toilets, boiler houses etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present proposal is costed at £0.5 million.  Of course, it would be a major improvement on the facilities offered.  I appreciate, having listened to you tonight and having visited the school, that having regard to the accommodation available at present, the school authorities, teachers, parents and pupils would wish to have the project commence as soon as possible. However, the planning of each project involving the provision of new permanent accommodation is a detailed and complex process, but most of all there is the need for money.  I could outline the six stages, but the project has reached the bills of quantity stage, which is the fifth of the six stages of planning.  The bills of quantities have been submitted to the Department by the consultants and these are under consideration at present. <Col N="670" /> However, it has not been possible to clear this stage of planning and to authorise the invitation of tenders due to the budgetary constraints currently affecting the Public Capital Programme.  That is the bottom line.  There are over 250 capital projects in the pipeline.  I have visited most of them.  Most classes are in complete prefab accommodation, without any proper classrooms at all.</P>
    <P>First of all Inverin is a stand-alone school serving a catchment area and that type of school is what I want to prioritise for capital spending, if and when I get it. It also has a very high reputation.  I know that from visiting the school and from what people tell me all the way between Spiddal and Inverin.  They comment on the quality of teaching, the fact that it fits into the environment very much, the type of courses on offer and the excellent rapport between the parents and the school management and the teachers.  This is all to its credit.  Nothing would give me greater joy than to come here tonight and to tell you: &ldquo;Yes, I will open up my purse, so to speak, and hand out the money&rdquo;. But the facts of the matter are that I cannot sanction this because I have not got the back up money to do it.  Often I receive letters, indeed I am not referring to you, Senator &mdash; we have had the utmost of good relations and courtesy between us &mdash; which say: &ldquo;You are such a cruel Minister, why do you not, with just one stroke of the pen, sanction this school?&rdquo;. But one stroke of the pen might mean £0.5 million or £1 million or in some instances £2 or £3 million.  So it is not a stroke of a pen.  It is much more than that. I have to say to you that, if it becomes possible to consider authorising the invitation to tender of any projects this year, Inverin will be one of the schools I will give priority to and I think that is a fair commitment.  As of now I do not have the capital, nor am I likely to have in this year.  You asked if I could give a sort of an IOU for 1990.  It would be quite an improper procedure to allocate moneys for 1990 which would not have <Col N="671" /> been voted through by the Dáil on the Estimates.  I would not be able to do it. But I give you a commitment that should capital become available to me for second level building projects, Gairmscoil Cholmcille, Indreabhán, County Galway will certainly receive the very highest <Col N="672" /> priority.  I am glad to have been here tonight to have heard your undoubted commitment to the school and to the neighbourhood.</P>
