      <P>I have notice from Senatcr Mick Lanigan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The improving trends and prospects in the public finances and the Irish economy in general.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator David Norris of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to give a categorical assurance that in the reorganisation of the Dublin hospitals and the eventual absorption of the Adelaide Hospital into the new hospital at Tallaght the different ethical approach embodied in that hospital's tradition will not be overwhelmed by the dominant ethos of the Catholic ethia committees.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Lanigan and Norris as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matter raised by Senator Lanigan and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Norris may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business will be vehemently opposed today, but before giving the reasons I join with the Cathaoirleach in welcoming the three new Members to the House.  I also congratulate those from this House who have moved to the other House.  Like the Cathaoirleach, I wish them a lengthy stay in the lower House, and I would ask the Chair to use her influence to turn that aspiration into a reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2331" /> It is very difficult to say this in the very uncertain situation in which we find ourselves, not knowing whether we will face one or two elections, but I learned with regret that Senator Willie Ryan will not be contesting the next election to the Seanad.  On behalf of the Fine Gael Party I simply put on record our appreciation of his contribution to this House over the last quarter of a century or more.  Senator Ryan has always been a person of the highest integrity and courtesy and he has personified all that is best in this House. Certainly, this House will be the poorer for his absence from it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage I must say why I am vehemently opposing the Order of Business today.  To ask us to take two major pieces of legislation through all Stages on the same day is simply not acceptable.  To do so when this House has been depleted through the election of 15 of its Members to the lower House is to ask us to process through legislation in an incomplete Chamber.  It was never intended that the House should be used in this way.  The shortage of Members is largely on this side of the House.  Our environmental spokesman, for example, was elected to the Dáil and we have not reappointed someone to that brief.  We do not have anyone appointed to look after the Building Societies Bill.  In the current situation it would be unreal and unfair to ask someone to take on that brief at short notice.</P>
      <P>As well as that we are meeting today in the middle of the Seanad campaign. That is a time which is not suitable for the reflection and detailed consideration which these Bills require.  Never before has this House been asked in the midst of an election campaign to process major legislation, to complete two Bills on the same day.  It is simply not acceptable certainly on this side of the House and it is bringing the Seanad into disrepute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are also opposing the Order of Business today because of the legal and constitutional uncertainty within which <Col N="2332" /> we are operating.  At the moment we have a caretaker Government.  Our reading of the Constitution is that the Government have the duty to carry out certain functions but they are very limited and our advice is that the Government do not have the right to process legislation.  They are not doing so and would not attempt to do so in the other House.  Our legal advice which has been of a consistently higher quality than that obtaining on the Government side is that we are meeting under a constitutional cloud given the presence of an acting Government who do not have the right to process legislation through this House today.  Before we move on, I would like to see the legal advice upon which the decision of the Leader of the House and the Government to call us here today was based.</P>
    <P>For all those reasons we will be vehemently opposing the entire Order of Business today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with all that Senator Manning has just said.  I would also place on record my appreciation of the courteous and tolerant relationship.  T have always had with Senator Willie Ryan during my time as co-ordinator of the Independent group.  I regret that the Senator is not going forward again.  We have basic philosophical differences on matters of policy but in dealing with Senator Willie Ryan, I have always found him to be honourable, reliable and courteous. I would place firmly on record my regret that he will not be in the House the next time round.</P>
      <P>I find this cynical misuse of this House today to be most objectionable.  I know the Cathaoirleach will take umbrage at this but the matter being allowed on the Adjournment is not a matter that should be seen as an adjournment matter at all. It is not a matter over which a Minister has power or authority.  It is a cynical attempt to allow a partisan approach and discussion to influence what is happening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that priority was not given to another matter put down by another Member of the House.  Secondly, I think it was very cynically allowed through in order to influence what is happening outside the House and to allow the Government side to make certain noises here this afternoon.  It amounts to no more than that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Since Christmas, time and again we have raised with the Leader of the House the need to bring legislation before us.  We had major rows here on three occasions when we called for extra sittings of the House to deal with the legislation on hand.  The last time we discussed this matter, I listed the legislation that remained to be dealt with, including the two Bills we are faced with today.  I indicated that it would take a certain amount of time to process that legislation through the House and we got all sorts of guarantees from the Leader &mdash; his usual baseless guarantees, the words he normally uses are &ldquo;a promise, but not a solemn promise&rdquo;.  You will recall, a Chathaoirligh, that that was the last effort he made to wriggle out of a <Col N="2334" /> commitment given.  The promise was not a solemn promise, it was merely a Fianna Fáil Leader's promise.  It is unacceptable that we should be treated in that way.  I think we are being treated very&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole is well able to look after himself.  Senator O'Toole to continue without interruption. Could we stick to deciding whether we are in agreement with today's Order of Business and let the Leader in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure you that I do not agree with today's Order of Business.  I would like to figure out how the Leader of the House expects these matters to be adequately dealt with today, even with a full Chamber, but a half Chamber it will be absolutely impossible to do so.  He is simply exploiting a situation where there are so few Members in the non-Government benches &mdash; and I choose my words carefully. This is not acceptable.  We are now faced with putting through legislation without due consideration and without having an appropriate amount of time to consider amendments.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House how he expects us to deal with Second Stage today, consider the Minister's response and then deal with amendments?  Are we back to the old story of Fianna Fáil dropping the guillotine to rush through legislation?  It is a very solemn lesson to the rest of us as to why that party should be kept in check.  When they have power they seek to abuse it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made my point and I hope it is not lost on the Leader of the House because sometimes I find him <Col N="2335" /> quite insensitive to the most straightforward comments.</P>
      <P>I would also like to ask the Leader if he will make time available today to discuss the totally unprecedented situation which would arise, in the Seanad elections, if the Taoiseach decides to dissolve the Lower House would there be a second Seanad election?  This would have grave implications for us and I need your guidance, a Chathaoirligh, as to how this matter might be dealt with.  It would not be appropriate to raise it under Standing Order 29 or anything else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a legal matter.  I am not in a position to help you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  The Constitution, for which we are partly responsible, states that a general election for Seanad Eíreann shall take place not later than 90 days after a dissolution of Ditil Éireann.  If the Lower House is dissolved this week and the election for the Lower House takes place before the election for the Seanad, that would seem to fulfil the constitutional requirement and there will be absolutely no need for a second Seanad election.  I have been led to believe that the Acting Minister for the Environment has indicated that in the event of the Dáil being dissolved, there will be a second Seanad election.  I want to place on record that there is no constitutional requirement to have a second Seanad election.  All it does of course is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Leader of the House, on the Order of Business, if he would make time available for a discussion on a most substantive matter, which has relevance to the workings of this House.  The Minister should be called in here and asked to explain what he <Col N="2336" /> intends to do in this eventuality on which the Constitution is silent.  It is not necessary to have a second Seanad election.  I certainly would oppose the holding of one and, if possible, would mount a Supreme Court case on the matter.  A second Seanad election would merely be facilitating people outside this House.  It is unnecessary and it is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to ask two questions of the Leader of the House.  In the light of the extraordinary position of Mr. Haughey in the Dáil a couple of days ago, in which he stated that this is not only the best Government this country has had for the last while and also that <Col N="2337" /> he has produced the most progressive legislation in Europe</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to extract an answer which will clarify for me whether the Government of this country have the slightest respect for the European Court of Human Rights and whether they will honour the undertaking they gave in the light of the fact that the former Taoiseach has claimed that this Government have produced the most progressive social legislation in Europe?  Is he going to do something about the judgment of the Strasbourg&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking whether legislation is to be introduced on this matter. I also would like to ask, and here I support my colleague Senator O'Toole whether there will be any discussion on the constitutional problems involved in the Seanad election.  I think that would be welcome.  I have in fact put a section 29 motion in to have this whole political crisis discussed this afternoon.  It will be interesting to see whether this is deemed to be a crisis or a matter of national importance.</P>
      <P>I would like also to ask when the report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is to come to this House which signally failed to meet and to which I was advised to refer the matter of a misleading statement made to the House by a Minister.  I was told there was a report coming to the House.</P>

      <P>I want to raise two further matters.  The first is one that you have traditionally allowed, that is, the question of difficulties that Members experience with regard to the facilities of the House. I would like to point out with regard to the present situation, while we are all involved in an election, it is very frustrating not to have access to offices and telephones over a weekend when most of us would like to put in some work.  I would like to know if any help can be given on that matter.  Of course it would be improper of me to challenge your ruling on the question of the Adelaide Hospital and I will not do so, but I would like to ask the Leader of the House if there is not an intention for the House to sit again before the election for Seanad Éireann so that this important matter may be placed yet again because it has <Col N="2339" /> been ruled several times as an appropriate matter and yet it has not been taken.</P>

I was very sad to hear about Senator Ryan and I hope everything in his future life works out well for him.</P>

My attitude, quite frankly, to the whole business today is that we should behave and act in accordance with the Order of Business.  I think there is a case for the adjournment of the Seanad based on what was said by Senator Maurice Manning &mdash; that, in fact, we are depleted in numbers.  The Seanad election is going on at the moment and there is a constitutional difficulty.  In all of those events the wisest thing for us to do would be to adjourn the business of this House and I propose it.</P>

      <P>First of all, I would like to join with my colleagues on these benches in welcoming the three new Members of the House for their short stay here. Secondly, I would also like to echo the words of Senator Manning and other Independent Senators in expressing a deep regret that Senator Willie Ryan will not be here during the next Seanad, and will not be here voluntarily.  He has been here all the time I have been in the Seanad and I never had from him anything but courtesy and co-operation despite the fact that obviously we did not agree about a great many things.  Having said that, if I had had to support the decisions of the Leader of the House for the last six months I do not think I would have stayed here much longer either.  I have every sympathy with Senator Ryan.</P>

I say in total sincerity and with great solemnness, that the past six months in this House have been the worst in the four Seanads in which I have sat and it is laid simply at the door of the Government party who have treated this House with contempt week after week after week.  I cannot believe that Senator Lanigan could come to this House and say that they intend to put items Nos. 1 and 2 through today full stop. Nowhere&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Let me read into the record a few words on this, and it is important <Col N="2343" /> they are read into the record because we had this before.  I asked this question, as did Senator O'Toole, why is Government business being railroaded through this House and agreements being broken in order to facilitate it?

In reply to this question he said here, &ldquo;Mention has been made of solemn agreements&rdquo;, but Senator Lanigan said that there is an agreement which is not solemn.  I have never heard such a farcical answer in my life.  I presume that Senator Lanigan will be able to withdraw that and that he will be able to confer some sort of solemnity on the agreement we have this afternoon and perhaps tell us why it is being breached again.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated to Senator Wllie Ryan the extent of my regret at his decision not to run again for the Seanad.  There were two things about Senator Willie Ryan that made an enormous impression on me.  One was his absolute truthfulness, even when that was difficult in terms of how, perhaps, senior members of his party in Government treated him in terms of what they asked him to do.  I never found that Senator Willie Ryan deliberately, or in any way, deceived me either privately or publicly.  In politics, that is a considerable compliment to have paid to one.  I do not easily pay compliments to people in politics.  In particular, I do not easily pay compliments to people on that side of the House.  The compliments to Senator Willie Ryan are well earned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second compliment that I will pay to him reflects much on my personal background, because Senator Willie Ryan reflects the Fianna Fáil I used to know and with which I used to have a family association, a Fianna Fáil of decent values, of small people, who were not tangled up with the rottenness of big business and corruption.  That is what people like Senator Willie Ryan stood for and stand for.  That is particularly why I regret his departure because that sort of Fianna Fáil is the sort of Fianna Fáil that I used to associate with in my youth for the very good reason that they were representative of those values.  They were conservative values, some of which I would not agree with now, but they were decent values, they were human values, they were real values of real people <Col N="2345" /> struggling to live in a real world.  The departure of Senator Willie Ryan is one more step away from that sort of Fianna Fáil, the sort of Fianna Fáil that people like myself, my father and my family could associate with.  For that second reason I very much regret Senator Willie Ryan's departure from this House.</P>
    <P>Did the Cathaoirleach give any consideration as Cathaoirleach, as a person who represents this House and who directs when this House should meet to the appropriateness of this House meeting? I do not want to know how you came to a decision, I should like to know if you even thought about it because indeed you should consider the question of whether it is appropriate for this House to meet under the circumstances.  We have a caretaker Government, a caretaker Taoiseach and caretaker Ministers until we elect a Government, We do not have a Government, we have a constitutional necessity in an <i>interregnum</i>.  It is singularly inappropriate for this House to discuss legislation which was initiated by a defeated Government, a Government who did not get the support of the people, who indeed lost support.  It is singularly and totally inappropriate that legislation introduced by a failed Government, a Government of losers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will.  I am sorry but I was provoked by Senator Cassidy.  I am intrigued as to the urgency of these two Bills.  They are both important Bills and were debated extensively in the other House.  They are not matters which caused fundamental conflict between what was then the governing <i>ad hoc</i> Coalition and I keep wondering why, all of a sudden, we have to rush these Bills through.  Is there a crisis?  I do not think so.  Either we are worried about the capacity of the Central Bank to act on some immediate problem &mdash; after all, Senator Lanigan's motion on the Adjournment suggests that there has been an enormous boom which the 250,000 unemployed people will be relieved to hear about &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Before I support my leader, Senator Manning, in opposing the Order of Business, I should like to pay tribute to Senator Willie Ryan who has made what must have been a momentous decision for him not to contest the forthcoming Seanad election.  Others have spoken about his decency, his gentlemanly qualities and his quiet courtesy and charm and I should like to add that I concur with all that has been said about him.  I wish him well in his retirement. The House will be the poorer for his decision.  I should like to congratulate the 15 colleagues of all parties who have succeeded in being elected to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak with feeling on the Order of Business as my party's spokesman on Finance. I have been waiting for some time for the Central Bank Bill to be introduced in the House and making appropriate preparations and I am shocked, and, indeed, scandalised, to think that it is <Col N="2351" /> proposed to dispose of all Stages today. I should like to make the point that there are nine Chapters and 141 sections in the Central Bank Bill.  I believe that we have a basic duty in the House to deal adequately with legislation and give it the detailed attention that is so manifestly required.  It is a particular attribute of the House that, by and large, party political rancour does not enter into debates on this type of legislation.  Those of us who have an interest in such legislation, and are equipped to deal with it, can give it the detailed exposition that it requires. This is one of the most significant financial Bills to come before the House; it is of great importance.  It is my view that to deal with it, and the Building Societies Bill, in a one-day sitting will do the legislation and the House a disservice.  It is not in the best interests of democracy to deal with the Bills in this way.  We have been elected to the House to preserve and to cherish.  I am appalled and scandalised that we are being asked to deal with two major pieces of legislation in this way.</P>
    <P>I cannot express myself strongly or vehemently enough in regard to this issue.  I do not wish to score points but I want to see justice done to two major Bills.  So strongly do my party feel about this, and so conscious are we of the jack-booted response we expect as a consequence of the vote on the Order of Business, that I am giving notice that, should the vote result in the Order of Business being passed, we intend doing something we never contemplated before; we will withdraw from the House and not participate in the debates on the Bills.  We will do that because we feel so strongly about the introduction of the Bills.  We are unhappy about the strange nature of the back-drop against which the House is operating today.  We are absolutely opposed to dealing with these Bills in this offhand, cavalier fashion.</P>

      <P>I should like to add my tribute to my colleague, Senator Willie Ryan, and wish him a happy retirement. <Col N="2352" /> To our colleagues who were successful in the general election, I should like to wish them continued success.  I should like to endorse what Senator Bulbulia has said about the heavy and complicated Bills that are listed on today's Order of Business.  I hope the Leader of the House will have second thoughts about his proposal that the House should deal with all Stages of those Bills today.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with other members in paying tribute to Senator Willie Ryan for his long service to the House.  A fellow Tipperary man, I have known Senator Ryan for a long time and his honesty, integrity and calmness in any situation are attributes we should think about.  He will be a big loss to the House and to our party.  I expect that he will continue to be an active member of our party for many years.  If we all reflected on the attitude and respect Senator Ryan had for the House in the last 28 years, we would be doing a service to the House and the people who elected us.  I should like to congratulate Members who were elected to Dáil Éireann and wish them well.  I should like to welcome the three new Senators who were appointed by the Taoiseach recently.  I hope they will gain some experience from today's sitting.  We should act as mature people here.  We have wasted almost one hour today and if we had not wasted so much time in the last two years we would have had more time to deal with other issues.</P>

      <P>Comments were passed about the fact that the House is sitting today and a reference to the fact that we are sitting under strange circumstances because of a shortage of numbers.  I cannot understand those comments.  The Seanad has sat after the dissolution of Dáileanna on many occasions.  This is not a precedent.  I should like to remind the leader of the Fine Gael Party in the House, who may not have been a Member in 1982, that we passed a number of Bills after the dissolution of the Dáil.  We took all Stages of those Bills at that time.  There is a precedent for the House sitting.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, may I seek your indulgence for a moment.  A certain situation has arisen in the House which has caused total and grave disquiet to all on the Opposition benches.  It is utterly unacceptable to us that we take all Stages of the two Bills today.  I am putting forward a compromise with the agreement of all the groups on the Opposition side of the House.  We would be agreeable to take the Second Stage of both Bills today and to defer taking Committee Stage.  We think that is reasonable.  It would save us from having to take the extreme sanction &mdash; which we do not want to take &mdash; of having to withdraw from the House in protest.</P>
      <P>I am now proposing a short adjournment during which the Whips could agree to a revised Order of Business.  We would be agreeable to take Second Stage of both Bills today.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, as you know, we adjourned for ten minutes to see if some compromise could be reached on the day's business.  I regret to say that the proposals made by the Government side are not acceptable.  The main compromise proposals made are that we take all Stages of the Building Societies Bill today, all Stages of the Central Bank Bill tomorrow or that we take Second Stage of each Bill today and the Committee Stage of each Bill tomorrow. They are not acceptable for the simple reason that there are 270 sections in these two Bills of very complicated legislation. We are meeting here under the shadow of an acting Government.  It is not acceptable to us that legislation be rushed through in this way.  What is being asked of us by the Government side is not reasonable and it is with great reluctance, great regret and great sadness that I have to say that if the Government insist on steamrolling these two items of legislation through today we will have no option but to depart from the Seanad, to boycott the proceedings.  It is something we would do with utmost regret but a reasonable proposal has not been made from the Government side.</P>

    <P>Tá anois sa Bhille seo an t-athdhéanamh is chuimsithí riamh ar an dlí cumann foirgníochta.  Cinnte is Bille mór é agus tá bunchloch ann ar a bhféadfaidh na cumann foirgníochta dul i láidreacht amach anseo agus leanúint orthu ag cur seirbhís fhiúntach ar fáil don phobal agus ar son na tíre i gcoitinne.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to modernise the law relating to building societies.  It has been amended in a number of respects in the course of its passage through Dáil Éireann.  The Bill which has been circulated to Senators should, I hope, prove to be generally acceptable as a new legislative code for an important segment of our financial services industry and the single most important source of mortgage finance for housing.</P>
    <P>Before outlining the key features of the Bill I would like to say a few words about the role of societies to date and to explain why I think the Bill is necessary. At present societies have assets in excess of £3.8 billion and a total membership of approximately 1¼ million.  They hold approximately 20 per cent of community savings and over the past ten years have provided more than 60 per cent of the loan finance for the purchase and provision of housing.  It will be clear from these few statistics, and I am sure from the personal experience of Senators, that societies play a very major role in the housing sector and in the financial services industry.</P>
    <P>Societies have achieved this prominent position from very humble beginnings. They have adapted, grown and developed to meet the changing needs of their members.  This growth and development, however, has taken place within the confines of a restrictive legislative code.  It has, in fact, been argued that the success of societies to date is evidence <Col N="2367" /> that there is no need to relax the legislative restrictions.  This view, however, ignores fundamental changes that have been taking place in the financial services marketplace and which make it imperative for the continued well-being of socieites that the restrictions under which they operate be relaxed.</P>
    <P>The main changes I have in mind here are as follows:</P>
    <P>(1) The breakdown of the barriers between different kinds of financial services.  Up to recently we had a very segmented financial system.  All the players in that system, banks, insurance companies, stockbrokers etc. concentrated on their particular speciality.  In recent years, however, there has been a noticeable blurring of the boundaries and a distinct move towards the integration of the different types of services.  There is a move on the part of the major financial institutions towards the &ldquo;one stop shop&rdquo; concept in an effort to meet as many as possible of people's needs for financial services of various kinds.</P>
    <P>(2) The increased competition for business and the variety of lending and savings products now available from a wide range of different institutions is evidence of the intensity of competition. Building societies have experienced this competition both in attracting funds and in the mortgage market.</P>
    <P>(3) There is the imminence of competition from abroad.  The various moves at EC level to break down international barriers will eventually result in increased competition from foreign financial institutions from other member states.</P>
    <P>These changes make it imperative that we have in place a modern comprehensive legislative code that will enable societies to compete effectively and on a broader front and that will allow societies to pursue opportunities for growth and development not open to them at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2368" /> I do not propose to go into too much detail on the contents of the Bill as the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill is quite comprehensive.</P>
    <P>Part I contains the usual general provisions. Section 4 gives the Minister a limited power to remove by regulation difficulties in bringing a provision into effect and is intended to enable the Minister to deal with an unforeseen technical difficulty in giving effect to any provision. The power to make regulations under section 4 will expire after three years. As many of the provisions of the Bill correspond to provisions in company and banking legislation, section 5 allows for the extension to societies by ministerial regulation of relevant changes which the Oireachtas makes in such legislation in the future.</P>
    <P>Section 6 repeals all building society legislation currently in force but special provision is made to continue in force in relation to existing and future housing loans those parts of the Building Societies Regulations, 1987, which deal with property insurance, valuation reports, legal fees and so on.  Accordingly, existing and future homebuyers will continue to enjoy all the rights afforded by these regulations. With regard to redemption fees, the ban is only being lifted as respects future fixed interest rate loans and it is being lifted in respect of these loans because the ban makes fixed interest rate loans an unattractive proposition for societies.</P>
    <P>Part II provides for the fundamental ground rules of building society law such as how societies can be formed, how they are incorporated and how they receive permission to raise money from the public.  As well as being required to have a set of rules, each society will now also be required to have a memorandum setting out the objects and powers of that society.  This is considered to be the best method of accommodating the new broad scope of permissible objects that a society can have, and will operate in much the same way as a company's memorandum. Senators will note that the provision of housing finance is a mandatory object of each society and that all other objects <Col N="2369" /> must be within the framework of the legislation.  The Second Schedule lays out in greater detail what is required to be covered in the memorandum and rules.</P>
    <P>At present a society must obtain the approval of the Registrar of Building Societies to advertise for funds.  Following enactment of this Bill a society will be required to obtain an authorisation from the Central Bank before it can raise or solicit funds other than its funding cpaital.  The Central Bank will be able to impose whatever conditions it considers necessary on an authorisation, which will in fact correspond to a banking licence.</P>
    <P>Part III sets out the powers of building societies.  As well as restating existing powers, it contains a wide range of new powers which will enable societies to compete on a much broader front in the marketplace, to offer a more comprehensive service to their members, to the house purchaser and to the general public.  These new powers, prudently undertaken, will give societies an opportunity to develop and grow in the rapidly changing financial services sector and thus to continue to be a major source of funds for housing by providing mortgage loans and by direct investment in residential development.</P>
    <P>The lending powers of societies are set out in sections 22 and 23.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately I was not able to be here at the start of today's business.  On a point of order, will the Chair please explain how it is that two Bills could be ordered today when we have no Government to put forward legislation?  We have an acting Government pending a decision in relation to that matter.  Even if the Chair is in a position to clarify that issue, it is quite clearly a very undesirable proceeding, particularly as there is no one on this side of the House who is prepared even to be present in the Chamber when two very major Bills are being discussed.

      <P>In addition to the traditional lending secured by mortgage of land, societies will be able to offer loans on second mortgage, bridging loans, loans for payment of a deposit for the purchase of property and loans backed by other securities or guarantees as may be approved by the Central Bank.  Societies will also be able to offer, subject to whatever limits the Central Bank imposes, unsecured loans to individuals for house improvement, unsecured loans and overdrafts for general purposes.</P>
      <P>The new power to own and develop land will enable societies to invest directly in the provision of housing for sale or rent and I would hope to see them use this new power to make a contribution to the urban renewal programme by becoming involved in mixed developments. While societies cannot be expected to operate at a loss as social or community improvement agencies their mutual tradition when combined with their wide new powers to invest directly in land, to set up subsidiaries, etc., opens up the prospect of profitable and socially useful joint ventures with local authorities and other organisations.</P>
      <P>The Bill, therefore, opens up wide new horizons for societies in their traditional area of housing.  It will enable them to consolidate and further expand their already very influential position in the housing sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 28 will allow societies to form companies, either alone or in conjunction with others, as subsidiaries of the society <Col N="2373" /> or as joint ventures.  The section will also enable societies to support voluntary and co-operative bodies which provide residential accommodation on a non-profit making basis.</P>
    <P>Under section 29, societies will be able to offer a wide range of financial services to members and other persons.  Financial services have been defined broadly and flexibly.  However, the provision of any of the services listed in section 29 will be subject to the terms of the Central Bank approval and any other legislation that govern the activity in question.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made in Part III for certain non-financial services, such as conveyancing and auctioneering and other services in relation to land.  Given that societies have been extensively involved in housing purchase transactions for so many years, it is only natural to allow them to expand their range of services so as to include the full range associated with these transactions.</P>
    <P>Section 31 amends the Solicitors Act, 1954, so as to allow societies to provide conveyancing services subject to regulations to be made by the Minister for Justice.  Section 32 will allow societies to provide auctioneering services as well as other services such as valuation, property management services, etc.</P>
    <P>All in all, a society will be able to offer a comprehensive house purchase service to its customers.  This in turn, it is hoped, will lead to a reduction in the overall costs to the consumer.  I recognise that there is some potential for conflicts of interests in respect of these activities and I have taken steps to counteract that. The Bill contains a number of provisions aimed at avoiding these problems.  In the case of conveyancing services, the provision of such services to both the vendor and purchaser of the same property is prohibited, thus removing the greatest potential source of conflict of interest.</P>
    <P>The regulations which have to be made before societies can offer conveyancing services will be able to make further provision in relation to conflicts of interest, compensation for negligence, qualifications of persons providing the services and so forth.  Similar regulations can <Col N="2374" /> be made in relation to other property related services if this is shown to be necessary.  In addition I have included provisions to ensure that societies do not engage in anti-competitive pricing in the provision of conveyancing and auctioneering services.  A society is also prohibited from requiring anyone getting a housing loan from it to use other services provided by the society or its subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>Section 18 contains a very wide power for societies to raise funds in Irish or foreign currencies.  I expect that societies will in the future look to the wholesale market for a higher proportion of their funding than they have done to date.  Use of wholesale funding will also, of course, serve to even out the peaks and valleys in society funding and, together with the increased number of mortgage providers, should ensure that we do not have mortgage queues like we had in the past.  For reasons relating to their mutual status and to the supply and cost of mortgages, societies will be required to maintain at least half of their total funding liabilities in the form of shares issued to members.</P>
    <P>In relation to the power to operate abroad it should be noted that even with this power a building society incorporated and authorised in Ireland could not at present operate in, for example, the UK on the same basis as a UK society nor could they set up a subsidiary to take deposits in the UK without authorisation from the Bank of England.  However, under the proposed EC Second Banking and Mortgage Credit Directives an Irish building society would be able to operate throughout the Community under the supervision of their home supervisor, the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>As diversification by societies into any or all of the new activities I have referred to will involve new and different kinds of risks for societies the Bill contains a number of detailed provisions in section 36 requiring that a society must formally adopt by special resolution any of the new powers they wish to exercise and they must obtain the approval of the Central Bank to exercise the power.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank will have wide powers to control the involvement of <Col N="2375" /> societies in the provision of new services and to impose whatever conditions and requirements they consider appropriate. Also, provision is made to allow the Central Bank to restrict the exercise of certain powers to specified categories of societies.</P>
    <P>Before leaving Part III, I would like to say a few words about tiered rates.  In this respect the position has changed radically since the 1986 Act was introduced.  In the first place I should make it clear that tiered rates cannot now or in the future be reintroduced in respect of existing loans. Under the Bill tiered rates may only be charged by a building society on loans made after the commencement of this Bill if a tiered rate is charged from the day the loan is drawn down, the mortgage provides for the charging of a tiered rate and the borrower acknowledges in writing that he is aware that he is being charged a tiered rate.  That is the factual position.  Also bear in mind that there is no restriction of any kind on the charging of tiered rates by other financial institutions engaged in mortgage lending.  It would not make sense to have a ban on tiered rates that applies to only one type of institution providing housing loans and not to others.  The best and most realistic protection against high rates whether in tiered form or otherwise is the existence of a really competitive mortgage market.</P>
    <P>Part IV contains the general provisions relating to the control and prudential supervision of building societies by the Central Bank.  The powers which the bank will have are similar to those they already have or will have under the Central Bank Bill in relation to banks.</P>
    <P>In summary, the Central Bank will be able to: (a) require societies to maintain specified prudential ratios; (b) impose requirements relating to the structure and composition of liabilities and assets &mdash; for example, liquidity requirements; (c) revoke a society's authorisation in certain serious circumstances; and (d) give a direction to a society to suspend for a specified period raising funds or making payments.</P>
    <P>The powers which the Central Bank <Col N="2376" /> will have in relation to a society's authorisation, that is, the power to impose conditions, to give a direction to a society to cease raising funds and to revoke an authorisation are central to the enforcement of the Bank's supervisory functions. Section 40 lays down in considerable detail the circumstances in which the Central Bank may either revoke an authorisation or suspend operations.  The Central Bank will also have wide powers to carry out inspection of a society's books and records, to obtain information relating to the activities of the society, to control the form and content of advertising by societies and to call a special meeting to mount a formal investigation of a society's affairs.  On the other hand, the Bill contains important safeguards by way of procedural requirements and ultimately appeal to the courts in regard to the exercise by the bank of their powers.</P>
    <P>It will be obvious, therefore, that the powers available to the Central Bank will be more extensive and flexible than those currently available to the registrar.  This strengthening of supervisory powers is a necessary aspect of modernisation of the legislation, a necessary concomitant of the broadening of the scope of societies' powers and will bring about a substantial degree of uniformity in supervisory systems. All in all, I am confident that the Bill will provide the basis for an effective system of supervision that will be sympathetic to the development needs of the societies.</P>
    <P>Section 38 is a new provision which recognises the special importance of ensuring an adequate supply of mortgage finance for house purchase and improvement. It would be my intention under this section to regularly monitor the supply and demand of mortgage finance in consultation with the Minister for Finance and to communicate the position to the Central Bank so that any impending shortage of funds would be anticipated and appropriate preventative action considered. It should be noted that we are talking here about the supply of mortgage finance from all sources, not just building societies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2377" /> Turning to the question of the running of societies generally, I have tried to strike the right balance between the role and responsibilities of the directors and those of the members.  The board of directors carry the final responsibility for the overall direction of a society and as such are properly interested in ensuring that the composition of the board is such as to enable the board to effectively and efficiently discharge its responsibilities.  It is the members who elect the directors, however, and to whom the directors must account for their stewardship.  Members therefore must be kept fully informed of major developments affecting the society and members who have a commitment to the society must have a fair chance of putting forward a candidate for election as a director.  Basically it is vital that societies should be seen to be run in the interests of their members.</P>
    <P>Part V deals mainly with the election of directors and a number of situations where a director might be tempted to put his personal interest before that of the society.  It requires every society to have a board of directors elected by the members, a chief executive and secretary. It contains a number of changes in existing legislative provisions and substantial new provisions relating to the election and conduct of directors.  The provisions as drafted will, together with those in Part VI, enhance the confidence of members in the manner in which directors are elected and subsequently conduct themselves as directors.</P>
    <P>Sections 50 and 51 contain extensive provisions in relation to the appointment of directors.  Until regulations were made under the 1986 Bill, building society law contained no particular provisions regarding the election of directors, the eligibility and nomination of candidates, the circulation of an election address and the retirement of directors.  The provisions in the 1987 regulations regarding these matters have been retained in the present Bill but with certain changes.  The effect of these changes is that a society may, (a) increase the maximum shareholding that may be required to nominate or join in nominating a candidate for <Col N="2378" /> election as a director from £10 to £250; and (b) increase the maximum number of qualified members that may be required to nominate a candidate for election as a director from ten to 20.</P>
    <P>The new limits will allow societies to require candidates to demonstrate a reasonable level of support and those nominating them to have a reasonable commitment to the society.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there are important new provisions designed to enhance public confidence in the electoral process. First, a poll, as distinct from a show of hands, must be held on a contested election. Secondly, societies will in future have to appoint an independent person to supervise the conduct of elections and to report to the Central Bank on the conduct of the election stating whether in his opinion the election was conducted in accordance with statutory requirements and otherwise with fairness and integrity.  Thirdly, canvassing by employees at their place of employment or at a meeting of the society will be prohbited.  The Central Bank will also be able, if it considers it to be necessary on the basis of the report from the person who supervised an election, to apply to the High Court for an order setting aside an election.</P>
    <P>Sections 52 to 59 contain provisions on dealings between a society and its directors.  They are designed to ensure that an unscrupulous director does not divert a society's assets for his own personal gain.  The approach adopted is, (a) to prohibit certain dealings between the society and a director or a person connected with him; (b) to require disclosure of all significant dealings between the society and a director or a person connected with him; and (c) to provide for civil liability and penalties in respect of dealings that contravene the requirements of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In addition, section 60 requires societies to maintain and make available for inspection a record of the amount of business being given by the society to any company or firm which has a director of the society as a director or partner.</P>
    <P>Part VI contains a series of detailed <Col N="2379" /> provisions on meetings, resolutions and voting.  Section 69 increases from £10 to £100 the maximum shareholding that can be required of a member to vote on a resolution or in an election of directors. The £10 requirement which was first prescribed in the 1976 Act as a reflection of actual practice at that time has become quite meaningless in terms of today's money values.  The figure of £100 proposed represents a minimal level of commitment to a society which merits enfranchisement.  The section also makes it clear that on a special resolution or a resolution for the conversion of a society into a company each qualified member has one vote.  This is in line with the interpretation of existing legislation by the courts.  A special resolution may only be proposed in relation to certain major decisions such as changes in the memorandum or rules, the adoption of new powers and mergers.</P>
    <P>It is important that the law protects the rights of the ordinary members of mutual bodies such as building societies and gives them a democratic say in the running of affairs.  At the same time societies, as major financial institutions depending for their survival on public confidence, must not be made prey to irresponsible elements who have no real stake in the society.  This legislation strikes a good balance between these two interests.</P>
    <P>Part VII contains provisions relating to the accounts and audit of societies and substantially updates existing provisions in these areas.  It is very important that societies observe the best modern practice in keeping accounting records and publishing annual accounts.  The provisions on these matters and relating to auditors in building society legislation have traditionally been based on similar provisions in companies legislation and accordingly the provisions on accounting records, the appointment and removal of auditors, the rights of auditors and the auditors' report are based on similar provisions in the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987.  There are, however, additional provisions in this Bill: (a) it requires <Col N="2380" /> societies to have a proper system of control of its business and to have an internal reporting system to the board of directors; (b) it requires the preparation of a layman's summary financial statement for issue to members; (c) it gives the Central Bank power to veto the appointment of an auditor as is also proposed in the Central Bank Bill for banks; (d) it imposes special duties on auditors to report certain serious matters or to supply specified information to the Central Bank over the head of the society, as has been enacted for auditors of insurance companies in the Insurance Act, 1989 and as is proposed for banks in the Central Bank Bill, 1988; and (e) it requires that auditors be re-appointed at every annual general meeting and does not provide for automatic re-appointment.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for insisting that societies have proper systems of internal control and that auditors alert or assist the supervisor if something goes wrong. After all, no reasonable measure designed to protect the security of the public's savings should be omitted.</P>
    <P>Part VIII contains a re-enactment of the existing provisions in relation to the settlement of disputes between the society and a member under the rules.  It also provides that the Minister for the Environment may make regulations requiring societies to set up, either individually or jointly, a scheme for the investigation and determination of complaints by customers in relation to the services provided by societies.  This type of &ldquo;ombudsman&rdquo; arrangement would apply to consumer complaints in relation to services provided by societies and not to disputes between a society and its members under the rules.  However, any such disputes that are covered by the terms of the complaints scheme could, with the agreement of the parties concerned, be dealt with by that scheme.  I have already suggested to societies that they should come together to set up a voluntary arrangement for dealing with complaints.  If the societies succeed in setting up their own scheme and if I am satisfied that it constitutes a satisfactory arrangement I will be quite happy to <Col N="2381" /> forego the regulation-making power in favour of the voluntary arrangements.</P>
    <P>Part IX provides for the extension to savings held in building societies &mdash; whether as shares or deposits &mdash; of the scheme proposed in the Central Bank Bill for the protection of deposits with banks.  The trend internationally is towards the establishment of some form of protection for smaller deposits taken by financial institutions &mdash; and the EC has already issued a non-binding recommendation in this regard.  While societies have a very good track record in so far as the safety of funds entrusted to them is concerned, I think the arrangement now proposed is an opportunity to further enhance the confidence of small savers in our financial institutions and to put societies and banks on the same footing in this important area.  The contribution of societies to the protection account in the Central Bank is set at 0.2 per cent of Irish pound shares and deposits, which will mean that societies collectively will have to maintain a deposit of something in the region of £7 million with the Central Bank as their contribution to the fund.  This compares with £4.5 million currently maintained by societies under the 1976 Act.  It should be noted that this is a once-off deposit which will earn interest for the societies.  Societies will only have to make further contributions in line with the growth in their shares and deposits or in the event of a payout from the fund.</P>
    <P>Part X is essentially a re-enactment of similar provisions in the 1976 Act relating to the amalgamation of societies and the transfer of engagements between societies. The opportunity has been taken to clarify and streamline the process by which societies can amalgamate or transfer engagements.  It is important that societies have a clear and well-defined mechanism for effecting amalgamations and transfers particularly at a time when future developments in the financial area may well give rise to some rationalisation of our existing building society configuration.</P>
    <P>Part XI contains a series of detailed <Col N="2382" /> provisions which will enable a society to convert itself into a public limited company. I would like to emphasise that the Government's main concern in this is to ensure that any society proposing to convert carefully considers all the issues involved and that the conversion process is not rushed into on the basis of ill-considered and half thought-out proposals. That is why the conversion process contains safeguards such as the requirements to consult with the Central Bank, to draw up a formal conversion scheme, to have the scheme approved by a conversion resolution passed by a majority of the investing and borrowing members entitled to vote and to have the scheme approved by the Central Bank.  In addition, aggrieved members will, under section 105, have recourse to the High Court if they consider that the conversion scheme does not respect their rights.</P>
    <P>Section 102 contains a number of what we have termed protective provisions. These are intended to ensure that societies do not come under external influence to convert with a view to their take over and that following conversion a society will have five years of assured independent life in its new status.  I believe that new forward-looking legislation such as this should not freeze societies into a specific legal form and exclude them from the option of conversion and I am satisfied that the procedure laid down with its inbuilt safeguards will ensure that any conversion will be properly considered and carried through.</P>
    <P>Part XII is concerned with the winding up and cancellation of registration of a society and is mainly a re-enactment with modifications of existing provisions. There is a new safeguard for mortgage holders in that a liquidator cannot sell off mortgage assets except on terms that the High Court consider just and equitable.</P>
    <P>Part XIII contains a number of miscellaneous provisions, including a requirement on the Central Bank to keep a public file relating to each society containing specified documents provided by the society.  Members of the public will be entitled to inspect these files.  Provision is also made for necessary amendments to <Col N="2383" /> the Banker's Books Evidence Acts and Bills of Exchange Act so that societies will be able to provide banking type services. Section 127 is designed to give building societies the same status as banks as depositories of money, for example, to hold client funds and to accept payment of wages.</P>
    <P>The underlying objective of the Bill can, I think, be summarised in the phrase &ldquo;preparing for the future&rdquo;.  That is essentially what it is about &mdash; allowing societies to use the considerable human and financial resources at their disposal to develop not alone for the benefit of their members but also for the benefit of the economy generally.  The Bill will result over time in the transformation of societies as we know them today without diminishing their commitment to housing. That societies are preparing for this transformation is clear, in some cases at least, from the injection of new and additional skills and changes in internal organisation. The transformation, however, will not be without difficulty and will require careful planning and preparation.</P>
    <P>This Bill I believe will provide a good framework with which societies can plan their future development.  It sets out very few boundaries to their future role and activities and, as I have said elsewhere, the main constraint on societies will be their own capacity to broaden and intensify their business without prejudicing the funds of their investors.</P>
    <P>I hope the House has found my explanation of the thinking behind the Bill and of its major provisions useful and helpful.  Due to its length I regret that I was unable to dwell in detail on individual provisions but I will try to respond to any points or queries raised by Senators in my reply to the debate.</P>
    <P>These Bills as you are aware, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, have been around since December last year.  Every country in Europe has modernised its legislation on financial institutions in the recent past. We set up a working party over two years ago.  Everybody was aware of what was in the Bill and everybody has a good idea how carefully it was dealt with in the <Col N="2384" /> other House.  These Bills are very urgent and necessary.  We need to reform our legislation on financial institutions to prepare the path for 1992 negotiations. These matters cannot be set aside.  The Dáil having considered these matters at great length and having passed them, I assume the Seanad will find it useful now to consider them further.  Molaim an Bille don Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be very brief because while this is very comprehensive, important and forward-looking legislation and, indeed, will transform the building societies, as the Minister has said, it would be more fruitful to make contributions to the Bill on the Committee and remaining Stages and I intend to make the points I want to make at that time.</P>
      <P>In passing, I wish to say I regret we will not have the benefit of contributions from members of the Opposition on this important legislation.  I sincerely hope the legislation will not be the poorer for this.  You, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, and other Members of the House will recall that I was very strongly criticised on a previous occasion by a Minister for the Environment for the attitude I took to building societies.  I have always been involved with building societies.  I have always realised the importance of building societies, particularly in the housing area, and this is more true than ever before.  In my contribution I will deal with the housing area.  I welcome the extension into the conveyancing area. This is an important step and it will result in this work being expedited.  I also welcome the extension into the auctioneering area and, indeed, the extension into so many other areas.  One could make a contribution on each one of those areas but one would only be taking up the time of the House in doing so and I do not think this is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present it is important that we make more help available in the housing area because I am conscious, as I am sure the Minister is conscious, that in many cases, even though there is a new house grant of £2,000 for first time buyers or builders, <Col N="2385" /> many people forego this grant for the simple reason that to avail of it they would have to engage the services of a registered builder or to pay VAT on accounts to the extent of at least £15,000. Many people are in a position to build using direct labour at a much keener price than by contract.  I have made representations in this regard to the previous Minister for the Environment and I understand the problems.  However, when members of a family are tradesmen and are in a position to contribute to the construction of a house, thereby making considerable savings, the Department of the Environment should make allowance for that.  I realise that this is tied up also with the Finance Bill and is a rather complicated area but nevertheless, the Minister must be fully aware of the absence of grants for settlement houses, reconstruction or extension, except with regard to disabled persons at present.  There is a crying need for some further help in this respect.  I know that this legislation will in the long term be helpful &mdash; it must be &mdash; but that area has been left untouched.</P>
    <P>No help is given to the person who wants to build a house using direct labour.  It is fair to say that it is almost impossible for anybody not engaging a registered builder to avail of building society loans; this is unfortunate.  I realise the reason behind this and the problems which arose in the past but, in general, these were not on a large scale.  While I appreciate that the Minister is committed in this area, and this legislation is a clear indication of that commitment, considerable improvements could be made without any further expense to the State.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that at present we have the unemployment and emigration problems.  Sons and daughters of a few of my friends save and send back that money to be invested in foreign banks; that is unfortunate.  Perhaps the building societies would be in a position to channel some of those funds, which would be welcome.  Over the years building societies, by and large, have encouraged saving, which is very important.  Young people in general are committed, they <Col N="2386" /> are serious about life.  I could use a lot of time giving the House many examples of this.  In schools, for example, education could be geared to helping youngsters and encouraging them to save, showing them the best ways to save and informing them of the type of housing best suited to the environment.  That would eliminate many of the problems that arise at present.  While this legislation is a tremendous extension of what is in existence &mdash; a transformation as the Minister has said &mdash; further strides could be made in the ways that I have mentioned.  The Bill contains technicalities and details and there are 13 different areas involved and it would be improper to deal with all those now.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome the legislation. In the long term, whatever about the short term, it must help to solve the housing problems.  The new house grant of £2,000 is only a pittance.  For that reason, many people forego it.  The Department should strive to encourage people to avail of these grants.  In the long term that would suit society.  There is a very serious problem with regard to young people who are availing of a building society grant but do not want to use the services of a registered builder.  I ask the Minister to look at that area in particular to see if anything could be done to help these people.  I welcome the legislation and look forward to Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dawson</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much. First, I thank the Chair and the Senators for welcoming my colleagues and myself to this House.  My appointment is indeed an honour for me and my wife.  The appointment in the week preceding my father's death was of even greater significance to me.  I express my gratitude to the Taoiseach for giving me this honour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's initiative in bringing forward this legislation broadening the scope and range of building <Col N="2387" /> societies.  The building societies have played a very central role in society over the year and have encouraged home ownership, having financed 60 per cent of house purchases.  If our building societies are to compete successfully on the open market after 1992, they must not be constrained by outmoded legislation.  What we all want is for these societies to be able to provide a better service at a cheaper rate.  This legislation will create the right basis for this.  It has struck the right balance between the interests of the societies and those of the customers.  Now it is up to the building societies to become more efficient in order to prosper in the freer and more competitive climate.  They must ensure that the quality of service improves in tandem with broadening the range of services.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the new powers for societies to invest directly in the ownership and development of land and property. This provides important employment creation and investment opportunities for the societies, of which I hope they will take full advantage.  My one concern would be that the freer availability of mortgages, with low interest rates, will give rise to inflationary measurs, inflexions of the borrowing market. It is, therefore, imperative that all lending agencies behave with responsibility and restraint to avoid this.  The Irish trend of home ownership should be positively encouraged.  Every effort needs to be made to ensure that the first time purchaser is not driven out of the home market.</P>
    <P>Once again I welcome this legislation which is a very positive and balanced development for building societies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivianOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to go on at any great length but I welcome the contents of this Bill which is long overdue.  Anybody who has been a member of a local authority, which I have been for the past 17 or 18 years, has seen the drift of the HFA loan to building society lending facilities.  There was a great need for this legislation and the Bill is a definite and positive response to the <Col N="2388" /> problems which have arisen over the past few years.  The Minister must take credit for the fact that he recognised the great desire of most people, especially newlyweds, to own their own house.  This has not been impinged upon and the additional availability of meaningful funds from building societies is indeed very welcome. Anyone who tried to help a person to negotiate an SDA loan for £16,000 to building a house costing £35,000 or £45,000 is acutely aware of the great vacuum that existed, despite the fact that the person seeking the loan from the county council badly needed the money. The loan was never enough and we went through the ritual every year of passing resolutions asking the Minister for the Environment to increase the amount of the SDA loan.  Quite often, our request fell on deaf ears.  The Minister, Deputy Flynn, has been revolutionary in that regard because he saw that that concept had come to the end of its tether.</P>
      <P>It is important that the legislation controlling the activities of building societies is put in place.  This is an adequate response, which I welcome.  There are other aspects, which I do not propose to tease out at this stage, in relation to the need to streamline the various mechanisms for electing officers and so on.  It is interesting to note that in the United States at present there are a number of huge lawsuits being conducted by the Federal Reserve on behalf of the US Government because of the inadequacies of the structures of building societies in some of the states resulting in fraud by members of the societies lending substantial sums of money to themselves.  It is important that this should not arise here and if we hope to develop building societies along the lines of this legislation, the correct mechanisms should be put in place early on.  The system whereby directors are elected appears simplistic but that is the point, as the ordinary John citizen should be able to see that it works for him and that he has access to the system.  In the past it has been very difficult for members of the public to have access to the system but that problem has been resolved in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2389" /> Senator Dawson mentioned the great desire the societies had to become involved in the development of land and property.  It was an obvious adjunct for building societies to be involved in this area and the only note of discord I would sound in that regard is that the incentives would not apply to areas of urban renewal as they cannot be availed of under the various urban renewal Acts and the concessions under the Finance Acts. However, there is an obvious role for joint ventures between county councils, corporations and building societies, who have a mutual interest in this area.  It is a very suitable vehicle for local authorities to become involved with building societies in this regard.  Zoning and planning difficulties currently encountered by planning authorities could quite easily be overcome in the context of a joint venture between a building society and a county council.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer briefly to the protection of investors because many people have been involved in the saga of the collapses of some societies.  Various inquiries took place but at the end of the day, unfortunately, the investor did not appear to have protection.  I do not propose to name a particular building society but many investors have not had their funds returned to them and do not have any redress.  It is important to close any loopholes in this regard so that societies cannot fold their tents in the middle of the night and leave investors with nothing.</P>
    <P>I wish to be associated with the expressions of appreciation to the Minister for bringing in this Bill.  It is important that the element of competition is again highlighted in the Bill because anyone who deals with banks is acutely aware that there cannot be enough competition. We have all seen the dead hand of banks, especially those in the private sector trying to develop their own businesses. That is why there is a need for competition between banks, building societies and other lending agencies.  I know that the Minister was concerned in this regard.  As a consequence, the borrower will be the beneficiary.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also addressed the <Col N="2390" /> very sensitive problem for borrowers of the ping-pong matches which take place between the various solicitors and building agencies.  It was very aggravating to have to go to a named insurance company for fire cover and so on.  Indeed it was a major encroachment on the rights of the individual borrower and I am pleased that the Minister has addressed the problem in this Bill.</P>

      <P>In welcoming the Bill I compliment the Minister and the Department for introducing very formidable but balanced and well thought out legislation.  Indeed, it is timely to have this Bill before us.  As the Minister said, it has been passed by the Dáil.</P>
      <P>In regard to the rumpus here today, when the Seanad is, by law, in session I see no reason for it not conducting its business irrespective of what election has taken place or what is happening in the other House.

    <Speaker pid="TonyBromell" hpid="Mr. Bromell Mr. Bromell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bromell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your point and I will not go into that labyrinth.  The importance of building societies has been demonstrated by the Minister and other Members who have contributed.  It is fascinating to read about the development of the building societies over the last 20 years.  Their capital resources were reasonably low then but they are now in the region of £3.5 billion.  That is about 20 per cent of the accumulated savings of the country.  Therefore, we are talking about the building societies having grown very much in the last 20 or 30 years.  I understand that in the region of 500,000 people have invested in building societies and that six in every ten house purchasers have availed of loans from societies.  It is timely that the Minister should have taken a look at legislation in regard to societies and updated it.  It is right that he should see to it that proper legislation is introduced in regard to them.  His comprehensive Bill will take us into the next century.</P>
      <P>There is a great future for the building societies under this wide-ranging Bill. They are being given plenty of scope for development.  Under the Bill the Central Bank will have a controlling hand over the activities of building societies. However, its provisions are very flexible and that is important.  Development should take place in a proper way with an overseer to ensure that everything is done properly.  It is important that societies be given flexibility to make the best of the provisions of the Bill and the opportunities presented to them here and in Europe after 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill extends the role of societies significantly.  One may say that there are dangers in extending the role of building societies.  For example, the Bill gives societies power to purchase land, to develop land, and in regard to building and conveyancing, auctioneering and so on.  In that context there is always the danger of creating monopolies but I welcome section 35, a new provision, which prevents societies from making it a condition of a housing loan that borrowers must take other services from the society, for example, insurance, conveyancing <Col N="2392" /> and so on whether provided directly by the society itself or through a subsidiary or associated body.  That is an important provision because a borrower who goes through a building society might be expected to avail of the services provided by that society.</P>
    <P>The question of monopoly is a difficult one.  When one increases the powers of a society one is, in effect, creating a type of monopoly.  On the other hand, our societies are relatively small when compared with societies they will be competing against from the UK and Europe. We have to strike a balance between giving them freedom and a type of monopoly and, on the other hand, encouraging them to work together so that they will be strong enough to engage in the home market, and further afield, and withstand any inroads that may be made by foreign societies after 1992.  It is important that our societies are given some protection.</P>
    <P>It is because six out of every ten householders here have a mortgage with a building society that the question of interest rates is important.  Thanks to the actions of the Government in the last two years interest rates have declined, although there was a 1 per cent rise some time ago and another rise is in the offing. I have never understood the reason for the great margin between what is charged to those with loans and the interest paid to those who have money on deposit with building societies and banks.  Building societies have a social as well as an economic function to play and it is the difficulty of rationalising the social function with the economic one that leads to problems in regard to rates.  However, there should be some guidelines, outside of the capital function, for deciding on rates.  It is important that we should ask why it is necessary to have such a margin between deposit interest and the interest charged to borrowers.  It is in all our interests that rates are kept as low as possible.</P>
    <P>It is important that we should continue to have the type of societies that we have. We are often told that we are out of step with Europe but I am glad we are out of step with Europe in regard to home <Col N="2393" /> ownership.  It is important that as many people as possible have a stake in the country and the greatest stake they can have is the ownership of their own homes. We are all aware of the success of house purchase schemes in corporation estates. Many of those houses have been refurbished out of all proportion to what they were previously.  I am referring to such schemes in the Limerick area in particular.</P>
    <P>On occasion people get into difficulties in meeting their mortgage repayments due to sickness or unemployment but in my dealings with building societies I have found them to be more than co-operative in such cases.  They have extended loans in many instances and have been helpful to mortgage holders.  I welcome the provisions that suggest that disputes that may arise between building societies and mortgage holders should be dealt with by a type of ombusman.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 26 which re-enacts, with modifications, section 82 of the 1976 Act, and imposes certain obligations on a society that take possession of a mortgaged property in accordance with the terms of the mortgage on the default of the borrower.  That section is designed to protect the position of the borrower and that is very important.  That section states that where the society opts to retain possession of the property under section 21 rather than sell it, they will be required to arrange, with the agreement of the borrower and any other mortgagee, for an independent valuation of the property. The section states that the court will have power to appoint a valuer where agreement on the appointment cannot be reached.  That section will be welcomed by all but in particular by those who, through no fault of their own, are unable to meet their repayments due to sickness or unemployment.  They may be temporary setbacks but, unfortunately, for people in their late forties or fifties they can last.  Those people should be helped in every possible way.</P>
    <P>I should like to put a question to the Minister in regard to tiered rates which are permitted under section 24, which replaces section 4 of the 1986 Act.  I <Col N="2394" /> accept the Minister's view that circumstances are different now from what they were in 1986 and that there is good competition in regard to mortgages. Would it be possible to introduce an enabling clause to the effect that if circumstances change the Minister may prohibit the reintroduction of tiered rates of interest?  I accept the Minister's reasons for introducing section 24 but the advantageous position for mortgage holders may not continue.  I suggest that building societies, banks and those in the mortgage field, should advise borrowers on the money they are investing in property.</P>
    <P>We have all seen the escalation in house prices during the past year or year and a half.  This reminds me of what happened to the farming community in the seventies when the banks and financial institutions lent too much money to people who, as a result, took on obligations which they could not fulfil.  People who decide to buy houses may find themselves in similar difficulties.  I believe it is incumbent on financial institutions and, as in this instance, building societies, to advise people whether the property is worth the price demanded.  Perhaps in this way the prices of property can be kept low; I do not mean very low but within reason.  The escalation in property prices which has taken place in England, Dublin and finally in places like Cork, Limerick and Galway is not good for the country as a whole or for first-time borrowers or purchasers.</P>
    <P>With regard to the number of societies, I mentioned the difficulty in relation to monopolies, the difficulties small units have in trying to compete and, in particular, the difficulties they will have in trying to compete with societies from abroad after 1992.  One of the things which strikes people when they are driving around the country &mdash; I think the Minister mentioned this in a supportive way when he said &ldquo;Tá a n-oifigí scapaithe ní hamháin sna cathracha agus sna mórbhailte ach ar fud na tíre ar fad&rdquo;&mdash; is the number of offices which societies have. One may ask if societies need so many offices.  This is not a completely rhetorical question but one which should be looked <Col N="2395" /> at to see if there is overspending by administrations in having so many outlets.</P>
    <P>On the question of administration costs, I do not have any new figures but there was a time when it was said that administration costs for building societies were too high in comparison to total costs.  Perhaps the Minister has some figures in relation to these costs, I do not have the figures at present.  At one time the administration costs were about 2.9 per cent of turnover, which seems to be inordinately high.</P>
    <P>Another question often raised at building society meetings is the amount of emoluments to the officers of societies and the amount of fees paid to directors. In these cases there is always a question to be asked if facts are not produced. There is nothing in the Bill which says that such amounts should be itemised in the published accounts of building societies. These emoluments might be very low but when they are not itemised or given globally all sorts of questions are raised, questions which should not have to be raised at all.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered &mdash; and the Bill lays down the importance of this &mdash; that the primary role of the building societies is the provision of money for housing.  In this regard we need to be careful about section 21.  The Explanatory Memorandum states:</P>
    <P>Section 21 is a new provision which gives societies power to acquire and develop land and property for residential and other commercial purposes subject to the adoption of the power and the approval of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>I welcome the flexibility, advancement and development which can take place under that section but I hope that the primary purpose of the building societies will be maintained.  With regard to section 28 the Explanatory Memorandum states:</P>
    <P>A society may not invest in a body whose objects enable it to undertake <Col N="2396" /> activities outside of the powers of the society or to invest in other bodies.</P>
    <P>I welcome this provision.  It continues:</P>
    <P>These restrictions are basically to ensure that a society cannot use subsidiaries to circumvent the requirements of this Bill or the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>I am not too happy with the rest of the paragraph which states:</P>
    <P>The Central Bank will, however, have a discretion to dispense with these requirements in circumstances where it thinks it proper to do so.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister for the Environment and maybe the Minister for Finance to have a role, working through the Central Bank, in ensuring that the primary function of building societies is the provision of investors' money for people so that they can buy their own homes.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset this is a very comprehensive and, in a way, exciting Bill.  I should like to be around after 1992, after the implementation of this Bill, to see building societies and other financial institutions operate to their full potential. I welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Minister on introducing it.  I wish the Bill every success.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh. I should like to thank you and, through you, the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad and my colleagues for the very generous welcome which was extended to us here today.  I do not want to delay the House unduly because we have already lost two hours.  I was dismayed at the walking out of Members, particularly the major Opposition Members, when we came to discuss what must surely be one of the most important Bills to come before the House for quite a period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we are all aware this legislation affects the lives, homes, inheritances and <Col N="2397" /> the future of a great majority of people. It is enlightened and courageous legislation. It required the attention of an energetic Minister, such as the Minister we have with us today, whom I am glad to see here, and also the keenness of a caring Government to get in here, and to suggest that it should be delayed for an hour, a day, a week or a month is irresponsible and is not the view of people who will be affected by this legislation in the years to come.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides a balanced framework within which the societies can plan their future development without setting unnecessary bureaucratic boundaries to their role and activities in the future.  In that way it is a sensible Bill.  The Minister's introduction to the Bill was one of the most sensible I have heard for a long number of years; he forgot the jargon and gave us plain facts.  This is to be welcomed.  I have attended in this House under the chairmanship of many Cathaoirligh, including Professor Hayes, whom I knew and others.  One of the things which impressed me over the years was how some Senators used language which the ordinary man never really understood.  The Minister is to be complimented on his lucid introduction to this Bill.</P>
    <P>Many of the points which I wanted to make have been made by my colleagues and as I do not want to delay the House I will content myself by saying that the Bill proposes to replace, with one comprehensive Act, all legislation dealing with the building society movement.  It also provides for the conversion of building societies to public limited companies while providing sensible, careful and prudent safeguards in that regard. This is to be welcomed because it is taking place throughout the 12 member states of the European Community.  I want to have my tribute to the role played by building societies written into the record. Many of us can be regarded as &ldquo;knockers&rdquo; and indeed on one occasion I invented the phrase &ldquo;we are a nation of knockers&rdquo;.  In many ways the building societies have been footballs for the <Col N="2398" /> knockers.  Over the years they have performed a magnificent job in providing finance and advice, enabling us in this little country to have one of the highest percentages of home ownership anywhere in Europe or the free world.  They deserve our congratulations in that regard.  I am sure they too will welcome this Bill.  I know the Minister has had many consultations with them and has endeavoured to meet points represented to him.</P>
    <P>It must be realised that we are talking in terms of something close to £4 billion when we talk about the activities of building societies.  Therefore, enormous care has had to be taken to ensure that the legislative provisions before us will be in line with, if not better than or more enlightened than, those pertaining in any other area.  There is at present much rationalisation taking place among the banks, building societies and other financial institutions.  In this regard the Minister is to be complimented on his liberal view which matches anything I witnessed elsewhere.  Indeed we are fortuante to have had the present Minister deal with this Bill, the evidence of which is before us today.</P>
    <P>As a country we shall have to compete, as will our building societies, with other institutions, financial and others, within the EC.  This Bill constitutes another Government step to render us ready for the competition that will obtain in 1992. It fits in well with the national plan submitted by the Government to Brussels.  I hope the members of that Government will see all of that great plan come to fruition.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and his officials on this timely Bill and the building societies on the co-operative way they dealt with the Minister's proposals. I was dismayed at the attitude of people on the opposite side of the House to such an important Bill, to have people, as representatives of the main Opposition, walk out and see others perform as though they had Actors' Equity cards in their pockets.  It is the height of irresponsibility. I am glad that the Minister <Col N="2399" /> and this side of the House have behaved in a responsible manner.</P>

I might remind the Senator that the only reason grants are framed in the way they are is to ensure that taxpayers' money would not be paid to those who operate within the black market.  It was thought prudent that the payment of such grants to new house purchasers and owners would be made only to those who found it possible to engage registered contractors to undertake the necessary work on their behalf rather than have the State expend money on supplying and feeding what had become a very big problem for it within the black market.  I altered that provision slightly devising arrangements about the total amount of money in so far as qualification for a grant was concerned, placing a ceiling of £15,000 on it.  I adjusted that again in so far as the amount that would have to be spent on labour and materials is concerned, which has been recognised by all Members of the House. From private conversations I have had with them they have said that constituted a substantial step forward in enabling people themselves undertake the requisite work to a limited extent but certainly to enable them provide their own homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons also raised the question of home improvement grants which had been terminated over two <Col N="2400" /> years ago but in respect of which we are still paying an awful lot of money.  Indeed the hundreds of millions of pounds we have had to pay in respect of such grants had not been provided for before we asssumed office.  Regrettably we are still paying for that legacy and will be for some time to come.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons also raised the question of access to building society loans.  I understand that the building societies require that houses in respect of which they provide loans be registered with the National House Building Guarantee Scheme.  That is a reasonable, prudent provision ensuring some degree of protection for both houseowner and building society.  Senator Fitzsimons welcomed the societies' powers to provide conveyancing services.  I am pleased that he found it possible to do so.  Building societies have long been involved in the whole area of house transfer.  It constitutes a logical extension of their area of operation to allow them now to provide legal services involved in those transactions. Of course, building societies will be unable to provide such services straightaway.  This new element of competition will carry benefits for the consumer through better choice, better service and prices.  Given the complex nature of this area regulations to enable societies to become involved will have to be made by my colleague, the Minister for Justice.  These regulations will provide all the necessary safeguards against conflicts of interest, qualification of building society personnel and so on.</P>
    <P>The Incorporated Law Society, while opposing the concept of allowing building societies to compete with them in conveyancing, have made several suggestions as to the nature of the safeguards needed.  I have had due regard to their suggestions in the preparation of this Bill. For example, section 31 provides a number of safeguards against a possible conflict of interest.  Senators should note that societies may only provide conveyancing services in accordance with regulations to be made by the Minister for Justice only after such regulations <Col N="2401" /> have been made by him.  These regulaitons will deal with compensation for negligence, protection against conflicts of interest, qualification and experience of personnel of building societies in providing the services and the charges that may be imposed for such services. Building societies may not provide conveyancing services to both the vendor and purchaser of the same property.  It is important to emphasise that fact. Building societies must charge for the services to cover the cost of providing the services which will prevent societies providing those services on a loss-leader type basis which would not be in keeping with the true competitive spirit in which this Bill has been framed.</P>
    <P>A building society will be unable to advance a housing loan conditional on a borrower availing of that society's conveyancing service.  A borrower does not have to do so.  That constitutes considerable protection for those using the service.  Officers and employees of a building society will be prohibited from using information obtained in the course of providing conveyancing services to promote other aspects of the society's business, a further protection which will be welcomed by the consumer.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank Senator Dawson who referred to the employment opportunities that will arise on account of some of the provisions of this Bill, particularly those activities in respect of which building socieities have not been freed up, allowing them greater opportunity to engage in such activities.  I agree with the Senator in that respect.  Considerable employment opportunities will arise when the building societies are able to invest in the purchase of land, the development of other properties and so on.  That will free up considerable sums of money available to building societies which have been channelled in the one direction only heretofore.</P>
    <P>The Senator was also concerned about the protection of the availability of money for first-time home purchasers and owners. That is a valid point.  We do not wish a situation to evolve where <Col N="2402" /> building societies would be putting all their money into other activities, financial services and other practices removed from the mortgage business of providing money for individuals.  That is the reason it has to be an objective of the societies business that they provide money for that sector.  That is an important point to stress.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Callaghan referred to local authorities and the old SDA loans which existed and to those who, in the past, took advantage of SDA type mortgage funding but have moved to the financial institutions.  That was innovative and far-reaching. It has worked and it has been a great success.  The initiative was taken some time ago.  I must put on record to the banking institutions, to the insurance companies and to the building societies my appreciation of how favourably they responded to my request on behalf of the Government that they would take up that money and release the State from the obligation of providing the money under the SDA loans and thereby restricting the Government from doing other things. That very large provision and help given by the institutions has contributed substantially to the economic success of the Government in the past two years.</P>
    <P>There is a very strong wish on the part of large numbers of people in this country to own their own homes.  We have contributed substantially in that regard.  It has been brought about by the building societies making money more readily available and by the banks doing likewise but, in particular, by the tenant purchase scheme which I introduced some time ago and under which 40,000 local authority tenants applied to buy out their own homes.  I expect a very large percentage of that 40,000 to finalise their business with the local authorities.  When that happens in excess of 80 per cent of all householders in this country will be home owners.  That is something of which we can be proud.  It gives people an identity in the community.  It gives them a better understanding of looking after their own property.  It gives them a better stake in the community and will strengthen the estates and the communities that live in <Col N="2403" /> those estates by the very fact that they own their own homes.  That is something that has been welcomed generally and I am pleased to see that the matter has been referred to here today.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Callaghan also made reference to the new powers which are being provided under this legislation so far as urban renewal programmes are concerned. He also referred to the question of mixed developments.  This must be very exciting so far as the activities which building societies can be engaged in are concerned.  We have pressed on with that initiative to a considerable degree under the urban renewal Acts and with the whole range of the special incentives we have provided for urban renewal.  These were introduced under the Urban Renewal Act, 1986, and in the Finance Act of that year.  They consist of tax allowances and rates remissions for the construction and refurbishment of property within the specified areas designated for urban renewal.  Everybody will be very pleased to hear of the great success of the extension of that designation to the cities and larger towns &mdash; 15 areas in all &mdash; throughout the country.  Very substantial development is taking place and this has created many jobs.  It has helped to encourage the private sector to invest its money in a growing revitalised economy.  The benefit is now being given seen in many of our major cities and major urban areas and, particularly, in the inner city areas with the reduction in the amount of decay and dereliction which has been there for so many years. The extension, announced recently to some other towns will, I have no doubt, add significantly to the amount of activity in the building industry and we look forward to further progress in that area.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Callaghan referred in an indirect way to the new risks which will be facing building societies.  Yes, these societies will be at greater risk but I suggest that they would be at much greater risk if they were not allowed to develop and to compete fully and effectively in the financial services area.  Is that not what this legislation is all about?  They <Col N="2404" /> face very stiff competition in the two areas that have served the country well: the provision of the safe location for personal sector savings and the provision of mortgage finance for housing.  Now, and in the near future, this competition will have an international dimension which was not there heretofore.  That will come about with the advent of the EC internal market.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that societies will face risks, but I satisfied that societies will prove more than capable of evaluating those risks and ensuring that their shareholders' funds are not put at risk.  I might add that building societies already have been closely associated with many operations in the areas of activity in which they can henceforth participate.  They will not go into the new areas willy nilly and they also have to bear in mind that there is a supervisory system in place to guarantee and to ensure that they only take on those new activities which they are capable of carrying through in a proper fashion.  That supervisory system is modernised and strengthened and this is very important.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear that Senator Bromell considered the Bill to be balanced because we went to considerable pains to ensure that not only is it comprehensive but that is a new charter for building societies from now until the end of the century and way beyond.  That was an enormous task but we were very careful to ensure that the Bill would be balanced in its complexity and in what it has attempted to do.  Senator Bromell referred in particular to section 35.  The purpose of that provision is to prevent societies from abusing their dominant position in the housing mortgage market by making it a condition of housing loans that borrowers of such loans must use other services either arranged by the society or provided by the society or one of its subsidiaries.  It applies to services such as insurance, conveyancing and auctioneering. The subsection will not prevent a society from offering a package of services or offering to arrange the provision of services required in connection with the housing loan but it will not be <Col N="2405" /> able to insist that the borrower must use the services either arranged by the society or provided by the society or one of its subsidiaries or associated bodies.  Thus, for example, a society will not be able to insist that the endowment policy to be effected for the purpose of repaying the housing loan must be arranged through an agency or a society or one of its associated bodies.</P>
    <P>Senator Bromell referred also to interest rates and, in particular, to the spread between the rates at which building societies raise their funds and lending on that money.  In fact, the operating margin of societies runs at about 2 per cent at present and it is considerably less than the banking norm.  In future competition will dictate that operating margins are kept to a minimum and the benefit of that goes on to the consumer. Is that not what we are trying to achieve in this legislation, that is that people will have an adequate supply of mortgage finance available and that it will be available at the right price with the right kind of spread of opportunities and variations which are now available through many of the financial institutions?  This is to enable them to compete which everybody accepts is now the order of the day, not just in Ireland but abroad.  Very soon they will have to be in competition with the best that is available internationally also.  To delay this legislation would have been an act of great folly, an irresponsibility.</P>
    <P>Senator Bromell also referred to the need for societies to co-operate and if I understand him correctly, to a possibility of a need for mergers to take place in the future.  I am not too sure, however, that there is much a Minister for the Environment can or should do in this area, except to provide a sound statutory basis for co-operation between the societies and for the mergers that may subsequently take place.  The provisions on mergers and transfers have been updated, in Part X, as Members will recognise.</P>
    <P>Special reference was made to tiered interest rates.  While I dealt with this very comprehensively in the Dáil, it is right <Col N="2406" /> and proper that the matter should be raised in this House also.  As I said in my opening speech, section 24 will ensure that existing loans will not be affected and future borrowers can only be charged a tiered interest rate where a tiered rate is charged from the date the loan is drawn down: where the mortgage provides for a tiered rate and the borrower accepts in writing that he will have to pay that rate. There is nothing hidden.  There is no going back.  No retrospective tiered rates will apply to existing loans from the date the legislation is passed.  People will have to be acquainted in writing of the fact that they are being charged tiered interest rates.</P>
    <P>When section 24 is brought into force, societies will have the choice of charging tiered rates but this is no more than other financial institutions can and do at present.  I firmly believe that maintaining the ban on tiered rates would be of no advantage to anybody and certainly could be to the disadvantage of the mortgage seeker.  Everything in this legislation was framed by me with the mortgage seeker and mortgage holder in mind.  In this context, I think that Senator Bromell's suggestion that power be retained to ban tiered rates in future is not really necessary. Competition is the real key and is the best way to deal with tiered rates. We have a level of competition in the financial marketplace for mortgage finance the like of which we never had before.  There is a whole range of options available to people.  People have actually set up in business to advise others how to get the best deal from the various societies and institutions.  That will continue, not just because of the availability of finance from the Irish institutions but of what will happen when the freedom of establishment and the freedom of services directives are brought to bear on the market place.  We will then have finance available from abroad as well.  Therefore, we will have a wider range of options and this is to the consumers' benefit.</P>
    <P>However, we have to allow our institutions to compete with other institutions on a level playing field, otherwise we are running risks for them.  I want the <Col N="2407" /> building societies to be strengthened and to have opportunities and possibilities available not merely to stay alive in the narrow sector where they have already played a major role, but that they would be allowed to expand the width and breadth of their services.  The existing legislation discriminates against building societies as far as tiered rates are concerned since it places no obligations or restrictions on the competitors.  We are introducing these provisions to change all that.</P>
    <P>I join in the welcome extended to the new Senators, Senators Kavanagh, Dawson and McDonnell.  I would like to assure Senator McDonnell, who referred to it, that extensive consultations took place in the framing of this legislation. This was done by the Minister in isolation from his advisers, the institutions, the registrar, the Central Bank, the Department and the interested parties.  Everybody who had an interest in this legislation was given an opportunity to make his case.  The Incorporated Law Society and all the other agencies who wished to have an input got a hearing. In particular, I would like to record my appreciation of the working party who sat for so many months with the institutions working out the best way forward.  This was an enormous job of work and it was not taken lightly.  The legislation has been gone through carefully and in very great detail and there were quite extensive consultations. That is the reason it has got a very big welcome, not just in the Dáil and Seanad but from the financial institutions. The reform of the legislation was welcomed.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonnell referred to the provision to allow societies to convert to public limited company status.  Of course, this is a huge area of importance in so far as the building societies are concerned and is a major element of this reforming legislation.  The Government's position on the matter was quite simple; a society should have the right to decide whether to maintain its mutual status.  We are giving them that right.  Given the ever-changing nature of financial institutions <Col N="2408" /> and business structures, it would be quite wrong, I believe, to freeze societies into a specific legal form.  It would be like putting a strangle-hold on them in how they could best benefit in future developments. We have freed them from this. We are not demanding their action in that regard but giving them the opportunity to consider what is in their best interests and those of their members.</P>
    <P>The Government are conscious that the conversion process should take account and vindicate the rights of members and borrowers and it should not be initiated with a view to the realisation of a windfall gain or for speculative reasons.  There are safeguards provided for in Part XI, such as the requirements to pass a conversion resolution on which investing and borrowing members will each have one vote; to make the fullest information available to all members; and a five year prohibition on any one person or group of persons acting together holding more than 15 per cent of the share capital of the successor company. I think those measures are sufficient to protect the interests of members and to ensure that conversion is not undertaken because of the prospect of making a quick buck.  That was the thinking behind that section.</P>

      <P>It is prudent.  There were those who would have liked a shorter time but I felt if something was going to happen by way of such a takeover they would have to wait quite a long time before they would get their opportunity. We are not into speculative takeovers of any of our existing societies.</P>
      <P>Finally, I thank the Members who contributed. They had worth-while points to raise and made the business of the Seanad more effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for giving me the opportunity to appear here today.</P>
      <P>Central Bank Bills are rare events.  The Bill is only the second major change proposed in banking legislation since the passing of the Central Bank Act, 1942, under which the Central Bank of Ireland were established.  Much has changed in baking since then and indeed, since the last Central Bank Act in 1971.  We are now addressing the need to equip the Irish financial sector with an up-to-date commercial code of law and regulation to meet the challenges of 1992.  Given the fast pace of change in financial services, it is vital that we give as much flexibility as is reasonable to the bank in their supervisory task.</P>
      <P>The Explanatory Memorandum indicates that the Bill covers a very wide area of financial services.  Banking is the core element of the Bill but the Government are also proposing to give the Central Bank the power to regulate firms in the International Financial Services Centre, moneybrokers and financial futures and options exchanges.</P>
      <P>The primary functions of the Central Bank; as set out in section 6 (1) of the 1942 Act, are to protect the domestic and external value of our currency and to control credit.  The bank seek to achieve this principally by formulating and implementing monetary policy, having regard to national economic policy which is, of course, the responsibility of the Government.</P>
      <P>The bank's other main functions are to ensure that there is a stable and efficient system for taking deposits, extending credit and making payments within the State and to act as an agent and banker for the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The banking sector has developed apace in the last few years.  The whole ethos of banking has changed radically. Banks generally have become more customer-oriented and have developed <Col N="2410" /> new financial services in response to the needs and demands of clients.  Irish banks have shown their abilities in the new financial markets in competing with the best abroad.  So, too, has our financial sector generally.  The Government have build on these strengths in the successful development of the International Financial Services Centre.</P>
    <P>Much has been written about the blurring of distinctions between different financial sectors.  Clearly, the neat and simple distinctions between banks, building societies and, to an extent, life assurance no longer pertain.  We must adapt our supervisory practice to this situation. The Government have decided that the Central Bank will be the sole supervisor for all the main deposit-taking institutions and legislation to this effect, such as the Building Societies Bill, which has just been passed, the Trustee Savings Bank Bill, has been brought forward.</P>
    <P>The Government will also be keeping under review the supervisory arrangement for the financial services sector generally to ensure that a multiple layer of supervision and multiple supervisors is avoided where possible.</P>
    <P>At EC level there has also been significant developments.  The Second Bank Co-ordination Directive which is nearing adoption will remove the remaining barriers to freedom of establishment in the banking sector and provide for full freedom of banking services.  Other directives propose to lay down harmonised rules for capital and solvency for banks within the Community.  Irish institutions operating in the internal market will be required to meet these standards.  This should not pose particular problems for the Irish financial sector as the regulation of banking here already conforms to required international levels.</P>
    <P>This Bill entrusts wide powers to the Central Bank.  During the debate in this House on the Central Bank Bill, 1942, the then Minister for Finance laid particular emphasis on the independent role of the bank in their relationship with the Government.  It is generally acknowledged that the most important element in Central Bank-Government relationships <Col N="2411" /> is the degree of independence accorded to a Central Bank in the formulation and implementation of monetary policy.  I make this point because most of the provisions in the Bill will fall to the bank to implement, in some cases at the bank's sole discretion.</P>
    <P>I will now go briefly through the detailed proposals in this Bill.  I do not propose to comment on each and every provision in the Bill.  I will try, rather, to highlight the main features and the principal new elements being introduced.</P>
    <P>The first few sections call for little comment except to note that the penalties for offences in this Bill are being substantially increased and provision is being made for penalising a continuing offence.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Bill is new and provides for fees to be paid to the bank in respect of the costs of supervision.  This is a necessary provision given the new areas of supervision which this and other Bills assign to the bank.  The fees will be set after discussion with the parties who will pay the fees.  Section 13 (3) specifically covers this.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill removes the requirement that the Minister appoint two banking directors to the board of the bank.  This requirement has existed in Central Bank legislation since the bank was set up in 1942.  I think we should acknowledge that these directors have contributed valuable banking expertise to the direction of the bank and have helped establish and maintain the deserved reputation of the bank for professionalism and competence.  However, I believe that in presentday circumstances, it is not appropriate to preserve in legislation a specific requirement that two places be reserved for the directors of a licensed bank.  Expanded responsibilities for supervising financial institutions are being entrusted to the bank by this and other legislation and it would be invidious to have the representatives of one particular financial sector on the board of the bank as of right, to the exclusion of others.</P>
    <P>Because of its pivotal role in financial and commercial affairs, it is important to <Col N="2412" /> protect the confidentiality of information which comes into the possession of the bank.  At present, the officials of the bank are required to take an oath of secrecy not to disclose information.  Section 16 will replace the oath by a general provision relating to all staff of the bank. This confidentiality provision will be no less binding than the existing requirement, but will allow for exemptions in specific circumstances.</P>
    <P>As a result of the debate in the Dáil, I put down amendments to the section to improve the balance between the need for the bank to preserve confidentiality where this is necessary and the legitimate interest of allowing the bank to be able to discuss freely those matters which can be debated publicly.  I think the section is a much better text now and I acknowledge the contribution of the Opposition spokesmen.</P>
    <P>Section 23 removes a legal impediment to the issue of a £1 coin.  The Government have decided to introduce such a coin next year.  Changes to the existing coins are also being considered to improve their aesthetic and practical (such as weight) characteristics.  Final decisions have not yet been taken but we do not plan to remove any of the existing coins. Under the Coinage Acts any such changes will have to be approved in advance by both Houses.</P>
    <P>Chapter III of Part II of the Bill deals with the supervision of banks in the State. The current arrangements were introduced by the Central Bank Act, 1971. Experience has shown that the requirements have worked well, but this does not exclude the need for certain modifications and adjustments to meet particular problems that have arisen.</P>
    <P>There are new powers included in the Bill in respect of auditors of banks.  These are at one with similar provisions in the Insurance Act, 1989, and in the Building Societies Bill.  An auditor of a licence holder will be required to report to the Central Bank on any specific shortcomings he comes across in the operations of a licence holder arising out of the exercise of his auditing function.  It is not my wish to interfere in the auditor-client <Col N="2413" /> relationship.  However, there is an extra dimension in the case of banks &mdash; the depositor, whose interests must be protected.  I do not see the new provisions in the Bill as placing an unreasonable burden on the auditing profession.  The practical implementation of the section can be worked out between the bank and the profession and suitable guidelines drawn up.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes a provision to broaden the definition of banking business contained in the Central Bank Act, 1971, both to conform with the relevant definition in EC directives and to improve the protection of the public from unauthorised deposit-taking.  In order not to disrupt the bona fide raising of capital by ordinary firms, a provision has been included in section 31 to allow the Central Bank to exempt particular classes of such activities from the requirement to hold a banking licence.</P>
    <P>Because of the rapid evolution of financial markets and the introduction of new and unfamiliar financial techniques, I have included in the Bill a provision allowing me, by regulation, to apply the supervisory powers in this Bill to any new financial activities which, if left unregulated, would cause a loss to the investing public, or disrupt the operation of financial markets in the State.  I believe it is wise to take these powers now rather than wait for the damage that unregulated financial markets might cause before seeking the necessary legal powers.</P>
    <P>An important innovation is the introduction in this Bill of a scheme to protect bank depositors.  This is aimed primarily at the small depositor.  It is not a failsafe guarantee for all deposits.  The dangers of providing for such a scheme are only too obvious when one looks at experience in some countries abroad.</P>
    <P>Deposit protection schemes help preserve confidence in the integrity of the entire financial system.  There is, however, a notable body of opinion which feels that deposit protection lessens the role of market discipline in deterring banks from undertaking unsound or risky policies.  Proponents of this view <Col N="2414" /> can point to the cost of keeping insolvent banks from closing and the burden this can place on the financial system.</P>
    <P>I recognise these concerns and the viewpoint of those who feel it unfair that well-run institutions should bear the costs of inefficient competitors who get into difficulty.  The scheme being proposed in the Bill is, however, a modest one.  The maximum compensation is £10,000 and not all types of deposits are being covered.</P>
    <P>The Government examined the issues carefully before settling on what I believe is a reasonable and affordable system.  I hope we never have to use these powers but it is best to have the tools available to cope with such a contingency should it arise.  Many of the more developed countries have deposit protection schemes in place, for example, UK, France, Germany, USA, Canada, Japan and the Netherlands.  The EC Commission has recommended that all member states introduce these arrangements and nearly all have complied or are in the process of complying.</P>
    <P>The way in which the deposit protection scheme will work is set out in Chapter V of the Bill.  I can go into detail on Committee Stage if desired.  The principal feature is that the scheme will be funded by a levy of 0.2 per cent on Irish pound deposits.  This will generate a fund of £18 million which is small in relation to total bank assets of £24 billion.  The maximum compensation for depositors will be £10,000 based on a sliding scale set out in the Bill.  Certain classes of depositors will be excluded, namely those connected with the bank or responsible for its collapse.</P>
    <P>The bank is allowed under the scheme to use the deposit protection account to advance funds to a licence holder where it is in the interests of depositors to do so or where it is necessary to promote the orderly and proper regulation of banking. Let me say that the particular cases in which this power will be used will have to be weighed carefully by the bank.  I would expect that if the bank saw that the application or funds would have a good chance of success, and would cost <Col N="2415" /> less than having to compensate depositors should the licence holder fail, then it would consider the use of this account in this way.  The Bill leaves this decision entirely to the bank.  The bank must set out in detail the principles which will guide it in the exercise of these powers. The holders of licences will have the right to make representations to the bank in relation to the application of these principles.</P>
    <P>The provisions in Chapter VI of Part II of the Bill give statutory backing to the control already being exercised by the Central Bank over the ownership of licensed banks and acquisitions by licensed banks in both the banking and non-banking areas.  The Central Bank has two concerns.  The first is to secure an appropriate ownership structure in order to facilitate the maintenance of the capital adequacy of banks.  The bank is also anxious to minimise the risk of appreciable holdings in a bank coming under the control of unsuitable persons or institutions. The second objective is crucial in the context of the orderly and proper regulation of banking.</P>
    <P>Under the proposals in the Bill, the bank must be notified of proposed acquisitions in or by banks.  The relevant minimum percentage holdings in the shares or voting rights which must be notified to the bank for approval is 10 per cent.  I will be able, by order, to alter this figure, but any alteration will have to be approved beforehand by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The bank must also be notified of acquisitions of less than 10 per cent of shares if the shares confer any rights over the appointment of some or all of the directors of the undertaking concerned.</P>
    <P>Ministerial approval will be required where the proposed acquisition would result in over 20 per cent of the assets of all licence holders in the State coming under the direct or indirect control of one person, whether that person is another licence holder or not.</P>
    <P>The Minister may attach conditions to any approval which he may give.  The bank, in addition, may prescribe its own <Col N="2416" /> conditions as it sees fit.  These latter conditions can be applied to all cases and not just those acquiring transactions required to be approved by me.</P>
    <P>To allay concern that certain proposals in the Bill would cause severe disruption to the ordinary commercial activities of banks and their associated companies the Dáil agreed to certain specific changes in section 75.  These relate to the exclusion of associated enterprise of banks in certain cases and the granting of powers to the bank to exempt particular classes of share acquisitions.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the House will find the powers being taken in this Part both necessary and reasonable.  They will be applied in a fair and practical way with the aim of protecting the interests of depositors and the wider public good.</P>
    <P>Chapters VII to IX of Part II of the Bill give the bank the responsibility for supervising IFSC companies, financial futures and options exchanges, money-brokers and related entities designated by the Minister for supervision by the bank.  The broad terms of the supervisory provisions are similar in many respects. The purpose is to allow the bank to specify particular regulatory requirements to be followed by the financial institutions concerned.</P>
    <P>The bank is at present undertaking the supervision of certain financial institutions which have been licensed to operate in the International Financial Services Centre.  The provisions of Chapter VII place this supervision on a statutory footing. The Government are committed to the application of the appropriate regulatory standards to firms in the IFSC.  It is important that the reputation of the centre should be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>The establishment of financial futures and options exchanges in the State is a very recent development.  The bank has already undertaken the informal surveillance of the rules and activities of the exchanges which has already set up here. I do not think that there will be any disagreement that this supervision is required.  Futures and options exchanges transact significant financial dealings <Col N="2417" /> which, if unsupervised and unregulated, could have grave effects on the reputation of the State and on the operation of all financial sectors in the State.</P>
    <P>The final provisions in this Bill are by way of up-dating miscellaneous Acts governing particular financial transactions. These are the Bankers' Books Evidence Act, 1879, the Bills of Exchange Act, 1882, the Moneylenders Acts, 1900-1933, the Trustee Acts, 1893 and 1958, and the Stock Transfer Act, 1963.  The Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill explains the amendments which are being made.  One noteable provision, however, is contained in section 128 which empowers the Minister for Finance to direct the closure of banks and other financial institutions or exchanges where the protection of the currency or the national interest so requires.  These are very much emergency powers.  They are not new in that the Government have always had the power to declare bank holidays.  After this Bill is passed, bank holidays will be catered for under the Public Holidays Act, 1973.</P>
    <P>New provisions have also been included in the Bills of Exchange Act, 1882, to allow the transmission of cheques between banks by electronic means.  These changes are sensible given modern technology and are common practice in other EC states.  I expect, however, to see that the consumer will benefit from the efficiency gains.  I have no doubt that competition between the banks will see to that.  The banks have indicated to me that these moves will help keep bank charges down.</P>
    <P>The Dáil also included in the Bill two new sections which are related.  One deals with the investigation of complaints by means of providing for the establishment of a bank ombudsman.  I can go into detail on Committee Stage on the procedures, powers etc., involved.  I envisage the type of complaints being mainly consumer-driven, for example, bad service, unfair practices, undue delay, non-itemising of charges, overcharging and so on.</P>
    <P>The other new section empowers the bank to draw up and apply codes of practice to any bodies supervised by it.  These <Col N="2418" /> powers are aimed at applying even requirements on competing financial institutions.  To take an example, various allegations were made by life assurers and building societies about unacceptable practices by banks in selling life assurance. The Central Bank, as a result, drew up a code of conduct to ensure proper standards and transparency of conduct in this regard.  I believe it is better to have a standard all can see and follow.  The codes of practice section will copperfasten the Central Bank's powers in this regard.</P>
    <P>I hope I have covered the essential elements of the Bill.  If I have missed some important items I will be happy to cover these in my reply or on Committee Stage.  I thank the House for its patience and attentiveness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his opening comments said that Central Bank Bills are rare.  It is well known that parts of this legislation have in some form been with us for many years.  I am very pleased that my constituency colleague, the Minister for Finance, is bringing forward this very important legislation.  This is in keeping with his innovative style.</P>
      <P>A series of Bills is being brought forward dealing with all kinds of financial services in the light of changes which are taking place throughout the world.  A Bill dealing with the trustee savings banks has been drafted and earlier today we had the Building Societies Bill.  Other Bills will also be forthcoming due to the changes in financial services.  We must have appropriate legislation in these challenging and changing times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before us is a further effort to strengthen and improve the law dealing with the role of the Central Bank.  It is a highly technical Bill which received a fair amount of debate in the other House. The Bill sets out to strengthen the powers of the bank in relation to the licensing and supervision of the banking business, to provide for the introduction of a deposit protection scheme for bank depositors, to provide for the prior notification to and the approval by the bank <Col N="2419" /> and the Minister in certain cases of proposals to acquire a specific holding in a licensed bank in the State and of proposals by banks to acquire certain holdings in other corporate bodies.  In addition, there is the extension of the bank's supervisory role in relation to money brokers, the financial services centre and financial futures and options exchanges.  It is a timely Bill in view of the need for major reform and to augment the powers of the Central Bank.  It has been there for a long time in some form or other and it is now presented in a package.</P>
    <P>In relation to all legislation of this kind introduced by any Government, there will always be people who will ask whether it is comprehensive enough.  The single European market will bring us within a jurisdiction which is well controlled by extensive and very comprehensive legislative measures.  I am sure the Minister will claim that the measure before us is suitable for our purpose and I sincerely hope that is the case.</P>
    <P>When one considers the need for a Bill of this type one recalls the famous Shanahan Stamps controversy and the heavy losses incurred by many investors. Another case which I recall very clearly is that of the Irish Trust Bank since I knew of people who had invested money in that undertaking.  Many people forget that saga but in time matters were put right because a new Government took office and the then Minister, Mr. Colley, felt the credibility of banks generally was at stake and paid the investors in full. Clearly what was happening in that bank was wrong.  They were offering rates 2 per cent or 3 per cent above those offered by other financial institutions, while also giving excessive introductory fees to accountants or solicitors or anybody who wanted to act in some way as an agent. They were giving them above the normal introductory fees.  In situations like that one will have problems, and I hope there was a lesson learned from that.  If one gives a lot over the normal rate one is heading for trouble.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on whether there will <Col N="2420" /> be a role for the Central Bank in that situation?  Can they carry out an examination to see if rates being given are far above the normal?</P>
    <P>In the last few years we had the PMPS problem.  Whether right or wrong, I have always felt that the Central Bank should have been asked to repay the unfortunate depositors in PMPS.  There was also the saga of the ICI and AIB.  The solution to that problem was arrived at through the good offices of the Central Bank and that problem was solved.  Fortunately the credibility of the bank in question, and indeed the whole banking system, was not damaged.  This was the worry at the time.  The steps taken at that time ensured that the taxpayer did not have to pay anything and that the bank itself, through the Central Bank &mdash; and the other banks to a lesser degree &mdash; would finance the rescue operation.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to bring coherent control to the whole banking sector.  It might be argued that there is not sufficient financial protection for the most important player in the game, the consumer or the investor.  While we would like more protection, the fact that the Minister has introduced the deposit insurance system is welcome.  Incidentally, this is a feature of all Bills of this kind.  The Building Societies Bill, which was passed here earlier today contains a section to enable the provisions of the bank deposit protection scheme, as contained in the Central Bank Bill, 1988, to be applied to building societies.  I presume there will be something similar in the Trustee Savings Bank Bill, although I have not read it through.  This deposit insurance scheme will encourage banks, by virtue of the additional money they may receive by way of deposits since people will know their deposits are safer, hopefully to offer a higher interest rate because they now know the position regarding the insurance.  In some way it gives protection to the investor who, after all, is the important person.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point that this scheme is to help preserve confidence in the integrity of the financial system.  I agree with that.  I hope we never have to <Col N="2421" /> use the powers in this Bill.  Nevertheless, as the Minister said, it is best to have the tools available to cope with any contingency that may arise.  That section is one most consumers would welcome. While it is aimed primarily at the small depositor, it is certainly a welcome development.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank is perceived, even by people who are working in the commercial banks, as some form of secret banking organisation.  It is also perceived as an institution that requires updating and is known to be an institution that is vital to the economic life of this country. The Minister has referred to this.  I am sure many people would be surprised to learn that officials of the bank are required to take an oath of secrecy not to disclose information.  While confidentiality is extremely important, as a result of the debate, the Minister has brought about a better balance between the need to preserve confidentiality and allowing the bank to discuss freely matters that can be debated publicly.  That is something we all welcome.</P>
    <P>The role of the accountants is very important.  That became obvious to me during the debate on the Insurance Bill. The Minister referred to the Ombudsman, life assurance, how far banks can go in this area and in other sectors of their business, and perhaps we might talk about these matters on Committee Stage. My hope would be that in updating and amending this legislation we will have a Bill that will serve the nation well over the next few years bringing us well beyond 1992, and help us to deal with the challenges facing the country after that date.</P>
    <P>Obviously, it gives me pleasure to welcome the Bill, and I wish it success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Fallon for his comments. He is right when he says that this Bill was absolutely necessary in the changing world and in the development of the financial services sector.  It places us in the forefront in regard to those developments which have taken place in recent years, particularly the successful establishment <Col N="2422" /> of the International Financial Services Centre.  When the second bank directive is completed in Europe, it will put us at an even better advantage in that once a bank sets up within the EC and meets the requirements of the supervisory authority within the home country, it can then offer services freely throughout the 12 member states.  This is a big step forward in the freedom of establishment for financial services.  It will make financial services even more attractive than they have been up to now because there is a major development of financial services and new products on the market.  The fact that one can set up in any member state and freely trade out of that member state is a major step forward for the Community and augurs well for the completion of the internal market in 1992.  Foreign banks, whether from Asia or the United States, were reluctant to come forward until this second banking directive was completed and they could see clearly where it would lead.</P>
      <P>As regards the International Financial Services Centre we now have 63 projects approved in principle with associated job commitments for just under 1,500 people.  These projects originate both domestically and from a wide variety of overseas firms from the United Kingdom, other EC states, the US, Japan, Australia and Canada.  The list of those approved includes major international banks and financial institutions.  The level of interest in the centre continues to be high, reflecting the considerable input and skills of the promotional agencies involved.</P>
      <P>Everybody agrees that this legislation was long overdue having been promised at various times over the last few years. As I said in my opening remarks, we are trying to be flexible in this Bill to meet the situation that may arise because of rapid developments in financial markets and in the technology associated with financial markets.  This is a wise and practical course to follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now take the opportunity to respond to a few other points mentioned along <Col N="2423" /> the way.  Senator Fallon welcomed the Bill.  I am aware of the important role of the Seanad in discussing this Bill.  The Senators have already considered the Building Societies Bill here today.  That is another vital building block in legislating for the new environment of financial services. Senators will recall the important contribution they have made in shaping the Insurance Bill which was passed last March and they will recall the detailed consideration given to the Companies Bill introduced by me in this House.  The record will show that we have recognised the importance of financial legislation and that Senators have played an important role in its adoption.</P>
    <P>A notable feature of the Central Bank Bill is the span of activities it covers &mdash; the Central Bank itself, bank supervision, the regulation of new areas of financial services, bank takeovers and acquisitions, deposit protection, coinage, currency, bills of exchange, bankers' books and other technical financial matters. Senator Fallon said that the gestation period of the Bill has been far too long. I agree with him in that and that is one of the reasons for its size.  Senator Fallon raised the issue of the smaller banks which failed in the past.  This was one of the reasons for designing this scheme for protecting deposits.  Some people may ask what about the very large depositors? If we had a similar scheme there it would be very costly to manage.  Senators would agree that the people with large amounts of money to invest are better informed about financial markets and in relation to decisions they take but that small depositors are not so well informed.  They are the people this legislation sets out to help. Everybody knows that people making large investments are capable of making judgments, calculating the risk and making their decisions about whether or not to invest money.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon also referred to excessive rates of interest being paid and what the Central Bank can do.  The Central Bank will be extra vigilant in this regard. It is a normal part of the supervisory <Col N="2424" /> process.  They have the authority to look at the rates of interest paid and their primary objective is to protect our currency. They are totally independent in their decisions, although they take Government policy into account when making their decisions.  I am aware that some people feel that in relation to the deposit protection scheme there is an inherent risk that the existence of the scheme may lead to unsound practices by some banks.  These fears are generally overstated.</P>
    <P>The scheme is designed to afford a measure of protection primarily to small unsophisticated depositors.  A ceiling has been incorporated whereby the maximum sum payable to any depositor is £10,000; thus, it is only in cases of deposits up to £15,000 that two-thirds or more of the deposit is protected.  This relatively low ceiling will also reduce the likelihood of depositors seeking out higher and riskier returns for their savings.  In the past we have seen that small depositors have been caught in that they have been attracted by very high interest rates although they were not in possession of all the financial knowledge necessary to make a proper judgment.</P>
    <P>Under section 55 (9) (a), banks are prohibited from advertising that their deposits are protected under the scheme and, therefore, cannot attract deposits on that basis.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested that the fund for the deposit protection scheme should be based on a risk-related insurance scheme.  While I agree that such a rating basis might be the ideal, examination of such schemes has shown that they present major practical problems.  These problems were cited in the OECD report on prudential supervision in banking, and include the difficulty of assessing relative degrees of risk &mdash; how, for instance, is management ability to be evaluated, the difficulty in predicting how risks will develop in the future, and the difficulty of trying to apply actuarial methodology in areas where there is significant historical experience and lack of uniformity in the variables.</P>
    <P>There is also the potential impact of <Col N="2425" /> the risk premium itself on the action of the bank.  A risk premium can be a costly exercise and it might encourage an institution to seek higher profits from more risky investments to pay the insurance premium.  Even in those countries which have adopted insurance-type schemes, the premium is only related to the amount of money at risk, rather than to the riskiness of the insured for the reasons I have already given.  Another drawback is that the resultant grading of banks in this way carries an attendant risk of impairing confidence if, or rather when, the ratings become public knowledge.  The scheme we have introduced here is modest, safe and reasonable.  I hope these points will be of interest to the Senators and I thank them for their input into the Second Stage debate on the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give some greater detail on what he means by a bank ombudsman?  I have some idea but I would like the Minister to go into it in greater detail on this stage, as he indicated he would.  Banks should certainly have some form of bank ombudsman. Banks just like other institutions make mistakes and the consumer has a right to be able to consult with an independent body with regard to his rights. The Minister referred to bad service, to unfair practices, in relation to the non-itemising of charges and so on.  There are a number of areas in which a bank can frustrate the efforts of the consumer.  The establishment of some form of bank ombudsman would be welcome and I <Col N="2426" /> would ask the Minister to comment in greater detail on it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMcDonell" hpid="Mr. McDonnell Mr. McDonnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it proposed that the ombudsman would have any authority with regard to the state of paper currency? Our paper currency does nothing for our tourist industry.  One of the great complaints I have heard relates to the horrible state of the £1 and £5 notes. Nobody seems to have any powers in relation to this.  I have complained about it to my own bank but nothing seems to be done about it.  There has been some improvement but for the past 12 months or more these notes have been, to say the least, unhygienic.  Can the Minister give the ombudsman some powers in that regard, or deal with it in some other way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the type of complaints procedure that might be set up, I do not have a scheme ready and waiting in the wings to be put in place.  I certainly see the complaints process here as involving consumer-type complaints which will be about a variety of bank activities, such as the availability of loans, financial services generally, credit cards, cash dispensing cards and so on.  The complaints could be about a wide variety of sources of dissatisfaction, such as alleged over-charging, unfair practices, undue delay, bad service and so on.</P>
      <P>What will happen under this section is that the Central Bank will invite the banks to propose the establishment of a scheme on a self-regulatory basis.  The regulations to be made under this section will provide for the operation and procedures of the scheme, when we get a scheme in place, whether complaints must be in writing, or taken up with the bank concerned first, or whether oral hearings will be held.  It is not possible at this stage to paint the entire picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations provided for in subsection (2) of this section are a necessary framework for the administrative details of the scheme.  I do not believe it is necessary to require that this House approve these regulations in draft form before they can come into effect.  We are taking <Col N="2427" /> the power to regulate.  The Central Bank will be the body who will set up this scheme and then we will make regulations to underpin it.</P>

      <P>If a person applies for a loan from a commercial bank but is refused for whatever reason, is it envisaged that the reason for the refusal will be made known?  At present many banks refuse loans but give no reason for doing so.  Will the Ombudsman have a role to play?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me reply, first to a point made earlier by Senator McDonnell on the state of bank notes.  The Ombudsman will not have a role in this area. Currency is a matter for the Central Bank and I know &mdash; indeed I have spoken to them about this matter &mdash; that they are endeavouring to ensure the currency is kept to a high standard.  We are committed to the introduction of a one pound coin next year and this might help.  In relation to the point made by Senator Fallon about loans, it is for the bank to make up their mind whether a person is a good risk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like more information on section 46 from the Minister. The appointment and role of an auditor is very important.  As I said, a similar <Col N="2428" /> provision is contained in the Insurance Bill &mdash; an amendment was introduced at the last minute.  Clearly, that was one of the best things to happen during the passage of that legislation.  Under that legislation, if an auditor finds an insurance company to be even remotely wrong in their accounts there is an obligation on him to immediately inform the Minister and the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Under this legislation, if something is found to be wrong, then the Central Bank or the Minister for Finance has to be advised immediately.  If such a provision had been in place in the past we would not have had the Irish Trust Bank or the other scandals.  Therefore, I welcome this provision.  Perhaps the Minister would like to comment further on the section.</P>

      <P>Section 47 is probably the section the Senator is referring to. This section proposes to impose new duties on an auditor of a licenceholder, in particular a duty to report to the Central Bank in certain circumstances along the lines the Senator referred to.  It is important that the Central Bank be able to object to a particular person being appointed auditor where it has reason to believe that that person would not adequately discharge these or other duties of an auditor.  The Central Bank can also require a licence holder to notify it of the name of the person whom it is either proposed to be appointed or reappointed as an auditor of the licenceholder. The Central Bank must also be notified by the licenceholder when the directors propose to fill a casual vacancy in the position of auditor.  Notification must be given at least 15 days in advance of the shareholders being informed of the name of the person who it is proposed to appoint or reappoint at the annual general meeting, or in the case of the <Col N="2429" /> filling of a casual vacancy by the directors at least 15 days in advance.  Therefore, there is adequate protecton to cover the eventuality Senator Fallon has referred to.</P>

      <P>The way the section is worded leaves some doubt in my mind. I welcome the provision but I wonder whether some discretion will be left to the Central Bank or the bank against which the report has been made to indicate in the annual report whether attention has been drawn by the auditors to the matter concerned.  Will the discretion remain with the Central Bank or with the bank concerned?</P>

      <P>Where the auditor finds something seriously wrong we would expect him to put a note in the accounts. Where an auditor believes that circumstances exist which materially affect the licenceholder's ability to fulfil his obligations to depositors or his financial obligations generally, such as the obligation to maintain particular ratios of capital or assets, he must report to the Central Bank.  Where he has reason to believe there are defects in the financial or internal accounting systems of the licence-holder, where he believes there are omissions or inaccuracies in financial returns made to the Central Bank, where he proposes to qualify any certificate he is required to give under the Companies Act or the Central Bank Act, or as he must where he decides to resign and not to seek re-election as an auditor he also has to report to the Central Bank.  These are all laid out in section 1 of the Bill.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matter. - Economic Trends and Prospects.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>My reason for raising this matter on the Adjournment is that we are in an unprecedented situation.  Up to now we have had gloomy economic forecasts from outside bodies and glowing indications from Government circles that things were going extremely well. Over the past few weeks we have seen a change in the trend.  We have seen the Government being very conservative in their attitude towards growth in the economy and towards prospects for growth. At the same time, because of an enormous buoyancy in tax revenue in the first few months of this year, Government forecasts have been overtaken since over £200 million in tax over and above what the Government were expecting came in in the first period of the year.  This morning we had the very confident view of the ESRI on the economic prospects for this country over the next few years.</P>
      <P>My original reason for raising this matter was that in the past a Government that has an excess of revenue might have decided to spend it to buy votes or enter into arrangements which might in the long term be damaging to the economy. I would like the Minister to reassure the people, not alone in this country but abroad, that our economy is in the hands of people who want long-term economic advancement for this country and who will not buy votes for short-term advantage. This could have been done; it was done in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are, and have been, working towards long-term solutions to the problems that have overtaken us over the past ten years.  That there has been a buoyancy in the tax returns is due to confidence coming back to our business people.  This confidence is permeating businesses.  As a small businessman in the motor trade, I am at last seeing a change in the business area.  That industry <Col N="2433" /> is beginning at last to get off its knees. The building trade and the motor trade have been the two indicators over the years of economic growth in the country. The building trade has not yet got back to the levels reached in the late seventies, but the position is improving.  People are returning who had gone to work in what they considered to be a better environment in the south of England, in the United States and other areas.  They are starting again into speculative building in the housing area.  They are beginning to get involved in the construction of commercial projects.  The fact that people are willing to come back is an indication that the economy is on the upturn.  Unfortunately there are problems in regard to people wanting to set up business finding workers because many people who left the country are not willing to come back unless there is a long-term prospect for work.</P>
    <P>The ESRI report shows that there is a long-term prospect for security of jobs and growth for people who go into business. Because this report comes from an independent group outside Government it is important to take cognisance of it. The fact that they say there will be an increase of 80,000 people at work over the next few years must be taken into account.  When the population is increasing it is difficult to provide employment for all but that 80,000 figure should be noted.  That is the important statistic which should not be forgotten.</P>
    <P>It is amazing to note that the ESRI also state that within the next few years no Government borrowing will be required. I do not think anyone, two years ago, could have foreseen that the ESRI would have made a statement of that magnitude. They say there will be a GNP rise of over 7 per cent next year, a huge increase by world standards.  No matter what statistic is taken, from any country, for an independent body to state that there will be a GNP rise of 7 per cent next year &mdash; when the average all over the world will be less than 3 per cent &mdash; shows that the Government have been working solidly to produce long-term solutions to our problems.  Of course it <Col N="2434" /> takes time to resolve all our problems in terms of work, attitudes to work and investment.  There was an attitude that this was not a country in which to invest and many companies ceased to invest here and invested abroad because the returns were much better.  I am glad that in the past few months there has been a huge investment abroad by indigenous Irish companies.  They are doing so because they have profits to invest abroad and the money they make on them will be repatriated to this country, which is a very positive sign.  Avonmore, Waterford Co-op and others have invested in the United States resulting in Irish banks being very positive towards investment abroad.  These companies can compete abroad and repatriate their profits, which is very encouraging.  It is a result of positive Government action over the past two or three years.</P>
    <P>I put down this motion because the Minister for Finance should be given the opportunity to state categorically that the Government will continue to work extremely hard to get the country back into line, to provide jobs and education for our young people and the services necessary to support the very young &mdash; and old &mdash; population.</P>
    <P>Another significant figure from the ESRI was that Government borrowing has dropped from 30 per cent of GNP in 1986 to about 4 per cent this year.  That is a figure of enormous magnitude when one considers the economics involved. There are problems associated with our level of growth and training in a number of industries.  Many firms have not taken on an apprentice for the last four or five years because they could not guarantee employment at the end of the training period.  The Government should look into this area and also at the fact that the economy will grow with the result that there will be a demand for more work from people within the economy. However, they will not be interested in doing this work if they are excessively taxed on overtime.  I ask the Minister to look at the system in Germany of a seven or eight hour day and where the remuneration for anything over that is taxed at a <Col N="2435" /> normal rate.  The same should apply here if people are willing to work longer hours. I am talking about skilled and semiskilled workers.</P>
    <P>The economy in full bloom will cause problems associated with steady growth. People may decide to buy imported goods to such an extent that inflation could rise. That will have to be controlled to a certain degree as we do not want a booming economy if it causes a huge increase in inflation because we are importing too many goods.  Irish standards in production and the range of Irish goods available have never been so good.  Standards in design and technology here are in the first class world league.  With an increase in prosperity we should look to the Irish product first &mdash; not to the exclusion of the foreign product &mdash; and, if we can, to buy it instead of the imported one.  After 1992 the marketplace will be much more open and we must look at Europe as the single market.  After 1992 goods imported from within the EC will not be treated in the same way as goods from outside the EC.  We must live and survive in the open market which is Europe.</P>
    <P>Many firms are spending a lot of money in getting involved in the process of preparing for 1992; 1 January 1993 is not far away and those who are not yet involved in preparation for 1992 should be encouraged to get into the mainstream to try to force them to get their act together to take advantage of the prospects for 1 January 1993.</P>
    <P>The major problems we have to face which will not be totally resolved, irrespective of our economic progress, are those of emigration and the creation of jobs for our young people.  We should do everything possible to ensure that Irish people continue to receive a high standard of education in our schools.  If they have to go away so be it but they will gain experience abroad than will be of enormous value to the country when they return.  Young graduates who have experience in foreign commercial concerns make a great contribution when they return.  There is little point in continuing with the old slogan that our young <Col N="2436" /> people are our future.  Our young people will only be our future if they get an opportunity to work here.  I do not mind if they leave the country for a short time to gain experience but the Government must continue their efforts to provide the commercial environment to entice them back after they have gained the experience of working with international firms.</P>
    <P>The Government, according to the independent reviewers, have been adhering to the task they set themselves.  They must be allowed continue with that job. If they are not the country will return very smartly to the depths of depression it was in three years ago.  There is a good attitude among Irish people at present and it must be maintained.  I am appealing to the Minister and the Government to continue with the work they have been engaged in in the last two years.  Independent economic advisers, whether they are the ESRI, or <i>The Economist</i> intelligence unit from Britain, or <i>Newsweek</i> reporters all say that in the last two-and-a-half years our Government transformed the state of the Irish economy.  My plea is that the Government should be allowed continue with their task.  They should not be denied that opportunity.</P>

      <P>I should like to congratulate Senator Lanigan on raising this issue on the Adjournment.  It was an excellent idea to raise it on the conclusion of this Seanad.  I agree with the sentiments Senator Lanigan expressed and, as a young Member and a young businessman I am aware of how important it is that we should have a continuation of Fianna Fáil Government policies.  In the last two years it has been exciting and challenging trying to create growth in the economy.  We all felt proud to be Irish when we were seeking markets abroad. After all the years of doom and gloom the Government succeeded by implementing the proper policies in turning the economy around.  It should be remembered that it was a minority Fianna Fáil Government that gave us all this great opportunity. I hope their hard work and dedication will be recognised.  If they are allowed to continue with their work I <Col N="2437" /> have no doubt that as we approach the nineties the standard of living of our people will improve.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Lanigan that the danger is that imports will stream into the country and stem our progress. However, I am confident that our Government of experienced politicians and businessmen will be able to deal with that problem.  The ESRI report is a tremendous vote of confidence in the Government.  It should be remembered that that body consists of people of all political persuasions.  I understand that the son of a former Taoiseach Deputy FitzGerald is an auditor with the ESRI. It is encouraging that such a body should predict a growth of 7 per cent in the future.  The compliments paid by the ESRI to the Government speak for themselves.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to detain the House on this issue but I am glad to be given an opportunity to support Senator Lanigan.  The ESRI report is a marvellous commentary on the work of the Government in the last two years. When one compares that with reports from the same body between 1983 and 1986 one will find that it makes the best possible case for a single party Government, whether it is a minority or a majority Government.  The report is a tribute to the dedicated work by the last Government for the benefit of the Irish people.  We are seeing a repeat of the work by Seán Lemass in the sixties.  Many of us recall his phrase that the rising tide lifts all boats.  The last Government have lifted the plains; the skies are freer and tourists are coming to Ireland.  I travel widely on business and I am aware that people in Europe are envious of the progress we have made.  We are only beginning and those from all sides who talk of the national interest could do no better than transfer their sincerity into a vote of confidence in the outgoing Government and re-elect them to continue the job they started.</P>

      <P>
        <Col N="2438" /> I should like to thank Senators Lanigan and Cassidy for their comments and to extend a welcome to the new Senator, Senator McDonnell.  I am delighted to see him in the Seanad and I was pleased to hear his contribution.  He has had vast experience as a businessman.  In saying that I am not taking away from the yonger generation such as Senators Lanigan and Cassidy.  I agree with the hope expressed by Senator McDonnell that the difficulties that have dead-locked the other House up to now will be resolved and that in the not too distant future we will see white smoke emerge following the election of a Taoiseach.  We will then be able to get on with the business of developing the country.  In that context I hope that all parties will play their part in the national interest.  However, one must say that some parties are not doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are foolish enough as a nation to undermine the progress that has been made in the last two years and the foundations we have laid for a take off, as represented in the ESRI review, we will be mad in the head.  We will be committing national suicide if we do that. Sacrifices have been made in recent years to allow the proper foundation to be put in place.  We are aware that some of our decisions were not popular.  We found it difficult to take those decisions but the fruits of them can be seen.  The ESRI mid-term review is clear on how we should proceed in the future.  Indeed, we confounded most economists who said that the fiscal adjustments we made in the public finances would deflate our economy.  We proved that in doing that we could at the same time achieve a growth rate of 3 per cent in the last couple of years.  While it is estimated that our cutbacks in public expenditure took away 1.5 per cent of the growth rate, this gives us some idea of the growth which took place in our economy.  How did this come about?  It came about through the restoration of confidence and by the investment which took place when people both outside and inside the country saw that the economy was in the hands of an excellent economic management team.  This <Col N="2439" /> restored confidence and the people responded to that.  There was both public and political consensus for what we were doing.  As I have said, having come so far it would be absolute suicide to think of doing anything which would endanger that growth or stop us getting on with the job.</P>
    <P>Some of the semantics being engaged in at present are of little relevance to the people who are looking for work, to the young people who are emigrating or indeed to many other sectors of our society.  If politics are to regain any part of the high ground, then there is an obligation on everybody in the next few days to help resolve the problem.  Every party has a role to play.  Every party has a national responsibility to play that role. As I have said, I do not know why this responsibility should be imposed on one party, having regard to what we have achieved having made every effort to put our economy right.  We are prepared to play our part, and let us hope others are prepared to play theirs.</P>
    <P>I want to welcome the medium term review which covers the period up to 1994.  It is an extremely useful contribution to the most challenging and important task faced by Government &mdash; to evolve policies which will ensure stable, sustainable and solid economic growth for the benefit of all.  Policy formation demands informed assessments of the likely thrust of broad economic developments, and against such a background, a teasing out of the implications of those developments, leading to action both to build on anticipated strengths and to avoid possible pitfalls.</P>
    <P>I also want to welcome the review for its contribution to our understanding of the remarkable turnaround which the economy has witnessed in recent years. This independent assessment clearly acknowledges that a resumption of growth has taken place, and that the underlying rate of growth is now very strong.  It confirms that there has been a resurgence of the productive investment necessary to support sustainable employment growth, and a consequent increase <Col N="2440" /> in total employment itself.  The conclusions which the authors draw from their analysis about the policy risks we face in the future provide an insight into the primary domestic development which have contributed to this turnaround, namely, the recovery in international cost competitiveness, and the improvement in the public finances.  As I said, the improvement in the public finances was carefuly managed by the Government during the past couple of years.  The recovery in our cost competitiveness was a major factor in the growth rates we have achieving in our exports abroad. This has come about primarily as a result of <i>The Programme for National Recovery</i> and the consensus of our social partners, the most valuable contribution given to us.  I want to compliment all who have been involved and, hopefully, in the future we will be able to sit down and work out another sensible three year programme in order to sustain the growth levels which will be achieved this year and next year.  As Senator Lanigan rightly remarked, would anybody have believed it was possible to achieve the growth rates which hopefully can be attained in the future.  Those growth rates can be attained if we all manage our business sensibly and well.</P>
    <P>Much more important, the review holds out the possibility of steady economic growth in the medium term.  It considers that the international environment, allied to sound domestic policies, offers the prospect of continued growth in exports, investment, output and consumption, all leading to significant employment gains.</P>
    <P>Whatever academic economists may feel about the precision of its forecasts, their thrust is very clear.  We are moving forward, and we can continue on that path.  The authors' central forecast suggest that real growth averaging 5 per cent a year is possible between now and 1994. I would mention in this respect that we need to achieve a growth rate of 4 per cent before we begin to see appreciable and recognisable indents into unemployment levels in this country.  If we achieve a 5 per cent rate it is quite clear <Col N="2441" /> what we can do to that unemployment level, and for those who are involuntarily emigrating.</P>
    <P>This, if achieved, would represent an historically high growth rate, and would be considerably in excess of the 3 per cent plus annual average of the national development plan, which, of course, covers the period to 1993.  It thus confirms that the basis for the national development plan was prudent and, as indicated in the plan, that a higher growth rate is credible.  It underlines the realism of the estimates of employment growth contained in the plant.  It also confirms the plan assessment that, while the responsible course of fiscal policy now is to continue budgetary consolidation, the progress already made enables future consolidation to be at a less pressing pace than heretofore.</P>
    <P>In the round, the prospects held out by the review are enticing.  We must not, however, look only to the attractive elements of the ESRI assessment.  As the review says &ldquo;the improved environment does not mean that immediate or easy answers are possible&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Defining optimum policies, indeed the very well being of the Irish people over the years ahead, depends on our facing up to the issues which this assessment brings into focus.  Failure to deal with the real dangers highlighed in the ESRI central forcast &ldquo;would put at risk the possibility of making lasting economic progress over the next five years&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The key issues which domestic policy must address are that were there a buildup in domestic inflationary pressures, this could permanently damage the economy; any loss of international competitiveness in the exposed sectors would slow the rate of economic expansion; the potential exposure of the economy to world financial problems requires us to cut the level of national debt, and, in the short term, while the scope for reform must be exploited, the economy does not need any net stimulus from fiscal policy, which is growing of its own accord and does not need any stimulus from Government; and there are deep seated structural problems <Col N="2442" /> in the economy which it is now opportune to tackle.</P>
    <P>There are two further issues which we must also address.  Firstly, the assessment we are discussing indicates that we could face a period of high growth, unfortunately giving rise to economic tensions which cause the pace of growth to slow progressively in the latter years of the forecast period and beyond.  Policy should seek to maximise longer term, sustainable, growth.  If the past has any message for us it is that we lose rather than gain by opting for short term benefits.</P>
    <P>Secondly, any forecast over a period so far ahead, as acknowledged by the authors, &ldquo;is subject to great uncertainty&rdquo;. This derives, on the one hand, from uncertainty about the responses of policy itself and of key interest groups to the manner in which economic developments may unfold.  On the other hand, it derives from the need, in order to make a forecast, to adopt technical assumptions about which the only certainty is that they will not turn out as assumed.</P>
    <P>In this latter context, it is important that the particularly buoyant scenario envisaged in the review is seen as a view of what could emerge and not as a preordained and inevitable outcome.  To many, including myself, certain features of the review would suggest that its 5 per cent average annual growth rate is rather closer to the optimistic end of any range of plausible outcomes, as also is its predicted reduction in the burden of the national debt to 84 per cent of GNP by 1994.  These suggested possibilities are crucially dependent on two factors where some, I know, will take issue with the authors' views.</P>
    <P>I would like to be able to claim that the underlying and, therefore, sustainable growth rate of the economy in the period 1987-89 has been raised to 4½ per cent from virtually nothing but, in honesty, I cannot.  Certainly, we hope that growth will emerge at an average of 3 per cent or better; and the superficial effect on economic activity of reducing the Exchequer borrowing requirement <Col N="2443" /> may have approximated 1 to 2 per cent per annum over the same period.</P>
    <P>However, part of the growth actually achieved, offsetting the immediate down-side effects of a responsible correction of the public finances, undoubtedly flowed from the positive impact on confidence of that very correction.  Growth benefits most while confidence is actually improving. Once fully restored, the scope for further benefit is scaled down.  To this extent, it is arguable that the underlying growth rate is less than 4½ per cent.</P>
    <P>In addition, while we can anticipate continuing increases in the real level of Structural Fund assistance from our EC partners for a few years ahead, such annual increases can scarcely be assumed as a permanent feature.  However, the doubling of the Structural Funds which we expect to get from the EC will obtain until 1993.  It is what will happen beyond 1993 that may have some influence on growth rates beyond that point.  If the Community pursues its objective of economic and monetary union the policies of economic and social cohesion come into play in a straightforward manner.  There is no question in mine or anybody else's mind but that our economy will have reached economic or social cohesion at the levels necessary to obtaining the final objective of economic and monetary union.  Consequently, we shall have to maintain a very close eye on whatever funds we may be seeking post-1993 to ensure that economic and social cohesion continues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMcDonell" hpid="Mr. McDonnell Mr. McDonnell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely.  These projections put the 5 per cent forecasted growth into perspective as potentially optimistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A second crucial feature is the assumed decline in the personal savings ratio. International experience indicates that the rapid decline assumed could occur.  Unfortunately that experience does not demonstrate in any way that it <Col N="2444" /> must take place.  However, experience does show that a rapid decline in the personal savings ratio can indeed take place.</P>
    <P>The trend assumed, by facilitating substantial growth in consumption and generating a positive investment response, contributes significantly to growth itself but in the initial years only and to the major improvement in the budgetary balance forecast.  A different pattern of savings could imply substantially altered projections.</P>
    <P>In addition, as the authors point out, its effect on domestic demand would be inflationary which, they caution, could damage the economy permanently.  This presents us with a dilemma &mdash; the inflationary consequences of an over-rapid expansion in domestic demand.  We cannot avoid these consequences unless, as a society, we make secure arrangements to ensure that such expansion in demand will not lead to wage or price pressures.  Have we matured sufficiently to so ensure?  That is the challenge presented in the next stage of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  It would be our hope that the social partners, in their wisdom and commonsense, will see what benefits can be had if we are all sensible in the manner in which we order our affairs and resist unrealistic increased wage pressures.</P>
    <P>I am sure that one stark feature of the ESRI projection will not have escaped the notice of the House.  Despite the record growth performance involved, the forecast for employment falls far short of our requirements.  The numbers unemployed are forecast to decline by less than one-fifth by 1994 notwithstanding net emigration of well over 100,000.  Put another way: while we must anticipate up to a net 125,000 new entrants to the labour force over the five years to 1994 more of those are expected to opt for emigration than remain at home, though those who remain at home are more likely to be in employment.  That is one scenario. The annual increase in the labour force &mdash; those leaving school &mdash; is of the order of 70,000 while in the region of 35,000 to 40,000 retire, giving a final net <Col N="2445" /> figure of about 30,000.  The projections contained in the national plan are for the creation of 30,000 jobs by April 1990 and, in order to raise that figure to 35,000 &mdash; the ESRI medium-term report forecast an additional 4,000 to 5,000.  We shall certainly make inroads into the unemployment and emigration figures if we achieve the targets that can be achieved on the assumptions and scenario drawn here.</P>
    <P>This cold but necessary analysis represents the core message of the study for the welfare of the community.  It underlines the absolute requirement that we all face up to acceptance of policies which can promote sustainable job growth in the interests of the many who would otherwise face a future of unemployment or involuntary emigration.  We must remember that that could be result if we choose the wrong policies and do not continue to accept the necessary disciplines.</P>
    <P>I am confident that we are following the right path in the interests of all of those people.  Indeed the past few days have provided further strong evidence of the growing success of the financial and economic policies pursued by this Government since assuming office.  All the time conditions are improving for higher self-sustaining economic growth and the further increase in jobs so badly needed.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the improvement in the public finances has been crucial to the success of this Government's policies.  In 1986 the Exchequer borrowing requirement was just 13 per cent of GNP.  By the end of the last year we had reduced the underlying level of borrowing to 6 per cent of GNP; in other words, we more than halved the level of borrowing in just two years.  This dramatic turnaround in the public finances has been the single most important element in restoring confidence and in encouraging new investment.</P>
    <P>For the present year the budget set a borrowing requirement of 5.3 per cent of GNP so as to continue the downward pressure on borrowing and debt.  The end-June Exchequer returns, published <Col N="2446" /> on Monday of this week, give a useful half-year report on the financial and economic position so far this year.  Those returns demonstrate that not only will the 1989 budget targets be achieved but that Government borrowing will be below target for the third year in succession. This will give a further fillip to confidence and growth.  If present improvements are maintained the level of the Exchequer borrowing requirement is now expected to fall to some 4.5 per cent of GNP as against the budget estimate of 5.3 per cent to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>That significant reduction in borrowing reflects a number of welcome features. The level of Government expenditure remains under control and is broadly in line with the provisions announced in the budget.  Expenditure on debt servicing will be slightly lower than estimated because of the lower level of borrowing now emerging.  This is particularly encouraging when one realises that debt servicing costs still eat up such a huge amount of our resources &mdash; over £2 billion in the current year or £40 per week in taxation taken out of the pay packet of every worker.  We have no alternative but to continue to reduce borrowing so as to free up these resources for other purposes.</P>
    <P>The trend in tax revenue is particularly encouraging, being well up on the budget estimate.  The additional revenue is coming from excise duties, especially from higher car sales signalling a welcome return to buoyancy in the whole of the automobile market which had been on the floor for so many years, higher receipts of VAT and higher stamp duties from property in which there has been a huge lift, as there has been in the whole of the building and construction industry which had been on the floor for the past eight years or so.  We have witnessed a welcome return to buoyancy in that industry also with much investment already this year.  Already in house-building there has been an increase in the range of 37 per cent in new house starts in the first quarter of this year.  Other taxes also are performing well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2447" /> All this provides encouraging evidence that the level of economic activity is increasing and will be even stronger than was expected at the time of the budget. We now expect private consumer expenditure to grow by approximately 4 per cent in volume terms and that GNP will also grow by approximately 4 per cent as against the 3 per cent expected at budget time.  This higher level of activity is clearly reflected in the buoyancy of tax revenue.  The further fall in the level of borrowing is being achieved notwithstanding the fact that this year we were able to provide in the budget a major package of income tax and social <Col N="2448" /> welfare concessions which will cost up to £180 million this year.</P>
    <P>The results show what can be achieved with continuing financial discipline.  Far from causing a weakening of economic activity, the actions of the Government in tackling the problems of the public finances have proved to be the catalyst which is lifting the rate of growth of our economy and transforming our prospects for the years ahead.  I am glad that we now have an independent, expert report which encourages and confirms that transformation.</P>
