      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, in view of the fact that the Minister for Agriculture and Food waited until the Dáil had risen yesterday before issuing his statement on the Goodman affair, that the Minister's statement has left most of the key issues unanswered and that this is the only House of the Oireachtas now in session, we are asking for a special debate today to allow the Minister to come in and answer the still unanswered questions.</P>

Far be it for me to <Col N="674" /> correct the English in this Order Paper, as a colleague did on one occasion, but I feel sometimes that some of the insertions are put in just to fill up the pages. For instance, item No. 29 is a little out of date.  It reads:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann urges the Minister for Finance to extend the deadline for the current tax amnesty to the 31st December, 1988.</P>

      <P>I would like to say how difficult and embarrassing it is at times to try to get anything done through Irish here.  It is extremely difficult to get a letter written in Irish.  Even Minister find it difficult.  I have had the experience on several occasions of ringing up and being given the name of a Department in Irish, which is usual, and because the name has been announced in Irish I have asked for the extension in Irish&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I support the proposal made by Senator Manning on the Order of Business, that the House be given an opportunity to debate the so-called Goodman affair which was raised in the other House, not only because there are a lot of unanswered questions as a result of the Minister's speech yesterday&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No, it is not.  I would just like to say in response to what the Leader of the House said about taking item No. 1 today, that it would be helpful to this House if we were allowed fairly liberally to debate relevant, topical and immediate issues when the other House is not sitting.  It would also enhance this House if today we could have a debate with a Minister here who could answer the questions about the Goodman affair which have not been answered in the other House or in the public arena.  It would simply help this House.  That is why I am supporting Senator Manning's request.</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare Bill, 1989: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill he now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The measures contained in this Bill represent a further major advance by <Col N="676" /> the Government in tackling poverty.  We have concentrated the available resources in a number of vital areas and brought about significant real improvements in the position of those in greatest need.</P>
      <P>The ESRI report on poverty and the social welfare system identified a number of categories of people who are at risk. The measures in this Bill represent a further major step in improving this situation and, taken with the measures we introduced in 1988, substantial progress has been made since the surveys on which the ESRI report's findings were based.</P>
      <P>The Government's social welfare policy is well directed and has led to major improvements in the system in the two years since we took office.  We have maintained the basic structure of the schemes and by bringing the self-employed into the social insurance system we have filled a major gap in coverage.  Furthermore, through better management and control we have been able to ensure that resources are directed to those who need them.  Over the past two years the Government have provided about £256 million extra to those on low incomes.  Last year in addition to the general increase in social welfare payments and the extension of social insurance we provided for increases of over 11 per cent in the personal rates of the lowest social welfare payments and a major streamlining of child dependant allowance with extra amounts at the lowest levels.  In addition, by rationalising the free fuel schemes and extending entitlement to the long-term unemployed with families we gave a further significant increase in income to the families concerned.</P>
      <P>This year we are continuing with, and building on, the significant improvements we made last year and we are directing substantial extra resources to those identified in the ESRI report as needing special assistance, including in particular large families and families where the head of household is unemployed or employed on low earnings.</P>
      <P>The main improvements in payments provided in this Bill are:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="677" /> (1)  a general increase of 3 per cent in widow's and old age pensions, unemployment and disability benefit and other weekly payments;</P>
    <P>(2)  a 12 per cent increase in the personal rates of long-term unemployment assistance and 8 per cent increase for short-term unemployed and those on supplementary welfare allowance;</P>
    <P>(3)  abolition of the lower rural rate of unemployment assistance by increasing this rate, and consequently the rates of supplementary welfare allowance, to the higher, urban, rate;</P>
    <P>(4)  a streamlining of the rates of adult dependant allowance for unemployment payments to two rates &mdash; a long term rate and a short term rate &mdash; instead of five as at present.  The number or rates from 17 to six within a two year span;</P>
    <P>(5)  an increase to a minimum of £10 per week in child dependant allowances payable with weekly social welfare payments and a further streamlining of rates of increases for children, reducing the number of such increases to 12 from 36 two years ago;</P>
    <P>(6)  payment of the higher rate of monthly child benefit of £21.75 in respect of the fifth and subsequent children.</P>
    <P>From July next a family with three children in receipt of unemployment benefit will receive an increase of £3.50 per week giving them a new rate of £105.80 per week.  Pay-related benefit of up to £18.10 per week may also be payable, bringing the total to £123.90.  A couple on retirement or old age contributory pension will receive an increase of £3.00 per week, giving them a new rate of £102.20 per week.  A widow with four children in receipt of a contributory pension will get an increase of £3.10 per week, giving her a new rate of £110.90 per week.</P>
    <P>Apart from these specific measures, we have also taken a number of other important initiatives to extend and improve the social welfare system.  We are providing for a new social assistance <Col N="678" /> scheme for widowers and deserted husbands. We are extending occupational injuries cover to members of the Garda Síochána.  We are imposing a liability on a deserting husband (or wife) to maintain the deserted wife (or husband) and children. Having extended PRSI to the self-employed last April, the Government have now decided in principle to extend PRSI cover to public servants, following consultation with the public sector unions.  We are exempting fostering allowances for means assessment purposes. We are changing the arrangements which operate in separate payment cases. We are providing for a greater degree of flexibility in relation to activities which unemployed people may engage in while remaining entitled to unemployment payments.  We are taking powers to pay prescribed relative allowance direct to the relative who provides care.  We are taking further measures to strengthen the provisions relating to the control of fraud and abuse of the system.  Other changes are being introduced without recourse to legislation.  These include an option to use natural gas in the free schemes, allowing pensioners carryover unused units of electricity from one billing period to the next, and significant improvements in the free fuel scheme.  Other possible developments will be examined during the year and implemented as appropriate.</P>
    <P>I want a service for social welfare clients that is equal to the best that the public or private sector can provide and this Bill will further that development.</P>
    <P>One of the most striking features of the rates increases given in the past two years is the narrowing of the gap between the various schemes in the levels of payment provided to families with an equal number of children.  For example, prior to July 1988, the payments being made to a five child family ranged from £75.00 to £117.20, a gap of £42.20 per week. Taking account of the measures included in this Bill, the payments being made range from £115.30 to £127.00, a gap of only £11.20 per week, as compared with £42.20 previously.</P>
    <P>With regard to special increases for the long term unemployed, this year the <Col N="679" /> Government again approved a further special package aimed at the least welloff. In recognition of the special difficulties faced by the long term unemployed, I have increased the long term personal rate of unemployment assistance by a further £5 a week.  I am aware that the assistance rate will now be higher than the basic benefit rate, but I am satisfied that this is necessary to help people to cope with the extra needs where unemployment is of long duration.</P>
    <P>The personal long term rate of unemployment assistance will now be £47 per week.  The personal rate for short term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance will be £42 per week.  A married couple bringing up three children on long term unemployment assistance will get £8.20 extra per week, bringing their total to £107.  A similar family with five children will get an extra £11.40 per week, bringing them to £127 per week.  They will also get an increase in child benefit.  Taken together with the increases given last year, these payments have risen by almost 25 per cent since last July.  They represent a very considerable improvement for those dependent on these social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>In relation to improvements of particular benefit to families, adult and child dependant rates, in future there will only be two rates of adult dependant allowance for the unemployed, one long-term and the other short-term.  In reducing the number of rates from five to two, I am also giving special increases.</P>
    <P>I am continuing to streamline the child dependant allowance rates as I did last year.  A minimum rate of £10 a week for dependent children is being introduced. This represents a considerable increase for larger families and as a result, the number of rates of child dependant allowance is being reduced to 12, as against 36 different rates up to last July.</P>
    <P>With regard to the extension of child dependency, section 7 of the Bill provides that the child dependant allowance for long-term recipients will be paid up to 19 <Col N="680" /> years where the child continues in full-time education.  The Government regard this as a first step towards eventually extending the period of payment of the child dependant allowances, where the child is in full-time education, to 21 years.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill provides that the higher rate of monthly child benefit of £21.75, which is currently payable in respect of the sixth and subsequent children, will, from next October, be payable in respect of the fifth and subsequent children.</P>
    <P>The Government are firmly committed to improving the position of families.  We do this directly through the social welfare payments and through the family income supplement scheme for those at work on low incomes.  Child benefit or children's allowances, as most people still know it, on the other hand, applies to all children and is paid directly to the mother.  It applies equally to the children of those at work and those on social welfare and, therefore, does not create a disincentive to employment.  However, the one disadvantage of child benefit is that it is not possible at present to allocate extra resources to those who need them most. We can go some way in this direction by giving extra increases to larger families, as we did this year, and also through the tax system by means of the child-related tax exemption scheme also introduced this year.</P>
    <P>If in future we wish to use the child benefit scheme, not only for general across the board increases, but also as a means of directing more resources to particular groups of children, then we will have to find a way to do this.  The extent to which we can do it will depend on our success in matching tax records with child benefit records so that we can identify the income level of recipients. To date, we have matched approximately 70 per cent of our records and we are working on the balance.  This matching exercise is very important for the future. It will open up the means for us to use the child benefit system, not only to make payments to every mother as heretofore, but also to direct additional resources to lower and middle income families.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="681" /> The family income supplement is a further element in the resources allocated to families.  In keeping with the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> I arranged for a detailed study of the family income supplement scheme.  The report addresses the main policy issues in relation to the scheme, including the question of the rate of take up.</P>
    <P>A main conclusion of the report is that the original estimates of take up on the scheme were too high.  A reassessment of the potential claimant pool revealed a maximum of 20,000 families who would be eligible.  Allowing for take up rates experienced internationally on such schemes, the report estimated that the maximum achievable number of clients is unlikely to be more than 12,000 families.</P>
    <P>I am at present finalising my proposals for improvements in the scheme, which I will be announcing shortly.  The improvements will come into effect with the increases in rates of payment generally from July next.  As already announced in the budget, there is an allocation of £1 million extra for the family income supplement scheme to cover these improvements. This 20 per cent increase will bring the total expenditure to over £6 million for 1989.</P>
    <P>There is a new deal for widowers and deserted husbands.  For some time, I have been very concerned at the difficulties faced by men on low incomes who are bringing up children on their own.  Unlike women in this predicament, widowers and deserted husbands with children, who are unable to take up paid employment due to their domestic responsibilities, find that the only social welfare payment available to them is supplementary welfare allowance &mdash; one of the lowest social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>In this Bill I am providing a new social assistance scheme for widowers and deserted husbands.  Section 6 provides for payments to widowers and deserted husbands with dependent children on the same lines as the non-contributory widow's pension and deserted wife's allowance schemes.</P>
    <P>Let me give some examples of how a widower will benefit under this new <Col N="682" /> scheme.  A widower with two children who is in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance currently gets £56.80 per week.  Under the new scheme he will get £74.80, an increase of £18.  Those with large families will gain even more.  A man with five children would get £80.80 under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  This will be increased to £115.30 under the new arrangements &mdash; a very substantial increase of £34.50 per week. This is in addition to the increase in child benefit for large families, which would increase the weekly gain to £36.05.  I estimate that 5,500 men will benefit from the new schemes.</P>
    <P>I also consider that there is scope for rationalisation in this whole area.  The introduction of these new schemes mean that there will now be six separate social assistance schemes providing income support to lone parents.  Accordingly, my Department are examining the possibility of replacing these schemes by one lone parent allowance scheme which would apply to parents, male or female, who are bringing up children on their own. Complex legislative changes will be involved but I hope to be in a position to bring forward proposals in the matter later in the year.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the increase in the ceiling for employees and employers and section 9 provides for the increase in respect of the self-employed.  As a result of these increases from 6 April 1989 employees and the self-employed will pay PRSI contributions in respect of earnings up to £16,700 instead of £16,200 at present.  This is the lowest percentage increase in the ceiling for employee contributions for some years.  Employers will continue to pay contributions up to a ceiling of £18,000 in respect of employees who have these higher earnings.  The extra cost to employers in 1989 will be £4 million.  At the same time employers will save an estimated £7.5 million in 1989 as a result of the reduction in their contribution to the redundancy fund.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill provides for an increase from £66 to £69 in the amount of weekly earnings disregarded in calculating the rate of pay-related benefit. <Col N="683" /> The purpose of the weekly earnings disregard is to ensure that the amount of personal flat rate benefit is taken into account in determining the amount of the pay-related element.  The change will affect new claims from 3 April.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Bill provides that the rural rate of unemployment assistance will be raised to the higher rate applying in urban areas, at a cost of £7.25 million in a full year.  The differential in rates dates back to 1934 and is now clearly outmoded.  People in rural Ireland face the same cost of living as urban dwellers and, furthermore, the present situation has led to serious anomalies in that many areas now accepted as urban are outside the urban classification.</P>
    <P>The supplementary welfare rate of payment which was the same as the short term rural rate, irrespective of where the claimant lived, will also be increased to the short term urban rate.  The effect of this measure will be to give a total weekly increase of £5.70 to a couple on supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>When I took up office there were 17 rates of payment in unemployment assistance alone.  In just two years I have cut these down to six rates &mdash; a personal rate and an adult dependant rate for short term and for long term unemployment assistance, and two child dependant rates.  This is a substantial reform of the social welfare code by any measure.</P>
    <P>The break up of marriage through desertion is an increasing problem in our society today.  In 1978 there were 5,237 women in receipt of deserted wife's benefit or allowance.  This grew to 13,617 by 1988.  This represents an increase of 8,380 (160 per cent) in a ten year period. Expenditure has shown a corresponding increase rising from £5.6 million in 1978 to £52 million in 1988.  The State has always shown concern for deserted wives and will continue to do so.  They are paid at the same rate as widows.</P>
    <P>Except in the case of supplementary welfare, no provision has been made up to now to require a deserting spouse to contribute towards the payments being made under the social welfare code for <Col N="684" /> the maintenance of his or her family.  In the case of social welfare payments to the deserted spouse, responsibility for seeking income support from their spouse has been left to the claimant.  Entitlement to the payments is conditional on the claimant making and continuing to make reasonable efforts to obtain such support. The only sanction my Department had, in cases where it was not satisfied with those efforts, was to reject the claim or to withdraw payment in cases where it was already in payment.</P>
    <P>However, it is clear that too many spouses are just walking away from their responsibilities towards their families and leaving it to the taxpayer &mdash; through the State &mdash; to pick up the burden.  This is not good enough.  What we are setting out to do through this Bill is to impose a liability on a husband to maintain his wife and family and, likewise, to impose the same liability on a wife to maintain her husband and family.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides that the competent authority &mdash; either the Minister for Social Welfare or a health board &mdash; can seek a maintenance order against a person who fails to maintain their family, and the District Court shall order that person to pay the maintenance to the competent authority.</P>
    <P>Where the persons concerned or their employers fail or refuse to supply social welfare officers, or the health boards as the case may be, with any information or documents required for the purposes of any investigation related to the award of benefits or allowances under these schemes, they shall be guilty of an offence and subject on conviction to substantial fines.</P>
    <P>In this way, the State can recoup some of the cost of supporting the deserted family.  Where the maintenance is paid to a deserted spouse, that person, if receiving an allowance from my Department or from the health board by way of supplementary welfare allowance, shall be liable to transfer the maintenance to the competent authority.</P>
    <P>A practice has grown up in the courts, when dealing with maintenance orders, to limit maintenance to a topping up of <Col N="685" /> the payments received from social welfare. The effect of this is to cause the State to bear the responsibility of supporting the family, rather than placing that responsibility firmly and fairly on the shoulders of the deserting spouse. Section 13 of the Bill provides for amendments to the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, to exclude social welfare payments from the benefits that a court can take into account in determining maintenance orders.</P>
    <P>Special provision has been made to protect the income position of claimants who are currently receiving payments under the social welfare code as deserted wives.  Those claimants will not be required to transfer any payments they are, or will be, receiving on foot of maintenance orders obtained prior to the coming into force of these provisions. Where those claimants obtain maintenance orders after the date of commencement of these provisions, only the amount of payments in excess of amounts awarded under the original orders will be transferable by them.</P>
    <P>This new section on liability to maintain contains a clear, comprehensive and coherent set of provisions.  They will enable my Department or the appropriate health board to obtain contributions from deserting spouses.  The contributions obtained will help to ease the burden on PRSI contributions and taxpayers generally of financing these payments. The purpose here is to maintain the payments totally to the deserted spouse.  Indeed we are expanding that by bringing in deserted husbands as well, maintaining that payment but, at the same time, allowing the State to be in a position to pursue a recoupment of all or part of the payment from the deserting spouse.</P>
    <P>At present a person who has exhausted entitlement to unemployment benefit can requalify for benefit after having worked and paid contributions for 13 weeks.  This proved to be a significant incentive for people to take up insurable employment of short duration.  While entitled to or in receipt of unemployment benefit a person <Col N="686" /> was not entitled to receive unemployment assistance.  This does not pose any problem where the rate of benefit exceeds the rate of assistance.  However, following the improvements I have already announced, the rate of unemployment assistance is now higher than the rate of unemployment benefit, and so there could be a disincentive to an unemployed person to take up employment of short duration.  Section 14 of the Bill provides power to enable me, by regulation, subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance, to allow an unemployed person the option of claiming either unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance, whichever is the more favourable.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that in recent years I have promoted a number of initiatives to increase flexibility in the unemployment payments system, and facilitate the unemployed in their efforts to find a foothold in the jobs market. These initiatives cover facilities to pursue educational courses, to take up part time work, and to engage in voluntary work of benefit to the community.</P>
    <P>The need for greater flexibility in the unemployment payment schemes was raised by a number of Deputies on Second Stage debate on this Bill in the Dáil.  Many Deputies expressed concern that the existing statutory condition regarding availability for work is so restrictive as to preclude claimants from engaging in activities which would enhance their prospects of obtaining employment again.  Section 28 of the Bill provides me with powers to make regulations to deem persons to be available for work for unemployment assistance purposes and to exempt persons from having to be available for work in order to qualify for either unemployment benefit or assistance.  The power to deem persons to be available for employment already exists for unemployment benefit purposes.  It is envisaged that the new powers would be directed primarily at the long term unemployed and would be used, for example, to allow persons to attend courses of education, subject to certain conditions, without affecting their <Col N="687" /> entitlement to unemployment payments. The provision might also be used to enable the long term unemployed, in restricted circumstances and for limited periods, to engage in certain community enterprise projects.  This measure will greatly add to the flexibility of the unemployment payments system and enhance the potential for development of initiatives, such as the part time education and voluntary work schemes.</P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Bill provides for the exemption of fostering allowances from the assessment of means for unemployment assistance, old age and widow's pensions and supplementary welfare allowance schemes.  The health boards have experienced considerable difficulties in recruiting foster parents in recent years. As Senators are aware, there has been a move away from residential care and efforts are being made to place more children in foster homes where they can enjoy the benefits of normal family life. The health boards regard the fostering allowance, currently £34.50 per week, as a payment for the maintenance of the child.  The fact that it is payable irrespective of the foster parents' circumstances allows the financial circumstances of potential foster parents to be disregarded when their suitability as foster parents is being considered.  By excluding the assessment of fostering allowances from the social welfare means test, this section removes what could be seen as a disincentive to potential foster parents.</P>
    <P>Under the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, regulations have been made which allow the payment of the allowances for adult and child dependants to be made directly to the spouse of a claimant, in cases where the claimant does not provide the spouse with sufficient money for ordinary household expenditure.  The claimant, usually the husband, continues to receive the personal rate.  This arises where there are problems such as gambling, alcoholism or drug addiction.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the Bill provides that <Col N="688" /> regulations may allow such amount of the social welfare payment, as is reasonable in the circumstances, to be paid direct to the spouse.  The claimant will be paid at least the value of the adult dependant allowance.  I am sure that this new provision will be welcomed by those who are currently surviving on separate payments.</P>
    <P>Senators will be familiar with the prescribed relative allowance which is payable to pensioners who are so incapacitated as to require full time care and attention from a relative.  In line with recommendations that have been made in this area, section 30 of the Bill provides for enabling powers to allow me to pay the prescribed relative allowance directly to the carer subject to such conditions and in such circumstances as may be prescribed. The allowance which is currently £27.20 will be increased to £28 with effect from July.  It is envisaged that the new arrangements will apply only to new cases and that existing pensioners will have the option of either continuing to receive the allowance or having it paid direct to the relative who provides the care.</P>
    <P>Section 17 of the Bill is designed to confirm the current insurability of sub-postmasters as employees, by specifically including such employment in the list of insurable employments contained in Part I of the First Schedule to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.  Arising from a recent High Court judgment, it was considered that there was a possibility that sub-postmasters might be regarded as being under a contract for service as distinct from a contract of service. In that case they would no longer be insurable as employees.  This provision is intended to safeguard their current position under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    <P>I am providing in this Bill for the extension of occupational injuries benefits to members of An Garda Síochána.  Section 18 of the Bill provides the means for including gardaí in the occupational injuries scheme.  At present gardaí have no entitlements under this scheme.  In the case of malicious injuries or death, a garda or his representatives may apply for compensation under the Garda <Col N="689" /> Síochána (Compensation) Acts. However, other injuries received or diseases contracted accidentally in the course of duty are not covered by this legislation.  It is now proposed to fill this gap in their coverage by bringing gardaí within the scope of the occupational injuries scheme.  Gardaí will be covered on the same basis as other civil servants. They will be entitled to half rate disablement benefit starting 26 weeks after the occupational accident occurs or disease is contracted.  They will also have full cover for survivors' benefits, including widow's pension, dependent widower's pension or gratuity, orphan's pension, dependent parents' pension and funeral grant.  A reduced rate of occupational injuries contribution will be paid on behalf of the gardaí in line with the limited benefits for which they will be covered.</P>
    <P>The section also provides that any benefits payable to gardaí or their survivors under the scheme will be taken into account in the assessment of damages under the Garda Síochána (Compensation) Acts.  This is in line with similar arrangements in assessing damages for the purposes of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act, 1964.</P>
    <P>The details of coverage and the contributions payable will be set out in regulations following this legislation. Coverage under the occupational injuries scheme will represent a considerable improvement in the employment conditions for gardaí.  I am sure that Senators will support me in acknowledging the good work done by An Garda Síochána and I am sure that this measure will have the support of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Over the last two years I have placed great emphasis on the effective management of the resources devoted to social welfare.  As a result, I have put in place a range of measures to eliminate fraud and control abuse of our schemes. I intend to continue to pursue these measures vigorously and to improve them as the need arises.  There are a number of measures in this Bill aimed at improving the effectiveness of the various measures I have brought in.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="690" /> From the start of this year, employers in the construction, contract cleaning, forestry and security industries are required to notify my Department when they take on new employees.  So far 528 employees were notified to my Department for January and 1,145 were notified for February.  This gives a clear indication of the value of this control measure.</P>
    <P>I am aware from discussions with the trade unions and from other sources that there has been an increasing recourse to the employment of subcontractors in these industries.  It is also clear from investigations carried out by my Department that many subcontractors are not fulfilling their responsibilities in terms of tax and PRSI.  Accordingly, I am amending the legislation to provide for the notification to me by any employer, in the designated industries, of the employment by them of any subcontractor will also addition, each subcontractor will also have to notify me of any person engaged by him or working with him.  This will greatly assist in the control of those &ldquo;cowboy&rdquo; operators who set out to cheat the taxpayer and their competitors. Section 20 provides that, in any proceedings for an offence under the Social Welfare Acts, a certificate, signed by an officer and certifying facts recorded on computer or on microfilm, will, in the absence of the original document, be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the facts so certified. This provision is required because of the increasing extent to which records of the Department are held on computer and microfilm instead of on paper.  The provision also extends to organisations with which the Department conduct their business, for example, An Post propose to microfilm cashed social welfare pension orders.</P>
    <P>Section 21 provides that records relating to earnings and periods of employment maintained by an employer shall be regarded as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of these matters.  This is intended to simplify the current arrangements whereby, in cases involving large companies, a number of company staff would be required to give evidence to prove that a person was in fact employed in a particular period and <Col N="691" /> that wages were paid to him in respect of such employment.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides that, where an employer who colludes with an employee in fradulently obtaining any social welfare payment is convicted of certain offences, that employer will be liable for the repayment on demand, as a civil debt, of the amount irregularly received by the employee as a result of that collusion, while in his employment.</P>
    <P>Under the legislation enacted last year relating to self-employed contributors, a self-employed person was required to have discharged his full liability before he could be regarded as having paid his PRSI contribution.  Because of the way the tax system works, this requirement for full discharge is giving rise to serious problems as tax assessments are reviewed and revised.  The provisions allow contributions which have not been paid to be treated as having been paid, in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for substantial improvements for the proposed pre-retirement allowance scheme which is intended to provide more flexible arrangements for unemployed people in the over 60 age group.  The legislative basis for this scheme was contained in last year's Social Welfare Act and regulations are required to implement it.  Following the amendments in this Bill, I propose to make regulations providing for the new improved scheme as soon as the administrative arrangements are in place.</P>
    <P>The main effect of the amendments included in this Bill is to remove the requirement contained in the 1988 legislation that an applicant be otherwise entitled to unemployment assistance. This will enable the allowance to continue be paid to retired persons who, for example, fall ill and would, therefore, not fulfil the conditions for unemployment assistance.  The Bill also provides for the includion of the pre-retirement allowance as a separate allowance in the list of social assistance payments contained in the Fourth Schedule to the Bill.  This will give greater flexibility in regard to determining reduced rates of allowance as the <Col N="692" /> rates will no longer be tied to the rates of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Section 30 of the Social Welfare Act, 1988, provided powers to make regulations giving entitlement to pensions to certain persons who came back into insurance on the abolition of the earnings limit for liability for social insurance contributions in April 1974.  The provision was intended to cater for those who, having paid contributions covering them for old age contributory pension, failed to qualify for a pension because of gaps in their insurance record prior to 1974.</P>
    <P>Many Senators will be familiar with this problem.  It was always considered to be inequitable that employees, who became compulsorily insured for the first time in April 1974, were able to build up an entitlement to a minimum old age contributory pension after a relatively short number of years, whereas those, with a similar record of insurance after 1974, failed to get a pension because of the effect that the pre-1974 &ldquo;gaps&rdquo; had on their yearly average of contributions.</P>
    <P>It has since emerged that the enabling legislation and regulations made under it in 1988 gave entitlement to <i>pro rata</i> pensions to categories of insured persons other than those for whom they were intended.  The wording of the legislation also gave entitlement to persons who came back into insurance in 1974 but at a modified rate which did not include cover for old age contributory pension. Persons in this situation are part of what is known as the &ldquo;mixed insurance&rdquo; category and there are particular problems associated with their situation.  The problems of &ldquo;mixed insurance&rdquo; and its effects on pension entitlements are being examined at present by the National Pensions Board as part of their review of State, semi-State and private occupational arrangements.</P>
    <P>Section 25 is intended to remedy the defect in the primary legislation by confirming that entitlement to pensions will be confined to those affected by the insurable limit as originally intended, <Col N="693" /> namely, persons who again became compulsorily insured at the full rate of contribution in April 1974 following the abolition of the insurable limit.</P>
    <P>Sections 26 and 27 are designed to remedy potential defects identified in existing legislation and ensure that the provisions covered endure and are correct.</P>
    <P>The last four sections in the Bill, namely sections 28, 29, 30 and 31, are new sections which were inserted in the course of the debate on the Bill in Dáil Éireann.  Section 28 is the section which enables me by regulations to expand the criteria under which a person can be regarded as available for work for unemployment purposes, which I referred to earlier in my speech.  Section 29 provides that such regulations will be subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance. Section 30 provides for another matter to which I have already referred, namely, the payment of the prescribed relative allowance in certain circumstances direct to the prescribed relative.  Finally, section 31 reduces from six to three months the period for which a person who is convicted of an offence in connection with the fraudulent receipt of a social welfare benefit is disqualified from receiving benefit.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I believe that the measures included in this Bill represent a very significant and worth-while package for people dependent on social welfare, and especially for those on the lowest payments. Since the Government took office two years ago, we have introduced some of the most far-reaching improvements in the social welfare system for many years and we will continue to improve and develop the system as resources allow.  At the same time, I will continue to concentrate resources on ensuring that the system is managed effectively and that fraud and abuse are controlled.  In this way we will have a social welfare system which is comprehensive, efficient and effective in meeting the needs of its clients.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me first take the <Col N="694" /> opportunity to congratulate the Minister on his ability and concern indicated in his speech introducing this Bill.  This is the third year in which he has addressed this House on Social Welfare Bills and allocations. I make no apology for saying he is very much aware of the problems in social welfare.  He has shown serious concern particularly for people who cannot get benefit elsewhere and cannot obtain work.  In this House we have emphasised strongly that the facilities and items recognised in social welfare are very numerous.  Now the number of categories are being reduced from 26 to 12.  The Minister recognises that the best way to spend £7 million is the simple way, and he is setting about doing that.</P>
      <P>Let us look at what social welfare has achieved in the last three years.  Are we doing the right thing?  Are we trying to ensure that people will not need to avail of social welfare?  Are we asking for subscriptions to be increased?  We say more people are looking for work, but that is not so.  I want to enlarge on that later. The areas where the Minister has allocated extra money are of benefit particularly to people on long-term unemployment, but I do not like the impression to go abroad that perhaps they are a disincentive to work.  In other words, we say the person who is working must be prepared to pay more to provide for the people who are not working.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to people over 60 years of age and I understand the budget provided that people over 55 years need not go to the employment exchange.  That is not mentioned in the Minister's speech and I would like him to clarify it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the money he saved last year but that was achieved by the implementation of the arrangements made by Deputy Hussey, the previous Minister, before she left office to remedy abuses in the system.  It was recognised nationally that there were fraudulent issues.  The Minister laid great emphasis in his speech on the way he would deal with the &ldquo;cowboys&rdquo;.  The <Col N="695" /> question of abuses, particularly in contracting areas, was raised in this House two years ago.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to fraudulent subcontractors who made sure they did not have to pay PRSI.  We recognise that the social welfare system is now computerised. Three or four years ago the need for computerisation was admitted, but are we going far enough?  When a person leaves an employment office to be employed by a subcontractor or other employer, should he not have some type of record that can go back into the computer system when he comes off the workers list?  There is no reason we should not have job cards.  A person who is working for a subcontractor for two or three days a week should carry a job card, which could be used in the same way as a credit card.  When that person returns to the local employment office, his job card should be put into the computer to indicate that he is again in receipt of unemployment assistance.  If an inspector visits a workplace and finds a person working there whose job card is not available, this is proof that the person is abusing the system.  It would be very fair.</P>
    <P>There is general agreement that some people are working while claiming social welfare benefit.  It is only right that this should be queried by those on the PAYE system.  While this is a recognised problem, there is some concern about the manner in which the Department of Social Welfare are investigating the entitlements of people in receipt of long-term disability allowance.  I was particularly annoyed about a case I saw in Connolly Hall in Cork.  This is where people are asked to come in order to indicate their availability for work.  I was having a discussion in the lobby with a friend.  When I go about my business I am always very discreet and I do not want to let people know who I am, if at all possible.  I saw a person having to be helped out the door by a nurse, but he was then unable to negotiate the swinging doors.  I was rather annoyed.  I could not understand why the GP, the consultants and the investigating officers could not <Col N="696" /> have reached a better understanding in regard to that person's circumstances.  I am very much aware that some people are receiving disability allowance who are not entitled to it, particularly women who have been mothers for a long time and are still claiming the allowance.  However, doctors differ.  In the case I am referring to the person had 33 stiches around his ankle and was barely able to walk, yet he was asked to travel to Cork from Kinsale. He had to be helped into a car and brought to the bus.  The Minister in his speech has shown much concern for people who are totally reliant on social welfare, yet he allows this kind of abuse by the Department to continue.  I subsequently made inquiries about the position of the person concerned and was informed that he was not available for work.  There is an impression that those in the PAYE system are paying too much and that taxes are too high but at the same time we should not regard it as necessary to investigate every social welfare claim to the extent of calling people before investigating officers.</P>
    <P>We have a duty as a people and as legislators to create an economic climate in which people can earn money for themselves and not be reliant on the State.  We should try to return to the position of the late sixties and early seventies where social welfare benefits were available for people who really needed them because they were not able to avail of other opportunities. The elderly retired person who is being looked after in a home is in need of social welfare benefits.  Other people have to seek social welfare benefits because they have no jobs.  There is a clear difference.</P>
    <P>Until a few years ago an Irishman did not want to go to the local employment exchange for assistance, but nowadays there is no choice.  We have had to recognise that people over the age of 55 should not have to attend.  I would resent any implications that people aged over 55 should not work.  The recent budget in the UK provides that the pensions of those aged over 65 should not be reduced if they want to work, yet we in this island, <Col N="697" /> only 60 miles away, have adopted a contrary policy.  It is sad to acknowledge that people aged over 55 will not be able to work any more.</P>
    <P>The Minister emphasises payments to the less-well-off in society.  I welcome the increase to the long-term unemployed but next year he should ensure that there is no difference between any category of the unemployed.  What is the difference between a person who has been employed for three months and another person who has been employed for, say, two years?  They are both unemployed. We should eliminate the difference between benefit and assistance and have only one category.</P>

There are many questions still unanswered and this is the place where they should be answered.  There was considerable controversy yesterday evening and this morning about the unanswered questions in the statement by the Minister for Agriculture and Food. This House is in session and surely it is incumbent on the Minister to come here to allay public unease and disquiet over this matter.

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we do not have issues like this every morning.  After those few words, we need a jolly discussion to cool the atmosphere.  I am not surprised that some Members are annoyed at the statements that have been made but, at the same time, people are entitled to their opinion.</P>
      <P>The Minister has recognised the need to help the less well-off but I do not think he has gone far enough.  In the course of his speech, the Minister recognised that his Department are only concerned with paying out benefits and I do not think he has done enough to encourage those on social welfare to seek work.  The Minister takes credit for having saved the State a lot of money in the last two years and that represents good work by him.  Indeed, if all Ministers were as attentive our financial position would be much healthier.  It is sad to think that we have to pay out so much on social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not good enough to concentrate on the elimination of abuses.  The Minister has suggested that employers should <Col N="700" /> pay more to the social welfare system but he has not given any incentives to them to take on more employees.  For example, the Minister has not said that employers who take on more workers will not be asked to pay the maximum amount in contributions to the State.  Under the social employment schemes introduced by the former Minister, Deputy Hussey, in 1986 not as many people qualify for full unemployment benefit.  That was not the intention at the time.  It was not the intention that we should say to a person if he or she works for three days, that they will be paid £70 and be entitled to work elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It appears that agreement has been reached between the social partners and the Government that those on long-term unemployment who are employed on a social employment scheme should do any work available for £70 per week.  That has occurred at local authority level following agreement between the Government and the unions.  Many employees in State bodies have been let go and replaced by part-time workers.  In other words, we have let people go who earned £130 per week and taken on people to do the same work at £70 per week.  I do not think we should use the social welfare system to do that.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the Minister, who spends millions each day, has not encouraged employers to take on more workers. He has not said he would like to reach the stage when his spending would be reduced from £6 million per day.  I should like to give examples of what I find wrong with the system because I do not think it is right to criticise it if I cannot produce the evidence.  In the last three or four weeks in Cork, I have heard of many people being employed on a part-time basis.  It appears that the popular thing to do today is to hire people on a part-time basis.  That suits the State because people are taken off the live register.  The Department accept that a person over 60 is entitled to have his dole posted to him and that he can work up to 18 hours per week.  However, the same does not apply to young people.  I am aware of a young man who trained as a fitter with Cork <Col N="701" /> County Council but at 22 years of age can only obtain part-time work, earning £50 for four hours work on four mornings each week.  The employer is happy, and the State is happy because he is not on the live register.  On the other hand, we are telling people over 60 that they can collect their benefit and work 18 hours per week.  That is not fair.  If the Minister wishes, I can give him details of the company and the individual.</P>
    <P>The State tells employers that if they wish to employ people they must pay more PRSI.  I do not think that is an incentive to business people to take on employees.  When are we going to say that there should be one tax?  PRSI is a tax.  We should make a health comtribution, but that is not what PRSI is in reality.  The tax should be set at a single percentage rather than 22 per cent from the employer and the rest from the employee.  I am very much aware of the amount of money the State gets in from contributions from employers and employees.  The whole system should be simplified.</P>
    <P>A person working part-time and getting £50 a week still has to pay a certain amount of PRSI.  A person in Great Britain who earns under £43 a week pays only 2 per cent.  Here there is a disincentive in that both the employee and employer must pay.  Here one pays PRSI up to an income limit of £16,700 and after that one pays no more because one does not get any service.  I see no reason why a person earning over £16,700 should not continue paying because he is earning most.  We should be taking less from the person who earns less, in other words, the person earning under £120 a week. I make no apology for suggesting that people should pay PRSI even after they have reached the income limit of £16,500 because although they get no benefit after that they are usually covered by the VHI and, because of our health situation, more and more people are joining the VHI.  In 1992 people will join other insurance companies to get private health cover because the cover available on the national health at the moment is not too good.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="702" /> There are no incentives to employers to employ more people.  The Minister has not said he wants fewer people on social welfare.  There are over 240,000 people out of work and over 30,000 a year leaving the country.  They are the official figures. I wonder how many are really leaving?  In my city there are certainly 200 a week leaving.  In every family young people are leaving and this is very sad. Last year the Minister saved £90 million, yet the numbers unemployed or emigrating are the same.  How does the Minister reconcile those figures?  How did he save that money?  Was the situation created deliberately, in that if people were left without social welfare for long enough there would be a saving?  I have to say that in the long-term there is no saving.</P>
    <P>I am confused about the whole thing and now I am getting very annoyed about it.  Since 1980 the number of people out of work has doubled and it does not seem to matter which Government are in power.  There is no incentive.  Employers do not want people working for them. They just do not want to take on extra workers.  The welfare system is such that there is no incentive to work.  There are 109,000 people on long-term unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes a distinction between the unemployed and the long-term unemployed.  They should be treated similarily.  They are all people on social welfare.  We recognise that there are 32,000 people leaving the country each year.  Imagine what we are not prepared to recognise, but agencies like the Combat Poverty Agency will recognise it for us and give us our answers.  It seems we are not prepared to face up to the facts.  There were 6,000 extra jobs created last year, yet there are more people on the unemployment list.  We are saying rationalisation is needed and advocating that a person giving up his job should get a lot of money.</P>
    <P>Not more than three weeks ago a company I know of with 15 people working decided they could carry on with fewer <Col N="703" /> workers by bringing in English subcontractors. The 15 workers got on average £52,000 per person.  This money was tax free, but if the tax and other deductions had been made, that figure would be nearer £75,000 or £80,000 per person. The following week that company had only five people working earning £300 each a week.  Three of the people who got £52,000 got another job, and the State allowed that.  Is that a fair system?  One of the people who got £57,000 got a pension of £130 a week and, in addition, got a job with another company.  This person is only 51 years of age.  I am not saying he should not work, but we are creating a situation whereby the people left in that company are working ten hours a day rather than eight hours and probably doing three runs instead of two.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a serious review of the workplace on the part of management and workers.  We are creating this situation and yet we have only to walk 100 yards to meet a person who is working 22 hours a week for £50 a week while another person gets £57,000, £130 a week pension and another job.  The £130 a week should be enough for him if it were tax free &mdash; and it should be tax free if it is a pension.  I will admit that between the £57,000, the pension and the earnings from the other job that person is taxed very highly.  I have no objection to that. This person is paying a lot of money and coming home with 50 per cent of his money because of the present tax system. The State makes by taxing him more.</P>
    <P>We have created a situation where we are making 15 people richer while another five people, who could have been given a job, remain unemployed.  That is what is happening with our welfare and our tax systems.  We then say we want people to come into the country to create jobs.  Employers take on people on a part-time basis and give them £40 or £50 a week for working 20 or 21 hours, with the result that these people cannot get any other benefit.  If the person worked only 18 hours a week he would get benefit. Under the social employment scheme a person could work for three <Col N="704" /> days a week and his employer would have no objection to him working elsewhere for the rest of the week.  He would not even want to know how much the person earned for those days.  The employer's attitude is that he pays the person £70 a week and he is saving the State money.  I resent that.  It is the Minister's duty to simplify matters and to have a situation whereby everybody will be treated on an equal basis.  Priority should be given to the people who need work.</P>
    <P>I put a very strong emphasis on the fact that everybody should have some kind of work but there is nothing in the Bill to provide for that.  I would like to see employers employing more people but the Minister has given no incentives in this regard.  People are making a lot of money in chemical plants and in areas of high technology and they then leave the country when they have their money made.  I am not saying we do not want these people in the country; we do want them and I would like to see more of them coming here.  The Minister should provide an incentive to employers, particularly in the private sector, to take on more people without having to pay PRSI for these people.  The employer has to pay 17 or 18 per cent and he also has to pay a certain amount for the employee. We should create incentives in our local areas for employment such as glass factories, timber plants and so on.  The Minister should have discussions with the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern, and with social partners with a view to creating incentives for employers by reducing the amount of PRSI they have to pay.  Many companies are not making as much money as the high technology plants which are situated throughout the country.</P>
    <P>People may criticise the Minister and say that he is giving money to one area and not to another.  He has recognised that there are many people who are entitled to benefits, such as deserted husbands. At long last they are entitled to the same benefit as deserted wives.  There are now more deserted wives and unmarried mothers and I make no apologies for saying that these people should be looked <Col N="705" /> after.  It may not be an ideal situation but it is fact of life.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also recognised that people who are looking after their relations in the home should receive benefit and I welcome that.  These people never received benefit up to now and it is not before time that it was introduced. I congratulate the Minister for that.  The Minister is prepared to recognise the need for benefits in this area but he should extend them to other areas also. I know the Department of Finance will say they do not want to spend more money and that if they extend the benefits it will be an extra charge on the State. The Minister should put strong emphasis on employers creating more work.  I will be pressing this matter on Committee Stage and I will be asking the Minister why he is not prepared to reduce PRSI for employers.</P>
    <P>When the social employment scheme was first introduced the intention was to get people off the unemployment list and allow them to work not alone in the public sector but also in the private sector.  As I said here before, employers should be allowed employ people on a part-time basis.  If a job card was introduced for workers it would mean that the Department would not have to employ as many people to investigate irregularities.  Every person in the State, irrespective of where they are working, should have a job card. The Irish do not welcome the idea of having identification.  Every employee should have a PRSI number and his signature should be on his job card which would be held by the employer at all times.  When the employee leaves the employment the job card would be sent to the local exchange where it would be put through the computerised system. That would save a lot of money.</P>
    <P>It has been recognised at long last that we have a high rate of poverty.  The Minister for Social Welfare saved £90 million last year.  In this year's budget he provided an extra £70 million for social welfare. It has been recognised that over one-third of the population are living in poverty.  Rather than saving £90 million the Minister should have given, say, 10 <Col N="706" /> per cent of it to the people below the poverty line but that did not happen. They did not even get 5 per cent.  In comparison with other Minister, the Minister for Social Welfare has done excellent work at Cabinet level.  Cutbacks have been made in the Department of the Environment and other areas and I congratulate this Minister for not cutting back in the social welfare area.  He has shown the other Ministers he can save money, at least in the short term.</P>
    <P>There are people living in poverty, people on social welfare, who are suffering as a result of loan sharks.  I know the Minister has put a lot of work into this area and is very much aware of the problem.  I would like him, in his reply, to tell me what assistance he is getting in this regard from credit unions and banks. What are they doing as regards getting more and more people away from these loan sharks?  The Minister is taking particular interest in this area.  It is sad that many people on lower incomes are suffering as a result of these loan sharks.</P>
    <P>There is concern also about pension allocations.  I have heard of a number of cases of people claiming non-contributory allowances who are being assessed on their gross bank savings.  For instance, a couple with up to £6,000 savings in the bank seeking a non-contributory pension would be given a contributory allowance but the assessment is being made on the gross amount of their savings.  In other words, if they are receiving interest of between 7 per cent and 10 per cent on their savings in the bank they are assessed on the gross amount.  Even though it was agreed three years ago to abolish DIRT &mdash; on the basis that it would not yield very much &mdash; it is now being admitted that the yield from it is greater than had been anticipated.  Yet, the person being assessed for a non-contributory pension has not been given the benefit of being assessed on his or her net savings.  The Minister should examine that aspect because it is most unfair to such people.  Many people with such savings reserve them for their funeral or burial expenses.  I am aware that others have greater savings.  I know of many <Col N="707" /> pensioners who have savings they contend are sufficient only for their burial whereas, in fact, they would be sufficient to bury half a village.  That is the other side of the coin which has been acknowledged from the DIRT yield and which has been advanced as an argument in favour of its retention.</P>
    <P>Why is it that the oldest people receive more than those in greater need?  I have been advancing that argument to the Minister for the past three years.  I am glad that the Minister is recognising that anomaly at long last.  I contend there is no difference between a person of 79 years of age and another of 80.  Yet the 80 year old receives more than his or her counterpart aged 79.  Again, a 79 year old receives much more than, say, a 65 year old or 55 year old.  Until such time as that anomaly is abolished I will continue to press the point.  I do not see any reason that a son of, say, 55, with three children, should receive much less money than his parents of 75, 77 or 81 even though the parents may not need it.  I do not see the logic in that.  I shall be pressing that point on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister recognises that there are people who are defrauding the social welfare system.  While the Department are tackling the problem of abuse of the system it has to be said that there are also people being investigated who should not be.  I resent that practice. Indeed, any savings effected through the elimination of abuse should be given to those most in need because it is an undeniable fact that there are some people more in need than others who are not benefiting.  Until such time as that is rectified I will continue to press the point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss Wallace Miss Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House enables us to examine the record of the Government in a critical area of public policy.  Indeed the crucial test of any Government is the manner in which they treat the vulnerable, defenceless and the marginalised.  In this domain the record of the Administration is of the same high standard achieved in other <Col N="708" /> areas when thankfully, care of the weakest in our community has been maintained even in the difficult financial climate obtaining.</P>
      <P>This year there is a general increase of 3 per cent in widow's and old age pensions, unemployment, disability benefit and other weekly payments.  There is also a 12 per cent increase in the personal rates of long-term unemployment assistance and an 8 per cent increase for the short-term unemployed and those on supplementary welfare allowance.  The child dependant allowance is being increased to a minimum of £10 per week with payment of the higher rate of monthly child benefit of £21.75 in respect of the fifth child.  These increases are indeed to be welcomed especially by the unemployed with families.</P>
      <P>However, in the changing climate of the late eighties, it is not sufficient to increase payments within the context of an unchanging welfare system.  I am particularly pleased to note that the Minister is committed to reform along with the payment of increases.  Since 1987 we have witnessed the Minister's systematic streamlining of the social welfare system undertaken in a methodical, logical manner.  The greater efficiencies effected to date benefit the claimant as well as the overall administration of the system.</P>
      <P>For example, the number of different rates for children has been reduced from 36 to 12 and the rates of unemployment assistance from 17 to 6, leading to a greatly reduced administrative network. Legislation must reflect the needs of society.  I am pleased to note that section 6 provides for payment to widowers and deserted husbands with dependent children on the same lines as non-contributory widow's pension and deserted wife's allowance.  Such improvements were long overdue and introduced some sanity into the social welfare code.  However, it would be unwise to indulge in a round of congratulatory back-slapping in the belief that the task of reform has been completed. I know the Minister is aware of that fact and is committed to further reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is inequitable treatment of social <Col N="709" /> welfare claimants in similar circumstances. For example, widows, regardless of age, are entitled to a payment from the State at the time of bereavement whereas a deserted wife whose husband may leave her before the age of 40 is not entitled to such payment until she reaches the age of 40.  This creates an anomaly between, say, two women living in the same housing estate, one a widow and the other a deserted wife, both of whom may have ceased to work on marriage.  Both circumstances are similar.  Yet, the deserted wife will not be entitled to anything from the State until she reaches the age of 40.  This is another matter which must be examined in the changing circumstances prevailing in society today.</P>
    <P>In the course of his remarks the Minister referred to the six separate social assistance payments to lone parents. There is also the proposal at present that unmarried fathers receive such payments which would increase the total of that category to seven.  It is only reasonable to streamline that provision, leading to further simplification of the system overall. It is opportune to move in the direction of having claimants or recipients fall within one or two categories; either a person is unemployed and available for work or he or she is a lone parent and unavailable for work because of their commitment to their children.  That type of approach has much to recommend it. It would represent a further rationalisation of the system, reducing the number of categories from seven to one and would ensure that claimants are treated by the State based on their being available for work.  A crucial factor in all of this is the reduced bureaucracy and its attendant costs when much of the present paperwork would be greatly reduced.  It would also ensure that departmental officials would have more time available to deal with individual claimants rather than sorting through the technical difficulties within the different categories of claimants.</P>
    <P>There are other advantages to be considered. For example, there is a tendency at present to categorise people, when <Col N="710" /> many claimants find themselves allocated within a group to which there is a social stigma attached.  I do not suggest that redefining her social welfare payment category will change the reality or fact of a woman being an unmarried mother, the wife of a prisoner or a deserted wife. However, I submit that for many such people living bleak lives the weekly reminder of their status by the Department, the way in which they tend to be viewed, places yet another burden on their shoulders.  We must always be conscious of the dignity of the individual, remembering that dependency on the State constitutes a significant blow to self-esteem. I encourage the Minister and hope it would be possible for the Department to see their way to bring this about.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress the importance of the employment schemes.  No matter what Department are involved, the employment schemes are extremely important and have a great bearing on the social welfare position.  The manner in which schemes under the aegis of different Departments overlap can give cause for concern.  For example, under the start your own business scheme, once a person avails of the opportunity to start his or her own venture, should it fail that person is not entitled to a second chance under that scheme.  The Minister might discuss this with his counterpart in the Department of Labour because it has a huge bearing on social welfare.</P>
    <P>While I am not suggesting that the State should provide funds for people to use in ventures of questionable merit, on numerous occasions I submit that having but one chance at the start your own business scheme is restrictive.  It could be the case that a sound idea could fail to yield the expected results due to factors outside the individual's control, and should the same person develop another commercially viable idea he or she is excluded from benefits of this scheme. Given this situation, many people are left with no alternative other than to seek payment from social welfare.  I contend that with the scarcity of funds available to all Departments &mdash; the one we are interested in today is Social Welfare &mdash;<Col N="711" /> it is highly debatable as to whether the Department of Social Welfare should have to pay people who are denied the chance to be self-sufficient and contribute to the economy by virtue of rigidities of an employment scheme.  A relaxation of the rules or an improvement in these schemes holds potential for much employment and thus savings in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The social employment scheme, which was mentioned earlier, gives much needed work experience and can assist the unemployed in getting a foothold in the jobs market.  Yet, its relationship with the tax system can cause difficulties. Should a person be engaged under this scheme &mdash; it affects a married person in particular where his or her spouse is employed &mdash; the payment under the scheme is liable for tax.  This is a clear disincentive to take up the opportunities under the scheme when other things such as travelling to work, etc. are taken into account.  There is a definite need for remedial action as many people are financially better off remaining on unemployment benefit as distinct from taking up the social employment scheme because of the taxation of their spouse's income.  This is a pity because people are missing out on the opportunity of becoming more employable and getting involved in the workforce.  I am aware of a number of cases where people had to give up the opportunity of working under a social employment scheme because they would end up with less money at the end of the week.</P>
    <P>With regard to the part-time employment scheme, the one difficulty I have found &mdash; and I do not know if it is possible to get around it but perhaps it could be considered &mdash; is in relation to the self-employed. I had a case where a person got part-time employment with the local parish co-op.  Because the co-op could certify his work each week, he was then considered to be an insurable employee. However, the co-op were only involved to get him started in the job and when they withdrew the Department regulations did not allow him to continue <Col N="712" /> under the part-time allowance scheme.  I know this is difficult because the Department need the certification from the employer to say he is only employed for a certain number of hours, but in this case the person was employed by the co-op for seven months and they had certified that it was only a part-time job, and there was only work for two and a half or three days each week, but as soon as he became self-employed he was no longer entitled to benefit under the part-time allowance scheme.  Unfortunately he was ineligible for the start your own business scheme because he was no longer long-term unemployed since he had spent seven months on the part-time scheme.  He could not even join a social employment scheme because he was not coming off the dole after 12 months.  All schemes were closed to him because of his participation on the part-time allowance scheme for seven months.  It is in the area of self-employment where many jobs will be created, and I hope the Minister will do something to help these people.</P>
    <P>Against this background it is clear that the manner in which the State schemes work and the fashion in which decisions of one Department affect another, can militate against efforts to clear the labour market.  This is what we are interested in.  At a time when the Government are striving to increase employment, it is farcical that a lack of co-operation between relevant Departments could result in the attempts of the State to aid employment being thwarted by the consequences of other State policies, however unintentional. We must endeavour to ensure that those who could work productively are not left on unemployment assistance by virtue of such obstacles.  I appeal for greater emphasis on improving the financial incentives of these schemes. This could have a huge benefit in increasing the employability of the individual and getting the long-term unemployed back to full-time employment.</P>
    <P>I am pleased by the Minister's decision in the Bill to allow such amount of social welfare payment, as is reasonable in the circumstances, to be paid directly to the <Col N="713" /> spouse in the case of separate payments. From my experience this is a valuable reform.  All too frequently those in receipt of social welfare payments encounter other social problems as the Minister mentioned earlier &mdash; gambling, alcohol abuse and so on, which seem to prey on the weakest sections in the community.  Women in receipt of separate payments are often in difficult financial positions due to the differences of at least £12 between the maximum personal rate and the adult dependant rate.  The ideal situation for these people would be to have just one adult rate but this would not be feasible as an equal division between the two rates would have drastic effects on the single adult recipient.  I am satisfied that the proposals in the Bill cater well for the situation and illustrate a keen awareness of the realities of life faced by many families.  In facilitating the alleviation of their plight, the Minister has helped to humanise legislation which previously failed to reflect this reality.  This is very welcome.</P>
    <P>The requirement now being made of deserting spouses to contribute towards the payment being made under the welfare code for the maintenance of his or her family is very necessary.  The number of women in receipt of deserted wife's benefit or allowance has more than doubled in the past decade and now that the new deserted husband's allowance is being introduced regrettably it is evident that many spouses are walking away from their responsibilities towards their families and leaving the bill to the State.  The Minister seeks to impose a liability on the husband to contribute towards the maintenance of his wife and family or, with the new arrangements, to a wife to contribute to the maintenance of her husband and family.  This Bill contains clear provision which will enable the Department to obtain contributions from deserting spouses.  There is no doubt that this is important and necessary.</P>
    <P>The proposal to extend the child dependency allowance is significant.  The initial extension to 19 years is the first step towards eventually extending the period of payment of child dependency <Col N="714" /> allowance where the child is in full time education to 21 years.  I hope that it will progress to 21 years soon as it provides support particularly to long-term social welfare recipients while giving vital help to the child in his efforts to gain academic qualifications and enhance employment prospects.  There is no doubt that many families have not been able to give their 18 year olds the opportunity of continuing in education because of their income. They needed the income which the 18 year old could bring home and the loss of the social welfare allowance was unsustainable in the household.  This extension will I hope open education to many more people in this age group.</P>
    <P>In the current economic climate the effective management of funds is crucial and efforts to eradicate social welfare fraud have been an important feature of the departmental policy over the past couple of years.  I am pleased to see that there is a continuation of this policy in the Bill.  Moves to ensure that employers in construction, contract cleaning and security industries notify the Department when they take on new employees ensure that a loophole for welfare fraud has been closed.  The thorny issue of subcontractors not fulfilling their responsibilities in terms of tax and PRSI has demanded action for some time.  A sensible development is the amending of legislation to provide for the notification by the employer of the employment by him of any subcontractor.  In addition each subcontractor would have to notify the Department of any person engaged by him or working with him.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us figures of the number of people that have already been involved in this notification.  It places the emphasis where it should be placed, on the employer who has been colluding to defraud the social welfare system.  It should cool the ardour of many unscrupulous individuals who have built up a small industry in cheating the taxpayer and their competitors.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 20 and 21 of the Bill reflect the manner in which records are kept today and simplifies the task of establishing the culpability of <Col N="715" /> offenders in legal proceedings.  This is very important with regard to the administration of the Department.</P>
    <P>Section 22 of the Bill is most satisfactory. Under the section employers guilty of collusion with an employee to defraud the State shall be liable for the repayment on demand of the amount received by the employee as a result of that collusion.  These sections redress the balance in favour of the State.  Corrupt employers shall not be permitted to use social welfare outlays as a basic payment which they may top up.  I have no doubt that this was taking place across the board.  Legitimate, law abiding employers are entitled to expect the State to endeavour to provide a level playing field on which they may do business.  It was starting off £100 better off than employees in competitors' firms.  It is only fair to legitimate law-abiding employers that this type of thing be tidied up.  I am glad that this proposal has been so successful since it has been invoked.  A competitive environment is no excuse for criminal activity on the part of employer or employee and the sooner this message gets across the better.  I wish the Minister and his officials well in their attempts to stamp out offences.</P>
    <P>The urban and rural rates of unemployment assistance which were both outdated and unjustifiable have caused problems for some time.  In Meath the people in our only large town, Navan, received the lower rural rate of assistance. The move to have the population growth reflected in the legislation is welcome. In Meath apparently nobody was paid on the urban rate, so most people will benefit this year from the increase.  I welcome that tidying up of the whole system.</P>
    <P>Through the increases in this Bill and the improvements in streamlining the welfare code, the Government have kept their commitment to the most vulnerable in society.  The Minister deserves our credit and gratitude for the caring manner in which he has performed his <Col N="716" /> role in social welfare.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be dishonest of me not to say that the Minister has shown a considerable flair in relation to aspects of this Bill.  There were anomalies which caused injustices and the Minister has dealt effectively with a number of them. I commend the Minister on that.  There have been increases in various payments and whereas we in the Labour Party do not consider them adequate, at the same time we acknowledge that the Minister has made worth-while strides for which I again commend him.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party hold that the report of the Commission on Social Welfare should be implemented.  Here we will be talking about a basic income of £60 for a single person and £96 for a married couple.  The rate of payment for disability or unemployment benefit for a married couple with two children will be £95.80p which is far short of the £96 that the Commission on Social Welfare recommended for the couple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with a Minister who will deal with anomalies and make adjustments where possible.  I will deal first with the free fuel scheme.  It was a retrograde step to remove the free fuel scheme from the ambit of the health boards, particularly in the case of people on disability benefit.  The Minister agreed previously that there are a lot of people who have been on disability benefit for a very long time and that in everything except the technical definition, they are long-term social welfare recipients.  The health board scheme had a lot more discretion than this social welfare scheme and because the scheme has been removed from the health board such people have been excluded from payments under the free fuel scheme.  I welcome the change introduced by the Minister so that a child aged from 18 to 19, of a social welfare recipient, will now be considered a dependant.  That is a step in the right direction but will the Minister clarify the position in relation to the free fuel scheme?  Under the scheme where a dependant over 18 years was in full-time <Col N="717" /> education, even though no income was being paid to the parents for that student, because there was a person over 18 in the household, the family was denied free fuel.  With the change which means that an 18 to 19 year old will be considered a dependant, does that apply to the free fuel scheme?  I know the Minister is introducing a change whereby two social welfare recipients in a household who, if they were on their own would qualify for free fuel, will from next October receive a payment.  What will the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the free fuel scheme be with regard to a student over 18 years of age, as from October?</P>
    <P>Another anomaly relating to the free fuel scheme is where a pensioner is also in receipt of disablement benefit.  Disablement benefit is paid following an industrial accident or an industrially induced disease.  Obviously payment of disablement benefit is a recognition that the person has special needs but because of the rules of the scheme if a person has an income of more than £5 a week in excess of the welfare payment, even though the payment of more than £5 a week comes from the Department, he or she is disbarred from receiving the free fuel allowance.  The Minister should apply himself to this anomaly as it is an injustice under the scheme.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the injury benefits scheme has been extended to the Garda Síochána.  The Minister in his speech said that compensation can be paid to gardaí under the Garda Síochána compensation Acts.  I had occasion to attempt to introduce a Bill in this House in relation to compensation for prison officers.  Because there were money implications the Bill was not allowed. Will the Minister say what the position is with regard to prison officers and occupational injuries benefit?  If they are not at present entitled to it the Minister should look at extending the occupational injuries benefit scheme to the prison officers, particularly in the context of their not having a compensation Act to cover them for injuries or death arising in the course of their duties.  Obviously we would prefer to have many fewer <Col N="718" /> people on social welfare.  At the end of the day, social welfare is not unlike the fire brigade, it is there when a certain type of emergency arises.</P>
    <P>An issue that I have raised with the Minister's Department relates to community workshops and specifically in the context of community workshops in Waterford city.  Long-term unemployed people do not have means.  To become involved in community workshops where people can start up their own businesses, the enterprise allowance scheme is available under which £50 a week is paid.  I know from experience of particular workshops however, that the enterprise allowance scheme proves inadequate for people, particularly over the first three month period.  For instance, a married couple with two children would have £84.10.  That income is grossly insufficient as things stand, but to consider reducing that to £50 a week, particularly at the initial stages where a business is being built up and maybe orders do not come in for some time is unreasonable.  I would ask the Minister to consider extending payment of either unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit for the first three months of a business enterprise to assist people in getting businesses off the ground.  This is an investment by the State in our people and it will assist them in getting back to work.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to hear that the Minister is at present considering proposals regarding the family income supplement scheme.  However, an anomaly arose in the context of a case of which I am aware in my own area, where a man who had been unemployed for a long time succeeded in obtaining employment which was not a full week's work but was close to it.  He applied in November for family income supplement and it was granted.  On 23 December, just before Christmas, another child was born to that family but when he sought to have that child added as a dependant to his family income supplement he was informed that he would not get payment for that child until November 1989.  The position is that you are granted family income supplement for 12 months and it cannot be <Col N="719" /> changed.  I suggest in the spirit of the way in which the Minister tackles problems of this type that arise in the social welfare area that this is a matter that he should look at, in the context of encouraging people to get back to work, getting people off social welfare and thereby, at the end of the day, reducing the cost to the State.</P>
    <P>The provisions that the Minister is making to bring the urban and rural rate of unemployment assistance into line is to be welcomed and indeed is something that I have raised in this House.  I unreservedly commend that change.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the free telephone allowance and to cite a particular case to highlight a weakness in the scheme.  A widower in my area who was and still is on invalidity pension had a free telephone allowance until one of his children became 15 years of age.  If someone needs to send for a doctor late at night, it is not advisable to send a 15 or 16 year old out into the night, quite often in situations where telephone kiosks are a good distance from the home.  I would ask the Minister to consider that with a view to making the free telephone allowance available in a more humane way to families.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the Bill with which I would be very much at variance is the proposal to raise the floor for the assessment of pay-related benefit from £66 to £69, particularly when the ceiling has not been increased correspondingly.  Since this Government came to power, pay-related benefit has been decimated and less than £19 is the maximum amount of pay-related benefit for any recipient of unemployment benefit or disability benefit. I would see this as militating against the people in less well paid employment, and the Labour Senators will be opposing this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the Minister has made very genuine improvements in social welfare generally and, in particular, has tackled some long-standing anomalies and for this I once again commend him.  The underlying problem, as we in the Labour Party see it, is that payments under social <Col N="720" /> welfare are still very inadequate relative to the needs of many people in our society.  Figures like 1.2 million of our population living in poverty are very often heard and, indeed, we hear that 44 per cent of the farming community, for instance, live in poverty.</P>
    <P>While the social welfare code applies to some extent here, I wonder if there is a full take-up.  I know that there are many farmers that make less than their full contribution to the Exchequer but, on the other hand, I am equally aware that there are many family farmers that are virtually ekeing out an existence at the moment, living on very small incomes.</P>
    <P>We will later on be moving amendments, for instance, an important one proposing that copies of all information secured by investigating officers shall be supplied to each appellant, with an appeal notice at least seven days prior to the appeal being heard for unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.  People should know the case that they have to answer and the evidence that is being produced against them before they arrive at an appeal.</P>
    <P>As a public representative I have occasion to attend at appeal hearings against decisions of the Minister's Department.  I can be helpful to the appellants in as far as I can explain to them what the system is about and what the issues may be, but people who may never before have had experience of such a tribunal can be very much at sea at the hearing.  This is the case even though, let me say, in my experience the appeals officers of the Department make every effort to put people at ease and to explain to them what is happening there.  At the same time, it is an intimidating experience for many people.</P>
    <P>I wish I could say the same about all the medical referees in terms of how they treat people because a number of reports have come my way although obviously I have no way of checking them out.  It would indicate to me that people are not always treated with the courtesy and dignity to which they are entitled.  People should know what case they have to answer when they appear at a hearing. <Col N="721" /> We will also be moving an amendment that an appeals officer shall provide a written report together with his decision setting out the reasons for refusing an application.  Regarding the means testing for unemployment assistance we will be seeking that the means of the applicant only shall apply to applicants who are subject to means testing for the purpose of qualification.  I ask the Minister to respond to these points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusCullimore" hpid="Mr. Cullimore Mr. Cullimore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate provides me with an opportunity to pay tribute to a ministerial performance of quality. Since taking office two years ago the Minister has presided over a process of reform and rationalisation which has improved immeasurably the manner in which the social welfare system operates.</P>
      <P>It is indeed heartening that the Bill bears all the hallmarks we have come to expect.  Despite circumstances dictated by the financial situation the commitment to updating our social welfare code endures.  Needless bureaucracy has been reduced.  As flexibility is improved and efficiency enhanced the funds allocated by the Department are disbursed in an optimal fashion.</P>
      <P>The record since 1987 has been one of caring for those who, by virtue of economic conditions, handicap or family circumstances, cannot care for themselves or their dependants.  Of course this is what we expect from a Government who stay in touch with the people at all levels of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year we will create 36,000 new jobs yet there are those who cannot claim their part in the national recovery.  I would much prefer that those availing of social welfare support could use their talents to contribute to the betterment and advancement of society.  For this reason I am glad the Minister introduced a new flexibility in regard to unemployment claimants.  Currently a person who has exhausted entitlements to unemployment benefit can requalify for benefit having worked and paid contributions for 13 weeks.  This is an incentive for those wishing to take up insurable employment for a short duration.  When entitled to <Col N="722" /> or in receipt of unemployment benefit a person is not entitled to receive unemployment assistance but with new developments the rate of unemployment assistance is now higher than the rate of unemployment benefit which could be a disincentive to people to take up employment of short duration.  This is a clear example of a State scheme operating in such a fashion as to introduce a distortion in the labour market.  Therefore, the proposals to allow an unemployed person the option of claiming either unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance &mdash; whichever is more favourable &mdash; is a sensible and practical reform.</P>
    <P>A recent European Community forecast report in <i>The Irish Times</i> showed that unemployment was set to fall from 18.6 per cent in 1988 to 18 per cent in 1989 and to 17.5 per cent in 1990 on current trends.  While these predictions bear testimony to the Government's sterling efforts of the last two years their determination to reduce unemployment must be maintained.  The Minister's proposal in relation to flexibility in claiming unemployment payments will facilitate all unemployed people, particularly the long-term unemployed, to find a foothold in the job market.  For people who have been out of work for a considerable period there are proposals regarding the outdated nature of their skills and training. The Minister is to be applauded for his initiatives designed to help people to pursue educational courses and to take up part-time and voluntary work.  The part-time education rule is invaluable because it encourages those who are out of work to avail of the latitude in the system which allows participation in part-time courses without infringing the availability of work criteria.  It is to be hoped that such developments will be capitalised upon so that the number of people whose lack of employment is attributed to structural factors may be reduced.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with those who may pay their contributions to economic growth and development, I wish to comment on those who have finished their working lives.  After a lifetime of work the elderly have a right to expect State support.  The <Col N="723" /> Government's prudent economic policy has contributed to the low level of inflation.  However, it is our duty to ensure that the basic income of the elderly is adequate to meet their needs. It is gratifying to see that having raised the old age pension by 25 per cent over the last three years, the Government are maintaining their commitment to keeping it ahead of inflation.</P>
    <P>The decision to extend the free fuel scheme to include households where an old age pensioner is living with a long-term unemployed person is a positive move which will ease the strain and discomfort encountered by people in that situation.</P>
    <P>The proposal to abolish the distinction between urban and rural rates of unemployment assistance is timely.  The differential dated from 1934 and created many anomalies.  It led to inequitable treatment of certain recipients.  In my own constituency of Wexford under the social welfare code persons living in Enniscorthy received lower rates of assistance.  I am pleased that this irksome situation has been rectified and that the growth in population in such towns has been recognised in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Simplistic slogans and allegations of new Right economics from certain quarters cannot obscure the fact that the policies of this Government enjoy the support of the overwhelming majority of the people.  Nevertheless, reform of the nation's finances is not an end in itself but a means to a greater end which will enable the country to realise its potential as a thriving independent State.  While the Government are effecting a radical change in the nation's fortunes this Bill signifies that the weakest in society will not stand alone and unaided.  The Minister and his officials are to be commended on this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers I generally welcome the Bill which tackled a number of anomalies in the social welfare code.  The Minister is to be congratulated for introducing such reforms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="724" /> I should like to raise the issue of unemployment assistance.  The Minister has abolished the differential between urban and rural rates which dates back to 1934. This is certainly to be welcomed but I have a criticism in relation to rural applicants seeking unemployment assistance. I am speaking particularly about small farmers seeking small farmers' assistance and the old age non-contributory pension. I should also like to refer to the widows of such farmers who own a small farm and who are in receipt of a widow's pension.  To qualify for a pension the first thing the Department do is to determine her means or income arising from an outside source, i.e., the farm.  I submit that the means used by the Department in arriving at the income derived from the farm is unfair.  I say that from practical experience as I have dealt with hundreds of these cases in the last number of years. Senator O'Shea talked about the intimidating atmosphere of an appeals hearing and the fact that an applicant goes through such a procedure without knowing the evidence against him.  I support the Senators appeal for a greater amount of information to be made available.</P>
    <P>In relation to the investigation of means carried out by social welfare officers operating under the 1981 Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, in particular sections 146 and 156 to 159, it appears that some of the calculations made are unfair.  Let us take a case I dealt with recently.  In this case a small farmer with a small portion of land was in receipt of £150 per annum arising from the letting of this land.  That was his only income. However, the official of the Department of Social Welfare stated that the letting value of the land was £500 per annum despite there being evidence from the auctioneer and the person who had leased the land that the actual amount paid was £150.  This is an example which illustrates many other.  The decision of the Department of Social Welfare which of course was final was that the letting value was £500 with the result that this poor man living well below the poverty line which is now about £48.50 per adult equivalent <Col N="725" /> in a household was done out of perhaps £8 or £9 a week.  This made the difference between living in hardship and grinding hardship.</P>
    <P>In the determination of means, small farmers are not allowed a write down for depreciation of fixed assets, such as buildings.  I wish to make a comparison with the tax code.  In the assessment of means in the tax code, a large or small farmer is allowed a write down for fixed assets and allowed stock relief.  We are not asking for this in respect of social welfare recipients but we cannot understand why a farmer cannot put a value on his fixed assets, and moving assets if he owns machinery, at the time he becomes entitled to a social welfare benefit, such as unemployment assistance.  We cannot understand why he is not allowed, say, a 10 per cent write down per annum as this would have a positive effect in the determination of his means but the Department of Social Welfare take a contrary view.  Under the regulations this is not allowed.</P>
    <P>What is also very irritating is that in the assessment of means they use a category which they call &ldquo;own produce consumed&rdquo;. I should explain that it is assumed by the Department of Social Welfare that everybody who owns land consumes their own milk and vegetables although the evidence may show that the applicant does not own a cow.  Even if he was milking his cows he would be foolish to drink unpasteurised milk.  When asked what is meant by &ldquo;own produce consumed&rdquo; they are told that it is milk produced and consumed on the farm.  Even if the evidence shows that the farmer is growing no vegetables at all and there is nothing growing on the farm but grass it will still be insisted upon, because of the regulations, that he is still somehow producing vegetables, that is, food on his own farm.  The maximum figure applied in these cases is about £150 per annum with the result they are deprived of about £3 per week in unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to lecture the Minister in relation to this matter.  Being an urban Deputy, he may not be aware that these anomalies exist but I can assure him that <Col N="726" /> they do.  I said earlier I gleaned my experience from dealing with people at this level.  I have attended dozens of appeals over the past few years and, here again, I have found wrong information and misinformation being given along with a basic lack of knowledge on the part of appeals officers.  I do not wish to reflect in any way on appeals officers but they do not seem to realise that these anomalies exist and very often their rulings reflect this lack of knowledge.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said in relation to unemployment assistance:</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the new powers would be directed primarily at the long-term unemployed and would be used, for example, to allow persons to attend courses of education, subject to certain conditions, without affecting their entitlement to unemployment payments.</P>
    <P>This is a welcome reform but it does not go far enough.  It is very common nowadays for a school leaver of 18 years of age not to find employment and in order to survive they have to apply for unemployment assistance.  If this teenager goes on any training course, such regulation which requires a person to always be available for work he or she would lose their entitlement to unemployment assistance.  I would not be able to conceive of any regulation which would act as a greater disincentive for people to go on training courses than that one.  The Minister states that the new powers would primarily be directed at the long-term unemployed.  However, a school leaver cannot be deemed to be long-term unemployed.  I ask the Minister to extend the scheme to school leavers who cannot find work and who in order to survive have to apply for unemployment assistance.  If these school leavers go on some short-term training course they would find they would no longer be entitled to receive unemployment assistance with the result that they would no longer be able to continue on the course as by staying on the course they would be in receipt of no income at <Col N="727" /> all.  I ask the Minister to take a closer look at this problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister also made reference to the prescribed relative allowance.  I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that in the past few years in quite a number of cases this allowance has been cancelled in rural areas.  A typical example is where a social welfare officer, on instructions from the Custom House, visits a household where a son or daughter cares for a parent for the purpose of carrying out a means test.  The applicant finds that the criteria used are far more severe than those used when he first applied for the allowance.  I know of many cases where an injustice was done. In some instances the prescribed relative allowance was discontinued purely and simply because in the opinion of the Department of Social Welfare the prescribed relative was not giving full-time care and attention to the elderly parent or relative.</P>
    <P>In a typical case a son or daughter, unmarried, decides to stay on the farm to look after ageing or infirm parents and, as a result, cannot go to work.  Such people glean a small income, say, from their farms but because they do that, under the new directions from the Department of Social Welfare, in most cases I have become familiar with they lose their prescribed relative allowance. The prescribed relative nowadays would appear to be entitled to no income at all other than the value of the prescribed allowance which is about £30 per week, if that.  The Minister will readily agree that to say that anyone could live on £30 a week is utterly contemptible.</P>
    <P>Other Senators have spoken about the problems regarding medical referees and I concur with them.  I cannot for the life of me understand why when independent medical evidence is presented to a medical referee by a consultant who is very familiar with an applicant who has suffered some disabling illness or some disabling condition, the medical referee decides to disqualify such a recipient, yet medical referees have done that.  Even <Col N="728" /> with the evidence provided by, very often, eminent consultants, doctors and so on, certifying that these people are unfit for work and that to undertake work would be dangerous for them, the medical referees, in so many cases unfairly deem these people fit for work and, consequently, they lost their benefit.</P>
    <P>If a medical referee disqualifies you from payment if you are suffering from some form of sickness or disability the next line of appeal is to an appeals officer and, in fairness to them, they very often reinstate such people.  Appeals officers are not medical people but certainly they apply a little more compassion in their decisions than very many medical referees. What riding instructions &mdash; so to speak &mdash; have medical referees going out to investigate somebody who is in receipt of sickness or disability benefit?  I cannot escape the impression that the instruction they are getting is to do everything possible to disqualify the applicant.  I ask the Minister to have a close look at that because if that is taking place, then I suggest no greater injustice is done under the social welfare code and quite a few injustices are done under the social welfare code.  I would have to single out the action of many of the medical referees.</P>
    <P>I have an amendment down for Committee Stage relating to the free travel scheme operated by the Department of Social Welfare.  Free travel applies to people over the age of 66.  It applies to people in receipt of an invalidity pension either from this country or the UK, and it applies to all persons who are in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance, irrespective of age in that case, and in the case of invalidity pension either from this country or the UK.  There is a very unfortunate category of people, very small in number, disabled people who have an income from some source which is above the maximum rate of the DPMA.</P>
    <P>The disabilities I am talking about are loss of limbs such as arms or legs.  Such persons may have acquired a skill &mdash; some are artists &mdash; which gives them an income of £50 a week or £100 a week.  I find it a sad commentary on society that we have <Col N="729" /> to disqualify such people from the benefit of the free travel scheme.  I know of one unfortunate disabled person, who had suffered the loss of his arms.  At a railway station on one occasion while trying to get his fare from his top pocket, which he had to do by the use of his mouth, suddenly he was set upon by hoodlums and his money was taken.  This unfortunate man could not qualify for free travel because he had an income of about £53 per week which he earned from a certain skill he had acquired.  I appeal to the Minister today to extend the free travel scheme to this category of people.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the union of voluntary organisations who look after disabled people in Ireland that the number of such people here is in hundreds.  If you are over 66 years of age and a millionaire &mdash; and there are millionaires in this country who go around in aeroplanes etc. &mdash; you are entitled as of right to free travel and this we do not question.  Therefore, is it not only right and natural justice that people who for one reason or another are wheelchair-bound, who have lost an arm or both arms, a leg or both legs, nevertheless somehow can earn a little income for themselves which is about the maximum rate of disabled person's allowance, should qualify for free travel?</P>
    <P>These are the points I wish to make.  I will come back to them on Committee Stage, but I hope the Minister has taken note of some of them because I make them based on sympathy I feel as a result of the experience I have had of dealing with social welfare cases.  I happen to live in a county where almost 50 per cent of the people in one way or another qualify &mdash; or should qualify &mdash; for some kind of social welfare or social assistance, so naturally dealing with their problems and the attendant poverty is a major part of my political experience.  It is not the fault of any of these people.  It is one of the accidents of history, geography and a number of things.  It is the absolute duty of Government to address the problems of these people and very often redress the injustices that on very many occasions are done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Members of the Seanad in welcoming this new Social Welfare Bill.  The whole spectrum of social welfare presents an important administrative problem for those who contribute to it, those who draw up the legislation and those who desire improvement.  It is a vast area. Those of us who want to be fair and honest and who have experience on the ground readily admit that having regard to the enormity of the matter, the sectors to be covered and changing circumstances, the introduction of new legislation is not the complete answer.</P>
      <P>I welcome the review, the new legislation and the benefits it brings to different sectors.  Some people undoubtedly will say it is not fair, it does not do this or that and it does not cover areas they are interested in.  Some people will focus on one section.  That is not a workable approach.  In providing social welfare benefits to the under-privileged, the aged and those generally who need them, the Department should review claims annually. They are doing a reasonable job and the Minister has adopted a very practical and positive approach.  Comments in the other House and the fact that the Bill went through without a division make it crystal clear that it is a good Bill which brings about improvements in looking after those in need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every public representative who has an opportunity to comment has his own area of concern.  I would ask the Minister to examine the possibility of getting more people back to work by introducing incentives.  When we look at the live register and the number of people unemployed, it is not unfair to say that half of those people are not employable.  They are either in jobs or they have no intention of working.  We are all aware that if we need to have some jobs carried out in the house or in the garden, people are not standing around in big numbers waiting to be employed.  There is no legislation that can resolve this problem.  The way to reduce the numbers on the live register is to give a greater incentive to go to work.  This would be a welcome <Col N="731" /> development and I urge the Minister to consider it.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Department might also consider a low rate of PRSI contribution for boys and girls aged between 18 and 22 who get employment on farms.  A number of farmers, especially small tillage farmers, have not the ability to pay a wage equal to the dole, together with PRSI.  Many small business people are in the same position and cannot afford to employ people on a wage which would compete with income from the dole and some casual work. I am not revealing anything which the ordinary person does not know.  There is no magic button which can be pressed to bring people back to work, but a low contribution from both employer and employee would be helpful.  A contribution of £1 per week for an 18-year-old boy, increasing after two years' employment to £2, would not impose hardship and would not be a major obstacle to his employment on a farm. The same would apply in the business sector.  I maintain that this is the only way to reduce the numbers of unemployed.  If the Government changed tomorrow and we had a new Government comprised totally of those who would advocate a socialist approach, they could not achieve a reduction in the live register.  It is not possible to talk it away.  Even if we had vast resources of oil, it would still be impossible.  I would urge the Minister to consider my point and plan for getting people back to work.</P>
    <P>The social employment scheme is an excellent one.  I recently attended a meeting of at least 200 people who claimed they were not getting enough under this scheme.  Single men get £60 per week for two and a half days work and they can take up paid employment for the rest of the week.  Somebody proposed that the scheme should be scrapped and this suggestion drew the loudest applause.  I wonder why.  Were the people there opposed to the scheme because it was interfering with their programme of drawing the dole and working at the same time?  I could only conclude that these <Col N="732" /> people wanted the scheme scrapped because they had such a programme which they were anxious to maintain, whereby they got about £120 while continuing to do nixers on the side.</P>
    <P>The social employment scheme provides a starting base which should be widened to include work for local authorities or for small business people and farmers.  It is a very worthwhile scheme which takes people back to reality and encourages them to get back to work.  Those who participate in the scheme are anxious to be included within the PRSI system.  This means that they want to go back on the dole again.  I would not go down that road.  The positive approach of the scheme would thereby be nullified.  I would rather see the scheme extended so that people would become involved and adopt the right attitude to work.  There is no way to reduce the live register except by getting the attitude right.  If you want to teach a language you get hold of those coming into school and get the attitude right.  There should be a time limit for those on the live register and there should be reviews.  Nobody could dispute that this Minister has had a very positive approach.  I should like to support that development.  The Government should consider giving special incentives to young people starting up.  Farmers and small businessmen should be encouraged to take on one or two more employees.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill represent a big improvement and all Members welcome them.  My appeal to the Government is that they should continue to tackle unemployment.  The Minister for Social Welfare is very alert to the need to carry out a review of the social welfare system and I am hopeful that next year he will produce a plan of action to get more people back to work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McGowan has tempted me to respond to his comments. He said that everything possible was being done to get people back to work, but I should like to point out to him that the private sector receive in the region of <Col N="733" /> £1,250 million annually to create employment but they are not succeding.  Had the wealth tax been implemented in the way we suggested, it would have meant an extra £25 million for the Government and that could have been used to create more jobs.</P>
      <P>I welcome the improvements in social welfare benefits and in particular the increase for the long-term unemployed. I am pleased to learn of the determination of the Minister to eliminate abuses of the system.  I am sure all Members will agree with the Minister in regard to that.  I should like to commend him on the initiatives he has announced to improve the welfare system.  Measures to improve basic welfare payments and to tackle the problem of homelessness were announced in the budget but they do not got far enough to redress the fundamental inequities that exist in society.</P>
      <P>I can understand how those who are involved in combating proverty and helping the underprivileged despair at the extent of the increases granted by the Government to social welfare receipients. They are concerned that because of our political system they are unable to tackle the problem of poverty in a real way.  I have never been satisfied that increases in social welfare benefits announced in budgets deal adequately with the problem of poverty.  Successive Governments have paid lip service to the problem of poverty in our society.  Ministers take credit for increases in social welfare benefits but the problem of poverty deepens. We seem set on maintaining a version of society like that of the fifties when we had large scale unemployment and emigration.  On the other hand, we claim to be distributing the wealth of the country equally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the wealth tax was set at 1 per cent many people objected and others were astonished that there was so much about.  While the 1 per cent tax yielded very little when it was introduced it would be useful today to create jobs.  In our budgets small improvements are announced for the less well off but because of the way the system works the division between the haves and the have <Col N="734" /> nots deepens.  People are finding it more difficult to survive.  As a result of the cutbacks many people do not have access to our health care or education systems. In fact, they do not get an opportunity to participate in society.  We contradict ourselves on many occasions.  We say we are doing something for the most needs but our actions give a different impression, particularly in regard to the distribution of wealth.  We may despair and wonder when the issues of inequality, poverty and exclusion will be faced up to, and I do not think that is likely to occur in the near future.  The increases granted annually enable people to survive but do not amount to an improvement in their standard of living.</P>
    <P>What is happening is that society is encouraging brash individualism.  There is a lot of emphasis on that philosophy.  I am not blaming the Fianna Fáil Administration alone for that because former Governments can be accused of it.  The inevitable consequence of this philosophy is that the poor will suffer.  It appears that all we are prepared to acknowledge is that there are poor people who are deserving of help, people who are down on their luck.  I have always maintained that we could do a lot to help those people if we collected wealth tax, corporation profits tax and so on.  I cannot understand why the Government do not have the political will to do that.</P>
    <P>I will highlight the inequalities in our society at every opportunity.  I regret that we cannot persuade our colleagues in Opposition of the need to tackle unemployment, inequality and poverty in our society.  My colleague has made many points about the provisions of the Bill and I do not intend to repeat them. However, I should like to refer to an article by Paul Tansey in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> on 26 February last on &ldquo;Money Matters&rdquo;.  What he says is that ordinary workers who lose their jobs and apply for unemployment benefit this year will get less cash than they would have got three years ago; that in each of the last three budgets increases in the rate of unemployments benefit were announced with a flourish; that over this period the rate of <Col N="735" /> unemployment benefit for a person with an adult dependant has been increased from £67.60 to £74 a week; that this represents arrears of 9.5 per cent in the basic rate of unemployment benefit since 1986. Despite these increases workers on average earnings who apply for unemployment benefit having lost their jobs in 1989 will draw less cash then if they had been made redundant in 1986.  He then goes on to talk about the cause of cuts in benefit for the newly unemployed.  He attributes it to the phasing back of pay-related benefit from 25 per cent right down to 12 per cent.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on this.  Is there any way he can show me that there is a balancing out?  I have not found it.</P>
    <P>Employees earning the average industrial wage who lost their jobs were able to have 80 per cent of a replacement ratio in unemployment benefits.  As late as 1985 people who were made redundant were able to receive four-fifths of their previous income in unemployment benefits. However, since the reduction in the rate of pay-related benefit to 12 per cent in 1987, benefits have been sharply reduced.  I would like the Minister to look at this.  I would like to know if he agrees with me and, if so, if anything can be done about this reduction?  If he does not agree, can he tell us how he can say this balances out?</P>
    <P>That is my short contribution.  I do not want to hold the House up any longer. In general I welcome the Bill except for one or two small anomalies that have also been mentioned by my colleagues.</P>

I listened to what the Senators had to say.  Here in the Seanad there has always been a very thorough analysis of the area of social welfare. Some of the Senators seem to be closely in touch with the reality of the difficulties <Col N="736" /> faced by people with the social welfare system as a whole.</P>
      <P>I said at the outset that these measures are an important advance in financial terms.  Let me give an example of the nature of the improvements.  A widower with five children on supplementary welfare allowance will have received an increase of £40.30 per week.  In real terms, allowing for the effect of inflation in the period pre July 1988 to post July 1989, the net increase is £35.90.  A widower with two children would have got an increase of £22.30.  Deputies will recognise the importance of introducing this scheme.  I am very glad it has received the welcome it did.  The scheme includes deserted husbands as well as widows.  It is a major development in our social welfare system generally.  A married couple with five children on supplementary welfare allowance will have received, over the same period, £19.70 which in net real terms is an increase of £13.80.  A married couple with five children on rural long-term unemployment assistance will have received an increase of £20.90 which in real terms is £14.60.  A married couple on long-term urban unemployment assistance will have received slightly less, £19.10, a net increase of £12.70.</P>
      <P>This indicates the size of the increases and the fact the Government have made a genuine effort to tackle the problem of lower incomes by identifying the people who are most likely to be at risk in our society today.  These increases, the one last July and the one now, come after the assessment done by the ESRI.  The assessment of the ESRI is based on 1986 and early 1987, but the improvements have taken place since that date and are a substantial improvement in the position of those on the lowest incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators contributed over a wide range and I know they will not want me to deal with every single point because it would take quite some time to do that.  I will pick out some of the principal points. Senator Cregan made a wide-ranging contribution.  He was particularly concerned about people on disability benefit and instanced a case in Cork where someone was called from Kinsale into Cork <Col N="737" /> for examination despite the fact that this person was obviously in no fit condition to go to Cork.  There is a system whereby one can be certified by one's doctor as medically unfit to attend.  Approximately 3 per cent of people who are called for examination send in such certificates; there were 2,760 last year.  The total called was 92,000.  The numbers are very large as the Senator will appreciate.  All the relevant information is set out in the documentation which is sent to the individual. It is stated that if a person is unable to attend for medical examination they should get a certificate to that effect from their GP.  I am not citing this by way of argument with the Senator.  I am just saying the system was there and maybe the person in question was not aware of it.  With the computer in operation people can be called in relation to the illness they have or the duration of the illness.  It is obviously difficult to meet all situations but the time at which people are called is related approximately to the likely duration of the illness.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan also pointed out that in the UK they are now allowing people over 65 to work and earn some money. We, of course, have always done that for old age pensioners, and the British are just arriving at that situation now. Senator Cregan also spoke about incentives to employers to employ more people.  I have to agree with him that we are anxious to have such incentives, but it is not so simple in practice to have incentives that work and are not open to abuse.  The previous Government tried a number of things which did not have the effect that was desired.  For example, there was the attempt through the PRSI pension scheme to try to encourage more employment.</P>
    <P>The use of that scheme over particular periods when employment is at its lowest or when there are peaks of unemployment might be more beneficial.  That possibly could be looked at further.  Various studies have been carried out on this matter by the NESC and they cannot find evidence which supports the claim that to reduce PRSI contributions would increase employment.  There might be <Col N="738" /> other reasons for reducing PRSI contributions but from the various studies that have been carried out no positive evidence has been shown that more employment would be created by doing so.</P>
    <P>In gross terms employers' PRSI costs amount to approximately 6.5 per cent of overall costs.  Labour costs in general and employers' PRSI in particular are low in Ireland when compared with most European and OECD countries.  I will not say any more on that matter.  The one country whose costs are lower than ours is Britain and they have no ceiling, which means income is higher.  I think it was Senator Cregan who raised the question of lifting the ceiling even further to give easement at the lower end.  This can be looked at further but in Britain there is easement but you do not get benefit under a certain level.  For people who work fewer hours there is a financial as well as a time yardstick.  We are examining that matter at present but it is fairly complicated.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the whole position regarding part-time work.  The amount of part-time employment is increasing and that is something I am concerned about.  In tackling that problem you have to be careful to maintain benefits and entitlements.  I can assure the Senator, and also Sentor O'Shea who raised the same question, that we are examining that matter fairly urgently at present.  I am concerned about the development that is taking place in this area.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan asked if I want fewer people on social welfare.  There are two answers to this.  Naturally I would rather see fewer unemployed people but there will always be more elderly people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>People are surviving longer and that is the position all over Europe.  In all the developed countries people are living longer and consequently there are more people to be provided for at that end of the scale.  Senator Cregan <Col N="739" /> also raised the question of numbers.  Our figures are built into the Estimates at the beginning of the year.  At the beginning of 1988 our figure for registered unemployed was 256,000 and at the end of the year the average number of people who received unemployment assistance throughout the year was 242,000 rather than 256,000.  At the beginning of the current year the figure was 232,000. There is a difference in terms of numbers. One may argue what the difference is and what is causing it.  We know there is a certain amount of abuse but the reality is that the number we have to cater for is being reduced.</P>
      <P>The other side of the coin is in many respects the most important one, and that is the number of people actually at work. The Senator mentioned that last year there was an increase of 6,000 in the number of people at work.  That was the first time since 1980 that there had been an actual recorded increase in the number of people employed, and that was very heartening.  The Estimates for 1989 provide for 36,000 new jobs.  Against that we have to set the losses that would occur in one form or other.  It is also anticipated that the number at work will rise further this year and at the end of the day that is the principal criterion.  In regard to social welfare, it is estimated that 232,000 people will receive social welfare every week.</P>
      <P>The Senator also mentioned loan sharks.  We have set up a supervisory committee to deal with this matter and they are working in conjunction with St. Vincent de Paul, community welfare officers, banks and credit unions to discourage people from taking out loans from moneylenders, particularly unregistered moneylenders.  This problem seems to be fairly widespread.  We have to give that committee time to do their job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator also asked where the savings have gone.  Essentially, they all went back into the system and were absorbed in improvements.  Various things were done which it would have been difficult to do otherwise.  I make no apology for having an efficient, effective <Col N="740" /> system and I think Senators generally like to see that.  Obviously when I get additional resources I will make improvements in the system.</P>
    <P>Senator Wallace spoke particularly about reforms generally and the lone parent allowance.  We are looking at this broader question of a lone parent allowance. There are various legislative implications involved and there are differences between the schemes but we are examining this matter at present and I would hope at a later stage to be able to introduce a co-ordinated and comprehensive lone parent allowance scheme.  While some people may be categorised in people's minds they are not categorised in our books.  There are two categories, one for widows and one for all other types of social assistance, and is not divided into unmarried mothers, deserted wives and so on.</P>
    <P>Senator Wallace and a number of other Senators spoke about assisting people in starting up their own businesses.  Senator O'Shea talked in particular about community workshops, the long-term unemployed and giving payment for a three month period to assist people in getting back to work.  That is the purpose of the flexible arrangement we have provided for in this Bill.  It will enable us to deem these people to be available for work for a period.  That would require the sanction of the Minister for Finance but we will have power to bring in regulations along those lines.  That is a matter that has been mentioned previously by Senators.  I am very glad the Government have allowed me to do this because it is a fairly major change in the legislation regarding those on unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>This measure applied previously in regard to unemployment benefit but it was probably required less because people on benefit for the first 15 months were less likely to need it, and it did not apply at all to unemployment assistance. We have introduced a measure of flexibility in this regard and we will be considering regulations to bring that flexibility into effect.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Shea mentioned specifically the community workshops.  That is one <Col N="741" /> of the things we had in mind.  A group in Cork raised this matter with me and the Senator spoke about a group in Waterford. Obviously both Cork and Waterford are leading the way in a variety of matters. These two areas are very much to the fore in tackling the problem of moneylenders.  We have been to the fore in tacking that problem and will be able to do so within the flexibility of the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Of course, we will have to specify what we are doing which will apply to various educational schemes and courses which will be covered.  We would be more anxious to begin the educational courses at a somewhat higher age level, rather than immediately on reaching the age of 18.  I know one Senator advocated our beginning at the age of 18 which would be very close to the third-level education entry age.  We do not want to be in conflict in that area.  In any event we will have the power to implement that provision.  I think it was Senator Connor who advocated that we cover people who would just have left school.  Technically that could be done after the implementation of the provisions of this Bill.  We will begin with the long-terms unemployed.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Shea covered a wide range of subjects including the appeals system and the provision of documentation.  The position at present is that, if a claimant requests copies of any reports or evidence, including reports of a social welfare officer, such documents will be supplied to him.  For example, reports in relation to appeals can range from straightfoward means assesments carried out by social welfare officers to more sensitive reports relating to, say, the question of desertion in the case of social assistance or deserted wife's allowance and medical reports in relation to capacity for work.</P>
    <P>Unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance cases, in which there would have been some involvement on the part of an investigating officer and which later give rise to appeals usually involve the questions of availability for work, or genuinely seeking work in cases where fraudulent claims have arisen.  In <Col N="742" /> such cases claimants on request would also receive copies of any documentation in relation to their cases.  In any event, in accordance with the principles of natural justice, an appellant is fully informed at a hearing of their case that they must answer in order to succeed in their appeal.  Senator Connor, from what he said, seemed to have attended a number of appeals cases.  I have noted what Senators have had to say in that respect. I should say that the whole question of appeals is at present under review.</P>
    <P>Senator Cullimore and others welcomed the abolition of the rural rate of unemployment assistance which must be acknowledged, was amomalous.  From what Senator Wallace had to say I gather that nobody in County Meath had received the urban rate which, when one thinks about it, appears to be extraordinary. I was aware of the variations obtaining nationwide, particularly with regard to places like, say, Tallaght, the outskirts of the City of Cork, Waterford and other places.  The abolition of that rural rate constitutes an historic step since that provision had obtained since 1934.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Shea raised the question of the free fuel scheme.  I should make it clear that health boards still have discretion in this respect on grounds of illness. I must stress that the discretionery powers, particularly with regard to illness, remain with the various health boards.  I came across instances of health board officials contending they were no longer responsible for handling the provisions of that scheme.  It has been pointed out to them that it is quite clear that responsibility still lies with them. There may have been such instances while the changes were being effected but discretion and responsibility rest with them.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of occupational injury <i>vis-á-vis</i> members of the Garda and whether prison officers are covered, I should say that prision officers are covered; they are covered by virtue of the fact that they are not excluded. Sometimes that is a problem that arises <Col N="743" /> from interpretation of legislative provisions, ascertaning who is and who is not covered.</P>
    <P>With regard to the assessment of means of widows and small farmers, I should say that there are fairly generous allowances generally available for such people.  In the case of old age penisoners a couple can have up to £53,000 capital and still be eligible for the minimum old-age non-contributory pension.  Senator Connor spoke about the maximum pension and a figure of £6,000 savings.</P>
    <P>Many Senators referred to the difficulties encountered when people are subjected to a means tests.  Bringing the self-employed into the taxation system will mean that, after three years, there will not be any means tests, with particular refrence to widows and small farmers which will constitute a tremendous improvement in their cases. However, for old age pensions it may take up to ten years to have that means test problem overcome.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Shea also raised the question of dependants aged between 18 and 21.  In the past season I have raised the relevant age to 21 which means that children in education will be regarded as dependants of their parents up to that age.  At the beginning of the season I ensured that anybody still in education, not over the eligible age, would not be cut off from benefit in the course of the season.  That constituted a step forward but, in the course of the year, I was authorised to extend cover up to age 21.</P>
    <P>Senators would be surprised to learn of the number of improvements we have been able to effect in the system overall. We are aiming to have age of 21 as the &ldquo;across the board&rdquo; age applicable to all social welfare dependants who continue in education.  Raising the age to 19 was regarded as a first step on that ladder.</P>
    <P>It is true that type of case referred to by Senator Connor with regard to assessment of income can occour.  We are taking action in that respect which will be helpful in the future particularly to old age pensioners and widows.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan raised the question <Col N="744" /> of the need for greater flexibility in the system rendering it easier for people to get back to work.  I am most anxious to encourage that trend.  In fact, I shall be examining any measures we can take to ensure that people get back to work wherever possible.  A number of Senators raised that point, as did Senator Harte who made some very pertinent remarks in that respect.  Senator Harte wanted us to raise more money.  By bringing the self-employed into the system we will raise additional amounts of money which are already proving beneficial.  In the first year it was anticipated that the return would be £15 million from the self-employed. Some argued that the return might not be so great whereas, in fact, it amounted to £22 million.  The present estimate is of a figure of £39 million for 1989 which may well prove to be slightly conservative.  These are matters which must be worked out between officials of my Department and the Department of Finance at the beginning of the year.</P>
    <P>It is projected that by 1990 we will receive £50 million.  Obviously it will be more than £50 million because the rate and the level of contributions generally are higher than anticipated and consequently there is a good deal of money coming in.  There is a sharing of the burden across the board.  I would just point out to Senator Harte that it is more equitable.</P>
    <P>I recognise that social employment schemes are very valuable and are very much sought after, but they are not a long term solution.  Any means that we can use to assist people in getting back to work which are practical and workable we would certainly be happy to use.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions.</P>

      <P>All increases are paid in the one week, but what looks so different is that the unemployment payments are not paid until the end of that week so that brings them into the next week.  Basically, they are paid in the one week but in some cases the dates are brought forward and in others they are put back.  It is the dates on which the money falls due that makes them look so much further apart. In other words, the increase in unemployment assistance falls due on 19 July but will not be paid until the next week so they are actually all paid in the same week.  There is a huge volume of payments involved and it is spread throughout the week but they actually all relate to the one week.</P>

      <P>I welcome again, as I have said on Second Stage, the allowance to deserted husbands.  However, is the Minister happy that he has gone far enough is providing for a deserted husband in comparison with a deserted wife? You made the point when replying to the Second Stage that you recognise that there are deserted men who are in a diabolical situation trying to look after their children.  At the same time when we compare the amount of recognition and facilities that deserted wives are getting are you happy that we are going far enough to help deserted husbands?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>First, this is simply a social assistance scheme.  We do not have a social welfare benefit scheme for deserted husbands or widowers at this stage.  That is a matter to be considered further in future.  This, of course, is a major step forward as the Senator will recognise, in that it introduces a new scheme in the social assistance area which, of course, is the area where the greatest need arises.  The question of further equal treatment measures is being considered by the European Communities. There is a directive under consideration which would take in the order areas.  Meanwhile, I recognise that there are special problems at the assistance level and we are tackling those here in this measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister is now prepared to say that this is recognised that deserted husbands do not get the same facilities as are available to deserted wives.  Why is that in the Social Welfare Act ther is a recognition of a deserted wife and yet we now have only made an allocation to the deserted husband? We had much debate here two years ago regarding equal opportunity <Col N="748" /> equal rights and benefits.  There was a hullabaloo about equal benefits for people who are entitled to them.  I am not saying that they should not have got these benefits &mdash; indeed I am one of the people who would sat they should have rightly got them &mdash; too many comparisons were made and equal treatment worked to the benefit of some people only.  A spouse who was on disability benefit got an extra increase for every child he or she had not but the same did not apply to someone who was not on disability benefit.  Why has taken us so long to recognise the equality between men and women who are deserted by their spouses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The equal treatment Directive did not cover this area and it was not included because it was not part of the Directive.  As of yet there is no EC co-ordination in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Equal treatment was involved in what was done technically but it only covered certain areas, and this area was not included.  This is being considered at present by the European Community in a new directive which possibly may be introduced in a couple of years.  It was not included in the original Directive and this is one of the reasons nothing has happened up to this stage from an equal treatment point of view.  I accept, of course, that it was always up to the Government to take action along these lines but nedless to say this costs money. I am very happy that it has been done now, it is a new scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is admitting that the EC have not yet recognised equality for men in this area.  I was under the impression &mdash; and indeed I think this was clarified for us several times here &mdash; that under the Equality Act which was brought before us as a result of an EC ruling each person was recognised equally. Now we are saying that a deserted <Col N="749" /> man with a family is not yet recognised under EC regulations.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister has now introduced a widower's and deserted husband's allowance.  I think the Minister said that 5,500 men have been deserted by their wives but a deserted husband does not get the same benefits as a woman who lives next door or three doors up from him who has been deserted by her husband.  This is a fact of life and I believe that men who find themselves in this position are worse off than women who are deserted by their husbands.  The vast majority of men need assistance when they are dealing with children and I do not think they can deal with them as capably as women can.  This is the same as asking a woman to do a man's work &mdash; she will not do it as well as a man. Women do not have work as hard as men and they get paid the same amount for doing less work, yet a man who has to care for four or five children will not be given the same treatment as a deserted wife.  The Minister has done a lot in this area and I appreciate that very much.  He has shown very serious concern and has a great deal of knowledge of this area. However, we should not have to wait for EC regulations to come to our door again before doing something in this area.  This is a fact life and we must recognise it.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to the position of a man whose wife dies intestate. With regard to the distribution of <Col N="750" /> means for the level of entitlement of widower's pension, how does the Minister propose to deal with the distribution of an estate?  There is a notional distribution of an estate if the situation is the reverse.  For example, if the husband in a family dies intestate, and assuming that he has land, one-third of his estate is deemed to be attributed to his children and two-third is deemed to be attributed to his widow.  On this basis an income is then assessed as arising from the property or farm and two-thirds of that income is attributed to the wife and one-third to the children.  Will those children be regarded as qualified for the purposes of the receipt of an increase in pension for the family?  My question relates to the reverse of that where a wife who dies intestate and who, because of family protection, etc., has rights to property.

      <P>Incidentally this relates in interesting point which people have not yet fully realised.  We are talking here about a widower's and deserted husband's scheme and a widower or deserted husband could work to some extent and still receive income.  There is an allowance in the case of widows, which will now apply to the widower, of £6 per week for the person concerned and £6 for each child, together with a child minding allowance of £30 to £35 per week.</P>

      <P>He will under this scheme. He will also be able to claim travelling expenses.  Therefore, a widower with four children could earn £3,640 per year, allowing, say, £10 travelling expenses, and still get the full pension.  He can earn more than that and get part of the pension.  It is an assistance pension. People have not fully realised this factor. It does not just relate to cases where there is a nil income; there is an allowance for certain other income as well, which is more generous in the case of widows than in other cases, and this will now apply to a man in this position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister recognises that widows and deserted wives were treated better than deserted husbands and widowers.  Widows and deserted wives were entitled to certain benefits and to work.  They received tax-free allowances after they earned a certain amount and if they worked so many hours they could still receive the full pension. It is only right that this is the case because they have to look after their children without the fiscal help of their spouses and the same should apply in the case of widowers or deserted husbands. However, men did not get this assistance. I know a man who has seven children and he has not got any assistance up to now. Even if he wanted someone to come into his house for two hours in the mornings to look after his children or do housework, there was no allowance for this.  However a widow could do a certain amount of work and still receive the full amount of the allowance.  I am glad the Minister has at last recognised this anomaly and we should not wait any longer for EC regulations on equality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that the employer's contribution is being increased to £18,000.  This is an area where PRSI payments for the people who are earning less could be reduced and PRSI payments increased for those earning in excess of £16,700.  The Minister referred to that in his Second Stage speech.  In that connection, can the Minister see where a person should be paying PRSI on an income of over £16,700 and, if so, what extra revenue would it bring in?  If a person earns £16,700 up to the end of September, from then on he would not pay any more and he would not receive hospital services unless he was a member of the VHI.  If he were to continue to pay for the remainder of the year what would it mean to the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I should say is that if we were to exempt, say, the first £1,000 the cost in respect of the employee &mdash; if we exempt the employee only &mdash; would be £43 million; if we exempt the <Col N="753" /> employer from the first £1,000 it would be £88 million; if both were exempted it would amount to £131 million.  If we went on to exempt the first £3,000 the total would be £350 million.  The difficulty here is that everybody is involved and, therefore, the numbers are big even though it is a small amount.  It is important to recognise that what we are doing this time is making a difference between the ceilings going up to £18,000.  It opens up the whole question of how we can take the money in future and what we can do to meet these kinds of requirements. There is also the question of part-time people who have to be considered in that context.  When you come to consider the whole matter globally, it is more important to provide some benefits and security for part-time people.  If that continued into the distant future they would be left in very bad circumstances.  We might need to be flexible in that direction.  If we were to abolish the ceiling entirely &mdash; and let it run indefinitely &mdash; the total saving would be £86 million.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the contributions are to be continued to the end of the year you could bring in &mdash; even though there are not thousands of people on £18,000 or on £16,700 but there are enough &mdash; another £86 million.  For a person earning £5,000 &mdash; which is £20 per week &mdash; there is no contribution for the first £1,000 which is paid to everybody.  I would say that anybody who is earning under £7,000 per year should pay no PRSI on the first £2,000.  The less well off and the person who is earning £140 per week should pay no PRSI because he cannot afford to pay it and the employer should not be asked to pay it for him either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying that the person who is earning £16,700 a year should not pay more; of course he should.  That is what is happening in Britain.  The facts are that the person who is earning more is on a <Col N="754" /> rate of tax of 25 per cent.  The person earning £30,000 pays only at the rate of 40 per cent and the person who is earning £5,000 still has to pay tax at the rate of 25 per cent.  The Department of Social Welfare are able to change things in a short period because of computerisation. I am not denying that and thanks to computerisation that can be done.  There is no reason we cannot now say that a person who is earning less than £7,000 should not pay PRSI on the first £2,000. It is a help to him to go to work rather than go to the employment exchange where he will receive £10 less.  That is the point I am trying to make.</P>
    <P>I am trying to keep people at work. The person who is working does not necessarily say he is worth a lot more than the person who is not working.  The facts are that he and his family feel better. he looks better and is cleaner because he is working.  It does not matter what he is doing, whether he is going from one place to another; at least he is doing something and the children know he is at work.  It is good for him, it is good for us and it is good for society.  We have 240,000 people who are unemployed, 50,000 people per year are leaving and we are not prepared to give an incentive to the person who is not earning much.  I am not worried about the person who is earning £15,000 and upwards.  Let him suffer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that is one way of limiting the cost but obviously the specific figures would have to be worked out for any of those variations.  The Government did something like that this year on the tax system instead.  That is what the child-related tax exemption is all about.  The child-related tax exemption does almost exactly that.  For a person who is on £6,000 he will pay no tax up to that level, together with an extra £200 for each child which, with five children, <Col N="755" /> would bring it up to £7,000.  Therefore, at £7,000 the person at work will gain £13 per week which includes the extra child benefit of £1.65 per week.</P>
      <P>That is the reason the Government decided this year to go into that system because it was a means whereby one could ease the position of people who were at work.  That operates also in a marginal way up to about £9,500.  The people at work will receive £13 per week &mdash; if it is a five child family &mdash; if they are earning £7,000.  The amount will be reduced to £4 if the person is earning £9,000 or £9,500.  There is a sliding scale upwards.  One of the advantages of the tax system is that we can operate that kind of scheme.  With that in mind the Government decided &mdash; and bearing in mind what Senator Cregan has said repeatedly in the Seanad whenever we come to discuss these matters &mdash; to deal with the people at work.  The other matter concerning people at work is the family income supplement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much aware that as a result of the budget a person on £6,000 per annum would not pay tax. In order to create an incentive for an employer to take on another employee, would it not be better to charge a smaller PRSI contribution?  The Minister says that a person would be better off working even though, if he were on social welfare, he would be receiving £10 more.  From July, a man with two children will be doing all right on social welfare but not as well as his mother and father who are over eighty.  I would like that man to go to work.  By reducing the employer's PRSI contribution will the Minister enable the employer to pay a man as <Col N="756" /> much as he would otherwise get on social welfare?  Such an employee on low earnings is not even in the tax bracket.  People want to work; the social employment scheme has proved that.  Even with less money than they had two years ago, people are still saying they want to work under these schemes.  Even though people on social employment schemes are only getting £55 instead of £60 a week, they still want to work.  The Minister can imagine the number of jobs that could be created in the private sector by implementing a reduction in PRSI payments for the employer.</P>

      <P>We are going back to a higher ceiling generally.  We have made substantial savings which have enabled us to make major improvements under this Bill without having to look for more money.  We have a very substantial carry over from last year, approximately £55 million.  Our savings have enabled us to meet our costs as well as the extra costs of the increases given this year in this Bill.  It is true that the increase in the ceiling as a percentage is the lowest for the last eight years but the same increase is applying to employees and the self-employed. We wanted equitable treatment and equitable participation and we have that now.  We want the self-employed to proceed in line with employees generally.</P>
      <P>In 1983, the ceiling increased to £3,500, in 1984 there was no increase, in 1985 it was £800, in 1986 it was £900, in 1987 it was £800, in 1988 it was £700 and in 1989 it will be £500.

      <P>In reply to what Senator O'Shea said about pay-related benefit, I presume that he is aware that the Commission on Social Welfare recommended doing away with it altogether and including it in the basic level of unemployment benefit.  This is being done routinely over the years.  The base has been raised but the ceiling has remained the same since 1983.  This is the smallest increase in the <Col N="759" /> floor since that time.  The increase in 1983 was £4, in 1984 it was £7, in 1985 it was £6, in 1986 it was £9, in 1987 it was £4, in 1988 it was £4 and in 1989 it was £3.</P>
      <P>The Senator will recognise that it is the smallest increase of recent years.  Before that time, the increases were even bigger. This is the smallest increase as far back as 1981.  The effect of it is to reduce the maximum rate of pay-related benefit from £18.50 to £18.10 per week but I would submit that is minimal, and has less effect than has been the case for a good many years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The raising of the floor is one aspect, but the Minister has also reduced the amount that can be paid by the calculation method to 12 per cent of the accessible amount.  It has not just been the floor that has been the problem during his term.  Whereas the Commission on Social Welfare may have recommended this, the increases in the basic benefit have not been enough to justify what is happening with pay-related benefit.  I will be opposing this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>To keep it in perspective, the rate was 40 per cent at one stage and the Senator's colleagues, in Coalition, in 1983 reduced it from that to 25 per cent. It is true that in 1987 it was further reduced.  In fact, it was being reduced in the budget in any event when we came into office but it stayed reduced to 12 per cent.  Since that time we have maintained it at 12 per cent and I have resisted any reduction beyond that.  My argument in that case was on the grounds that that £18 to £19, on top of the basic amount gives the sort of level that the commission would have regarded as adequate and I did not agree with going below that level.</P>
      <P>That brings us back to the general question of the commission's recommendation that it should be absorbed into the basic rate.  If, in future, it was absorbed into the basic rate and the basic rate was adequate, that would be a different question altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate some of those points.  I can imagine the pressure that was on the Minister to take more money from social welfare as regards pay-related benefit.  I know that at one time the rate was 40 per cent and it was then reduced to 25 per cent.  There was a recognition that a person was then better off not working but because the rate was reduced to 25 per cent does not necessarily mean that the 40 per cent rate was not a good thing.  In theory, it was used to the benefit of people who probably were not being paid enough for the work they were doing.  The vast majority lost out because a certain number of people were inclined to abuse it and stay out of work.  They knew when to use the system. They knew the times of the year not to work so that their benefit would be at its highest.  It is sad that now a person who is really sick and has to stay out of work is not properly covered.  Even the Minister admits that they are just above the bread line.  For a person to be out of work because of sickness and not get a proper benefit because of other people abusing the system is unfair and the Minister should be making no apologies to anyone in saying that the rate of benefit should be increased.</P>

      <P>There are a number of rates to be eliminated.  I have always said and still say that there should be one benefit for everybody irrespective of their situation.  There is a real concern in particular areas as regards the payment of non-urban rates.  Is there any way in which we can bring about a better system of payment for people?  Is there any way we can have a better system of investigating <Col N="761" /> people, particularly people in rural areas?  It is most unfair to have them queueing up on the side of the street to see certain people before they can get any benefit.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that it should be easy to get benefit but, on the one hand, the Minister is saying that people over 55 years of age should not be seen any more and people over 60 years of age should be allowed to work, even though they would be getting benefit &mdash; I am not saying that that should not happen.  On the other hand, in every little village in the country people are queueing up on a certain day every week and they have many kinds of cars parked near the exchange.  I am not saying that all of them should be getting benefit, either, could we not have a system where at least they could be taken in off the streets, given some privacy and some dignity.  There are 240,000 people unemployed and as the Minister said, there are 190,000 of them on long term benefit.  When is he going to improve the system?  Is there not a better way of doing it?</P>

I would like to return to a certain category of rural rate of unemployment assistance and maybe repeat some of the points I made on Second Stage.  I do not think they can be repeated often enough because there is a degree of injustice being done here to small farmers who used to qualify for the old rural rate of unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the means test to qualify for what is called a qualification certificate, I made the point on Second Stage that the system used by the Department of Social Welfare in their investigation is far from scientific, let alone accurate. Many of the items of expense a small farmer may have in the running of his farm are not allowed for as, say, in an analogous situation under the tax code. They are not allowed for under the social welfare code and I introduce that at this stage because we are dealing with the abolition of the differential between the <Col N="762" /> urban and rural rates which, of course, is enlightened in itself.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister look at the proposal that a completely new, better defined, set of regulations would be given to our social welfare officers in the carrying out of their investigations and that the same criteria would be used by our appeals officers who have to deal with these cases. On Second Stage I mentioned many areas where expenses necessarily incurred in the running of a farm are not allowed for in the determination of means to qualify for a qualification certificate.</P>

      <P>As I said at the end of Second Stage, commenting on the Senator's contribution, we certainly will keep them in mind because what the Senator says is factually true.  There is this kind of assessment.  There is a difficulty, in any event, in assessing a smallholder's means and it is all on factual assessment now rather than notional. That was finalised a couple of years ago. Smallholders will get substantial increases in any event and are being brought up to the same rate.  There was a school of thought which proclaimed that it should not apply but their view did not prevail.  In relation to Senator Cregan's remark, we are now improving our system of payment.  One of the problems is that people are paid by cash and must come to collect it.  A survey showed that most people want to be paid by cash which is a difficulty.  We are rapidly computerising employment exchanges which will give us the option of doing other things.  The question of queueing comes up very often but it should not be a problem as people are asked to come at different times but, unfortunately, sometimes they all come together which causes delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not ask me to work out the whys and wherefores of that.  The Senator kept referring to the age of 55 but we brought in the post-60 pre-retirement scheme.  It was suggested that people <Col N="763" /> over 55 years of age might not have to sign as frequently and that the pre-retirement allowance might come into effect at the age of 55.  However, I did not visualise this and we settled on the age of 60.  A person in receipt of the pre-retirement allowance is not allowed to undertake work up to 18 hours per week.  At the same time, if a person in that bracket was doing a very small amount of work we would only pay attention of a very minor nature to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I did not hear the Minister's reply to Second Stage as I was having my lunch.  I submit that the means of assessment relating to smallholders is not factual.  It is full of anomalies and, consequently, full of injustices.  Will the Minister look at the whole system of determining what expenses are necessarily incurred in running a farm for the purpose of receiving a qualification certificate under small farmers' assistance-unemployment assistance?  The Minister should look at the code which applies for the assessment for tax and he will see a great difference in that and the system assessing income derived from land.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I always have an open mind which often gets me into trouble. However, the Senator should rejoice in the fact that increases have been applied to smallholders as well as to everybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that increases have been granted but the maximum rate will not bring a smallholder above the basic poverty line.  For that reason, I cannot rejoice.  My criticism is not confined to that area, I am also unhappy about attributing value to fixed or moving assets on a farm because their value can be very small.  At least under the tax code, there is an allowance <Col N="764" /> for depreciation but this does not apply under the social welfare code.  The Minister should look at the example of the tax system as a possible road to reform.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has admitted that some facilities give rise to concern. It is worrying that people want to be paid in cash in these dangerous times. Why can they not be paid by cheque? The problem is that a person cashing a cheque is charged from 8p to 13p.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be difficulty in cashing cheques because the banks are not over-enthusiastic about accepting the additional number of customers who would be involved.  However, we are laying the foundation for a more flexible method of payment and in computerised exchanges a chit is issued which is the same as a cheque.  The step from that to a cheque is a fairly small one but it requires agreement in a whole variety of areas. Dublin and Cork have been computerised and we are gradually getting around the rest of the country.  Sligo is next on the list.  We will soon have the whole country computerised which will give great flexibility in the system of payments. In relation to the increases for smallholders and Senator Connor's criticism I should like to say to him that an elderly lady I know always says that it is a poor heart which cannot rejoice.  The Senator should rejoice at the prospect of substantial increases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 14, before section 14, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;14.&mdash;Section 3 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion before subsection (5) of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(5) In the execution of his functions under this Act and the Social Welfare Acts in general, the Minister shall ensure the provision of a minimum degree of privacy in so far as circumstances permit, to persons having to discuss their personal business in any public office in connection with the provisions of the Social Welfare Acts.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have been made aware by a Member of the other House that the Minister is trying to do something in the Cork area but the fact of the matter is that those applying for unemployment assistance or some other social welfare benefit are placed in an embarrassing position in employment exchanges.  There are no facilities available.  Let me say in passing, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, that some of my amendments were ruled out of order on the basis that an extra charge could be imposed on the Exchequer.  Some extra charge to the Revenue must be involved in this case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal for better facilities to be provided.  I am aware that a new centre is being built in Cork.  I would much prefer if we did not have to build employment exchanges but we have to accept that there will always be a big unemployment problem.  This is sad.  It is also sad that we have to buy land in prime areas so as to erect new buildings to cater <Col N="766" /> for the unemployed.  In many employment exchanges at present people can get no privacy at all when dealing with their problems.  It is very easy to be overheard with the result that someone could tell you what your domestic position is.  I do not want to dwell for too long on this point but there should be some degree of privacy.  In many employment exchanges in towns and villages people can get no privacy.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say that I should take a look at what is being done in Cork where a new centre is being built and which will have every facility, such as showers and saunas and so on.  Perhaps they might be better off staying there. Even though I welcome this development I would much prefer if something else was built in its place and I make no apology for saying this.  If it does not need to be built, then do not build it.  With all due respects, many Departments of State own buildings in Cork.  With the making of a transfer order these could be used as local employment exchanges rather than our having to erect new buildings.  If it is necessary for us to erect new buildings, we should make sure that adequate facilities are provided so that those in the less well off category of our society can get some privacy.</P>

      <P>I think the Senator has attempted to forestall anything I might say.  We are building a very fine social welfare services office in Cork.  In any event we need a social welfare services <Col N="767" /> office.  Cork deserves a first class social welfare services office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many unemployed people in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We will always have to make provision for the elderly, the disabled, the handicapped and various other categories.  We hope that there will be fewer unemployed.  It is also possible that those in employment may want to check their entitlements.  We are now building social welfare services offices.  While people in Cork will still refer to these as &ldquo;the exchange&rdquo; I would much prefer if they looked upon them as one-stop shops.  Even though the Senator would prefer I did not refer to Cork, I feel I have to make a reference to the position in Cork.  If the Senator takes a look at the plan which I have in my hands he will see the very fine facilities that are going to be provided.  Three rooms, very nicely sectioned off, are going to be set aside as fresh claims interview rooms.  Separate from these, other interview rooms will be provided.  I give this as an example of what is being done everywhere else. Where an office is being refurbished we are providing facilities which would allow for a degree of privacy.  I would regard it as important that we do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present there are 225 offices throughout the country and a lot of work remains to be done.  The Senator spoke about the acquiring of sites and the erecting of new buildings but let me tell him that what took place within the Nutgrove Shopping Centre in Rathfarnham was very interesting.  We obtained facilities within that complex and have established a one-stop shop there providing all of these facilities.  This was opened a couple of months ago.  Another was opened in Galway not so long ago, and in the near future new exchanges will be opened in Ballyfermot and Kilbarrack on the north-side. In the Dublin area we wish to cater for people in outlying areas rather than their having to come in to the centre of the city where overcrowding takes place. I agree entirely that the cost of transport <Col N="768" /> is an important factor.  In Kilbarrack we have managed to obtain facilities in a shopping centre free of charge and these are now being converted.  This is a very interesting development and I would like to take a look to see where facilities are available within shopping areas around the country.  I would also like to see more such developments in the future as we wish to provide all of the services available in the one place along with information on jobs.</P>
    <P>At present we are refurbishing offices in Buncrana, Newbridge, Cavan, Carlow, Clonmel, Tralee, and a number of others were refurbished recently.  I would like to reassure the Deputy that we are trying to provide the facilities which would allow for a degree of privacy.</P>

I am glad that the Minister has been given a plan for the new social welfare services office and that he has brought this plan into the House to point out to me where the cubicles will be provided in the new centre.  Four cubicles and one private room&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In order to get to the private rooms one would have to pass through an open space about 20 yards wide.  The Minister is right in saying that in the Dublin area people do not have to come into the centre of the city, but with all due respect, I do not understand why the Minister has to bring a plan into the House.  Four open cubicles will be provided. In order to get to the fourth cubicle one must pass the other three and in doing so one will not close ones eyes.  It is an open plan, it is not nice and we can do better.  There are many people earning <Col N="769" /> a great deal of money, more than £16,000 a year, to draw up proper designs and the Minister can rest assured that for less than £16,000 he would draw up a better design than that one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, with your permission, I would like to refer to what I proposed.  During my remarks on Second Stage on this proposal &mdash; the Minister was going to lunch then &mdash; I appealed to his compassion to extend the free travel scheme operated by his Department to that category of disabled people who, because they have a very small income of their own, do not qualify for disabled person's maintenance allowance.  The Minister will inform me that the DPMA maximum adult rate is at present approximately £47 per week.  A person in receipt of this allowance only is on the poverty line as we know it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a group of unfortunate people who have lost a leg, an arm or arms or were born without a leg or an arm and through their own initiative they are gainfully employed on a part-time basis.  This gives them an income above the basic rate of DPMA but these unfortunate people do not qualify for the free travel operated by the Department.  I said on Second Stage that all persons over 66 years of age, irrespective of income, qualify for free travel; even if they are millionaires they have the right to free travel.  There is nothing wrong with that but before the Bill passes the Minister should introduce an amendment to <Col N="770" /> extend the free travel to the category I have mentioned.  I am informed by the union of voluntary organisations for the disabled that we are talking about no more than 200 to 300 people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point.  Following the passage of this Bill the figure will be £47.20 for the single rate and £74.10 with an adult dependant.  I appreciate the difficulty which arises for people who are marginally above the limits but the difficulty really is the cost of these schemes.  In fact, I did very well to maintain these schemes in the last few years when times were particularly difficult. However, I will bear in mind what the Senator has said about that scheme.</P>

      <P>In regard to children boarded out, what is the position?  In some areas people seem to want to cover up this matter and in other areas it seems to be an accepted thing.  Will the Minister explain it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a scheme operated by the health boards.  There are about 1,800 children in foster care throughout the country, more than half of whom are in the Eastern Health Board area.  A percentage of those children would be with families on social welfare.  In this section we are ensuring that the payment in respect of a foster child will not be an impediment and will not be taken into the means calculations.  This will remove a potential disincentive to foster parents. I understand there is a desire to increase the number of foster parents and this will help in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a worry in some areas that people are not prepared to foster because of financial considerations. It would not pay them to do it.  It would be sad if people in the less <Col N="771" /> well off categories were at a disadvantage in this regard.  If we can do better for people, children in particular, in regard to fosterage we must do so.  I make no apology for saying there should be a tax allowance or tax benefit for a person who is prepared to foster.  Such persons must be paid properly and get proper recognition. Otherwise the cost to the State would be enormous.  Such children are of great concern to social workers.  Nice families, people who are caring, are not lacking in our society and we must make no apologies for the cost involved in improving the position of children who need such care.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister happy about the ongoing concern of the Garda about their proper entitlements in regard to compensation claims and assessing compensation?  Do other areas in the State structure get the same facilities? For instance, do the armed forces get the same facilities as the Garda?  What about the Navy and other areas, do they get the same facilities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the Garda are concerned we welcome this provision. We have had discussions with the Department of Justice and they are very anxious to have this covered.  It is an extension. They will have the same kind of cover in the occupational injuries scheme as civil servants generally and a shortfall or gap that has been in their cover will be overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Army and other parts of the public service as a whole, we are considering that question.  The Pensions Board are examining it for me at present <Col N="772" /> and we hope to have a report from them later in the year.  On the basis of that we will be looking at the question to try to get as far as possible, a unified system, across the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying the Garda should not get this facility because they are doing an excellent job.  In our prisons gardaí and prison officers are dealing with such matters as the AIDS threat.  We just cannot flip over this very serious problem, but are we now opening the doors? If a new system is being introduced, will all people in the State structure be in the one system?  If so, there will be ongoing arguments in other bodies.</P>
      <P>For instance, the Army deliver money to the banks.  At the moment they are keeping silent because of the arguments about their 15 per cent claim, but they claim that they do a great deal of dirty and dangerous work and they do not have the same facilities as the Garda.  The Garda are recognised as doing a dangerous job but the Army, the prison officers, the Navy and other such people, also do work of a quality that should be recognised. I welcome the Minister's statement that one scheme will cover all people within the State structure, but I am not saying that people in the structure, including civil servants, should not pay for it.</P>

      <P>In the public service generally roughly 160,000 are in this scheme and 140,000 are not, so there is a division. This is a complex area.  They are covered for all sorts of different things, varying from one area to another.  That is why I have asked the pensions board to look at the actuarial side of the problem, which is very important for the future.  My objective is to have the one basic cover for widow's and old age pension for everybody and then to allow the employer to top up as he wishes.  There will have to be negotiations with the public sector unions as to how this will be implemented and that process is about to begin.  Many anomalies arise because people go in and out of the public service and they find gaps in their insurance <Col N="773" /> cover.  Some very sad cases arise when these people come to pension age.  We want to see an end to that and to provide basic cover for everybody, letting the private and the public sector top up on that basic cover.  That is the objective I have in mind.  It is now provided for the self-employed and employees generally and we are examining urgently the question of the public sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>At long last there is to be notification by the employer of the commencement of employment.  I know the Department have done a lot of work regarding the problem of people working in the black economy.  Three years ago we had long arguments here on that topic. Unfortunately the problem is still as bad as ever and a lot of people are drawing benefits while working in the black economy.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke earlier about paying out on a computerised basis. Should we not provide that every person at work should have a job card?  Other countries have such a scheme.  I do not mean that every person should be identified by a number or by a photograph, but there is much concern about people who are working while at the same time claiming money from the State. Employers are worried about the possibility of employees illegally claiming social welfare benefits.  Computerised systems are being introduced in all local exchanges and it would be possible to provide that every person at work would have a job card held by his employer.  It would be illegal to work without a job card being available on the premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was proved without doubt that people who tendered for local authority work in my area were employing people working in the black economy.  All the local authority looked for was a tender form giving the price of the tender. <Col N="774" /> Nothing further was looked for, even though the State was providing the money.  There is no question that contractors involved in several jobs in the city and county of Cork had employees who were not paying PRSI.</P>
    <P>We should institute a system whereby a person coming off the live register would take a job card to give to his employer. The card could be produced in the event of an investigation and money would not be paid out from the local exchange.  I am probably simplifying the matter but computerisation is marvellous, although we have certainly 100,000 more people unemployed due to the introduction of high technology.  The State is spending at least £7 million per day on social welfare benefits.  Should we not consider using technology to the State's advantage?  The system I am proposing is working in northern Europe.  I am not claiming that every person in the State should have an identity card &mdash; quite the opposite. However, I am certainly saying that every person at work should have a job card available at his place of work.</P>

      <P>We are taking measures in this section to tighten the position and ensure by a variety of means that records are available to check on people fairly readily.  Regarding sub-contractors, we have begun a system of notification covering the cleaning, forestry, building construction and security industries, who are required to notify the Department when they take on new employees.  This system commenced on 1 January and 528 new employees were notified to my Department for that month.  The figure for February was 1,145, making a total of 1,673 new employees notified to us in these industries.  As a direct result of these notifications 60 individuals are under investigation because there is some reason to believe they are drawing some other benefit at the same time.  That system is actually bringing its own controls with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cregan raised the wider question of having what he calls a job card. We are fairly advanced in our discussion with the Revenue Commissioners in <Col N="775" /> relation to the issuing of RSI numbers.  I hope it will not be too long before we can issue these from the Department, which will give us more direct control over the system.  The Revenue Commissioners regard it as the proper course.  It will facilitate the kind of development the Senator has in mind.  I assure him we are anxious to ensure by the simplest method possible that the system is self-correcting.</P>

      <P>I am seeking clarification from the Minister.  He is empowered by regulation to specify the circumstances in which contributions payable by a self-employed contributor may be treated as paid.  I came across a case recently of somebody who had been self-employed until his 58th birthday.  His business was no longer viable and he took a community-type job which was not very well paid.  He has been paying a Class A contribution since just after his 58th birthday. He would have had to enter the insurance scheme before his 56th or 57th birthday to qualify for an old age contributory pension.  I should like to ask the Minister to cater for such a case under the regulations referred to.  What I am asking is if credit for contributions will be given retrospectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Not under this section, although I appreciate the difficulty expressed by the Senator.  The matter will fall to be reviewed at the end of the three-year period when we will know the strength of the fund and the income.  I am anxious to deal with those between 56 and 60 years of age but the cost would be enormous.  In effect, a person should be entering the scheme at about 20 years of age and contributing from then until he or she reaches 60 years of age.  Those <Col N="776" /> who enter the scheme at 50 years of age get a very good deal actuarially.  It is very expensive to bring people in above that age and that is why I am caught and cannot go any further.  I should like to tell the Senator that if the scheme is going well at the end of the three years we will review the matter.  The section refers specifically to a technical difficulty that may arise.  It relates to a person who may have paid in his or her money but who has not been cleared by Revenue because the tax for the previous two years was not dealt with.  We want to be able to regard such people as having paid.  It is a technical provision which is needed.</P>

      <P>When we were dealing last year with the question of contributions by the self-employed, the Minister told us he would be receiving a specific amount.  He told us that for 1989 he will be taking in £39 million and for the next year he expects to take in £50 million.  I should like to know if he will make allowances for those between 56 and 60 years of age who are in difficulties. I suggest to him that they should be allowed pay half the amount of the contributions and be given the full benefit. We are prepared to give benefits to other sections of society and we should cater for those who have very little.  Will the Minister consider that suggestion between now and the next budget?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>It will be considered but I cannot give any undertaking in regard to it.  We are talking about £260 million.  I am an optimist and I can tell the Senator that all the indications are that the scheme is going better than anticipated. In the light of that the Senator's suggestion can be considered at a later date.  I should like to tell the Senator that a widow, and the family, will be covered if the old age pensioner was not on a contributory pension.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to have a look at cases where the net amount of income is taken into account when deciding on the eligibility of a person for a non-contributory widow's pension.  Eligibility seems to be assessed on the gross amount a person may have in the bank.  A person with £1,000 on deposit in a bank may earn £100 interest on that amount but 35 per cent of that interest is paid in tax.  It is wrong that they are not assessed on the net amount of income.  After all, most people consider such savings to be &ldquo;burial money&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure for a couple is £6,000 and that would cover burial.  I should like to tell the Deputy that the assessment is based on the gross income. Any change would cost a lot of money but this will be considered at a later stage. Finances for such changes are made available in the budget and at that time the Minister must opt for certain priorities. The Senator's suggestion will be kept in mind when we are looking at the assessment of means under all schemes.  He will be aware that there is a wide variation in the schemes and that widows are treated among the best.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to bear in <Col N="778" /> mind that some people get more recognition than others.  It is time we introduced equality.  A person who uses the system will get a lot of money but others who are not prepared to trouble the State do not receive much money in benefit. One regulation should cover all benefits. We are all aware that some holders of medical cards should not have them and some of those who have been refused medical cards are entitled to them.  It is wrong that we should assess the people on the gross income.  I accept that the Minister is concerned about that.</P>

      <P>In page 21, before Schedule A, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;.&mdash;An appeals officer shall provide a written report together with his decision setting out his reasons for refusing any benefit.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I referred this morning to some disturbing reports that come my way from time to time in regard to how people are treated by medical referees.  I am not suggesting that this is universal but there are incidents that I would be concerned about. If somebody appeals after two visits to medical referees and then gets a notice saying they are capable of work with no explanation, often these cases are borderline, and I believe a report should be provided by the appeals officer explaining why they have been found capable of work.  On humanitarian grounds alone this is something that should be done and it has not been done up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to agree with <Col N="780" /> Senator O'Shea.  There is a worry that people are not getting any information back from appeals officers.  I know a case where a person is not capable of work and yet on appeal for the second time he has been found capable of work.  I would like to have been at the oral hearing to hear about this claimant's situation.  The claimant's own doctor admitted that he was not capable of work.  Is the appeals officer qualified to say if a person is capable of work?  Is he a doctor or a consultant? There is one person who came to me about his second appeal.  He is not fit for work, and there is no way I would say he was not fit for work if he was.  This man had to have two harnesses removed to have his condition checked.  There is also the question of the definition of work.  This person might be able to push a pen or get on a bus, but he certainly could not drive the bus.  There is the question of what kind of work a person is available for.  If it is a question of work, this person could not work.  This person did not say he did not want to work; he would love to work but cannot.  He was still cut off from benefit and now we are looking for an oral hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangement for disability benefit hearings is that we provide two medical officers.  If one medical officer decides that a person is capable of work then there is the opportunity to appeal to a second qualified medical officer.  If the second medical officer also decides that the person is capable of work, there is still an appeal to an administrative appeals officer who will take the information provided to him by the medical officers and use his own judgement and administrative experience in deciding whether a person is or is not capable of work.  That system works very efficiently when one considers the numbers involved.  We all, as practitioners, come across cases that we are not happy with, but it is very hard to get away from the system entirely.  Broadly speaking when one looks at the numbers and the way the system operates, it is basically fair.  It has been taken as far as the High Court <Col N="781" /> to decide if it was an independent system, and it was decided that it was independent. Notwithstanding that, the whole question that Senator O'Shea is talking about here, the question of ensuring that people are properly informed, is still one that could be improved.  That is part of the consideration that is going on at the moment.  Under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> the Government gave an undertaking to examine what changes if any were required in the social welfare appeals system with particular regard to ensuring that the system is seen to be fair.</P>
      <P>The question of providing reports is one which would involve considerable additional administrative expenditure if it were to apply in all cases.  The main question that needs to be addressed is how to provide what people require without getting oneself into a great bureaucracy of needless paper passing.  I note the point made by the Senator that further information would be helpful.  I will certainly have that considered in the review that is going on at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one further point regarding equality legislation.  We tried to put down an amendment here which was disallowed asking that when somebody was being assessed for unemployment assistance only that person's means would be taken into account.  I am totally in favour of equality, but where a wife is in receipt of disability benefit and the husband in receipt of unemployment assistance the latter payment is reduced. It is part of the Irish ethos that the husband is the breadwinner, and the reduced payment to the husband can have a bad psychological effect.  I would ask the Minister to respond to me as to whether any review is going on in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The equality legislation brought about equal treatment as between men and women.  I take it the Senator is referring to the limit on unemployment assistance where the wife is on disability benefit.  That is basically a <Col N="782" /> question of the level at which the means test applies and what is taken into consideration. Disability benefit is really a payment for people at work, who are out for just a few weeks, and this is often forgotten.  I know in this country it often goes on for a few years and people begin to regard it almost as a pension.  In most other countries it is not a long term payment. After a time there is an assessment and one either gets nothing or goes on to invalidity benefit.  Here one can go on to invalidity pension after a year.  If one does not choose to do that one can go on taking disability benefit if one is mildly unwell or maybe has a problem with one's back.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
