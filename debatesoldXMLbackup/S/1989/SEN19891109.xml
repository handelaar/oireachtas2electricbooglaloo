      <P>I have notice from Senator David Norris that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to fulfil her commitment to the development of a new school in Waterford Street, Dublin 1.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Norris as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Leader of the House for the very orderly way in which business has been organised for the first three meetings of the Seanad this session.  I do not want to draw any contrast to former occasions, but from the Independent point of view on the benches over here, I would like to say that the fact that we are having Thursday sittings, that we are debating a report and that we had a late night sitting last night, are matters which I hope will <Col N="218" /> continue and that the Seanad will sit more often.</P>
      <P>I have two pleas to make to the Leader of the House.  The first is that the Bills that are coming through at the moment are going to the Dáil first which is a pity. During the last session we had, as Senator Honan mentioned yesterday, the Companies Bill and several other Bills which came here first.  They were amended substantially and this House treated them with an enormous amount of care.  I would ask the Leader to make representations to the Government that all Bills do not go first to the Dáil because, when that happens, it means that they come here and are pushed through with a certain amount of undue haste.  Otherwise, I would like to express my great satisfaction with the conduct of business so far, which may surprise the Leader of the House to a certain extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask two related questions.  They are important and considered questions and I believe they require a considered answer.  I will be prepared to accept a temporary answer today but not in future with regard to Item No. 39 which states:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann expresses concern at the Government's total lack of action in meeting the requirements of last October's judgment in the European Court of Human Rights concerning discrimination against homosexual citizens of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Government are required to introduce legislation.  I want to ask the Leader of the Government party in this House to seek an answer from Government in relation to a date on which the Government intend to cease their contempt of the European Court of Human Rights and to introduce the required legislation. I would like to signal the fact that I have no intention of getting them off the hook by introducing any such legislation at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the question again of the programme of legislation which has been raised by myself and by <Col N="219" /> Senator Manning on two occasions.  On the day of the opening of the other House, the Government Whip was able to announce to the nation at large a programme of 11 to 14 Bills which would be introduced in that House between then and Christmas.  We have asked unsuccessfully for the last week to get some information from the Leader of the House as to the likely programme of legislation for the next couple of months. It would be useful if the Leader of the House were to admit to us today that he has been unable to get any commitment from Government on this issue so then at least we could address it as a House together rather than having this constant niggling on a daily basis.  Do we have any information about the legislation which is planned for this House, or will this be just a continuation of discussion and questions day after day?  I put that question very clearly to the Leader and ask for a report from him.</P>
      <P>On a related issue, the Leader of the House has in the past given commitments time and time again to have a debate on the problems arising in the Middle East. I am saying this in the most neutral of ways at this stage.  I am not talking about taking sides, I am talking about a neutral motion in order to discuss developments in the Middle East.</P>
      <P>On a number of occasions we have raised this question of debates on matters relating to different parts of the world.  I do not intend opening the debate now. Would the Leaders of the House, first of all, give us some indication when he might take that and secondly, could he also indicate to us what the Government's policy is on a matter of committees, joint committee and committees of this House?  Could he indicate if it is possible for this House, of its own initiative, to set up committees on issues on which the Government are not prepared to set up joint committees?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of what Senator O'Toole raised as a matter which would generate all-party concern in the Middle East, I would like to ask the <Col N="220" /> Leader of the House about a debate on another issue &mdash; I do not want to be in the least bit disorderly because I doubt if there is much disagreement on this issue &mdash; that is the frightening spectacle in Cambodia of the most genocidal régime since Hitler's returning to power there and the need for the international community to do everything possible to prevent that happening.  It is an issue which we could appropriately debate on a motion which need not be contentious, though I would have a different view, perhaps, from the Government on it.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Leader to allow us to use this House to have an issue that is increasingly of concern to public opinion debated here.  Related to that and also related to Senator O'Toole's general question, could I ask the Leader if there is any possibility in this session of a joint committee on foreign affairs being set up?  In the meantime, can I tell Members that it is proposed that the <i>ad hoc</i> committee on foreign affairs, which was set up during the last session, will recommence its deliberations today at 3 p.m. in room G. 24?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of items have been raised, in particular the matters raised by Senators Ross, Norris and O'Toole in connection with Government Bills.  Government Bills will be introduced in this House in this session.  One of the problems since the Dáil returned is that they have been involved in business that went from this House to them. This is creating certain problems but there are Government Bills which will be available to us in the very near future. When I say in the very near future I am not talking about long-term near future, I am talking about short-term near future, possibly next week.  Definitely we will have one or two the week after, if not next week.</P>
      <P>With regard to item No. 39 I will express to the Government the concern of Senator Norris and will come back to him with the reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding a debate on the Middle East, this could be dealt with by way of an all-party agreed motion.  If I put down <Col N="221" /> a motion here in connection with the Middle East it might be construed in certain areas that it was being put down for my particular reasons and from my particular viewpoint so it would be better if an all-party agreed motion were to come before the House.  I would see no problem in having such a debate initiated within the near future, as soon as agreement can be got on a wording.</P>
    <P>As far as committees and joint committees are concerned, it is not my function to make decisions in these matters. That is a function of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Those two related matters can be taken up at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges presumably at their next meeting.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator Brendan Ryan's concern about what is happening in Cambodia, I presume that is the matter he could bring forward by way of the first Private Members' motion to come before the House.</P>
    <P>As far as a joint committee on foreign affairs is concerned that again is not a matter for me.  It would be a joint committee of both Houses and I have no part to play in setting up any joint committee. I will talk to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on this matter again and report back to the House or to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  From an operational point of view from now on we will sit on Wednesdays and Thursdays.  It is intended that, broadly speaking, we will take Government business, Bills and so forth, on Wednesday and will leave Thursdays open for reports and various other items.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is normal practice for the Order Paper of the House to carry notices of meetings which take place.  The Leader of the House has indicated that the matter of committees is a question for the House to decide.  Will it be possible in the future, for instance, for the Order Paper to carry notice of the meetings of the <i>ad hoc</i> committee on foreign affairs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Anything that appears on the Order Paper has to be related to formal committees or formal business of <Col N="222" /> the Houses.  I do not think that any <i>ad hoc</i> committee meetings should be inserted.  If they were to be included it would mean that anybody could decide to set up an <i>ad hoc</i> committee on any particular subject, have it on the Order Paper, circulate it to whomever they wished it and get the greatest advantage from it.  I do not think that would be to the advantage of the House.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed regulations have been made on the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Act, 1979. Their purpose is to secure an increased financial contribution from the farming sector towards the cost of the bovine TB and brucellosis eradication schemes.  This increase in the rates of levy is fully supported by the farming organisations.  The rates of reactor grant under the disease <Col N="223" /> eradication schemes were originally revised as and from 1 February 1989 and the adjustments at that time were made on the basis that ERAD could continue to operate within its budgetary allocation.</P>
      <P>However, an analysis carried out some months later showed clearly that the rates then fixed had, for certain categories of animals, fallen seriously out of line with their market value.  It became clear that farmer dissatisfaction with the level of reactor compensation would be a serious impediment to progress on disease eradication. The ERAD board, therefore, recommended a fresh adjustment of the rates of grant and that the increases be borne jointly by the Exchequer and the farming community.  The farm organisations agreed to support an increase in the bovine diseases levies and thereby fund their share of the increased grants. The new rates of levy from 1 December will be 1.2 pence per gallon of milk processed and £6.90 per bovine animal slaughtered or exported live.  The expected yield from the levy this year is £21.4 million.</P>
      <P>The proceeds from the increased levy will be used to finance the increased reactor and depopulation grants as well as the new income supplement introduced as and from 1 February 1989.  The increased reactor grants will be concentrated on the small to medium-size animals where it is generally accepted that the greatest need for increased compensation existed.  The special income supplement will apply in situations where total depopulation of the herd is not justified but where disease breakdown still results in the removal of more than ten per cent of animals from the herd.  Payment of the supplement will be confined to herds of 100 or fewer animals and I think it will be a very effective measure in easing hardship suffered by individual farmers.  Expenditure on grants paid to farmers is expected to come to about £16 million during this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is recognised that the establishment of ERAD has proved to be a <Col N="224" /> successful initiative involving all interested parties to provide a new approach to the disease eradication schemes.  Targets set for ERAD entail the halving of the existing bovine TB levels over four years and a more intensive and sharply focused programme is being put in place.  A full round of testing of the national herd is being carried out in 1989 together with special concentration on the 15,000 herd which pose the greatest disease risk not just to themselves but to all other herds.</P>
    <P>The strategy involves paying particular attention to the geographic location with a concentration of high risk herds.  These are designated as black spot areas.  I believe that the increase in the level of compensation announced by the board of ERAD in May 1989 and backdated to 1 February 1989 means that herd owners will be adequately compensated for losses because of a disease breakdown and that ERAD will be greatly assisted in meeting its objective as a result of the new grant structure.  The package represents concrete evidence of the commitment of the farming community and the Government to the success of the initiative in setting up ERAD.  What is now required is an all out effort on the part of all concerned towards insuring that the targets set for the reduction for bovine TB levels are achieved.</P>

      <P>The lack of progress in the eradication of tuberculosis is one of the great scandals of our time.  It started in 1954 and 12 years later I had the honour of being invited to a function by the Minister for Agriculture who is the present Taoiseach.  The purpose of the function was to celebrate the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  Twenty three years later and a couple of hundred million pounds later we still have tuberculosis. I am interested in the Minister's figures because I was on to his office this <Col N="225" /> morning about the costs in 1987.  The total cost up to 1987 has been £423 million. The figures for 1988 were as follows:&mdash; vets' fees £14.4 million, compensation to farmers £7.6 million and administrative costs £6.5 million making a total of £28.5 million.</P>
      <P>My figure on levies from farmers differs slightly from that given by the Minister. The figure I got from his Department was £22.7 million.  There is not a big difference but I am just making the point.  The actual net cost to the taxpayer is pretty low when you take into account the value of the animals to the Department when they were being disposed of.  Nevertheless, the real problem is that we are putting at risk our good markets for beef and unless we get our act together and eradicate tuberculosis I am afraid we might be excluded from certain markets which we now have.</P>
      <P>If we contrast the failure in tuberculosis with the success of the eradication of brucellosis, it makes very interesting history.  In point of fact we do not have the basic fundamental knowledge on how tuberculosis is spread.  We do have it for brucellosis and it was got very simply by a few scientists in Moorepark who showed quite clearly that the spread of brucellosis only occurred at time of parturition or at time of abortion and that isolating the animal for about 14 days would keep the infection from getting to the rest of the herd.  That basic piece of knowledge helped us to eradicate brucellosis. We do not have that kind of information for tuberculosis and despite the best efforts of many of us to get basic research done on how tuberculosis is spread I am afraid we met a blank wall. The Department of Agriculture and particularly the vets in that section resisted any research being done in the Agricultural Institute into how tuberculosis is spread.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have other problems, in particular the ear tagging problem.  It is so easy to get rid of the ear tag, or to change the ear tag, and I am afraid there are people doing this.  Really if we want to get sophisticated about this job we should insert in each animal a little microchip under <Col N="226" /> the skin which cannot be removed and the animal could be identified at any sale point by simply running it through a cattle grid and having a scanner there to identify the animal.  I am also amazed that in this era of information technology we still deal with the whole tuberculosis situation by mountains of paper and files piled upon files.  That information could be put on computers which would be much more efficient and would give us a better chance of knowing what the history of the animal was and it would prevent the changing of ear tags.  There is little point in recriminating about this sad saga. Everybody shares the blame in some way or other, everybody related to the subject, but the primary responsibility must rest with the Department of Agriculture. The farming organisations certainly did not do enough either to point out the few bad apples among them and certainly if the levies keep going like this the farmers will soon be paying for the entire programme and still running the risk of having a big loss of income if they have reactors in their herd.</P>
    <P>I support the additional levy but in doing so I would hope that there would be some change of procedure in the work of eradicating tuberculosis.  As I said at the beginning it is a national scandal. It has cost the taxpayer an enormous amount of money and it is putting our markets at risk for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with many of the sentiments expressed by Senator Raftery regarding the progress being made in the eradication of bovine TB and brucellosis. This has been going on for a long, long time and we have the same criticisms, the same discussions every so often and we still do not seem to be making the desired progress.  The regulations proposed will impose further hardship on farmers who are already very hard pressed because of the depressed state of the beef trade.  We all know that the profit margin for this year for beef farmers is nil and it is depressing for farmers to see those levies being increased still further.  In fact, there are many farmers losing money at present on cattle purchased last spring.  Farmers <Col N="227" /> expected when the APS scheme was introduced that prices would improve but instead of that they started to drop back by 1p and 2p per pound at the factories. Indeed the same happened when the Minister negotiated a higher quota for intervention and I wonder if the factories have filled that quota.</P>
      <P>At present there is a glut of cattle coming onto the market with farmers queuing outside the mart gates from 3 a.m. and in some cases having to transport their cattle back home again because the marts cannot accommodate the large numbers.  This, of course, is additional hardship and expense on farmers and I am convinced that the factories are not paying the price they should be paying for beef.  Nobody seems to be able to take them on.  They know they will get their own way in the end if they wait long enough because farmers will eventually have to sell their cattle.</P>
      <P>I accept that the levies proposed are necessary to finance the cost of disease eradication.  The biggest items would be the fees paid to veterinary practitioners for testing and reactor and de-population grants for the farmers.  Are we going to continue to increase those levies each time we need additional moneys for the disease eradication programme?  There is a limit on what farmers can bear and certainly we must be very near that limit this year when cattle farmers are accepting less for their cattle than they paid for them last spring.  The disease eradication programme to date has cost in the region of £1,000 million and still we have not got the disease down to an acceptable level.  In fact, the incidence of disease is higher now in certain areas than it was 30 years ago.  When there is a bad breakdown in an area, more research should be done into the cause of that breakdown. There must be a reason for it and it is not enough to eliminate the diseased animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The root cause of the disease must be eliminated whether it be badgers, birds, bad fences or whatever.  A thorough investigation should take place to find out the cause of the outbreak.  It is not enough for departmental officials to come along <Col N="228" /> and tell farmers to disinfect their stables. I would like to see more time and money being spent on research.  If the cause of the disease can be pinpointed then it is money well spent.</P>
    <P>A full round of testing was carried out in 1989 and that was a very good thing because that is the only way that you will come to grips with this problem of disease eradication.  I wonder will this full round be continued in 1990 and in successive years?  Perhaps the Minister when he is replying will be able to give us some information on that.</P>
    <P>At the present time the price being paid for small animals is not sufficient and any farmer who has the misfortune of having a number of such animals turned down in the test is losing a considerable amount of money.  I understand that some of this money we are providing today under those levies will go towards increasing the grants for those animals.  I would certainly like that to happen because I have seen so many cases of farmers losing a considerable amount of money on those animals.  It is hard to compensate farmers who have the misfortune of having their herds closed down because of the incidence of TB or brucellosis. Their whole livelihood is gone and in many cases they have to wait a couple of years before they can get their herds free again.  This creates considerable hardship for them.</P>
    <P>I hope that ERAD, which is the new body looking after this programme, will make great strides in the years ahead in eliminating this disease once and for all. Our beef is the pride of Europe and we should do everything possible to try to preserve it and to preserve its good name. People who are found switching tags or doing whatever else that is being done should be brought to justice because it is very serious to have that type of thing going on at a time when we are trying to promote our beef and our cattle in the European market and when we are up against such great competition from other countries where the incidence of disease is much lower than it is here.</P>
    <P>I hope we will see considerable progress being made in the eradication of <Col N="229" /> bovine TB and brucellosis in the year ahead and I hope it is the last time the Minister will have to come to this House or to the other House looking for an increase in this levy because farmers have to pay considerable levies at present. There are the veterinary levies, the CBF levy, the IFA levy, the disease earadication levy and insurance.  All those things have to be paid for.  They are all deducted from the price the farmer gets for his stock.  I hope it is the last time the Minister will have to come here looking for an increase in those levies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I get down to the motion before us, I would like to say that I am appalled by the casual way the Minister is treating the House.  He arrived 20 or 25 minutes late.  It may not have been his fault; I accept he was possibly held up on the Order of Business &mdash; we have had that explanation &mdash; but there is something appallingly wrong with the procedure when this House can be kept waiting for 20 or 25 minutes and when it suits another Chamber in this House a Minister will arrive.  If we are to be relevant and if we are to answer the criticisms the public are directing at this House, if we are serious about the reform of this House, we should get on with the business according to the Order Paper of the day.  That needs an immediate explanation to this House.</P>
      <P>I also feel it to be of extreme casualness that we do even have copies of the Minister's speech.  Having spent time in the other House I know that was the number one requirement.  When a Minister came into the House he had the courtesy to distribute to the House, particularly when he was issuing figures such as the Minister has issued here this morning, copies of that speech so that people could see exactly the case he was putting forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not being personal in regard to the Minister here but I find both of those incidents to be unacceptable to the general running of this House.  I for <Col N="230" /> one will not tolerate any slipshod practices that will continue to bring this House into disrepute.</P>
      <P>I have had an interest for many years in the whole area of bovine diseases.  I suppose initially my interest was caught from my scientific training, even though politics soon took over from science as my main interest in life outside the most onerous one of running a household and looking after my family.  I have spoken many times on bovine diseases.  I cannot recall how many times but it is at least my fourth if not my fifth time in different fora to address this particular topic.</P>
      <P>I have said before that a price cannot be put on the importance of TB-free status as well as brucellosis-free status. We can almost claim the brucellosis-free status, but a price cannot be put on TB-free status for this country.  We are an agricultural country, we are a net exporting country.  Our cattle, dairy and milk produce generally is of the utmost importance to our GNP and to our exports.  We are about to debate the NESC report and if we look to the place we will be taking in Europe and the importance that Ireland will hold around the Community table where we can shine in Europe, it is in this area where we can claim natural advantage in the area of agriculture and we should be at the top of the list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Raftery mentioned hundreds of millions of pounds; others have talked of £400 million since 1935 as the cost of eradicating TB in this country.  It is a national scandal, it is an appalling scandal. Successive Governments have contributed to this scandal.  The real figure is, in fact, over £1 billion if you translate into today's terms the money that has been spent over the years.  For a long time it was taxpayers' money.  More recently the farmers have been paying more and more of it themselves as well as the processing industries.  It is appalling that £1 billion has been spent and 35 years later we are still effectively hardly any further down the road in eradicating TB.  We need explanations from the Minister for this.  His two page report does little justice to this important topic.  I <Col N="231" /> have just been checking the contributions other Minister gave and they go on for pages.</P>
    <P>We can take a quantum leap forward to a year or so ago when the ERAD board was established.  I would have preferred if the Minister could have dwelt on the progress made by ERAD since they were established.  I held out great hope for ERAD and I still do.  I would like to know in detail from the Minister as to what progress they have made.  What, for example, is the method they are using for recording the level of TB in our herds? Are they using the prevalence of TB, are they using the incidence of TB, are they using the number of animals per 100, the number of animals per 1,000?  There are five or six possible ways of recording the levels of TB.  Certainly last spring there was a lot of work going on in relation to the type of method of recording that ERAD would use so that at least we can know how bad the problem is or whether the problem is improving.  Over the years the Department of Agriculture have used in some years the incidence of TB to tell the country the level of the disease.  Then they switched to the prevalence of TB. To the unitiated, including me, at the time, the two words were almost interchangeable but they are not interchangeable scientifically or when it comes to recording levels of TB.</P>
    <P>One of the first tasks that the new chairman of the ERAD board set himself was to take a dipstick, if you like, of the exact problem, of the exact situation, as of last spring or as of this year, and use that as a baseline and from there on measured the increase or decrease in TB levels from that base level.  I would like to know from the Minister has that been done and what method we are going to use from now on of actually recording the levels of TB so that we ourselves can know and so that the market to which we export our excellent meat products can know whether our situation is improving or disimproving.</P>
    <P>ERAD was launched with a great blaze of publicity.  I must say, as an aside and on a lighter note, I was not a great admirer of <Col N="232" /> those dreadful TV commercials they ran, at this line of faces in the agricultural community issuing fairly inane sentences one after the other.  I think, to be fair to them, they are not too proud of it themselves, in hindsight.  They have come in for quite a lot of criticism.  I believe in publicity, in PR.  We have an enormous job to do in awakening farmers and raising their consciousness to the importance of full co-operation from all sectors in eradicating TB.</P>
    <P>The farmers cannot be the only people to blame in the length of time it has taken to reduce TB levels to an acceptable incidence or prevalence in this country. After all, the farming community cooperated perfectly in the eradication of brucellosis.  The very same farmers understood from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; the importance of eradicating brucellosis.  It is an easier disease to eliminate.  Senator Raftery has referred to it.  The test is specific; the TB test is not.  It is really only a herd test, it is really only a screen test.</P>
    <P>Farmers could not see at first hand the damage it was doing.  If you had a cow aborting you had the loss of the calf and you had the disease.  You understood economically the impact for you, if not for the community, of the disease.  TB is harder for the farmer to understand in pounds, shillings and pence, straight up at face value, as it were.  An animal will survive with TB; it will not thrive.  You will not get the returns or the weight gain; but your animal is there and you are not losing your calf.  The impact is not as obvious as it was with brucellosis.</P>
    <P>The farming community need to be educated and to have their consciousness raised to the importance of everyone co-operating. I believe they are co-operating now.  I believe you should have the carrot there of fair and just reactor compensation, particularly, as the former speaker mentioned, for the weanlings. For a long time the dairy cows and weanlings were just not being compensated for sufficiently to really induce farmers to be 100 per cent co-operative with the eradication programme.</P>
    <P>Tags have been mentioned, too.  There <Col N="233" /> is no doubt that there is tag switching. There has always been tag switching.  But there was tag switching in other countries. There was tag switching in the North of Ireland, where they managed to eradicate TB and are down to an incidence of .004 per cent in the herd.  What is so different about the régime that was operated in the North of Ireland, just 80 miles up the coast, from what we are doing in this country?  What is the difference with the farming practice in the North that they could eradicate TB and we here have not been able to do it 35 years and a billion pounds later?</P>
    <P>There are some differences in farming practices.  They do not shift their animals around from calf to beef stage as much as we do.  I am not sure whether the figure is five or six change of hands, but it is somewhere around that in the Republic, from the time the calf is dropped on the west coast to the time it is slaughtered, perhaps in the factory on the east coast. He is sold as a calf.  He is then sold later on as a yearling, as a light store, as a forward store.  He is perhaps put into a winter fattening unit somewhere else.  He may be finished off and grasped by a further farmer and then finally slaughtered. The enormous movement on each individual bovine in this country is a problem in terms of handling it.  But I cannot imagine that the farming practices in the North are that terribly different from down here.  Our farming practices here are different from continental Europe in many ways and they have managed to eradicate TB or reduce it to an acceptable incidence.</P>
    <P>We must look at this again, as to why we have failed for so long and at such a cost to get this scandal under control when it is of such importance to our economy. I mentioned the tags.  Yes, tags are switched, but they were switched elsewhere too and they managed to overcome that.  I support Senator Raftery that we must seriously consider electronic tagging. It will be coming; it is only a matter of time.  Can we not be ahead of the posse?  Can we not lead Europe in this area where, God knows, we should have the experience and the expertise, as we <Col N="234" /> have handled animals for so many aeons at this stage.  Electronic tagging will come; it is just a matter of when.</P>
    <P>May I ask the Minister what is the present level of investigation and research into this, because I do know if it is being looked at in his Department and by ERAD and I would love him to tell us what the present state of play is in relation to this.  By the way, it is not only in relation to cattle but I believe in relation to horses and dogs that they are also considering electronic tagging &mdash; and very important it would be, too.</P>
    <P>ERAD have decided in their wisdom &mdash; and they have done a lot of good &mdash; some time ago, as part of their tightening up of the practices in this whole area, that any animal that arrives at a factory or a mart with his tag missing would be sent straight back to the herd from whence it came.  I do not know what flash of genius brought this to their mind, because, quite frankly, you can load cattle in a farmyard check, the ear tags against the card &mdash; we used to call it the blue card; they are pink cards now but they are still referred to as blue cards in the farming community &mdash; against the blue card, check each individual beast onto the lorry and trailer with their tag in place and their card correct.  You hand the card to the lorry driver and you can drive ten, 20, 50 miles to the nearest factory, let down the ramp, check the cattle off the ramp and there can be one or two tags missing.  That is a fact.  Apart from deliberate tampering, the quality of the tag we use is causing problems.  I know there is an investigation into this. We try different tags.  We are using tags that are not produced in Ireland, to my knowledge, which is a scandal in itself. There surely is an import substitution product there to be look at.  I know that tags are being produced in Ireland, but apparently the Department do not consider them satisfactory.  If I can be parochial, there are tags being produced in Wexford that the Department of Agriculture and Food do not consider suitable. I think Nigeria and six or eight continental European countries use Wexford produced tags, but they are not good <Col N="235" /> enough for Irish cattle.  A question needs to be answered there, but that is another day's work, if you like.</P>
    <P>The very fact that a tag can be lost from the beast, without any tampering, from the farmyard to the factory, is an accepted fact in handling animals and in the practice of handling animals.  ERAD have decided in their wisdom that that animal cannot be slaughtered.  Technically, they are correct under the legislation, because you cannot slaughter cattle unless you can identify them positively, according to the legislation.  What have they decided to do &mdash; that the farmer must bring that one beast without his tag back to the herd, having perhaps mingled with other animals at the factory, with other infected animals at the factory. He could bring a clean animal back to his clean herd and introduce infection into his herd.</P>
    <P>This came to my notice some six months ago in a rather dramatic way when a pedigree herd owner &mdash; he has one of the top pedigree herds in the country &mdash; had a wagon of animals going to the factory and one of them had lost the tag when it got there.  When the veterinary inspector insisted that that animal minus his tag go back to his pedigree herd, which is of international satus &mdash; he can command what he likes for the animal &mdash; he refused to take the animal back from a potentially infected premises to his own herd.  He was being told by the veterinary officers and inspectors: you must, under the law, bring back that animal regardless of whether it is being infected on these premises or not.  There was an appalling row.  This man approached the chairman of ERAD; he approached all of us who were interested in this topic at the time.  The outcome of it all was that he refused to take it back. He sent it down to an isolated stable he had about three miles down the road and left it there while the row raged.  ERAD looked at this problem and said, &ldquo;Yes, we understand what you are saying.  We understand what you are giving out about, but as the law stands you cannot <Col N="236" /> slaughter an animal unless you can positively identify if.  If it does not have a tag you cannot identify it and you cannot slaughter it.  Take it home with you.  We do not want to know&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>ERAD are charged with eradicating TB and surely any practice that might contribute in any way to the spread of TB should not be part of their brief. Right now, the compromise that has been arranged is that that animal, or such an animal, may go to the local pound until the issue is tested again, identified, or retagged, or gets a permit, or whatever is going to happen to him.  That is just one area that took weeks of hassle to resolve and made little sense to those of us perhaps on the field watching and those of us who care passionately about eradicating TB.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister also add to his brief contribution and expand on what is going on at the moment in the epidemiological unit of ERAD.  This is an area where, again, we were appallingly negligent for 33 of the last 35 years when we were trying to eradicate TB.  It is an area that may be as much an art as it is a science. This is the problem in relation to epidemiology generally.  We have had the controversy over the badger.  It raged long and hard around Offaly and Longford coming up to elections.  Farmers were threatening not to co-operate with the annual round test and the TB test. There were lots of problems, lots of passions, farmers have lost so much money when herds were locked up.  The tightening up of the regime has had at least impacted economically, but it has meant that, where they could not proceed along the lines they felt they should to help themselves to resolve their problem, frustration boiled over.</P>
    <P>Licences are being issued to test badgers as carriers of TB.  The wildlife people are watching very vigilantly what the Department of Agriculture and Food and ERAD do in this area.  I can understand it.  But there is a common sense somewhere down the middle of the line.  A badger infected with TB is little good to himself or to his own comrades.  In fact, <Col N="237" /> they lose weight.  They usually die of starvation or, because they are slow to react and are malingering generally you see them killed along th side of the roads in ever-increasing numbers.  It is in the interests of both wildlife as well as the huge economic interest of eradicating bovine TB that we finally establish whether or not the badger is a carrier of TB and is responsible for what we have been calling spontaneous outbreaks of TB, which apparently have occurred inexplicably around the country for so many years.</P>
    <P>There are other areas in relation to epidemiology.  I would ask the Minister perhaps if he could give us a full brief as to what is going on in this particular unit that is being set up in ERAD, how they are handling applications for the testing of badgers, why some counties can get licences while others cannot and what is the relationship with the wildlife people at the moment &mdash; just generally how we are handling what is the delicate area of this whole issue.</P>
    <P>I referred to spontaneous outbreaks.  I do not know if there can be such a thing as a spontaneous outbreak.  I do not have enough knowledge to comment on it. Where you have a farmer who has bred all his own replacements for years, who never buys in, whose hygiene and disinfection standards are absolutely meticulous, where he has double fencing between himself and his neighbouring farmer so there can be no contact or contagious passing of the disease, and how suddenly, having been clear of TB for 20 years, he can suddenly go down on his annual herd test, that is what we refer to as a spontaneous outbreak.  I have a feeling that these particular outbreaks are where we can learn most from.  If we could really concentrate our resources on these so-called spontaneous outbreaks we could eliminate so many factors as the possible cause in these situations that surely we could get a lead and surely there is a lot more to be told from that story.  Perhaps the epidemiological unit is looking on these and perhaps the Minister could have something more to say to us on it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="238" /> We have had over the years report heaped upon report in relation to the eradication of bovine diseases, particularly bovine TB.  We have had the Committee of Public Expenditure and ESRI and the various veterinary bodies.  We have had the farm organisations.  We all have copies of these reports.  My own party produced an excellent report in March 1988 in relation to the eradication of bovine TB and many others have done so also.</P>
    <P>Looking at the overall picture, one wonders where do we go from here.  I would ask the Minister to give us a detailed account of the present operations and the present programmes under way in ERAD.  Could he indicate to us where the TB eradication programme now differs from what was in place before ERAD was formed?  If we could have a comprehensive report from the Minister it would make all our jobs of selling the increased levy, the increased pence per gallon and the increased pounds per animal slaughtered now being charged to the farmer a much easier job to sell.  We will get far greater co-operation from all aspects of the farming community, from the milk and cattle men, if they understand exactly that progress is being made and that at last we are on the road to reducing our incidence, our prevalence, or whatever the Minister will tell me is the method of recording the disease now, to acceptable levels.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to indicate whether there has been an increase in black spots, what the reason for this might be or what he is being advised is the reason for this.  Counties Longford and Cork and various other areas have a tradition of being known to be black spots.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister why calves from infected herds, from locked-up herds, can still be sold freely through the marts or directly into clean herds that are not locked up.  Surely a 12-year-old could understand that a major source of reinfection and primary infection is the free travel of calves from infected herds to clean herds.  I agree there is a logistical problem on how you will handle that, but <Col N="239" /> what is ERAD doing about it?  Be it general hygiene on the farm, fencing, proper testing, proper animal management generally, the passage of calves throughout the country freely from infected herds must be the major source of infection left untouched by ERAD or by the Department of Agriculture.  What is the Minister going to do about it?  No matter what money you take in levies off farmers, no matter what money you spend on testing and establishing clean herds, the farmer legally is free to go to the mart and buy any number of calves, bring them home and they could be from any infected herd in the country.  That is madness.  What can we do?  How did other countries handle that?  How did countries who have virtually eradicated TB handle that?  Can we not piggy-back on the experiences of other countries? Can we not learn from their success in this area?</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could indicate for the record also when the latest round of increases in reactor grants will date from. I have at the back of my mind February or March or some time in 1989.  Again, to get full co-operation, particularly in depopulation, or where the figures do not warrant depopulation in the supplementary income payments, it is important to know when they are going to date from, because there has been a vigorous action on the ground by ERAD; and in many cases, particularly in relation to brucellosis &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; we have been depopulating far more earnestly than heretofore.  The carrot of knowing they will get some compensation or some payment to keep them going throughout the period when they will not have an income from their farm will indeed prevent the stick having to be used on farmers who are in difficulties in this area.</P>
    <P>With regard to the actual test itself, could the Minister tell the House where the serum that is now being used is sourced? Over the years we have used Dutch top and Rotterdam bottom or British top and Rotterdam bottom or Dutch top and bottom or British top and bottom.  They switched the source of the serum to, I <Col N="240" /> suppose, wherever it was cheapest or wherever supply could be got.  The Department switched the source of the serum used on the TB test apparently without any scientific reasons for doing so.  I was not aware at any stage that the efficacy of the actual serum was ever tested or graphed and yet the whole procedure continued the same regardless of the source of the serum.  Perhaps that is scientifically correct.  I would feel that when you source serum differently that as the test of the size of the lump between the two spots on the neck of the animal is a comparative analysis - if I can be totally unscientific in the description of how you read the test &mdash; it is very important that the strength and the source of the serum be fully taken into account.</P>
    <P>Before ERAD came onstream there was a lot of hassle with inconclusives and false positives and other such categories, where there was an objective analysis as to whether the animal was up or down when it came to reading the test.  Apart from that, there was indeed &mdash; let us be honest &mdash; some slipshod behaviour in terms of the vets reading the test.  There was a difficulty there.  A farmer has a particular relationship with his veterinary surgeon.  He depends on the vet to get out of bed at 3 o'clock in the morning if he has difficulty with an animal calving. He depends on a quick response and a good service from a vet when he has other animals in trouble.  The vet is beholden to that farmer every year for a large part of his income and to get the cheque regularly, annually or monthly or whenever he can get it from the farmer.  There is a personal relationship rather like a doctor/patient relationship that builds up between most farmers and their vets. Most vets will be acutely aware of a particular farmer's economic situation.  If the farmer has a wife and ten children and a large overdraft in the bank, the natural tendency was to give him the benefit of the doubt when it came to an inconclusive. I know that sort of attitude has changed with ERAD.  Perhaps the Minister could indicate to us exactly what the tightening up has been on reading and carrying out the test.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> Could the Minister also indicate whether there has been an increase in the number of <i>post-mortems</i> being carried out since the advent of ERAD?  What exactly are the <i>post-mortems</i> now telling us?  Are they inconclusives?  I believe all inconclusives are now being slaughtered and that there is no benefit of the doubt. I am open to correction in saying that. <i>Post-mortems</i> are histological examinations of these inconclusives, on lesions and so on.  What is that showing us?  What percentage of <i>post-mortems</i> are showing that inconclusives could nearly have gone to the false positive category &mdash; in other words, that they did not have TB even though there was a question mark over the test when it was being read.  Have we increased the number of slides we are doing on lesions at factories and points of slaughter?  If so, what is that telling us in terms of the disease and its spread around the country?  Are we learning any more from more scientific evaluation at the point of slaughter and, if not, why?</P>
    <P>We are now talking to a motion in relation to increasing the levy to I think &mdash; I still have not got a copy of the Minister's speech &mdash; 1.2p per gallon of milk and to £6.90 per animal.  The Minister says that will bring in £21.4 million per annum from the farmers' contribution to bovine disease eradication.  By comparing those figures with the last figures I have on record, that has increased from 1.1p to 1.2p per gallon, which is a moderate increase, and from £6.50 to £6.90 per animal slaughtered.  The previous figures were to realise £19.4 million.  Today's figure is £21.4 million.  I think it was Senator Raftery who said that those figures we have on record do not quite tally with the figures being given by the Department for 1987.  That is understandable because it has to be an estimate. We do not quite know in any one year how many animals will be slaughtered. We should know virtually to the gallon how much milk we will have processed in this country.  Perhaps the Minister could explain the reason for the slight difference.  It is only £2 million, but £2 million is a lot when you consider the budget of ERAD and the job that has to <Col N="242" /> be done.  If we are £2 million out each year perhaps we need to tailor more specifically the amount of money we raise in this area.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to be specific in the answers to the questions we have raised. He did not compose his speech.  I know that from having at one stage sat over in that chair on different issues.  The speech did very little justice to the importance of the topic we are discussing.  Bovine Disease Levies Regulations, 1989, seem fairly innocuous, but behind that is a huge industry that is of enormous importance to the farmers, processors and meat factories and which has enormous value from an export point of view.  Facing into 1992 and beyond, this is an area in which I feel, if we can get our health certification right, we can stand up in Europe and say we are TB free in the accepted sense of that word.  Then there is an enormous future to expand even further from a point of producing beef from grass where we have most natural advantage in this country.</P>

      <P>May I take the opportunity of apologising to the Seanad for any misunderstanding which has arisen this morning?  We had a delay on the Order of Business and, as Senator Doyle from her time in the other House will appreciate, it creates its own problems.  There was absolutely no slight intended to the Seanad in relation to this.  There are obvious difficulties when the Order of Business tends to drift on a bit.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to agree with you in a lot of what you have said; I might now reconsider my position.  I think there is very little point in dwelling on history and we have had quite a lot of that this morning.  I agree with many of the things which were said by the previous speakers but I think the central question here is that the farmers are contributing something of the order of £25 million to disease eradication and they are entitled to see that they get value for that investment. It would be widely accepted that progress in TB eradication has been poor.  Blame can be put for that on many areas &mdash; within the Department itself through the action of successive Governments; the veterinary profession may have some things to answer; and indeed farmers themselves would concede that all has not been well.</P>
      <P>In terms of this year's activities of ERAD and I note from the Minister's speech &mdash; I had the advantage of hearing it and I realise Senator Doyle may not have seen it &mdash; that it was recognised that the establishment of ERAD had provided a successful initiative.  I would share that view.  I think ERAD has been doing a good job.  It has two more years in which to build on the basis it has laid and I hope it can achieve that.  It must be a matter of some concern that, when the single market is introduced, our disease status would be up to proper European standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to some of the aspects of why the disease has or has not been successfully dealt with, I take Senator Doyle's point about the problem of movement of animals.  That has been a major problem. Senator Doyle referred to the situation in Northern Ireland and to the fact that things would appear to be a lot better there.  For the Minister's consideration I <Col N="244" /> would like to say that there is a computerised system in the Department in Northern Ireland where they can track the movement of animals.  That is something that would be of major benefit here, because undoubtedly the way in which cattle are transferred between farms, from farms to marts and factories, is a major element in our lack of progress in controlling the disease.  I understand that this year the number of reactors is likely to be 42,000 per annum, having been at a level of 28,000 to 30,000 for the past ten to 15 years.  That indicates either that the testing is more successful or that the problem is getting worse.  We do look to ERAD to make progress in reducing that figure.  I must also say that it has appeared in the past that where the money was available to control the disease a simple calculation was done in dividing the amount of money by the number of animals and then coming up with a figure. If that is the case we are faced with a problem this year if the figure is 42,000.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measures that have been taken in relation to increasing the level of compensation for animals.  It would appear that within certain categories of animal the compensation being paid is somewhat more than the market value of those animals and there may be funds available from that source to pay for the additional reactors that are coming through the system this year.</P>
    <P>There is no question whatsoever but that farmers have experienced considerable hardship over the years when it came to having reactor cattle.  I have personal experience of the matter myself and it is only where a farmer is in beef that the compensation levels were nearly adequate to pay for the animal, but there are certainly cases within the country of farm families who experienced major hardship, major difficulty, because of their commitment to disease eradication while some of their neighbours who are less committed appear to get away very much more easily.  The State has a commitment to see to it that the people who participate fully in the scheme, who are law abiding and who present their animals properly are looked after in the <Col N="245" /> event that those animals become reactors.</P>
    <P>One thing that should be referred to is the fact that the veterinary fees are to increase by over 14½ per cent this year, adding £1.4 million to the cost of the scheme.  In a year which has already been referred to, where cattle farmers have experienced such difficulty at the backend of the year, and where farm incomes are of course going to suffer very significantly that would appear to be a very generous offering to the veterinary profession. That is not to say that they may not deserve it.</P>
    <P>In terms of the question of black spots, the ERAD studies themselves would show pretty conclusively that the badger is a major element in the spread of the disease.  Obviously, a lot more work needs to be done in that respect.  We are sensitive to the needs of the environment and we would not suggest that badgers should be eradicated, but I do think that there is a case in certain areas for this to happen.  We all know of the situation in Offaly where it was pretty conclusive that the badger was a serious and major element in the spread of the disease.  For those who are sensitive to the future and welfare of those animals, if badgers have TB they are going to die a very lingering and painful death and it may be preferable in certain cases to remove them.  I am concerned about badgers but I am more concerned about farmers.  Farmers, contributing so much to the scheme, must have a say in it.  The test is only as good as the way it is administered.</P>
    <P>Again, figures which were published in recent weeks to show that veterinary inspectors within the Department were uncovering far more reactors than were private practitioners, would indicate that there are deficiencies in administering the test.  I take the point made earlier, that it is very understandable that a veterinary surgeon who has a long and established relationship with a client would tend to take, in all good faith, a more lenient view than someone who is an outsider. That is not to say which of those two parties is right in their assessment of the disease.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="246" /> In conclusion, we say that in general terms we welcome this proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to say that in common with the other Senators who have spoken, I accept the apology given by the previous occupant of that Chair, Minister Séamus Kirk, with regard to the fact that he was detained unavoidably in the other House.  I think, however, that it is unacceptable that we do not get, at the beginning of the debate, copies of the Minister's speech because I myself was involved in discussions in another part of this building and wished to have the opportunity of reading the Minister's script which I could do quickly as I am a speed reader.  It is important that we have this information.</P>
      <P>I would also like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that a large number of the television monitors in this building are not working.  This means that it is quite difficult to follow the proceedings in the Seanad.  I would like to ask that this matter be urgently attended to.</P>
      <P>There is something wonderfully appropriate in this debate being taken in this building and, if I may say so, in the fact that I, although a city dweller, should participate in it, because I look out the window and I see the beautiful columns of the National Library in which, according to the imagination of James Joyce, his character Stephen Dedalus surprised Cranley in perusing a tome entitled <i>Diseases of Ox.</i>  Joyce regarded this as quite an entertaining incident but I think that we, as public representatives, are aware of the fact that the situation with regard particularly to bovine TB is no longer a national joke.  It is far more in the line of a national scandal.  I would like to say that I, as a city dweller, found the contribution in particular of Senator Avril Doyle to be brilliant, incisive and educational from my point of view and I am very glad that I was privileged to be here and to have had the opportunity of informing myself with regard to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like, again as a city dweller, somebody who does not have a background in either science or in farming but <Col N="247" /> who is a taxpayer, to place on the record of the Houses, my concern at what is clearly a scandalous waste over many years of taxpayers' money.  I welcome the fact that this in any vindictive way but do not say this in any vindictive way but I believe that it is the best way of ensuring that they will act as a control mechanism on the veterinary profession.  Let us not be too polite about it.  Most people in this country suspect, and many believe strongly as I do, that the TB eradication scheme over 20, 30 or 40 years has been the single biggest racket in this country, that it was skilfully manipulated in order to milk taxpayers' money.  Of course it is possible to eradicate TB.  It was done in a human population by a great Minister and former Member of this House, Dr. Noel Browne; but then he was determined to do it and there was no money in frustrating the implementation of the scheme he so brilliantly administered.</P>
    <P>I would like to move from a situation where the Minister at the end of his script speaks about targets for the reduction of TB.  A target which is simply reduction, is no use because I have watched over a number of years as an outsider, as an amateur, situations where the eradication seemed to be closing in and we had fewer areas of the country seriously infected, and then suddenly the genie is let out of the bag again and it appears to be on the increase.</P>
    <P>I have to ask why this is?  It is not just a kind of collusion by the veterinary profession.  There are clearly, as Senator Doyle and others have indicated, areas where the procedures need to be tightened up.  The obvious one that occurred to me during the contributions of Senators Doyle and Dardis was the movement, the transport of cattle.  I believe that there should be some attempt at the regulation of the transport of cattle.  I also believe it is very important that the veterinary profession get a signal that Irish people no longer are prepared to provide a source of income for them in the long term.  An end must be brought to this situation.</P>
    <P>The point made by Senator Doyle was <Col N="248" /> an effective and important one when she raised the question of 1992.  She referred to it marginally and in passing.  Beef exports from this country are an extremely important source of revenue. They even appear to have an effect, I would think a distorting effect, upon issues such as our foreign policy.  It is clear that the Government give considerable importance to the export of beef.  We are moving towards the completion of the internal market.  If we do not have a largely TB-free stock of cattle then I believe our export of beef is going to be in trouble.  This is a major reason why all of us from whatever background, even those like myself who have little background in either science or farming, should be concerned and should be prepared to speak out on this issue.</P>
    <P>Of course one has sympathy with the human tragedy that sometimes lies behind infection in cattle herds, not just bovine TB or brucellosis.  There was a case in the last year of a man whose herd of animals was infected by some viral inflammation of the brain &mdash; I think it is called colloquially &ldquo;mad cow&rdquo; disease. This unfortunate man was in a situation where virtually his entire herd was wiped out and there was no compensation as I understand it available in this instance.</P>

      <P>It was not a notifiable disease. I would like to use this debate to ask the Minister to consider making this a notifiable disease because it was a perfectly appalling prospect to witness a man being interviewed on television with his life in ruins, his substance and his prospect of income simply evaporating in front of him and the man simply did not know what to do.  As a community which is interdependent &mdash; city dwellers are interdependent as members of the community with farmers &mdash; it is right that we should attempt to cushion those members of the farming community against this kind of disaster for which they are not prepared and against which they cannot arm themselves in advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="249" /> It would be inappropriate for me to speak at any enormous length on this subject.  I am not particularly qualified. However, I was a little bit concerned at the gentle insinuations against the badger made by Senator Doyle and the rather sharper remarks of Senator Dardis.  I would like to say that I hope the Minister will study scientific studies that were conducted in England which did in fact establish that there was a low level incidence of tubercular infection quite widespread in the badger population.  They went further than that, and this is where I separate myself slightly from what I understood Senator Doyle to be saying.  I do not think it sufficient to establish low level incidence of TB infection in a herd.</P>
    <P>I think one must go on and do what the British studies did and that is examine the mechanism of transference and see whether the badger can be incriminated. From my understanding of these studies there was at the least very grave doubt as to whether the badger was responsible.  I greatly regret the fact that Eamon De Buitlér was not reappointed to the Seanad because I think that this is a matter on which he would be far more qualified to speak than I am.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to be in touch with sources of scientific information such as that provided by Eamon De Buitléar to the previous Seanad in order to ascertain the actual scientific situation.</P>
    <P>I know that farmers believe badgers to be a source of TB.  When one has a situation, as was described earlier, of an apparently spontaneous outbreak of TB and one's livelihood is threatened and where one is aware of the fact that there are badgers in the vicinity and they they may have a certain level of tubercular infection, of course the natural human reaction is to <i>cherchez le badger</i> and do him in.  I have noticed badgers squashed on the road.  Unfortunately I am perhaps a little bit more cynical than the other Senators and I do not think that it is just because the badgers were limping across the roads in the last stages of consumption. I am certain that a sport has arisen over the last ten or 15 years.  I know this because although I do not come <Col N="250" /> directly from farming stock I have relatives in the country whom I visit and I know perfectly well that there is a sport abroad of just simply flattening badgers. It is regarded as quite an amusement. This is on the principal arteries between the cities and it may well be city dwellers who are doing it.  People have been known to swerve right across a road in order to knock a badger out of his standing, as they say in certain parts of the country.  I would like to enter a plea on behalf of the badger.</P>
    <P>I support the concern expressed by Senator Dardis with regard to the very considerable increase of over 14 per cent in veterinary fees and, to return to my suspicions, that if we are not very careful this racket of TB eradication will continue well into the next century, I ask the Minister to ensure that it is properly a programme for eradication of TB which, as I have said earlier on, can be done.  It has been demonstrated that it is possible to achieve the elimination of, not just a reduction in the incidence of TB in cattle. I was horrified by Senator Doyle's figures; a sum of £1 billion gone, not down the drain but into the pockets of the vets, and I have no doubt that there were marginal spin-off effects in supermarkets and pubs, hosiery departments, gents outfitters and so on, but I do not think that that benefit is sufficient to enable us to be satisfied&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is an important aspect of the nation's economy.  It is one where we require good housekeeping on the part of the Government.  It is one where we have a duty to monitor the spending of these very considerable sums of money.  It is appropriate that there should be reactor compensation.  As a community, we are interdependent, but it is an area also in which we are entitled to proper planning, to proper targets, and the only proper target is the eradication of TB from the national herd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make a brief contribution.  In my experience as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts over the past eight years, when this Estimate came before the committee, it was always a matter of major discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The failure to eradicate bovine TB over the past 30 years, under a scheme which has cost in excess of £1 billion in public funds in today's terms, and the slaughter of two million animals, is a national scandal. The Minister and Minister of State responsible for the food industry have stated &mdash; and I know they are very concerned, especially the Minister of State present &mdash; that they hope to make Ireland the food centre of Europe.  Then, central to this aspiration must be the eradication of bovine diseases.  This will ensure the supply of healthy and wholesome raw materials.  The eradication programme to date has been a costly failure, both to farmers and the Exchequer.  As I have stated, the Committee of Public Accounts were forced, over the past number of years, to the conclusion, particularly in 1988, that drastic action to remove technical and administrative constraints was essential to a cost-effective TB eradication programme.  Further, the Dáil Committee of Public Accounts identified no less than 25 matters of <Col N="252" /> serious concern to the operation of the eradication programme and it is to these areas I would like to see the Minister addressing himself.</P>
    <P>The disease eradication programme has now assumed the proportions of a major industry, employing over 1,300 civil servants in various categories.  Notwithstanding that, the bulk of the field work is done by approximately 800 private vets.  It is right to question whether a greater degree of efficiency can be achieved so that the funds that are made available for eradication go towards the purpose for which they were designed and, above all, so that farmers, who are now expected to make an increased contribution towards eradication, will be satisfied that their contribution is going for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The establishment of ERAD, involving all interested parties has proved most successful, in providing a new approach to the eradication of the disease.  Targets set for ERAD entail the halving of the existing bovine TB over four years, and a more intensive programme is being put in place.  A full round of testing of the national herd is being carried out in 1989 and I hope that this will continue into 1990.  I welcome the increase in the levels of compensation allowance by the board of ERAD in May 1989, and back-dated to February 1989, which means that herd owners will be compensated for losses because of a disease breakdown and that ERAD will be greatly assisted in meeting its objective as a result of the new grant structure.  The package represents concrete evidence of the commitment of the farming community and the Government to the success of the setting up of ERAD.</P>
    <P>There is a growing consensus among individual farmers and also among farming organisations that under ERAD we are on course in a new direction to totally eliminate, and not just contain, bovine TB and brucellosis.  I have every confidence in the Minister and Minister of State to see that this new direction will be seen through and I wish them every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like at the outset to <Col N="253" /> welcome the statement from the Minister and agree with the principles contained in it.  I am a trifle surprised that, while TB is mentioned in the statement, there is no mention at all of brucellosis.  I understand that brucellosis has become a considerable problem for a small number of people with some very spectacular cases in the recent past.  I would welcome the Minister informing us of the problem in relation to those herds where a slaughter policy had to be introduced, and what the genesis of the disease was in those conditions; what the likelihood of recurrence is and what preventative measures have been undertaken.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that the scheme is going ahead with the agreement of the farming community.  It is very important that farmers should be in full support of it and, indeed, I welcome the fact that they are prepared to contribute a significant amount of money towards sustaining this scheme.</P>
      <P>Senator Foley mentioned that Ireland is being promoted as the main food centre of Europe and that it to be welcomed.  It is important that if we are going to sell ourselves to Europe and the world on the basis that we produce the best of foods then we are going to have to meet the highest standards in terms of the quality of our product and that means we have to eliminate TB, that is, if that is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about the problems of TB and the difficulties which have been experienced over the years. Perhaps we have not been adequately aware of the fact that TB is a difficult problem.  That is simply a reality.  There are a series of difficulties and those difficulties have, to a large extent, been compounded, until the recent past, by the approach we took to the problem. Prior to the establishment of ERAD, the amount of research which was undertaken on this problem was very small, if not entirely non-existent.  I welcome the establishment of ERAD.  They are doing a very good job and I would like to be seen as supporting them.  However, it is important also that they continue to be given the resources that they need.  If this problem is to be resolved, it will be <Col N="254" /> solved by adopting a scientific attitude, experimentation, and a systematic analysis of the whole problem.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister inform me of his view in relation to the possibilities of developing a different test to diagnose TB?  I believe that some research work is presently in progress in relation to the development of a blood test.  The development of a blood test would be a major breakthrough and I would strongly support the provision of extra resources to help develop such a scheme.  It would be far more objective.  Much of the subjectivity which is unavoidable in the present test could be eliminated if a blood test was developed.  It is very important that investment should be made in research to achieve that objective.</P>
    <P>It is a complex problem because of the nature of Irish agriculture and because of the movement of animals.  I understand that a typical Irish animal tours around six farms from the beginning to the end of its life.  That is a fairly extensive tour of different parts of the country and, of course, as the animal goes around there is the risk that it is hawking disease from one place to another.  There have also been human problems.  As Senator Doyle said, there have been technical problems with the test which has been used in the past and it would be foolish to ignore the fact that these technical problems were intrinsic to the test.  It was not as if they did not exist.  Perhaps they could have been minimised somewhat but they are just a limitation of the test and we should recognise that.</P>
    <P>The veterinary profession has been at the receiving end of a lot of adverse comment this morning.  I have confidence in the veterinary profession; I work with them; I am involved in educating them, and I do not accept that they are prepared to falsify results or do anything other than their duty.  If one stops for even a few minutes to think about it one realises that the welfare of the veterinary practitioner in large animal practice is tied up with the welfare of his client, and if TB is going to continue to be a problem it is bound, in the longer term, to militate against the welfare of our farmers.  So I <Col N="255" /> certainly do not accept that veterinary surgeons do anything other than behave properly in relation to their duties and their work in diagnosing tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the relationship between veterinary surgeons and farmers on which we should be placing more emphasis, that is the question of veterinary surgeons being encouraged to provide more advice to farmers in relation to preventive medicine.  There is a great need for a good deal more advice for farmers on how this disease is transmitted and what methods and strategies can be utilised to prevent outbreaks occurring.</P>
    <P>The question of epidemiology is very important.  It is an imprecise science but nevertheless a very important one.  It has provided a tremendous amount of information which in the last century and day up to the present has led to major discoveries in the treatment of a whole variety of diseases.  I believe it is the epidemiological analysis that has been the basis of a lot of the progress which is being made in other countries in relation to the treatment and prevention of heart disease in the human population.  Epidemiology as a science has certainly received a certain amount of bad press and that has come from pure scientists who find some of the technologies and the methodology used in this area less precise than the type of thing pure physicists or mathematicians are used to.</P>
    <P>I suppose there has been a reluctance on the part of Irish people generally to face up to the problem which involves making difficult decisions &mdash; and in the past meant that we recognised the problem. There was a very understandable temptation for us to shy away from that. That temptation in part arose from the fact that if it was said there was a very serious TB problem in this country it created knock-on problems for the marketing of Irish farm produce.  It is very easy to forget that that was the reality and, I suppose, to some degree it still is.</P>
    <P>When we talk about the problem I feel we do not pay enough attention to how intrinsically difficult eradicating TB can <Col N="256" /> be.  I understand, for example that in Australia there are areas where the authorities have simply contented themselves with containing the problem.  The feeling is that that is the best that can be done. I am not suggesting that that should be the attitude in this country; I am simply pointing that out to illustrate what an intrinsically difficult problem this is.</P>
    <P>I want to mention very briefly the knock-on effect of TB eradication.  That really relates to how quotas were set up in the early eighties.  There was a very specific problem for people who were caught in a disease trap at that time.  They found their quota had been adversely affected because they had a disease problem when the quota standards were being laid down.  I want to draw attention to that and ask the Minister to what extent these people have been facilitated and if there are plans to help those in the farming community who fared very badly because of the anomalies which arose because their herds had disease when the standards for quotas were being laid down in the 1980 to 1983 period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few words to say on this.  It is not an area on which I have a great deal of expertise, I would be the first to admit that.  However I have a certain amount of knowledge about it because I am very regularly involved with farmers and have discussed this issue at length with them.  I have also discussed the matter in some detail over a long period with vets, and I want to put the record right from their point of view before this debate ends.  They have been verbally abused during the debate here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They provide an excellent service, and work in the most difficult surroundings, in the most trying circumstances, are very poorly paid for their commitment and have to wait a long time for payment in many instances.  They need the expertise, the skill and commitment of doctors but they are never recognised as such within the community.  They are the first people to suffer from recessions in the agricultural industry because they are always <Col N="257" /> the last people to be paid.  That should also be put on the record.</P>
    <P>This idea that the vets of Ireland are going around milking the system is less than truthful.  Apart from the low fee they are allowed, they are working a system over which they do not have control, in which they have consistently made proposals to have changes which have been consistently ignored by the Government.  The parties in Government should look into their souls, into their conscience and into their past.  It was the leader of the Minister's party who said that in the new Republic we would export our livestock instead of our young people.  It is interesting to look back at the position in the great industry of agriculture over the last eight years when we managed to quadruple emigration and halve the national herd.  That is the sad reflection on us.</P>
    <P>I concur completely with the need for taxpayers to get a return on their taxes. I agree with the point made by Senator Doyle about the whereabouts of our £1 billion.  What have we got to show for it, and why is it that in the other part of this island TB is down to 0.4 per cent or 0.5 per cent of the herd?  We seem unable to match that.</P>
    <P>It is also significant that since we began the programme of the eradication of bovine TB, as well as spending £1 billion, we have slaughtered two million animals. The sense of loss in terms of export, industry, jobs and the effect on the national herd, is quite significant.  Before coming into the Chamber I listened to Senator Dardis' proposals and found it of some interest.  When I came back in I decided to check that I heard correctly, I went down to the Library to find out what precisely was the position of the Progressive Democrats the last time this was discussed on 7 April 1987.  I found from the record of the Dáil proceedings at that time that the then spokesperson on Agriculture, Deputy McCoy said:</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats oppose any increase in the levies and indeed are opposed to them in principle.</P>
    <P>I do not know where Damascus is, and I <Col N="258" /> spend my life searching for it but I hope somebody will point the way at some stage because I would like to hear the process by which this change took place. It would be important for us to recognise where the change took place and what happened between 1987 and now to change the point of principle.  We are due an explanation because maybe there are developments about which we are not aware.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Far be it from me to contribute to rows between the parties represented in this House, but in the interests of accuracy and the record one should bring these things to the attention of the House.  We have noted the Progressive Democrats have changed position.</P>
      <P>The vets are on call 24 hours a day. The one disease they cannot deal with on a clinical basis is bovine TB.  I would like to know how we justify this.  On the one hand, we stand up and make fine speeches blaming the vets, let us put all the blame at their door, on the other hand, nobody takes any notice of them. Part of their job is to control the health of the national herd so why not let them get on with it?  Why do we not ask them how they feel it should be done?  Why not implement their proposals for a change? Successive Governments have tried this for many years now.  They have all had their go at it.  Why do we not let the professionals move in, listen to what they have to say, implement it and see does it work?  I ask the Minister not to come back and talk about the half-hearted implementation of proposals that come from the professionals in this job before now, because it is quite clear to me that they have never been given the full involvement that they would be entitled to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make another general point on the question of direct levies.  This refers back to the point made by the Progressive Democrats two years ago. <Col N="259" /> While I am not opposed in principle to the idea of direct levies, I find a general sense of anxiety about it because I believe that the health of the national herd is of common interest to all of us and it is too important to be left to individual farmers, or individuals anywhere.  There is too much at risk, there is too much at stake.</P>
    <P>The way to deal with it is through taxation. I do not intend making a speech on taxation but I would like to lay down that general principle.  It is not a case of levying to get a job done, it is in the interest of the nation that this job be done and that it should be paid for through proper taxation.  I will say no more on that issue.  That would be my general approach to it.  However, having said that, I will not oppose the proposal today. I just make that point.  As a general thrust, I would prefer a move in that particular direction.</P>
    <P>In terms of where the vet is involved in this, I asked a vet recently about the amount of paperwork, the amount of administration and the amount of general work involved in the normal test.  I went through the whole process of testing with a vet, one animal for TB and brucellosis. Obviously I am taking an example so that I can examine it under a microscope.  For better or for worse &mdash; I am sure the Minister is aware of this &mdash; in order to carry out that operation the vet has to append his or her signature to 13 different documents.  Does the Minister not think we should also look at the scale of that committment, the back-up and the support that vets require in order to carry out the proper decisions of the State in this matter?  I just want people to see it also from that point of view.  Surely there must be an easier way of doing it.</P>
    <P>More importantly is that we do not trust the vets, at the end of all that.  As I said earlier, the State does not trust the vets just to look after the eradication of TB.  It is treated differently from any other bovine disease.  Not only that, although we ask the vet to go out and test the herd, when he, through the professional application of his knowledge and expertise, etc., identifies an animal <Col N="260" /> as being a reactor, could somebody explain to me why at that point he cannot say, &ldquo;Get that animal off the farm now&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Arrange for that to be done immediately&rdquo;? Under the present regulations, having found a reactor in the herd, the vet has three days to bring that information, paperwork, etc., to the Department and set the process in train.  Why cannot the veterinary surgeon set that process in train immediately that he or she has identified a reactor animal in the herd?  Surely we would save further infection, further spread of the disease and it would be a more efficient and effective way of dealing with it.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear from the Minister about the process by which veterinary surgeons are nominated to examine and to carry out tests on herds.  How does that process actually develop and how is it done?  The more I seek information on it, the muddier the waters become.  It also seems to me, at the moment anyway, that for the veterinary surgeon to carry out this process it takes approximately three visits, or three days' work, an involvement over a period of three days.  There is the first day testing, the 72 hour repeat, there is the checking of the number, the checking of the description, the checking of the reaction and all the paperwork that goes with that.  There is also, of course, the brucellosis blood test and sending back the individual blood samples from each animal that has been tested to the lab, etc.</P>
    <P>A huge volume of work is undertaken on behalf of the State by veterinary surgeons. If the vet, having gone through the procedure, identifies a reactor animal, then has the commitment and responsibility to ring the Department immediately and follow up with information or forms within a three-day period &mdash; I must stress this point &mdash; it seems utter nonsense to me that there should be a delay between the identification of the reactor animal and when the actual process of removal takes place.  I can see no reason why, if the vet who is a professional person, has identified the reactor animal, that he could not set in train the process by which that animal <Col N="261" /> would be removed immediately, and demand that that be done.</P>
    <P>I move on to what happens after the vet has completed his or her work on the farm, has identified and arranged for the removal of reactor animals, has passed the remainder of the herd, has signed all the necessary documentation and has handed over all the appropriate paperwork to the herd owner.  Where are we at that point?  The herd are now clear for 120 days.  This, of course, is where the whole problem arises, and this is where vets are getting unnecessary stick and unnecessary criticism because the view of the vets that I have spoken to, and certainly the view of the Irish Veterinary Union and the Irish Veterinary Association as far as we know, on these matters, is quite clear.  They utterly disagree with the present position that people can move animals over that 120 day period as many times as they want to.  It leads to abuse of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton mentioned the fact that the normal animal, whatever that is, might move seven or eight times during his or her working career from one farm to another, etc.  The fact is that an animal could be moved seven or eight times in the 120 days if somebody wished to do so and it could have been in contact with seven or eight different farms, seven or eight different herds, or whatever number that would go into operation. What happens then &mdash; I would certainly direct the Minister's attention to this &mdash; if at the end of 120 days when the animal is on a completely new farm, in a new herd, with all the passports, documentation and description there, and a new vet comes along and finds that this animal, which was clear 120 days ago, is now a reactor?</P>
    <P>Where do we go from there?  What is the vet to do?  What is the State to do? What is the farmer to do?  How do we check back which of the six, seven, eight or nine movements of the previous four months is the one which led to the spread of the disease?  You cannot do it.  It becomes a physical impossibility, so the round begins all over again.  He goes through that herd, and the animals from <Col N="262" /> that herd may move again afterwards. The reason I am stressing this point is to point out very clearly that it is the system, the arrangement and the rules and the regulations, that have led to the failure to eradicate bovine TB.</P>
    <P>It is not a matter that can be laid at the door of the veterinary profession.  It is a matter that can be laid at the door of the regulations which are nonsensical and unimplementable in the context of eradicating TB.  We need a very clear proposal and I will ask the Minister to respond very specifically to it.  The proposal is very simply this.  Before any movement takes place there should be a test.  That makes it quite simple.  That is one way of ensuring that there is no movement without identifying where the infection is, or where the spread of the disease takes place.  I would be the first to admit that it would be impossible to implement and operate that.  It is the movement that creates the problem so we must control the movement.</P>
    <P>I believe, and many others also believe, that brucellosis could be as good as cleared in this country if we gave it the final push.  I do not know why there was a relaxation in the regulations last year when we were so close to victory.  We were just so close to beating the brucellosis problem and then we decided to relax the regulations about movement, I believe we are losing control of it again. It is decisions like that over the decades that have led us to the position we now have, having spent £1 billion, having slaughtered two million cattle and we still have failed to eradicate TB.</P>
    <P>It is because of those kind of politically motivated nonsensical decisions that we have failed to eradicate TB.  If we are going to keep to the 120 days testing we should say: &ldquo;During 120 days we will confine you to one movement&rdquo;; in other words, 120 days and one movement or else if there is to be any number of movements we reduce it to a month.  It is impossible to trace back the movement of animals between herds and between farms if we do not either reduce the number of movements or reduce the amount of time.  There is only one way <Col N="263" /> that can lead to eradication.  There are two variables, there is the movement and there is the time.  We have to close down on one of those if we are to retain any kind of control or be able to check where the disease is coming from or going to.</P>
    <P>Over the years we have adopted a fire brigade approach to this disease.  We spent the sixties and seventies having a go at the dealers.  They were the fall guys at that stage and, quite rightly so, they were the target at that time.  We spent the sixties and the seventies trying to sort them out and then we went on to the late seventies and eighties and we spent most of that time working on tags and getting a tamper-proof tag.  Perhaps we have reached that stage even though some people will say no.  We have gone through all the intermediate procedures and everything is in place now but it takes political nerve in order to make the final push on these things.</P>
    <P>We have also tightened up on legislation. There was a time when I would have said that part of the problem with the failure of the TB eradication scheme was because of the lack of severe penalties to deter unscrupulous people.  The penalties are heavy enough now and we just need to see they are implemented widely and publicly.  I hope they will continue to be implemented.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about the question of payment of vets.  It is something I do not know a lot about and I do not pretend to have a lot of information on it.  It is clear that because vets are not allowed to deal with TB like other diseases they are constrained in their approach to it.  I believe they would be far happier to deal with it more as clinicians where they would be paid per animal, they would be paid per call out and they would be paid in the same way as they are paid for dealing with other diseases.  There should be a normal payment plus expenses.  That is the normal way that we deal with other diseases, I ask that it be looked at.</P>
    <P>I know that a survey was done recently on the way vets are paid for their work, I understand that the report contained a <Col N="264" /> proposal that there would be backdating of the new rates for veterinary surgeons but I am now told that the Government are refusing to implement that.  That is shameful and it is the kind of thing that leads to bad relations between the Department and the veterinary profession. I ask the Minister to take a hand in this matter and see to it that the proposals as recommended are implemented and that people get their due.  It is the report of an independent group and one that should be accepted by Government.</P>
    <P>Most of the Senators have spoken about the badger.  The badger is getting a raw deal in this discussion.  It would appear certain that badgers can be the cause of spreading bovine TB.  There is no longer any doubt about that but some people still do not accept it.  There is also the fact, which is not clearly accepted either, that not every badger in the country is carrying TB or can spread it. That is the second factor.  Then there is the emotional response of a farmer who is losing money, who is found to have reactors in his herd, who knows there are badgers on his land and if somebody does not do something about it he will take a gun and clear the pest, as he sees it, from his land.  It is hard to blame him for doing that.</P>
    <P>That is the problem but how do we approach it in order to be supportive of the need to protect our wildlife, to eradicate TB and to be supportive also of the farmers position?  There must be a scientific approach to this.  Areas should be tested to see if badgers are carrying and spreading TB.  If they are they must be eradicated in that area.  They are hard work but that is the way it should be approached.  Similarily, if they are not carrying TB they should be left alone.  It is a very simple approach.  It is costly but it is the only acceptable way for people who want to look at the various demands that are being made on us to protect wildlife, to eradicate TB and to also give support to the farmer who wants to keep a disease-free herd.  I ask the Minister to respond very specifically on that point.</P>
    <P>Townlands should be surveyed and if there is a badger problem there it should <Col N="265" /> be addressed in that townland.  We do not need people with shotguns throughout the country deciding to take the resolution of this matter into their own hands, which will not be an acceptable or a scientific way of dealing with the problem.  As I said at the beginning, it is not an area in which I am particularly expert.  The professionals in this area, the vets, should be asked for their advice and this time it should be taken and implemented. Everything else has failed to produce the results at a cost of £1 billion and two million animals.  I am not putting the blame on any Government, on any party or any group.  The one group of people who have not been allowed to sort it out are the professionals.  We should talk to the professionals, take their advice, implement it and see how that works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be clear to everyone that our TB eradication scheme over the years has essentially been a failure. It has been a failure on a number of levels, first it has not alleviated the problem and secondly, it has cost this country vast sums of money.  I feel that central to the failure of the TB eradication scheme has been the fact that the farmer has not been adequately compensated for their animals.  The lack of proper compensation for the farmers has obviously affected their level of co-operation with the scheme.  I am convinced that if a proper compensation structure were put in place, and if we are serious about TB eradication, this should be done and there would be a change in the attitude of farmers.  The recent advertising campaign in the media has gone a little of the journey towards attitudinal change on eradication but I believe that fundamental to it must be the price given to farmers for reactors.  I would like to ask the Minister how the price of reactors relates to the present market price and to what degree that is the case at the moment.  I would also like to ask whether the Minister accepts the contention that we must progressively increase compensation to farmers as the effective way of getting their co-operation.  Given the hardship that farmers are enduring at the <Col N="266" /> moment and the grave problems facing farmers who bought last spring and have recently sold beef cattle, it is unreasonable to expect their complete co-operation without adequate compensation. Could the Minister give us his thoughts on that?</P>
      <P>I would also like to know from the Minister the degree, in the national screening test, to which cases of false positive have been found, in other words, the degree to which animals that did have lesions leading to their being committed to the factories were found to be tuberculosis free on arrival in the factories.  Subsequent to that I would ask the Minister whether it is his view that there is an absolute case for giving those people the full market or the full commercial value of the animals.</P>
      <P>I would also like to ask the Minister, since we are discussing bovine disease in the general sense, can he tell us why, despite the fact that we are declared to be brucellosis free, there has been a recent upsurge in brucellosis.  I would be interested in the minister's response on that.</P>
      <P>The fundamental view I rose to express and I would urge the Minister and the Government to agree is that until we have a proper compensation structure in place we cannot solve this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me welcome all the new Senators and the return of some of the older Senators.  I would like to welcome particularly the new people here &mdash; Senator John Dardis, Senator Jackman, Senator O'Reilly, Senator Pat Upton and Senator Eoin Ryan.  I am very pleased to be here in this new Chamber.  It is a change from some of the surroundings I am used to. It is a beautifully decorated Chamber &mdash; the doorways, the fireplaces, the ceiling and embellished of course by the distinguished Senators.  I want to pay tribute to the Office of Public Works.  I want to congratulate you, a Chathaoirleach on your elevation to the position of Cathaoirleach for this term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to briefly sum up by thanking <Col N="267" /> the Senators.  I am sorry, Senator Doyle, I was not here for your reportedly brialliant contribution.  I am sure it was because I had the privilege of being in the lower House with you and indeed all your contributions are brilliant, if I may say so.  Senator John Dardis made a very incisive contribution.  Senator David Norris made a Joycean contribution to this debate.  I do not know how widespread mad cow disease is in these chambers. We may introduce a test for it on entry here at some stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Denis Foley's background in the Public Accounts Committee was very useful to us.  Senator Pat Upton made a technically superb speech.  Senator Joe O'Toole made a spirited defence of the veterinary faculty and the veterinary graduates and a plea to have those hard pressed professionals paid at a higher rate.  I will see what I can do in that regard.  I would like to thank Senator Joe O'Reilly for his useful contribution.  He sought an increase in compensation to farmers for reactors.  This is in line with a number of contributions made here today.  With the more aggressive campaign to have the incidence of animal disease, particularly TB, in a four year programme we can expect an increase in the number of reactors which will have to be compensated for.  The estimated figures will go up from 29,000 in 1988 to 42,000 this year.  I think it is fair to record that the bulk of the money is coming from the farmers out of a total of £31.585 million, £21.4 million of the £31 is coming from the farmers themselves and £10 million from the Exchequer.  I think that is a reasonable ratio.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator Joe O'Toole who said that the general taxpayer should have to pay this entirely.  I think it is appropriate that there would be a contribution from the people who are being compensated and we have a duty as well to take appropriate action and to observe general hygiene regulations. They are the people who are mainly going to benefit from a disease <Col N="268" /> free status for not alone the animal industry but for the general agriculture and food industry.</P>
    <P>The question of badgers was raised by many speakers here.  The position in relation to badgers, of course, is that to some extent they may be the scapegoat. I remember a number of years ago it was the unfortunate hen population &mdash; which were supposed to be the main contributory factor &mdash; my poor mother had to get rid of every single hen she had in the place.  It is only in recent times that I am able to avail myself of the free range egg again which is a very desirable development. In relation to badgers scientific work had been carried out in this area by Professor Dan Collins and if anybody wants a copy of his report which was produced last year I will make it available to them &mdash; this is on the badger as a contributory factor to this problem. There is some evidence that the badger is a contributory factor.  Personally I do not like to be that hard on the badger and I do not agree with things like widescale gassing of badgers, but I accept that if people want to nail the badger then they have to look for a licence to do it and the Wildlife Service are quite right to be selective about giving licences.</P>
    <P>On the question of a TB investigation unit, the present position is that an investigation unit has been set up at the Veterinary College under the direction of Professor Dan Collins.  There is an investigation taking place at the moment on the suitability of electronic tags but it is at a very early stage and it is ongoing. We will not be in a position to know if we can replace the existing tags by electronic tags for a little while yet.  It would be desirable.  It is not so long ago that in the boot of any old car you could get what tags you wanted and a piece of tagging equipment as well.  It was just a question of what tag numbers you wanted.  There were weaknesses in the scheme over the past 30 or 40 years, glaring weaknesses.  Many a time I travelled behind an old truck with all sorts of effluent oozing out of it.  What is most galling is the fact that these trucks then pull up at a mart, unload some of the <Col N="269" /> cattle and then drive on to the factory with the TB reactors in the truck.  That certainly did not lead to good practices in the eradication or elimination or reduction of the disease.  In fact it contributed to the incidence of it.  ERAD certainly are taking a very serious view of these shortcomings and are making some progress.  Again in relation to the veterinary people and the contribution they can make to it, the veterinary profession have two members on the board of ERAD.  ERAD is quite a broadly based board.  If they have a contribution to make they should make it through the board of ERAD and see how they can be more meaningful in getting rid of this disease once and for all.</P>
    <P>There are other shortcomings at present.  There is a number of people who regularly call on farmers.  The farmers themselves should insist to a far greater degree that these casual callers should be more observant of elementary hygiene regulations.  It is seldom enough that you find in a farmyard a vat of detergent, Jeyes fluid in the old days was a regular one.  People visiting the farm, dealing with or handling animals should have their wellington boots washed in a vat of detergent before proceeding to deal with the cattle herd.  If people in the farming community have a valuable herd and valuable stock they should insist on that. They are the people who have the most to lose.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton raised the matter of blood testing for TB.  In fact work is going on at Abbotstown laboratory at the moment on that matter and we hope to have some results shortly on the feasibility of blood testing for TB.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton raised the question of farmers with milk quota problems.  There is a good number of such farmers.  At the early stages of the milk quota there was an opportunity for people who had herd difficulties, disease difficulties or indeed if the farmer himself or herself had an ill health difficulty, to get some increase in their quota.  It was not enough but it was an acknowledgement of the fact that some farmers were unfortunate either in their domestic circumstances or in the <Col N="270" /> fact their herd had a breakdown.  There is at present an application for and a discussion on the setting up of a 1 per cent reserve of milk for unfortunate cases and for new entrants and people with low quotas.  Hopefully people in the farming community who had difficulties with disease will be able to avail of some additional milk quota.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

      <P>The conditions will be very hard to comply with to get that 1 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>They will indeed, in the Irish context of 1,100 million gallons 1 per cent is only 11 million gallons and 11 million gallons is not enough to go around to make any reasonable impact.  The condition will have to be quite restrictive.  I accept the Senator's point even though it is not for this debate.  We will have to wait until a general review of the milk quota in 1992 to get any reasonable quota for the many people who want to make a living from dairying.</P>
      <P>In relation to the rounds, there is full TB round in place this year.  In brucellosis there is a full milk ring and blood testing round for non-lactating animals.  In 1990 there will be a full TB round again and a full blood test for brucellosis.  The tuberculin used at the moment is a Dutch type tuberculin.  Epidemiology work is being carried out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I will communicate with the Senator on that.  There was the question of whether market value could be paid.  The price which people get for reactors with this subsidy in virtually all cases is a reasonably adequate compensation to farmers and herd owners with one exception, that is people with pedigree herds.  They lose out very heavily because they are not compensated as fully as they should.  I am going to have a look at that also.</P>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions and I will bring their views to the attention of ERAD.</P>

      <P>The Government welcome this debate by the Seanad on this very important and timely report from the NESC.  The NESC has played an influential role in recent years in providing advice on an impartial and objective basis on this country's economic and social problems.  The present report complements this with an authoritative and detailed assessment of the effects of our EC membership.  It also identifies the key issues which arise for this country in the moves now underway to strengthen further the process of integration in the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We regard this latest report as having the same level of importance as the earlier report from the NESC entitled <i>A Strategy for Development 1986-1990.</i> That report laid the foundation for the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which, in turn, has provided the basis for the dramatic and sustained improvement in our economy over the last two and a half years.  As the NESC has emphasised, our economic success in the Community, as we approach 1992 and the completion of the internal market, requires continuation of the very successful macroeconomic management and supporting sectoral policies which we have been pursuing. It also needs to be underpinned by continued consensus among the social partners in our efforts to increase <Col N="273" /> employment and ensure higher living standards for all our people.</P>
    <P>At the outset, I would like to pay tribute to and convey our thanks to the NESC and its secretariat for this very important report.  The Government do not necessarily agree with every hypothesis and conclusion in the report.  However, we do agree that this country's overall interests are likely to be best served by the fullest degree of economic integration, provided this is accompanied by the necessary parallel measure to strengthen cohesion and reduce regional disparities in the Community.</P>
    <P>The report responds to the specific terms of reference set by the Government in areas which are germane to the NESC's general remit.  It does not deal with the wider political, institutional or cultural aspects of our Community membership. These aspects are of fundamental interest to us and are, of course, closely related to issues dealt with in the NESC report.  Indeed, a nation's approach in these areas must be informed by its concrete economic and social interest and concerns.  The NESC, in line with its functions and the request submitted to it, has concentrated on a range of issues in the economic and social sphere.  I shall largely do the same and while my remarks on the future shape and nature of the Community may beg institutional and political questions, I shall not, however, be able to deal with these today, given the limited time at my disposal.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the NESC's definition of the EC Economic and Monetary Union is much more comprehensive than that advocated in the Delors Committee's report.  The NESC view would involve the development of many more common Community policies and an expanded Community Budget.  As I have already mentioned, the Government are supportive of progressively closer integration with the Community, provided this is on a basis which ensures that the benefits of integration will be fairly shared and will extend to all regions of the Community.  This is the strategic approach recommended by the NESC <Col N="274" /> and the one which the Government are pursuing.</P>
    <P>This approach has guided our attitude to the completion of the internal market, to the elaboration of its social dimension, to development of the Community's environmental and R &amp; D policies, to its response to the concerns of the EFTA countries and to the economic needs of Poland and Hungary.  Our approach is, as set out in our <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, one of the fullest participation by Ireland in every facet of Community activity.  Ireland will not be opposed to further economic and social integration in the Community.  But we insist that it must be a Community which cherishes all its citizens equally &mdash; a Community that fully discharges the Treaty obligations to promote the achievement of greater economic and social cohesion by reducing regional disparities.  We want no two-speed nor two-tier process in Community integration.</P>
    <P>I should now like to return to the Treaty obligations on economic and social cohesion.  Over the past two years, attention has concentrated overwhelmingly, both in Ireland and at Community level, on the doubling and reform of the structural funds.  As Senators will be aware, under the Commission's recent allocation of structural funds for Objective 1 regions of the Community, this country will receive over the period 1989-1993 a higher level of aid per head of population than any other Objective 1 region.  We will also achieve the highest <i>per capita</i> increase in aid over the 1987 levels.  This represents a major boost for this country's economic development prospects.</P>
    <P>The Community support framework, which sets out the priorities, the amount and type of assistance which we will be receiving from the structural funds, has now been approved by the Commission. This will be published shortly.  Discussions are at an advanced stage between the EC Commission and the various Government Departments in regard to the content of our operational programmes and these are expected to be <Col N="275" /> approved over the coming weeks.  Pending this, it is not possible to say exactly which individual projects will be selected for assistance by the funds.</P>
    <P>There may be a tendency in the Community to think that this disposes of responsibilities in regard to cohesion. However, as the NESC report argues, and the Government agree, the structural funds will not be sufficient to promote cohesion and reduce regional disparities. In this context, I should emphasise that there is also an obligation, under Article 130 B of the Treaty, inserted by the Single Act, to take account of the cohesion dimension in the implementation of all common Community policies including those under the internal market programme. There has been some trend in recent years towards the differentiation of common policies to cater for particular features of the less developed member states.  However, we are far from seeing a fully purposeful and systematic application of Article 130 B.  We need this at the stage when the Commission are formulating proposals for Community policies. This is a subject we have been studying and which we will be pursuing with the Commission and with other member states.</P>
    <P>The NESC report has emphasised that it would be wrong to expect that the free play of market forces will, left to itself, bring about regional convergence.  It underlines the need for stronger measures of positive integration in the Community.  It also emphasises that the social dimension of the internal market is an important aspect of this positive integration.  It seems to me that if we are for economic and social cohesion, we have to be for a worthwhile and balanced social dimension.  We particularly welcome the fact that the NESC has been able to agree on forward-looking and helpful conclusions in this area.  Ireland fully supported the conclusions of the European Council meetings in Rhodes and Madrid which put the matter well, saying that, respectively:</P>
    <P>Completion of the Single Market <Col N="276" /> cannot be regarded as an end in itself; it pursues a much wider objective, namely to ensure the maximum wellbeing of all, in line with the tradition of social progress which is part of Europe's history.  This tradition of social progress should be a guarantee that all citizens, whatever their occupation, will have effective access to the direct benefits expected from the Single Market as a factor of economic growth and as the most effective means of combating unemployment [and] in the construction of the single European market, social aspects should be given the same importance as economic aspects and should accordingly be developed in a balanced fashion.</P>
    <P>The dominant issue in this area at present is the proposed European Social Charter. This is one of the major items for discussion at the European Council meeting next month in Strasbourg.</P>
    <P>In Community discussions we have indicated that we support in principle the broad thrust of the French Presidency programme in this area.  Too often the social dimension is spoken of as if it were a liability, purely a factor increasing costs.  I believe that it is more productive to look upon it as an investment in human resources and in social harmony, both basic conditions for successful economic policies and development.  We share this French approach of accentuating the positive, while not overlooking possible problems.  For us, the social priority is employment.  We have stressed this crucial aspect in the past and will continue to do so.  We welcome the French proposal to initiate regular ministerial discussions on the subject.  As the succeeding Presidency, we will certainly support continuation of this useful initiative. But much more is required and this brings me back to the role and responsibility of the Community in the future, the need for greater positive integration and the whole question of assignment of policy functions.  All of these matters are dealt with persuasively by the NESC in their analysis of the requirements for <Col N="277" /> stable integration and, specifically, for a stable and durable Economic and Monetary Union.</P>
    <P>There have been a lot of references in recent Community discussion to the principle of subsidiarity.  This means that the functions of higher levels of government should be as limited as possible and should be subsidiary to those of lower levels.  The Delors report says that adherence to this principle would be an essential element in defining the appropriate balance of powers within the Community in an Economic and Monetary Union. As specifically noted by the NESC, the Delors Committee report says:</P>
    <P>Thus, the attribution of competences to the Community would have to be confined specifically to those areas in which collective decision-making was necessary.  All policy functions which could be carried out at national (and regional and local) levels without adverse repercussions on the cohesion and functioning of the economic and monetary union would remain within the competence of the member countries.</P>
    <P>As the NESC report says, Ireland need have no difficulty with this as a principle. We certainly do not support any excessive centralisation of powers or functions in the Community.  We espouse a Community in which, as President Delors said in his recent speech in Bruges, diversity and pluralism are upheld.  We agree with him that integration in Europe, a Community of ancient nations, has to be a <i>sui generis</i> process.  We agree with the Commission President that we should add to Jean Monnet's aim of uniting peoples, the parallel aim of bringing together the nations.</P>
    <P>We specifically supported the invocation of the principle of subsidiarity in the conclusions of the Madrid European Council on the social dimension of the internal market.  But, as NESC rightly points out, the issue is the application of the principle.  It would appear from other references in President Delors speech and, indeed, from the report of the Delors Committee, that there is a tendency to apply this principle so as to unduly <Col N="278" /> restrict the areas in which the Community and its institutions would have competence and responsibility.</P>
    <P>It is to be welcomed that the Commission President now sees a Community budget rising to 5 per cent of Community GDP.  Other references though appear to leave to the exclusive competence and responsibility of the member states a number of policy areas where we would feel, together with the NESC, that the Community should have a parallel involvement.  The NESC report rightly points out that there are economies of scale, externalities and spillovers deriving from the provision of certain public activities.  This suggests that these activities might be assigned to a higher level of government.  Examples might be, respectively, air traffic control, environmental regulation and educational provision. They note that an additional criterion is political homogeneity or the feeling of belonging to the same political grouping and sharing the same interests and destiny.</P>
    <P>It would be foolish to suggest that the commonality of identity and interests between people from the different member states is yet anywhere as strong as that which exists amongst the peoples of the individual member states.  It is to be noted that, again in his Bruges speech, President Delors looked to every European having the feeling of belonging to a Community which would in some sense be his or her second motherland.</P>
    <P>I share this vision, but if it is to happen it will be necessary that the Community, as I have said, cherish each of its citizens equally.  Certainly, the member states have, as recognised in Article 130 B of the Treaty, responsibilities for the development and welfare of their own citizens.  But, with increasing integration, it will also be necessary to give fuller practical expression to the Community's obligations under that Article.  Here it is relevant to recall that, as NESC point out, the theory of fiscal federalism strongly suggests that the redistribution and stabilisation functions should be carried out at the highest level.  Moreover, in their report, commissioned by President <Col N="279" /> Delors himself, the Padoa-Schioppa Group expressed the view that &ldquo;greater Community involvement in stabilisation and redistribution policies is the indispensable complement of the ambitious project of completing the internal market&rdquo;.  It might be felt that in current circumstances it would be unrealistic to envisage that the Community should exercise these functions.  The situation should be different in an Economic and Monetary Union.  Even then, it is scarcely realistic or even perhaps desirable, to contemplate the Community exercising exclusive responsibility in such areas as social security or regional policy.</P>
    <P>I mentioned fiscal federalism a moment ago and in his Bruges speech President Delors spoke of the merits of the federal approach in the further development of the Community.  If we look at models such as the Federal Republic of Germany or the United States, we see that a prominent feature of such federal unions is the concurrent exercise of competences in various fields. I do not necessarily suggest that the future Community has to be a federation or that we should slavishly follow any particular federal model.  There is nothing, I suggest, against taking from them the elements that are appropriate to the Community's unique circumstances. One can imagine a situation in which major parts of the responsibility for decision-making in regard to such areas as educational provision or unemployment compensation remains with the member state.  But this would be paralleled by an active Community role in ensuring minimum standards of provision and welfare, including through financial support in areas such as these, which go beyond the boundaries of what is covered by the Structural Funds at present.</P>
    <P>This implies a larger Community budget.  Whether 5 per cent of Community GDP is enough is a question for further examination and debate.  The important point of principle is that the NESC are right.  Application of the Delors Commmittee's own criterion in regard to the cohesion and functioning of <Col N="280" /> an EMU suggests that the Community will need to exercise a competence, concurrent with the continuing competence of the member states, in a wider and deeper range of policy areas than is apparently being contemplated in certain quarters.  By reference to Articles 130 A and 130 B of the Treaty the effectiveness of the functioning of the EMU must be judged by the effect on economic and social cohesion.  If real convergence of the different economies is retarded rather than advanced by EMU, the cohesion and stability of the union will, sooner or later, be adversely affected.  The Community must have the policy competences and financial resources required in order to effectively promote such convergence.</P>
    <P>Some commentators have picked up the NESC comments on the question of the degree of political homogeneity needed before policy functions can be assigned to the Community level.  And, further, whether Community budgetary support can expand to fresh fields, beyond those concerned with structural development of the component economies. These commentators have suggested that this degree of political homogeneity is unlikely to emerge in the Community in the near future.  Consequently, they feel that the NESC analysis and prescriptions on European integration provide little basis for practical policy purposes.  We should, of course, be under no illusions as to the extent of the task of persuasion that lies before us. But, as the NESC itself points out, the degree of political homogeneity changes and develops over time and, as experience shows, sometimes in discreet leaps. This is certainly borne out by the experience of recent years.</P>
    <P>One of the dominant issues on the Community's agenda at present, and one which is dealt with at some length in the NESC report, is the completion of the Internal Market by the deadline of 1992. This will require important sectoral decisions and initiatives at the domestic level here to maximise the opportunities and minimise the risks.  I now propose to outline in general terms what the Government have been doing to promote <Col N="281" /> the necessary preparations by the different sectors of our economy for the internal market.</P>
    <P>Last year, the Government launched its EUROPEN campaign to promote awareness of the Community's internal market programme.  This campaign started with an initial phase of ministerial speeches, advertising and seminars and other initiatives focusing on the need to make the necessary preparations in what will be a major change in the economic and business environments.</P>
    <P>This year saw a change of direction in the campaign.  Emphasis is now on the necessary preparations at sector and firm levels through the support provided by the particular Departments and State bodies responsible for the various sectors and functional aspects, such as standards, export and domestic marketing and so on.  In addition to sustaining the flow of information on the adoption of directives and on other significant developments, we are also publishing, in co-operation with the Irish Business Bureau in Brussels, a monthly <i>&lsquo;Europen News&rsquo;</i> in Business and Finance and Irish Business magazines, thus reaching up to 21,000 people concerned with business.</P>
    <P>Another initiative has been a series of sectoral studies which have been undertaken for ten important sectors of industry by distinguished economists with an extensive knowledge of the sectors and issues concerned.  The ten sectors selected are the food processing industry; electronic, electrical and instrument engineering; metals and mechanical engineering; distribution; textiles/ clothing/footwear; transport; tourism; chemicals/pharmaceuticals/healthcare; financial services; and the construction industry.  I do not wish unduly to preempt these studies, which will be published shortly, except to say that, on balance, there seems to be a certain degree of cautious optimism about the direct impact of the internal market on Irish industry.</P>
    <P>The sectoral studies all stress the importance of informed and well planned <Col N="282" /> preparation in order to take full advantage of the opportunities of the internal market.  The studies also recognise that, because our economy is already relatively open and because we have scarcely any non-tariff barriers in our domestic market, a large part of Irish industry has already had to adapt to maintain its competitive position.  Considerable emphasis is placed in the studies on the overriding need for management to keep abreast of technical and structural changes in whatever industry it is involved, and to monitor the evolving needs of their customers. This ties in with the conclusion reached by the NESC in their very valuable analysis of the effects of the internal market on various sectors of our economy.</P>
    <P>The third main initiative, which we have taken this year, was a major survey carried out by Irish Marketing Surveys. This showed a significant but still insufficient improvement in respect of planning and preparation for the internal market as compared with an earlier survey undertaken by the Marketing Institute of Ireland at a time when the Government campaign was only getting into its intensive phase.</P>
    <P>While I am happy to note the improvements effected by the European campaign, the results are far from affording any grounds for complacency.  It is clear that a major task of preparation remains for Irish business and for the Government agencies assisting it.  The results of the survey have been supplied to the various public agencies and industry bodies as an aid in planning their programmes.  The most frequently cited need was for more specific information for different industries and sectors.  This is now being addressed with the publications of the ten Europen sectoral studies.</P>
    <P>I disagree with NESC that Irish Governments have tended to see cohesion as a purely economic phenomenon. Successive Governments here have, I believe, adopted a consistently <i>communautaire</i> thrust on broad strategic issues in the Community.  This is exemplified by our generally positive approach to fresh steps in integration such as the <Col N="283" /> EMS and the SEA.  These had much more than an economic significance, in our understanding for the concerns and interests of other member states &mdash; whether it is Iberian accession or German concerns about developments in Eastern and Central Europe &mdash; in our constructive participation in European political co-operation and in our respect for Community law which provides an essential underpinning for Community legitimacy.</P>
    <P>In the light of the unprecedented changes occurring all around us, particularly in Eastern Europe, we should not be too pessimistic about the readiness of Europeans to identify with, and accept, an enhanced role for the community in this context.  Senators might recall the recent address in the European Parliament by President Mitterrand of France, in his current capacity as President of the European Council, when he called for a wider revision of the EC Treaties than that required for the establishment of an Economic and Monetary Union.  It is also important to note the renewed commitment given by the West German Chancellor, Mr. Helmut Kohl, to the continuation of the EC unification process which he sees as an important condition for the success of the political and economic reforms now under way in Eastern Europe.  There is no future in trying to hold back the tide or in standing aside from a process that has such momentum.  Our ambitions in regard to the assignment of policy competences or the strengthening of the Community budget may not be fully realised in the immediate future.  Nevertheless, the strategic approach I have outlined will provide the best political context for making the maximum achievable progress at any particular time, thus providing successive staging points from which we can aim at further progress.</P>
    <P>With the Geoghegan-Quinn EC Coordinating Committee, the Europen Bureau and the regular meetings of the Committee of Ministers and Departmental Secretaries chaired by the Taoiseach, our co-ordination arrangements <Col N="284" /> have been considerably strengthened, as compared with most of the period reviewed by the NESC.  The arrangements are working well but we are now considering how they can be specially enhanced to ensure optimum effectiveness in conducting our forthcoming Presidency of the EC Council of Ministers. In regard to the domestic policy response, we have, in addition, the Central Review Committee under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and we have reactivated the Sectoral Development Committee.  These arrangements bring together those with executive responsibility in and under the Government and the representatives of economic operators, and are proving quite satisfactory.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should emphasise that the Government are giving the most serious attention to the NESC report.  We believe it constitutes one of the most significant Irish contributions to the debate at European level on the future shape and direction of further steps in the Community's integration.  Already it has provided a basis for debates here at home in various fora which I am following with particular interest.  It is, I believe, only fitting that the new Seanad should commence its proceedings early on with a debate on EC issues covered in the NESC report which will have a critically important bearing on this country's future economic prospects.  I am looking forward to studying the various contributions in this debate which I would hope will be in the same positive and constructive spirit as that shown by the representatives of the various economic and social interests on the NESC.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I think all of us here would <Col N="285" /> probably agree that the report commissioned in 1982 by the European Parliament set us on the road to where we are today.  That report concluded that Europe was losing out to the Japanese and the American markets by operating as individual national markets within the Community.  This led to a new treaty being signed by all member states in December 1985 called the Single European Act.  When the Single European Act came before the Dáil the Taoiseach, as Deputy C.J. Haughey, opposed it.  It is quite a sobering thought.  We need to remind ourselves that our present Taoiseach, as Leader of the Opposition at the time, opposed the Single European Act. Can we now have the confidence in the same man to lead us with conviction into the single market of Europe?  He is, after all, a man who a few years ago felt that the price of non-Europe was worth paying.  We just have to look to the NESC report before us to see exactly what that price of a non-Europe is.  They spell it out clearly; I do not have to regurgitate it here today.  But apparently, as Deputy C. J. Haughey, the Taoiseach thought the price of a non-Europe was worth paying, and he voted against the Single European Act.</P>
      <P>As we debate the excellent NESC report before us we must, as a result of what I have just said, be ever vigilant and concentrate on the contributions, particularly from the Government side, and look behind every word used to ensure that Deputy C. J. Haughey's or, as he is now, the Taoiseach, about turn on this vital issue is indeed just that, a road to Damascus conversion on the Single European market and not just opportunistic rhetoric, or, as I have heard used, economic spoof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to add my words of appreciation to NESC, a very distinguished body representing all sections of society, for the comprehensive manner they carried out their task.  Perhaps, for the record, we should indicate exactly what that task was and what their terms of reference were in carrying out the final outcome we have before us today.  They were requested by the Taoiseach in May <Col N="286" /> 1987 to undertake a project on Ireland and the European Community.  The terms of reference were as follows: firstly, to undertake an indepth study of Ireland's comparative performance in the EC, incorporating an assessment of the impact on Ireland of membership of the Community.  Secondly, to assess the problems and opportunities inherent in unification of the internal market. Thirdly, to put forward and evaluate the policy options available to help mitigate the problems, capitalise on the opportunities and consider what countervailing measures may be necessary.  The Taoiseach requested the NESC to undertake this project only a few short months after voting against our participation in the Single European Act, in other words our participation in an internal market post-1992.</P>
    <P>In response to those terms of reference NESC have provided us with a treasury of information on Ireland in Europe, past, present and, more important, to come. It is up to us as a nation to translate the words into action to ensure that Ireland will play a role indirectly proportionate to our size in the Europe of post-1992.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that Ceccini comes out of the NESC report rather negatively because up to now he was perhaps for some of us equivalent to the Bible.  Any time we discussed the Single Market or Europe post-1992 we would refer to the Ceccini report and quote from it.  He appeared to be some type of authority. NESC, perhaps, have deflated that balloon somewhat and my interpretations of the NESC references to Ceccini's findings are that they disagree to some extent with them.  NESC maintained broadly that the greater benefits from the completion of the internal market will accrue to areas already efficient and competitive while Ceccini found that the smaller or less developed member states would gain most.  There is quite a difference in view between both.</P>
    <P>As the internal market in itself will not lead to greater social and economic cohesion we must analyse carefully the report's findings on the doubling of the Structural Fund to £2.8 billion to Ireland <Col N="287" /> over the next four years.  The report's findings are, firstly, that even up at £2.8 billion the Structural Fund will still represent less than 0.5 per cent of Community GDP.  Secondly, since 1973 the Structural Fund's contributions to Ireland have failed to achieve any narrowing of the disparity between regional incomes and, thirdly, the increase in the Structural Funds does not guarantee that they will be most effective in the most disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>The NESC report casts serious doubt &mdash; I will go further &mdash; it points up the fact that the present level of structural funding support for the so-called objective one regions will not create economic convergence or remove social disparity within the Community.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister when she says that the social priority is resolving the problem of unemployment.  It begins and ends there because many of the other social problems we have in this country all spin from poverty and difficulties that are a direct result of the lack of availability of jobs.  The implications of this conclusion is that we will still belong to the slow lane in Europe, despite what the Minister had just said, unless immediate action is taken to target the Structural Funds directly to those areas and people it is intended for and, in the process, to achieve what has to be our goal, namely, to disquality ourselves from objective one status.  That is for Ireland no longer to be among the most peripheral and disadvantaged regions of the Community. To put it in a nutshell, our goal must be that once the four years of the doubling of the Structural Funds are over &mdash; and hopefully we will get more than 0.5 per cent and a higher <i>per capita</i> proportion than has been earmarked so far &mdash; and the people in Brussels sit down and look again at the various regions within the Community, Ireland will no longer qualify to be classified as an objective one region.  If that is so, we will all have done our job.  At the moment we are classified among the most disadvantaged and peripheral areas in Europe.</P>
    <P>There are many sectoral groups dealt <Col N="288" /> with by the excellent NESC report we are discussing today and I will turn my attention to just a few of them in no particular order of importance.  Confusion still abounds about our strategy, our drawing down from the doubling of the Structural Funds to the specific areas to allow us to compete on equal terms for free market access from 1 January 1993.</P>
    <P>We need a coherent approach, an approach that is programme-based rather than project-based.  We need infrastructure investment, not just a shopping list of individual capital projects.  It must be programme-based and, as one economic commentator put it some time ago, we need investment that will light economic fires and not just put money in on a once-off capital project with the economic spin-off dying once that project has been completed.</P>
    <P>Our entry to the European Community was sold to us in Ireland, above all, on the basis of the benefits that would accrue to our farmers and, indeed, the economic benefits from direct access to a market of 320 million consumers.  I recall at the time going around to meetings, trying to persuade the doubtful and those who did not quite believe that we were doing the right thing, that as a small open economy, dependent on exports and agriculturally based, we had to be in with Europe.  In 1971-72 and 1973 as we persuaded our colleagues, even then to most of us the price of not being in Europe was not one to contemplate.</P>
    <P>There was also a commitment to removing the economic and social disparities, particularly in the more peripheral regions, and we talked about that in the early seventies.  Today the rate of disparity between economic and social standards in this country and continental mainland Europe is as great as it was in 1973, notwithstanding the money that has come to this country from Europe. Farmers' expectations were shattered after the initial honeymoon period of a few years, particularly when we joined the EMS, and the green pound failed to be sufficiently price responsive and compensatory.  The Delors package for <Col N="289" /> the doubling of the Structural Funds to the backward regions &mdash; and I hope we will get far more than is indicated for us at present will probably be a once-off offer.  If we do not get it right now, if we do not have the mechanisms in place for targeting the help to the regions that need it most and to the people who need it most, we will not get a second chance as full and equal partners in Europe post-1993 to resolve our problems.</P>
    <P>There has been a perception, for some time perhaps, that the agricultural community are hard to please.  When we were out of Europe, we had our problems and when we are in Europe, we have problems. We have problems with price supports and production controls, and if all else fails, there are problems with the weather.  There is always some reason things are not right.</P>
    <P>Apart from looking at it lightly, we should analyse the situation.  Could the disquiet among the agricultural community be from the fact that they have seen their sons and daughters leave the land in droves over the last couple of decades?  Twenty-five thousand of them have gone during the past four years. Could it be because the analysts predict that 60,000 farms will disappear in the next decade, before the turn of the century?</P>
    <P>Even Brussels is concerned about the desertion in remote rural areas of this country.  We look to our present commissioner, Mr. Ray MacSharry, who has a role in rural development as well as his agricultural portfolio, to ensure that the huge problem of rural development is tackled, and this is quite different to the commercial agricultural problems that we look to the CAP and to him, as agricultural commissioner, to resolve.  Combating poverty is as much a rural as an urban issue and it must be clearly recognised as such.  Could the disquiet in the agricultural community be because of the ever-widening disparity in income between the dairy farmer with a viable quota and all other farm enterprises? Could it be because of the declining margins in beef and the poor margins in pig and poultry production?  Could it be <Col N="290" /> because of the bleak future for our cereal and tillage farmers?  Could it, perhaps, be because over 60 per cent of our farmers still have an income below £5,000?  Indeed, 15,000 farmers qualified for farmers' dole in this country.  We must use this golden opportunity presented with the doubling of the regional, social and FEOGA guidance fund by way of the Structural Fund, not only to close the economic disparity between ourselves and mainland Europe but also we must use it within our country between the different farm enterprises and different sections of society, and above all to ensure a future on the land for the backbone of this country, the family farm.</P>
    <P>There are many of us who fear for the future of the family farm and what it may hold and reading this report our fears are not allayed.  Is the concept recognised in Europe?  In strict agricultural policy, it is not.  One is talking about commercial and development farming there.  The future of the family farm and the resolving of the problems in the family farm lie far more in social policy than in agricultural policy.  Indeed, regional input will help in terms of infrastructural services, but I am afraid it is an area that because it straddles, if you like, two particular funds and two particular commissioners' portfolios, is not getting the attention it deserves.  There are very few of us in this House who are more than one generation removed from a small family farm somewhere in Ireland.  In any home in Ireland, either with one or both partners is only a generation &mdash; if that &mdash; removed from the land, and in most cases, from the small farm.</P>
    <P>In relation to agricultural concerns, and this whole area interpreting Common Agricultural Policy and the changes in CAP that come before us weekly, I would like to put on record my serious concern at the treatment by the board of Teagasc of the rural economy section.  This is the section of bureaucracy in Ireland that deals with and has the capacity to carry out our economic and social research in view of the rapidly changing CAP.  We have no agricultural institute.  We have decimated the rural economy section of <Col N="291" /> Teagasc, the only section fit to interpret the rapid changes coming from Europe for our agricultural sector.  Who is there left to advise, to analyse and to support the Minister in terms of the presentations he will make for the good of Ireland in this area?  This is an area which we must look at again another day: I will not dwell on it at any length here today; I accept it is only of peripheral interest to the report we are talking about, but if we are concerned about rural development, if we are concerned about the family farm in the context of post-1992 Europe, if we have no agricultural economic institute in this country and if we have decimated the rural economy section of Teagasc, the only section where there were qualified people to advise us in this particular area, how are we to help and direct the future of the Irish family farm?</P>
    <P>Under the Structural Fund's framework, as one of the most peripheral of the objective one regions, Ireland is classified as one single region for objective one status; we are region one as far as the Community is concerned.  Bearing this fact in mind, I would like to direct a few moments to the less favoured areas directive and how by using the Structural Fund we can not only remove economic and social disparities between various regions and between different communities within regions but how we must look to the Structural Fund, particularly the FEOGA guidance section, to compensate Irish agriculture for the rapidly changing CAP.</P>
    <P>As the various support structures, price supports and more production controls are put in place under CAP we will have to look to the Structural Fund to compensate Irish agriculture.  Headage payments under the less favoured areas directives are paid from the FEOGA guidance fund.  The present review, under the less favoured areas directive is being done by the economic unit in the Department of Agriculture and Food at the moment.  We have had the field officers survey, the desk survey, the Land Commission survey.  We will have it all on computer and eventually it will get to <Col N="292" /> Government before Christmas with the recommendations as to which areas will be brought in under the classification of disadvantaged areas status and which areas will be re-classified from less severely handicapped to more severely handicapped.  When all this is completed and with the Government before Christmas and when, some time in the New Year we have from Government their submission for Brussels in terms of the extension and reclassification of the areas of Ireland under the less favoured areas directive, only then will we know how we will be able to increase our draw down from the FEOGA guidance section. I favour headage payments above all as an income aid to marginal farmers or barely viable farmers or small farmers on marginal land, however one like's to describe the problems that exist on most family farms in most parts of Ireland today.</P>
    <P>This again will be our last chance to exploit the opportunities, to ensure a future for all our farmers, not just our commercial farmers.  I am calling again on the Minister to insist on the inclusion of the entire country in the reclassification of existing areas under the less favoured areas directive as part of the negotiations in terms of our draw down from the Structural Fund, as part of our compensation to farmers for the changing Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>If, from the point of view of Structural Funds, the whole of the country can be considered as one region, an objective one region, that is, one of the most peripheral and disadvantaged regions, it is logical to pursue that same argument in discussing the less favoured areas directive we should then be treated as one region under it also.  Why must we be redrawing borders now between marginal farmers and saying one is disadvantaged and one is not?  How can farmers above the road be that different to those below the road?  How can farmers one side of a river in Ireland be that different to farmers the other side of the river?</P>
    <P>There are parts of Ireland that are affluent; there are towns on the east coast that one would not consider peripheral <Col N="293" /> and disadvantaged in an economic and social sense, but still the whole country is being put in as one region under the Structural Fund because that, in the wisdom of those around the table in Brussels, is how they thought Ireland should be treated, as a single region.  I am saying to the Minister to ask the Government to ensure that Ireland is treated as one region under the less favoured areas directive and the particular review under that directive that is going on at the moment.  When it suits us, we are one region.  When it suits us, we are peripheral and disadvantaged economically and socially, when we can get as much as we can from Brussels.  I am saying it suits us on this occasion under the review of the less favoured areas directive to be also treated as one region and not draw borders around small areas in rural communities saying one is in, one is out, one will get headage payments, another will not.</P>
    <P>We are a very small country in the overall scheme of things at the European table.  If they want us as one region, and they are talking about the Structural Fund, if they consider us the most disadvantaged and peripheral of regions, I am saying that same criteria should apply to the less favoured areas directive.  They should classify the entire country as less favoured under the directive.  Areas that are already classified should be reclassified to more severely handicapped.  We would have saved a lot of time running around this country with all the submissions that have come in from the different communities in rural Ireland, with all the work that is going on in the economic unit of the Department of Agriculture and Food at the moment.  There will be a lot of heart searching at Government when it comes there, there will be a lot of cries for appeals from those sections that will be left out.  We will be fighting in Brussels to pursue the submission when it eventually gets there, and it could be another year or two before we know the outcome.</P>
    <P>Would it not be far more simple if we treated the country as one region, as we are treated under the Structural Fund. <Col N="294" /> Then, through FEOGA, which is a source of funding for headage payments under the less favoured areas directive, we will also compensate farmers and give them an income aid that will not depress their production.  We will give them an income aid in the Europe of post-1992 that will allow them to try to farm themselves out of their present problems and we will not be penalising them by reducing their headage payments if their income goes over a certain level.  The problems with the farmer's dole and that type of means tested payment is that if a farmer tries to farm himself out of his troubles he automatically penalises himself by disqualifying himself for dole.  The headage payment is a productive payment; the farmer is allowed to consider alternative uses of his land; he is allowed to farm his way out of trouble; we have a healthy, viable, rural economy and there is a future for the family farm.</P>
    <P>It could be said that since our membership in 1973 of the European Community there have been winners and losers.  Most of us welcomed Ireland's membership of the European Community at the time on the basis of the benefits to agriculture as promised at a time when our agricultural exports were almost entirely dependent on the British market.  Community membership offered substantial price increases in the doubling of agricultural income and unlimited markets.  They were the lines on which we sold it to this country.  At the time &mdash; the early seventies &mdash; agriculture represented 50 per cent of total exports so the consequences were not to be underestimated.</P>
    <P>Membership of the Community has turned out to be more traumatic then expected, especially for the sector we thought would benefit most, the agricultural sector.  In 1972 and 1973 Irish agricultural prices rose sharply because of international scarcities; but then in 1974 there was a sharp reversal because of higher costs and chaos in the cattle industry.  Prices quickly recovered up to 1978 and our farmers were at last realising the prices and income expectations of joining the Community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="295" /> If we look back and recall, in 1978 we became a full member, just as trouble in relation to agricultural surpluses raised its ugly head.  However, we were not unduly concerned because at the time we rationalised that the lower profit margins could be more or less counteracted by increased productivity.</P>
    <P>In March 1979 the European Monetary System was launched and Ireland joined. We did not expect this radical change in exchange rate policy to threaten agriculture. Again, we reasoned and rationalised that our inflation would have to fall to EMS levels making higher prices unnecessary, or that Irish currency would have to be devalued, giving us green £ increases to supplement prices in the Community as a whole.  In other words, we still thought matters would resolve themselves to suit our situation.  We were wrong.  Inflation did not fall in 1979 and 1980, nor was the £IR devalued within the EMS because of the revaluation of sterling at the time.  This spelt disaster for our farmers, with inflationary Irish costs and very modest EC price increases and, indeed, no green £ increase to bridge the gap.  In those two years &mdash; 1979 and 1980 &mdash; all the increased price benefits since joining the Community were wiped out and prices for agricultural produce across the board were below the 1970 levels. Downward pressure on prices actually continued until 1986 when three factors combined to reverse our fortunes.  First of all, inflation was at last under control. Second, there was an eight per cent devaluation of the £IR which caused green £ price increases here.  Third, the stronger dairy and beef market resulted directly from cutbacks in production following on the introduction of the milk quota.</P>
    <P>Presumably, from now on by maintaining our exchange rate within the EMS our real prices can expect to be in line with the EC average.  There is no doubt, however, that the greatest tragedy to date of EC membership is the manner in which exchange rates operated against Irish agriculture after joining the EMS in 1979. This is not often recognised.  If we had <Col N="296" /> the same price experiences as other states during 1978 and to the 1986 period, agricultural prices would now be 26 per cent higher than they are.  Farm incomes would be 50 per cent greater than they now are and agricultural exports would be worth £400 million more than they now are.  I dwell on the agricultural sector without apology because it was in relation to the benefit to this particular sector above all others that we sold the membership of the EC to the people of Ireland and yet that is their story in the 15 or 16 years since they have joined.  There are certainly winners and losers.  I am afraid we got a lot of money directly and indirectly through different support structures and price supports, but the net story is that we were losers in those years relative to the situation we were in before we joined.</P>
    <P>However, one may justly ask, if we had not gone in 1973 what would have happened to us, and there an even bleaker story can, in fact, be painted.  So, even though our expectations were not realised since we joined Europe in terms of the returns to the farming community and our food exports, we would have had a much sorrier tale to tell if we had even contemplated not joining Europe at the time.  The price of joining Europe, or at least the benefits from joining Europe, were not as much as we expected, but certainly the price of not being in Europe is something we could not have contemplated. Even now, with the wisdom of hindsight, we did the right thing. Europe is not interested in our unique problems.  To some extent our negotiators are isolated at the Brussels table as indeed are the negotiators from all the other individual states.  We must not forget that the agricultural industry sector is much more than the farming sector alone.  The upstream input supply industries and the downstream processing industries all have a national value added which is equivalent to all that is generated on the national farm. The state of farming is directly reflected in these linked sectors and they prosper and decline in line with farming itself.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding what I have said, we <Col N="297" /> have gained from the Common Agricultural Policy, if not to the extent we should have, even if we only consider what would have been if we had done otherwise.  Our gains have been on two fronts, first, from the FEOGA receipts from the market support operations and, second, from the trade gains from being able to sell into the EC market &mdash; 320 million consumers &mdash; at protected European Community prices.  In fact, the price of non-Europe, if we had opted for that &mdash; which none of us, certainly on this side encouraged back in the Seventies &mdash; farmers' relative incomes would be 15 per cent worse off than they are today.</P>
    <P>The benefits of the Common Agricultural Policy to Ireland are being threatened by the very necessary efforts to reform it, to control surpluses and the cost involved in their subsequent storage and disposal, whether it is intervention, aids to private storage schemes, or export refunds.  The choices facing us are effectively between price reduction or supply controls known as quotas.  It is very hard to be definitive as to which would be the best road for Ireland to travel.  There are different views as to what would be to our advantage.  Price control is more damaging to our economy as a whole but, on the other hand, there is market interference with quota controls. I suppose if pushed on it I would have to opt at this point in time and, for a short-term gain, for quota controls.  I know the free marketeers and those with a longer-term vision would reckon that price controls are in Ireland's greater interest.  My worry is how we will get from the present system to a system where we would only have price controls as a method of controlling production.  It would, indeed, let more younger people into the different agricultural enterprises. It would let more efficient people in.  It would be far more competitive which, in the long term, may be of interest.  There is for and against both systems and, indeed, that debate will continue.</P>
    <P>There is another area we must look at and, indeed, be mindful that our economic performance in the last two decades <Col N="298" /> is not solely a function of our membership of the Community; we must consider the two oil recessions, and the technological advances during that same period which have affected this country quite considerably. We must also consider the growing international anger at the EC agricultural expansion and the heavily subsidised EC produce on world markets. I refer to the whole discussion that is going on currently in the GATT round. This time next year this will be coming to a conclusion.  So far as one can ascertain the only major bone of contention is in relation to the price support and indeed the whole support structure for agriculture within CAP at the moment. America and the CAIRNS group of countries are pushing to liberalise agricultural trade.  They are particularly annoyed at our domestic and export refunds under CAP and indeed they want greater access to our markets.  They consider our ban on the use of growth promoters in cattle to be a technical trade barrier and they continue to insist that there is no scientific or health reason for that ban.  Indeed there is no evidence in that regard that growth promoters are damaging to humans on a scientific or health basis.</P>
    <P>The facts are that the European consumer at this point is demanding hormone free beef.  That is the regulation within Europe and it is causing difficulties I know for our colleagues in the United States but this, along with the many other issues, will have to be resolved before the conclusion of the present GATT round which will affect, quite drastically, the direction of agricultural policy within the common market in the years to come. Depending on who comes out on what side of the present argument at the GATT table we could have quite substantial changes in the Common Agricultural Policy in the years to come.  Even without the pressure from GATT there is a general reduction in the support structures generally all round in agriculture which will have a direct effect particularly on Irish agriculture.  We must be very vigilant and we must demand compensation <Col N="299" /> through the Structural Funds, particularly through FEOGA guidance, for the removal of the support structures and indeed the price supports under the CAP over the next few years.</P>
    <P>The control of agricultural surpluses had dominated the EC agenda since 1977 when the first steps were taken to resolve the problem.  The process has continued since then but at a slow pace because of the strong resistance of agricultural interests.  The imposition of the milk quota in 1984 was, however, a major achievement not only because of its immediate impact on milk production but because of its indirect effect on limiting dairy cow numbers and thereby beef production.</P>
    <P>The major remaining commodity which has not been brought under control is cereals.  There has been a US drought in each of the past two years and until this intervened effective control measures seemed unavoidable.  The American drought has, perhaps, postponed action on cereals until well into the nineties.  The immediate years ahead promise to be exceptionally prosperous ones for dairy farmers with viable quotas. In contrast, cattle farmers and pig and poultry producers are likely to experience even lower margins than those which have already prevailed.  There is some light on the horizon in the pig industry but they have a lot to catch up with.</P>
    <P>Down the road, cereal producers will have to face the adverse consequences of the surplus capacity.  Upstream and indeed downstream activity in farm inputs, supply and processing, will be constrained by the limits in farm production. We have talked long enough and often enough about the benefits for our food processing industry of the extended European market, of the internal market, of the greater access to the supermarket shelves.  If we limit farm production this will have a knock-on effect on our food processing.  Some expansion will take place.  The most critical issue in this country is the need to expand the beef cow herd, to produce more calves for beef production.  There will be some <Col N="300" /> expansion but because of the high capital and low profits involved the expansion is unlikely to be sufficient to offset the decline in dairy cows.</P>
    <P>In recent times we witnessed rationalisation and the rapidly changing structures within the co-operative movement. When we look to the Stock Market quotations the various other manoeuvrings that have been going on I wonder if farmers are sacrificing long term control of their own industry for short term monetary gain.  Again, there is a philosophy behind this that I do not know enough about to expound on here today but where is the whole philosophy behind the co-operative movement today?  I wonder what Horace Plunkett thinks of what has been going on in the last couple of years.</P>
    <P>Will we be left with what was intended in relation to the co-operative movement. They had to change.  There is no doubt that some of their practices were as antideluvian as you will find in any time.  They have to rationalise, they have to reduce their numbers but we must be sure that in the long term what they are doing is what allows sufficient farmer control which, if you like, is the very premise on which the co-operative movement was started.  If not, perhaps we do not need it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we should be more honest. Perhaps by farmers totally relinquishing their control they are doing the right thing.  If so, is it a co-operative movement, is it a co-op we are talking about any more?  That is for another day to tease out in more detail but it is all part of getting Ireland ready and getting our processing sector ready for the internal market in post 1992 to ensure that they can compete with the biggest, brightest and most competitive there will be in Europe.</P>
    <P>From the food sector point of view there will be extreme competition that they must be ready to avail of.  They must be very vigilant in relation to quality, price and the service they give.  They will need a European focus that is market driven and that will be a major challenge for our presently very fragmented food <Col N="301" /> industry.  We will see more joint ventures, partnerships, more rationalisation. Apparently in the Europe of post 1992 we will be talking about 100 major food companies in the Community each with an average sales of about £2 billion. These will dominate as will the multiples when it comes to the retail outlets.  Our policy in Ireland must be to ensure that our companies are fit to compete with the brightest and best and that from a marketing point of view every help and advice is given to them to ensure their access on to as many as possible of the supermarket shelves and the shelves of the multiples.</P>
    <P>While it is worth pointing out that our membership of the Community, as I have said, is not solely responsible for our economic performance we must ensure that those who will be leading the debate and be representing Ireland's interests during the current round of GATT talks are answerable to this House and indeed to the Dáil generally.  Some time ago I was shocked to realise that at a round of GATT meetings junior Ministers were sent over to represent the country.</P>
    <P>I have said that our membership of the Community will not be the sole function in relation to our economic performance in the years to come, as it has not been in the last decade and a half or so.  The negotiations going on at the GATT table at the moment will have an enormous bearing on the future of this country as it will impact profoundly on the Common Agricultural Policy.  We need assurances from the Minister today that representation at the highest level of Government will be given to our position and our negotiations at that table.</P>
    <P>The Minister actually dwelt at some length on the EMU, the Economic and Monetary Union.  That apparently is defined as co-operation in economic and monetary policy.  EMU follows naturally on the creation of the Single European Market.  If there are no barriers to the movement of money there cannot be different monetary or economic policies in different parts of what will then be a single economy.  It would not make any <Col N="302" /> sense.  The ECU or the European Currency Unit should then become a full parallel currency.  The ECU is being used already by the Soviet Union to fix prices on import contracts.  This gives stability which will be increased even further if the ECU becomes a means of exchange with the status of parallel currency.</P>
    <P>There are three phases in achieving EMU.  The first involves all EC countries being involved in the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS together with greater convergence and co-ordination of economic policies throughout the Community. At this point the UK refuses to join the EMS until it has its inflation under control though it does now broadly support EMU.  The first phase, having all the countries in the EMS, will be followed by the establishment of the parallel currency and finally the establishment of a Community Central Bank.  This is quite controversial and we are looking quite far down the road and there is no need to dwell in much detail on it today.  We must acknowledge the fact that that is where we are heading.</P>
    <P>On 24 October when he was speaking on this motion in the Dáil, the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>In my discussions with President Mitterrand last Friday, I reiterated our view that EMU could not work without convergence.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was referring to economic convergence &mdash; EMU could not work without convergence.  We read, however, in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 7 November last that at a meeting of Foreign Affairs Ministers on the day before, 6 November, Jacques Delors signalled that the establishment of economic convergence within the Community was not a prerequisite for the creation of monetary union.  Our Taoiseach insists that economic convergence is a prerequisite for economic monetary union, Jacques Delors says it is not.  Given the emphasis on the Minister of State's speech on EMU today &mdash; I welcome her emphasis on it &mdash; and the Taoiseach's other brief reference to it in the Dáil a few weeks ago, and the differences that have since appeared <Col N="303" /> between the Taoiseach's view on EMU and Jacques Delors', we need a fuller explanation as to what the Government's true position is and what differences exist on this issue of EMU which, after all, is inevitable.  There are differences between Brussels and the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>In the same report in <i>The Irish Times</i> the Minister for Foreign Affairs is quoted as saying that he is reaffirming Ireland's support for EMU based solely on the Delors model.  The Delors model, apparently, considers that economic convergence within the Community is not a prerequisite whereas the Taoiseach says it is.  We are further confused.  Apparently the Minister for Foreign Affairs agrees with Jacques Delors but the Taoiseach does not.  I ask the Minister, when replying to the debate to tell us whose line do we follow, what is the Government's policy in relation to EMU?</P>
    <P>I notice, even though the Taoiseach dwelt for some time on indirect taxation, the Minister today did not give much time to it.  This is a vexed question.  It is perhaps one of the areas we have been aware of for some time impinging on us. There are questions all along &mdash; will the internal market mean that cars are cheaper, will there be VAT harmonisation? The debate has come down the road a little in recent times because we have had Commissioner Schrivener stating that she will not insist on equalisation of VAT bands or indirect tax bands throughout the Community states, if I paraphrase her correctly.  We are now into expressions such as &ldquo;tax approximation&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;harmonisation&rdquo;. This is a rather clever move on her part because if we are talking about an internal market with no barriers of any kind, the movement of goods, services, people and money, it will be in the interest of each individual State to ensure that their VAT levels or indirect tax levels are as low as possible so that they are as competitive as possible within the market. She has spotted that there is probably no need for her to tell us to reduce our top level of VAT to 17 per cent.  If our neighbours are selling at 14 per cent and <Col N="304" /> we are still at 25 per cent we cannot survive so we have got to come down. We will do it ourselves.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the whole vexed area of VAT and indirect tax on clothing, food and the various other areas will be left to individual Governments' discretion if I interpret the present position rightly.  If we do not impose it &mdash; I know there is a strong feeling in this country that we should not &mdash; we will have to make up the shortfall in revenue from somewhere else.  Again, very cleverly, Madame Schrivener has left that to us and to the other individual Governments to make those choices for ourselves.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister of State could resolve a problem for me.  What is this we read of suggestions that, even though the frontiers in Europe will be down, the frontier between the North and South of Ireland will still remain, that we will still have a land frontier and customs post?  Is that factually correct?  I believe the Danes will have a similar arrangement with their contiguous neighbours as well.  In other words, we will have an internal market, no trade barriers, no fiscal or physical barriers of any kind, with the exception between the North and South of Ireland and perhaps between the Danes and their neighbours.  I hope that is incorrect.  I read it recently.  There are 30,000 customs officers employed in the European Community at the moment.  When will somebody tell them what their future holds?  When will somebody indicate if we will need them in the future?  We have them in Ireland.  We have them in Rosslare Harbour.  Apart from customs officers we have clearance agents.  We have the Revenue Commissioner officials and nobody has indicated to them what the future post-1992 will hold.  Is it not time we now indicated to them whether they will be needed, whether their job description will change?  Perhaps they will be on coastal patrols, perhaps they will be on arms and security work, drugs, public health, plant and animal health. What is going to happen to the sanitary regulations post-1992?  What line are we taking in all that area?  Will we need these men and women who are now working <Col N="305" /> as customs officials, and generally in the whole area of customs and import and export, at our ports of exit?  Will we need any of them in the future?  The Government are about to launch an AEP &mdash; automated entry processing &mdash; system for customs clearance and what they call DTI &mdash; direct trader input &mdash; also in the customs clearance area; there is a trial run for a computerised system involving millions of pounds scheduled for next year and it is to be introduced by 1991. How does that equate to an internal market with no barriers and no frontiers? What will they be inputting?  Automated entry processing for what?  Even if we could understand whether statistical data would need to be collected or whether they were just keeping an eye on the revenue that was flowing in and out of the different States or whatever, there is a huge area here where there has been an ominous silence.  Will legislation be necessary for AEP?  We need answers to these questions because there are different constituencies in our country, and indeed in other Community countries, who have been forgotten in the overall greater debate to the approach of 1993 and beyond.</P>
    <P>In relation to cars the debate is over. We have speculated long enough, though all of us in our hearts and souls knew that the price of cars would not suddenly be reduced in this country to the mean price that pertains in the rest of continental Europe.  Now we all know that VAT can be applied in the country of registration, in other words, the motor trade know where they go, so they continue as heretofore. We have waited a long time to be told that that will be the procedure.  The motor trade waited a long time.  In fact, the trade was distorted for a long time in the expectation that we would get half price cars.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the European campaign.  There was some evidence about eight months to a year ago of efforts on behalf of the Government to make the different sectoral interests aware of gearing themselves up to take maximum advantage of the Europe of post-1992.  I am afraid that, despite the <Col N="306" /> Minister's assurances in her speech and the various committees and standing groups she refers to, there appears to be little evidence on the street, among the sectoral groups that should now be preparing, of the effort from the Government. Perhaps we could step all that up a gear because in other countries everyone is aware of exactly what the implications of 1992 will mean to them.  They have been gearing themselves for the last three years.  They have been gearing their education system, they have been gearing the output of their graduates towards the demands that will be made on them in 1992.  As far as I am aware, we have not had the same effort here at all.  It certainly has not been evident.  The views of the different sectoral interest are that the effort has not been evident.</P>
    <P>In relation to manufacturing industry, the European Community has impacted here extremely heavily.  The removal of trade barriers to date has caused a major reduction in indigenous industry.  Indeed, those that have survived are perhaps healthier, stronger, more competitive and have increased their exports dramatically but there has been a huge price to pay in relation to major indigenous industry.  This decrease in indigenous industry has been coupled with the great increase in the number of foreign firms establishing here to achieve, if you like, a foothold in Europe especially with 1992 in mind.  We welcome that.  We welcome all the firms that come here, that bring with them certain skills and give employment to our people.  At the end of the day it is all about ensuring that we have a quality of life in this country where having gone through an education system that will send our children and our young adults out into the Europe of post-1992 in a position to be able to use their talents, to be able to find jobs for their particular talents and qualifications and that those who choose to go abroad, who choose to go to Europe for experience, can come back to Ireland and find a job here if they wish to do so.  The real tragedy of our emigration has not just been that we have no jobs or not suitable jobs or that our tax rates have been too high and so have <Col N="307" /> driven people out.  The real tragedy has been that there is no room for those who want to come back with the experience they may have gained elsewhere.</P>
    <P>As an island nation we have always had to live to a greater or lesser extent with the problem of emigration.  It has been exacerbated because of Government policies over the years at different times. It has been exacerbated by certain economic policies and by a certain callousness on behalf of different and successive Governments.  The real tragedy is when the young people with their experience and with the benefit they could give back to our country cannot find a place back home when they want to come back.</P>
    <P>We must be and &mdash; I borrow the phrase &mdash; pro-active in our approach to the Europe of post-1992, not reactive.  The Ireland I want to belong to as a full and equal member of the European Community must not be part of the second lane in Europe.  We must not be part of the slow lane in Europe.  As far as I am concerned there is one lane in Europe and Ireland is up there contributing in an indirect proportion to our size to the formation of the Europe of the nineties. As I have said earlier, the planning, the programming, the reporting, the dissemination of information in relation to Ireland in Europe post 1992 will only be a success if it disqualifies us from the objective one criteria we are now in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Lyons and earlier the Minister of State, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.  I would like to congratulate her for what was a very comprehensive report to us on the NESC report on Ireland in the European Community. That publication has been available for two months approximately.  I believe it will be seen as a very serious, responsible and authoritative document. It will also be seen as a very influential document which will be important in any debate on Ireland's role or on Ireland's future input into the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can be said in a broad way &mdash; indeed this is recognised in the NESC report &mdash;<Col N="308" /> that if proper decisions are not made to correct regional imbalances then the opportunity to establish economic and monetary union will be seriously damaged. The aim of the Community should be to become the single most powerful economic unit in the world.  If it makes the right decisions on the area of economic and monetary union, it can become a reality.  Of course, central to this particular aspiration must be the development of policies which will improve standards right across all regions of the Community.</P>
    <P>The structural funding that we have been debating will be vital in this area throughout the Community and for Ireland, too, it will be of vital significance. I have been of the view that despite the fact that there has been a lot of debate there has also been a lot of misunderstanding regarding the regional aspects of the National development plan and the Government's submission in support of our application for assistance from the Structural Fund.</P>
    <P>The Government from an early date established that all of the 26 counties of this State would be treated as one region. This philosophy has never been in any way called into question by the Commission or by any of our European partners. This certainly represents to me a very sensible and a very logical approach to the problem.  We have a population of just over three million people.  In other European countries such as Spain and France there are regions with populations in excess of 11 million people.</P>
    <P>Even though the concept that Ireland should be one region has been accepted and acted upon, the Government have gone a stage further on their own initiative without pressure from the Commission, and decided to draw up the national development plan to further break it down into seven sub-regions and to carry out extensive and detailed consultations with economic and social interests in the sub-regions.  While nothing like this was required by the Commission, the Government decided this was the right way to do it.  There has been general acceptance that this has <Col N="309" /> been the right way to do it.  This is in line with the firm definite regional policy implemented by the Government which includes decentralisation of the public service, the establishment of regional airports, roads, tourism and many other areas.</P>
    <P>Our specific initiative in regard to sub-regional consultation was publicly welcomed by the Commission.  They were impressed with it and they congratulated us.  For the first time in the preparation of a national economic plan ideas for various projects and various developments were sought from every area.  A proper structural manner has been established for subsequent inclusion in the overall national plan.  I believe it was a right approach.  It is wrong for anybody to suggest, as there has been some suggestions, that there was a lack of consultation at sub-regional level.  This is not the case at all.  Wearing my local authority hat, I can certainly say that many local public representatives were disappointed at not having an input into the working group.  They were, of course, involved in the advisory group.  The bottom line is that it has been a great success story.  The total support to Ireland over the next five years will be in the region of £3 billion.  That by any standards is a success story.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to get political about this. The previous speaker introduced politics on a few occasions I would have to say to the previous speaker that the previous Government &mdash; the Coalition of Labour and Fine Gael &mdash; did precious little in regard to plans for the structural funding. My information is that there was not a piece of paper ready when the last Fianna Fáil Government took over.  They were simply not in the picture.  When Mr. Haughey came into Government he set about devising policies which were going to be appropriate to the needs of the future and in time his role in the whole bargaining of the structural funding will be acknowledged, not now but in time to come, as a real success story.  Despite what Senator Doyle said, the fact is that we have got a very good deal indeed.  I do not think it is economic spoof.  What <Col N="310" /> happened was practical, hard bargaining, well organised Government who went about their business at the highest level. There was some criticism of that.  Of course Junior Ministers have to go to Europe but on this issue it was conducted at the highest possible level, at meetings all over Europe.  Despite some criticism by the media, and by other political parties the fact is that for 5 per cent of the population we are getting 10 per cent of the fund.  That has to be a success story. My criticism of the Government is that they are not telling the people the great success story it is.  It is a success story because this will be the biggest development budget this country will ever see.  It is proof positive that our system, our way of negotiation, was the best possible at the time and that the Government handled the entire negotiations in an excellent and competant manner.  No, Senator Doyle, it is not economic spoof.  It is a fact of life.</P>
    <P>I criticise the Government for not standing up and telling the people of Ireland the excellent deal they got. Remember the north of Ireland got a mere £500 million.  Some comparisons have to be made.  I do not like making comparisons because we should stand on our own feet.  But five per cent of the population has got 10 per cent of the fund.  That, to me, is a success story.</P>
    <P>In relation to the NESC report the analysis in the report on Ireland's economic performance since joining the Community focuses attention on how we as an economy and as a society have responded to the challenge that has been posed by our membership.  In particular it focuses on our economic policy.  It is an issue of critical importance in this context. Given that the Community is now firmly committed to greater cohesion between all regions of the community the NESC report evaluation of our performance to date gives us clear guidance for a strategy which will ensure that our policies and actions and those of the Community can achieve the state objective of cohesion.  It has put us in very good light.  It is clear that the Community have a high regard for the type of policies <Col N="311" /> that we as a Government over the last two and a half years purused, the kind of Government we gave and the kind of confidence we have created.</P>
    <P>I did not intend to comment on agricutlure but Senator Doyle referred to it at length.  I know the Senator has a particular interest in this area.  Having looked through and examined the NESC report the main thrust of it in regard to the whole agriculture and food area is the need for long-term policies to be decided at national level.  However, the plain fact is that much of the decision making on agriculture policy takes place at community level.  I believe that our Government will do and must do their utmost to have EC policies which are fully supportive of Irish farmers and which are very relevant to the problems of the Irish farming community.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to confusion regarding EMU.  She talked about what the Taoiseach said, what Mr. Delors said and what Mr. Collins said. I agree that there might be elements of contradiction or confusion but the fact is that at Community level EMU is still at a very early stage.  The ultimate form of economic union will be determined by much detailed negotiations which have yet to take place.  For that reason the findings in the NESC report are obviously timely and very relevant.  When the time comes the Government will have a very positive approach to EMU and will work for its accomplishment.</P>
    <P>On the social dimension which has been referred to briefly by the previous speaker, NESC consider that the development of the single market merits considerable and more urgent attention, that this dimension is especially significant for small, less developed economies like Ireland and that the active development of specific policies which are implicit in the social dimension would contribute to the stability and the cohesion of the Community as a whole. I would agree that this whole social dimension is of vital importance to this country.  Certainly for us the most important social dimension is the creation of <Col N="312" /> sufficient jobs to meet the needs of our people.  As a Government we have stressed this crucial aspect in the past.  We will have to continue for a long time to do so. Our priority is to translate the economic growth into increased employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the French proposal to initiate ministerial discussions on employment.  I am pleased that he indicated that this would be continued, as I would anticipate it would be, by Deputy Haughey when he succeeds to the Presidency on 1 January.  This French proposal is a very important useful initiative. At the same time we want the Community of 1993 to be one in which conditions of employment will be further improved.  The last link in the chain of economic recovery is the creation of jobs. There is evidence for that in England and other countries.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government have performed very well to restore the kind of confidence that is necessary in the economy to create jobs.  There is much evidence of this over the past two and a half years.  We have learned from the past.  We adopted a policy of reducing current Government expenditure which, in turn, brought about lower interest rates and we had a low inflation rate.  Admittedly they are going up somewhat now but the very thrust of the previous Government's work and their commitment to improving the public finances was important and will have beneficial results in the future for this country in the area of job creation.</P>
    <P>A vital question for us will be in the area of harmonisation of indirect taxes in the Community.  NESC suggest that without frontier controls we would be forced by market pressures to move to the UK excise and the UK VAT rates. This I would regard as being a worrying feature of the report.  It would be very serious for us.  It could result in an annual loss of revenue of something in the region of £600 million.  Certainly if this were the case, it would play havoc with our economic strategy; it would play havoc with any attempt to carry out tax reform and it would generally damage the economic prospects for this nation. <Col N="313" /> We must be allowed to continue as we have been doing.  The Government should be endeavouring to do this, to continue the present economic policy which is, I believe, very fundamental, the very basis of our recent economic recovery.  The Commission must recognise our position and must be informed at every opportunity of the real problems that this could present for us.  They must tackle this problem and bring about proposals which will allow us to benefit from the events of 1992 and to continue with the kind of principles of economic growth which we are at present enjoying.  It is a lengthy, important report and one could talk on it for a very long time indeed.</P>
    <P>I would certainly like to welcome what we have received from NESC and to congratulate those responsible for bringing out this important report.  It is a very complex matter and issues raised are very complex indeed.  They have analysed it in great depth and I believe that it will form the basis of much serious discussion in the future in the European Community. I congratulate them.  It is a serious attempt to examine this problem and certainly it is one that will help to generate much debate on this important topic for Ireland in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate concering the NESC report regarding Ireland's performance in the European Community. I would like to start by complimenting the National Economic and Social Council on this report.  We have been a member of the Community since 1973 and it is certainly time to take stock of where Ireland stands in the context of the Community. I regard the document as a remarkably fine production which can lead to substantial debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, NESC is not the Government.  I think there is a tendency in recent years for people to believe that Governments are opting out of Government and that these expert committees are effectively the Government.  Of course, they are not.  This is simply a basis for discussion and there are some <Col N="314" /> conclusions with which I would take issue.</P>
    <P>The report deals virtually entirely with an economic commentary.  There are other aspects of Ireland's involvement in the European Community which it could have addressed within the context of the terms of reference set for it by the Taoiseach. We could talk about a lot of psychologically issues; the advancement of politics in this country, the advantage psychologically to us all in the political arena and in the Civil Service through involvement in a much wider arena than prior to 1973 but we are not going into that today.</P>
    <P>The report is somewhat negative in tone because it points out that despite membership of the Community and despite the funds flowing to the country from the Community there are still severe problems, that in most sectors under review we have not benefited to the extent that might have been thought to be the case before we became a member in 1973.  Having said that, I do not believe the report's negative conclusions in some areas should detract from the merits of being a member of the Community because obviously negative thinking might beg the question as to whether this country should be a member of the European Community.  Of course the negatives, if you look at it in that regard, are appalling.  Where would this country be today without the Common Agricultural Policy support price mechanism, without the funds coming in through the Social Fund, without the limited funds in the regional sector and in the industrial sector?  It is not just a question of price mechanism or subsidies.</P>
    <P>The very fact that we are a member of a Community with a population of 320 million people to whom we have duty-free access has been the springboard for major industrial development which has occurred in this country in the past 15 to 16 years.  It is probably pertinent as well when we look at our problems today to remember the kind of problems this country had in the fifties, sixties and in the early seventies, the appalling level of emigration we had in the past, the type <Col N="315" /> of protectionism by which we tried to build up industry, especially in the textile sector, most of which folded prior to entry to the European Community, the huge numbers leaving farmlands and moving into the cities.  Putting matters into perspective, we are not all that badly off and the right decisions were made by the Government prior to 1973 in relation to entry and in the referendum.</P>
    <P>The report points to the earlier benefits we had from 1973 to 1980 but in relative terms it is able to point out that while gross domestic product in those few years increased by about 4 per cent, measured in other terms we were into a diminishing situation.  While gross domestic product might have increased by 4 per cent, we had much lower levels of growth in gross national product.  In 1973 to 1979, it was 3.4 per cent as against 4.3 per cent in the previous decade.  Gross national product when adjusted for terms of trade was only 2.2 per cent as against 4.8 per cent in the years 1960 to 1973.  Gross national disposable income was down from 4.9 per cent in the sixties to 2.8 per cent in the mid-seventies.  Thus in other regards there were huge problems in this country at the time of entry.</P>
    <P>We were probably unfortunate that our entry occurred at the time of the oil crisis which obviously disturbed what the wealthier States in Europe might have agreed to at that time.  I think a particular sufferer was the Regional Fund because those of us who, like me, live in the west had great expectations at that time that involvement in Europe meant a fundamental commitment to poorer regions, that this would lead to a major shifting of funds into the regions of the Community such as that in which I lived but, of course, that never happened.  That was one of the major disappointments and that is an issue which I will have something to say about later.</P>
    <P>The report points out that unemployment increased in this country from 66,000 in 1973 to 100,000 in 1978 so we are still experiencing major problems.  In the industrial sector, the report takes a fairly negative view of things.  We have <Col N="316" /> had few of our expectations realised.  We have still had the major closing of industries in the country.  We have had very little indigenous industrial development, if you compare it to a country like Finland, for example, which was decimated in the Second World War, on which war debts were levied, which has poor climatic conditions, and which today is one of the most thriving countries in the world.  They have had laws in the industrial sector which would not permit industrial investment in Finland by companies from outside unless there was a majority Finnish shareholding in such companies.</P>
    <P>The contrast with what is happening there and in this country is very sharp. We have very few indigenous Irish manufacturing companies.  Even the major Irish manufacturing companies, the major achievers today which are Irish based and have some facilities here, are achieving the vast proportion of their growth abroad, and some of them in the context of policy simply do not want to invest in this country because of some of the problems that obtain here.</P>
    <P>Of course, we have had industrial development as a consequence of European Community membership.  It has been very substantial.  Where I live we are beneficiaries of major foreign investment. It is very good to see and these companies are very welcome but there is very limited Irish equity participation in the industrial sector as a consequence of this policy.  NESC reports in particular that where it had been thought originally that major foreign investment would become self-sustaining and would lead to complexes of linked manufacturing activity, this has not really occurred. Again it is part of the problem.  If you have a head office in New York, in Tokyo or in Paris and if the pinch is felt, the subsidiary in a particular country such as Ireland can suffer.  It is not all rosy in the garden in that particular sector.</P>
    <P>We have very strong structural problems here still.  The report refers to the public debt in this country as it relates to other countries within the European Community.  It points to the fact that the Irish public debt is double the <i>per capita</i><Col N="317" /> average in ratio to GNP, it is the second highest in ratio to gross national product in the entire Community.  We are standing at 118 per cent.  Next to us is Italy with 96 per cent and the average in the Community is 60 per cent.  The public debt in this country is double the European average.  This, of course, presents problems for the Government and those of us in politics in the country.  It points to the disparities in gross domestic product.  In 1988 in gross domestic product we held 52 per cent of the European Community average, again against the background where Denmark were on about double that at 109 per cent and where in the entire Community only Portugal and Greece had a gross domestic product of European Community average of a lesser level than this country.</P>
    <P>In the development of the internal market the report refers to taxation and to the necessity for rationalisation.  I think this is a huge factor inhibiting development in this country at the present time. The closest link we have within the Community is with our neighbours in the United Kingdom.  What we have developing in this country at the present time is a huge voluntary emigration in addition to involuntary emigration because of the huge disparities in personal income tax levels on these islands. It reaches the point where certain people working in certain sectors would want to be outstanding patriots to leave well paid jobs across the water where taxation levels are running at about half the levels that obtain here.  Unless this Government and future Government take very strong measures to rationalise this, there is a huge disincentive built into the system which will mitigate, in my view, against the development of this country.</P>
    <P>The situation is very serious in the west at the present time.  The development of Knock Airport has been a huge unqualified success.  One of the major factors of its success this year and last has been the enormous level of emigration from the western counties to England, Scotland and Wales.  I applaud the fact that that airport exists because it is leading to a much more palatable type of emigration <Col N="318" /> because for many of our people it is the time spent travelling to the west of Ireland from London rather than money, that is important.  Now, they can come back four, five or six times a year instead of once a year or once every two years. That is a very healthy development.  It is reaching the stage in the most practical terms, where for large numbers of people who come from my area their effective capital at the moment is London, not Dublin.  They are closer in time to London and that is where the job markets are and that is the base to which they look.  They see London more often than they see Dublin, Dublin might be the political capital as far as they are concerned but their economic capital is London.  It is deplorable that this is happening to the extent it is happening.</P>
    <P>Concerning the agricultural sector, the report stresses the fact that if you look at price mechanism or if you look at price support across the board, or in the regional sector, or the social policy sector, or the industrial sector, or the agricultural sector, the outstanding bonus for Ireland, the huge unmitigated bonus where we are concerned &mdash; although some of our partners in the Community might not agree &mdash; has been the price support in the agricultural sector through the Common Agricultural Policy.  It has been of great significance and has had profound significance for the rural community in this country allied to the market stability of guarantees of markets for produce which as a farming community we did not have before.  While I welcome the type of support which we are receiving nationally, given my background in west Mayo where the average size farm is about 20 acres, I see the Community with more warts than people living in Meath or north Cork or Wexford might do for example.  I can see the continuing problems we have in many regions within this country.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have contested Seanad elections have travelled the length and breadth of this land, and have gone from places like Dingle or Westport, and when we go on to the good grass, we see great wealth.  We welcome that coming into <Col N="319" /> this country.  Having said that, this report refers to the fact that what they describe as the most significant problem in the agriculture sector in Ireland is the persistance in low incomes.  There are huge anomalies here.  We have globally huge sums of money coming into this country annually, but we are getting far from even distribution due to the nature of the funds.  They go on to point out that the disparities in income in the agriculture sector instead of narrowing have widened since 1973.  What this means is that for the smallholder on the 20 to 30 acre farm, instead of European Community membership being good for him in relative terms, a huge gap has developed between the type of income he can earn on that small holding and the income that can be earned in many other parts of this country.  I have to submit that that is a very unhealthy situation.</P>
    <P>The report refers to the persistence of low incomes and the narrow base of the progressive sector.  It goes on to say that this reveals the existence of very severe structural and other problems.  It is because of these structural and other problems that you have this haemorrhage of emigration from the west of Ireland continuing today unabated and apace. The reason is that when you analyse it, and when you analyse where the price support funds in the agricultured sector are going, all of the increased output has been provided by about 25 to 30 per cent of the farms.  This is a staggering figure. When you analyse what is good about membership of the Community, when you look at the price support coming in and when you see the huge proportion of price support coming in a specific sector and when we find, in an analysis of the rural community, that the vast bulk of that has been going to 25-30 per cent of farms, there is reason to concentrate on what is happening in the regional policy sector for these structural reasons.</P>
    <P>The report points out that agricultural support per farmholder is very limited&mdash; and, again, it is for the reasons I mentioned. It is interesting to note, as the report does, that agricultural support per <Col N="320" /> farmholder here, despite what we are told about the level of support for Ireland, the level of support for agriculture and the breaking down of the disparities, is on average well below the level of support going into the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Denmark and Belgium.  This is because price support is coming in by price mechanism only and we have not addressed the structural problems.</P>
    <P>When one talks about structures one is going into the whole area of regional policy, and in the remainder of my speech I wish to refer to these regional policy issues, on which I have quite strong views, some of them political.  Senator Fallon accused Senator Doyle of talking about politics and then went on to talk about politics.  But this is a political Chamber and, as long as we discuss matters in good spirit, we have to talk about politics, because we were elected to this Chamber to talk about political issues.</P>
    <P>We are talking about 1992 &mdash; the leadin to an internal market, the removal of physical barriers, the removal of technical barriers and the removal of fiscal barriers.  NESC point out &mdash; and it is salutary to note this &mdash; that before we ever get into an internal market, or before we ever approach what is supposed to happen in 1992, there are huge discrepancies developing; and already, without ever getting into that, regional disparities in income in the Community are at least twice as wide as in the United States of America.  USA is quite comparable to the Community, because it is its own community with an amalgam of states; it is a large size, with a large population, and some very poor regions with low income.  Despite that, disparity in incomes in the European Community is more than twice as large as in the United States and the differences in unemployment levels are three times as wide.</P>
    <P>Against that background, we are going into the internal market.  With the removal of physical barriers, technical barriers, fiscal barriers, with the building up of infrastructural improvements, which are two-edged weapon &mdash; if you build up great transportation facilities to <Col N="321" /> the south-west, the west and the north-west, you are building up infrastructure to bring goods in as cheaply and as easily as it is to get them out &mdash; discrepancies will widen.  The report goes on to mention that the advent of the internal market will facilitate the movement of resources to areas of greatest economic advantage, which means to the centre again.  The completion of this internal market will widen existing discrepancies between the regions, will widen existing discrepancies between the regions of the Community.</P>
    <P>With two-thirds of the farming community not benefiting hugely from the funds coming in, with massive disparities in income already, at least twice as wide as the United States, the difference in unemployment being three times as wide and the fact that the internal market is going to heighten these huge existing discrepancies, there has to be a balanced policy from the Community.  It is for that reason that the Community is supposedly committed to a structural fund.  The Structural Fund is dealing with structures, with people, life styles, incomes, pensions and so on; but the problem is that this is the fund which is going to help break down these barriers.  Those of us who live in the lesser developed regions of this country must be very wary of this internal market unless we see the Community building up the kind of structures that can help our regions to survive in this future European world.  From what we see in the context of policy there is no evidence to suggest that there is a strong political will within the Community to help the regions similar to that which I live in to a fraction of the extent that we would wish.</P>
    <P>NESC goes on to point out that, in so far as the Regional Fund is concerned, the scale is tiny.  In the context of the Community's gross domestic product the funds committed to the Regional Fund at present are 0.07 per cent of the gross domestic product of the Community.  It is infinitesimal.  It is quite unacceptable if this is supposed to be the solution structurally for these regions of our country which are going to face huge problems with the advent of 1992 and the internal <Col N="322" /> market.  The report quotes from a report of the Community in 1983 which states that &ldquo;the effectiveness to remove these disparities because of these limitations has been severely limited&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In relation to the regional policy sector, in which I have a particular interest, and to what might happen within the Community, there is a new approach within the Commission, within the regional sector, which I welcome.  I am one of those who welcomes a far greater input in the decision-making process by the Community and a lesser input into decision-making by a national Government here in certain sectors such as regional policy.  I say that in the most apolitical sense, regardless of what Government might be in, because I think that in some of the lesser developed regions we will get a better deal with a bigger European input.  The new European Community approach on regional policy is under five main headings.  The first is to seek a more active European Community role. Unlike Senator Fallon, I am not going to throw bouquets to the Government for their marvellous activity in getting regional funds and all that goes with it.  I am not just saying this because Fianna Fáil are in Government, but that type of complacency is unhelpful to us in Brussels. If people in Brussels get the idea that we are all patting ourselves on the back here for a marvellous job being done, that is not much of an incentive for the people in Brusells to come up with more than is on the table at present.  I would like Commissioner Millan to know that I welcome a more active European Community role in regional policy.</P>
    <P>The second point they seek within the Commission, and this has been agreed by the Council, is a reduction in national quotas and more distribution of funds by the European Community rather than their being based on national priorities. I would like the Commissioner for Regional Policy to know that, as an Irish Senator, I welcome that also.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, they seek that funds should go into development programmes and not simply projects &mdash; and I welcome that too.  The fact that programmes have not <Col N="323" /> been adequately developed is one of the major issues of contention at present between the European Community and the Government.</P>
    <P>They also seek that the regional impact of other Community policies be monitored and taken into account.  I welcome that approach because on analysis, and as somebody living west of the Shannon, I look at where the agricultural money is going, where the Social Fund money is going, that rural areas are designated as eligible for top regional funds and that major funds are going to the cities, which I welcome, but I want to speak on issues in relative terms.  In Counties Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan, Longford, Mayo, Sligo, Roscommon and west Kerry, any analysis in the broadest sense of where Community moneys are going will highlight special needs.  Therefore, I welcome it for that reason.</P>
    <P>The fifth point they make, which again is a policy statement, is that regional development programmes should be integrated and that they should build up as a result of consultations between the Community, national Governments, sub-national agencies, that, collectively, it should be co-ordinated and that the resources should be concentrated in the most disadvantaged areas.  I want to tell the Commissioner for Regional Policy that I welcome all of these approaches.</P>
    <P>This leads us to what is a contentious issue, the present approach in this country to future regional fund policy based on these yardsticks.  Successive Governments have designated all of this country a single region to avail of regional funds &mdash; I would take issue with that, but I do not want to develop the point unduly here.  I would submit that, if you build up two or three other regions where there are gross disparities and all that goes with them, it is a useful levering process to highlight particular problems.  As well as that, the major present contention is that, in so far as funds for Ireland under regional policy are concerned, the Government in March produced the national development plan and this plan was the basis of its submission to Brussels for support under the sector.</P>
    <P>The Commission have been stressing <Col N="324" /> that what they seek is sub-national input into such plans and the following up of plans by the submission of programmes which would be detailed and integrated in the regions.  It appears that, Ireland's plan was submitted to Brussels but the programmes were never submitted.  It seems that the structure of decentralised Government in this country is very different from that which obtains in most other members states in the Community, where we have an extremely centralised administration in the Department of Finance, the rein is held very tight and there is extremely limited input from the regions into these plans and programmes.</P>
    <P>I believe the consultations were quite inadequate.  Seven sub-regional reports, I gather, were collated subsequent to the plan.  My understanding is that these sub-regional reports, which might be in the nature of programmes, were not even sent to Brussels.  What made people in the regional policy sector irate was that they got an initial plan which was entirely global but which did not break down sufficiently specifically or in an integrated fashion what it thought.  These sub-regional reports were produced but they have not even gone to Brussels.  This was the major contentious point in recent negotiations, negotiations which are not yet concluded and which the Minister referred to as being close to conclusion.</P>
    <P>The Council's decision in this area involved a particular effort being made to assist the least prosperous regions within the list of priority areas: the objective of the Structural Funds to promote, develop and structurally adjust less developed regions; the converting of regions of industrial decline; the combating of longterm unemployment; the facilitating of occupational integration of young people and certain structural adjustments in the agricultural policy.  My own view is that in regions such as the west, where you have a lower income level, structural farm problems, massive emigration, etc., there is scope for much more consultation than is taking place at present.  I applaud the fact that the Commission is seeking to negotiate in regard to structures in the regions.  I deplore the fact that these recent negotiations were apparently attended by chairmen of county councils <Col N="325" /> and nobody else.  I regard that as entirely inadequate.  It is by developing integrated plans that you can highlight the problems in such regions and it can lead to much more funding coming into these regions.</P>
    <P>The question of constituting this country as one region has been a matter of debate.  The Taoiseach, in his speech of 5 October, referred to it.  He referred to discussions he had with the President of the Commission, Mr. Delors, and he put words into Delors' mouth.  He suggested that he fully agreed that, in the case of such a small country as Ireland, this system of national programmes we have adopted for sub-regional monitoring co-ordination was by far the most effective, if not the only way to successfully organise the implementation of a national development plan.  But nowhere do we find President Delors on the record with such a statement.</P>
    <P>We have seen comments recently in a publication on regional policy by Maurice Doyle, Governor of the Central Bank, former Secretary of the Department of Finance, where he in particular points out a different route: that the need for aid should be determined on the basis of regions, not of countries, and that aid should be concentrated in the poorer regions.  He goes on to point out that there is no reason, simply because we are a small country, that we cannot break down our regions.  These programmes which have been developed have been global inputs which relate to global funding for tourism, global funding for infrastructure, global funding for all the support areas.  I think this is a huge weakness in regard to the west of Ireland. Many countries as small as Ireland have distinctly different plans.</P>
    <P>I am saying this in a very apolitical sense.  Some years ago I was involved in a policy document which would have led to the establishment of a western development board.  The Government of 1973-77, which could have and should have done that, did not do it; so I am being as critical of my own party in the past as of this particular Government. Again, even in recent interviews, the Commissioner for Regional Policy speaks about this as well &mdash; the progress specifically related to the regions as distinct <Col N="326" /> from countries.  Despite these huge problems &mdash; structural problems, small holding problems, massive emigration problems, there is no setting out by this Government of the uniqueness of the west.  That is not being done and should be done in the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome this report, which gives us all scope for debate in coming weeks.  I am glad to play my part in it.  Again, I would like to compliment NESC for having produced it and I would like to compliment the Taoiseach on taking the initiative for having it commissioned in the first instance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We are, in my view, not only facing a situation of rapid change within the European Community, which initially had six members, but we are also facing a rapidly changing world where barriers, and particularly trade barriers, are coming down across the globe.  I welcome this because I think that in the final analysis this globe and this world of ours is too small for unnecessary barriers.  I particularly welcome the trends within the European Community and worldwide to standardise technical standards and <Col N="327" /> specifications, whether it be for the simple items like plug tops or whether it is relating to computer standards and so on.</P>
    <P>The world we live in is one of rapidly changing technology and particularly in transport.  This has opened up new frontiers. Nowhere is this more evident than in the massive changes that have taken place in eastern Europe in the last few years &mdash; changes that, I think, none of us could have foreseen a few years ago.  I visualise not only the breaking down of barriers within what is now the European Community but also large changes in the distribution of our trade with these countries.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Community has changed and is changing.  I think that the Community that we now are involved in is very different in nature from the Community we joined.  We have to ask ourselves, how have we responded as a nation, not only Government but people, to European membership.  It would be a fair comment that in certain ways we have responded positively, but at times we have seemed to have a little of the begging bowl mentality and we have not believed in our own ability to challenge and compete as equals in this Community.</P>
    <P>Another factor that comes out in the report, and it is very important, is the fact that the EC itself has changed.  We also have to face the fact that changes in the EC approach to things have had a huge effect on the Irish economy in the past 15 years.  None of us foresaw on membership of the EC that by 1989 we would have seen quotas placed on such things as milk and fish and that these would particularly hit a small island nation which is particularly dependent on these products for its wealth.  In this matter it is very important, too, to stress the fact that when these quotas came in various countries in Europe were frozen at unequal levels of development, that the stage of development we were at at that time was not the same as our partners and that this inequality has to be addressed in the future if the aim of cohesion is to be achieved.</P>
    <P>As we face into 1992 and the open <Col N="328" /> market we have to look at the task facing us in a very basic and practical way.  I have been for the past 15 years involved in the productive sector, involved with both agriculture, industry and forestry and in that time I have learned a lot of hard lessons.  In the first place, our industry and our agriculture must be competitive within themselves in terms of cost, quality and marketing.  As well as that, we must be able to compete in terms of our cost structures, and those cost structures particularly which have a large Government influence.  In this connection I would refer specifically to energy costs, where we have high taxation, to labour taxes and labour costs, the costs of telecommunications.  It is very important that these costs are made at least as competitive; particularly in relation to transport costs it is very important as an island nation &mdash; in fact, we will soon be the only nation state in Europe completely cut off from the market as regards direct access in terms of land, or a bridge, or a tunnel. It is very important that this question of transport costs be addressed.</P>
    <P>We also need to make sure that we make the best use possible of all modern technology because, as an island people, and particularly for us in the west of Ireland as a people far removed from the market, we must use all the modern communications technology and computer technology to enable us to make up for the disadvantages that we suffer because of our location.</P>
    <P>We will also have to ensure that the various services to industry, particularly banking, legal and insurance, adopt practices and methods that are not only as good but are better than those elsewhere, because in that type of approach will lie our future.</P>
    <P>When we are talking about the fact that we will have a local market of 300 million people we should not forget that because we are an island, our local market will basically still consist of the people of this island.  One of the things that we all look forward to is the dismantling bit by bit of the customs tariffs and customs border within this island. We must ensure more and more in the future, just as barriers are coming down all across Europe, that the barrier within <Col N="329" /> this island disappears and that the differences in the economies of the North and the South disappear and particularly that the costly duplication in services that we now have also disappear.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we face a daunting challenge because of our location but if we identify our strengths, identify those things that we are best at, we have nothing to fear for the future.  We must particularly ensure that agriculture, forestry, fishing, tourism, and the high-tech and information industries will become the basis of our strength in Europe.  In these things we have natural advantages. In these things the disadvantages of our location are minimised.  We have a super opportunity, by reaching high efficiency and high quality, of competing particularly in these industries.  It is very important for us to insist that the jobs be brought to the people and not the people to the jobs.</P>
    <P>This now is possible in a way that maybe was not so 20 or 30 years ago because of the advent of modern technology. We have all seen &mdash; I think with some amazement &mdash; the possibilities of computer link-up through the telephone which allows us in remote places to provide services that would not have been possible even ten years ago.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words on the question of cohesion and subsidiarity.  I must say that I disagree vehemently with Senator Staunton on the statement he made as regards approaching the EC or national government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to indicate, if I may, that I would like to give two minutes of my time to Senator Joe <Col N="330" /> Costello if he is able to be back on time from a union meeting.</P>
      <P>The motion concerns the building of a school in Waterford Street-Seán McDermott Street, commitments about which were given a considerable number of years ago.  I would like first of all to pay considered tribute to the work of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee in the valiant efforts they have made to continue the education of children and young adults in the north inner city which, as the Minister knows, is a very deprived area of our capital city.</P>
      <P>I would like to give a brief history of how the situation emerged.  St. Garvan's Vocational School, 3 Great Denmark Street, and Parnell Girls' Vocational School, 1 Parnell Square, have been operating for the past 40 years serving the needs of Dublin's north inner city post-primary students.  When the schools were opened in the 1940s it was envisaged that the premises being used were merely temporary.  The premises were two Georgian houses approximately 200 years old. Even then they were considered unsuitable as use for schools and they certainly are today and have remained so.</P>
      <P>One point I wish to come back to at the end of what I have to say is the fact that whereas I applaud the educational efforts of the VEC I deplore their absolute lack of any custodial responsibility of a series of extremely important houses in the inner city of Dublin.  The vandalising of No. 1 Parnell Square, of No. 20 North Great George's Street and of the Great Denmark site constitutes a considerable reproach to anybody and particularly to an educational body.  However, they were placed in a situation where they were being asked to make bricks without straw and I pity them for the situation in which they found themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the advent of free post-primary education in the late sixties and the consequent great increase in student numbers, the need for new accommodation became acute: that is, 25 years ago the problem was becoming acute.  A replacement school was approved by the post-primary advisory council in the early seventies and the City of Dublin VEC began to look for a suitable site.  It seemed at that <Col N="331" /> point that there was a distinct possibility that this dream of a new inner city publicly-funded school would be a reality, and in pursuance of the incarnation of this dream a series of sites were looked at and the project was then actively researched.</P>
    <P>Sites were looked at at Broadstone, Grangegorman, Mountjoy Square, North Great George's Street and a number of other options.  The intention was the purchase of alternative buildings. Nothing came of any of these plans, as the Minister knows.  As the years went by the conditions became worse.  The buildings deteriorated, the conditions in the existing school became progressively worse and both staff and student morale suffered.  As a teacher myself I can assure the Minister that a bad environment is not conductive to the communication of knowledge.  One needs a positive environment in which to meet this task.</P>
    <P>Meetings were organised, protests were held, and the situation was highlighted among the local community and also in the national media.  Local politicians and public representatives of various shades of political opinion gave their unqualified support to the demand for a new school so that there is clearly a positive political involvement on the part of all the local representatives from the area at a very early stage indeed in the proceedings.</P>
    <P>In 1981 the pressure had reached such an extent that a new school was sanctioned by the then Minister for Education, Deputy Wilson.  Shortly after this it was announced publicly that the site was to be at Seán McDermott Street and Waterford Street.  The site was purchased by the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee and the building was to be completed by 1985.  This is the end of 1989; in the early 1980s plans had advanced to such a point that the site was bought and the building was to be completed four years ago.  Architects' plans were drawn up and early in 1982 tenders were sought for the building of the school and found by the responsible authorities to be satisfactory.</P>
    <P>In 1982 a political situation emerged with which I am sure we are all familiar. There was a hung Dáil and there were <Col N="332" /> negotiations between both Deputy FitzGerald and the present Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey.  As a result of this the famous Gregory deal was struck when, for the first time, somebody representing the most deprived section of our inner city was actually placed in a pivotal role so that he was able to exact, by bargaining, from the incoming Taoiseach a series of undertakings that became known as the Gregory deal.  Part of that argument, part of that deal, a part which I very much regret has never been honoured, was that this school would be completed. There was an undertaking given. The reason I am raising this today on the Adjournment is to seek to exert pressure so that that long-standing undertaking can now at last be brought to reality.</P>
    <P>On 3 December 1987, as the Dáil Official Report will show, a question was asked by Deputy Gregory under the heading of Dublin Inner City Community College.  He asked the Minister for Education when she intended to give approval for work to commence on the community college for Dublin's north inner city at Seán McDermott Street, Dublin 1; if her attention had been drawn to the commitment given to build this college and if she would make a statement in the matter.  The Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Fahey, made the reply on behalf of the Minister and stated:</P>
    <P>Because of the restriction on the relevant capital allocation which the Government have imposed under their <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> I cannot indicate when it will be possible for me to authorise commencement of construction in this matter despite the undertaking given of which I am aware.  Work on the project which is estimated to cost £3 million will commence when sufficient resources become available to me to enable it to proceed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gregory pressed the matter by forcing the issue on to the level of social responsibility and his next supplementary question indicated very clearly that he felt as I do.  Although I do not directly represent the inner city I live in the inner city which, as this House knows, is an <Col N="333" /> area with quite astonishing levels of unemployment reaching into the upper seventies and eighties; 80 per cent of the adults in the area in which I live are unemployed.  The one way out these people have from the ghetto is the possibility of a decent education and successive Governments have conspired to deprive them of this.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a point at this stage that I think will emerge as we examine the evidence that what the Department of Education are involved in here is that most dangerous of exercises, reactive rather than creative planning; because as one reads through a series of questions and a series of replies from the Minister it is increasingly evident that the Department of Education have decided in their wisdom that there is, and is going to continue to be, a declining population of educable students in the north inner city.</P>
    <P>It was no doubt for this reason that the Minister for Education facilitated the Loreto Nuns in their flight from the north inner city out to the prosperous suburbs of Swords.  I remember questioning the head nun on that occasion when I met her on the street and I asked her why they were leaving, and she said, &ldquo;Because there were no children in the area, Mr. Norris.&rdquo; I said that was a very interesting observation and asked her if this was Catholic social doctrine.  I said to her I would like to know if there were no children in the area, what were those creatures I saw every day hanging out of the railings of the flats.  I asked her if it was the present position of Catholic social teaching that children only occur above a certain socio-economic level and asked if she would care to give me a categorisation of these humanoids I saw hanging out of the railings of the flats.  These are the very people for whom education is necessary, and I deplored, as I say, the flight in full pursuit of the middle classes.</P>
    <P>It was facilitated by the Minister, and I think it particularly means that when that middle class institution is allowed to flee and to realise that valuable site as an asset and to be assisted in the creation of a new school with finances from the Department of Education, even the new <Col N="334" /> inner city community college is apparently to be stripped away from the people in this area.  The Minister of State said it had a very high priority.  That can mean more or less anything you like depending on your scale of priorities, I suppose, but again he quoted budget restraints. Deputy Gregory asked if the Minister was aware that the Taoiseach gave a specific written commitment in 1982 that this college would be built and if he was now saying that because of financial constraints this written commitment would not be honoured.  The answer was that this was 1987 and not 1982 which is not, I think, an over-startling assertion.  We have a situation that architects' plans were drawn up, the schools were ready to go, but the Government were apparently hesitating.  Deputy Gregory pressed further questions with Deputy Tomás Mac Giolla on 16 June, Bloomsday, 1988. Deputy Gregory asked if the Minister was concerned at conditions at St. Garvan's National School, Great Denmark Street, and if she would make a statement. Deputy Mac Giolla amplified this by saying that he wanted to know if it was intended to proceed in 1989 with the building of the inner city Vocational Education Committee community college on the Seán McDermott Street site which was deferred in 1988 because money was not provided for its construction in the 1988 estimates, if she would ensure that the moneys were provided in the 1989 Estimates, and if she would make a statement.</P>
    <P>The statement that emerged was that she was aware of the conditions and I have to place on record that the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, is somebody with experience in the teaching area and, I believe she is a caring and good Minister. That is why I am making a strong appeal to her in this matter.  She said it was her intention to have St. Garvan's and the vocational school in Parnell Square replaced by the north inner city community college, Sean McDermott Street, but that it was not possible to indicate at that stage whether money would be available in the 1989 Estimates.  On 8 November 1988 a further question was asked by Deputy Gregory when he inquired of the Minister &ldquo;as to the plans <Col N="335" /> she has for the provision of modern alternative accommodation for the staff and students of St. Garvan's Vocational School, Great Denmark Street, which is in a rundown condition&rdquo;.  May I say that is putting it mildly.  The answer was that it was proposed that alternative accommodation for St. Garvan's Vocational School would be provided by the north inner city community college to be built at Sean McDermott Street.</P>
    <P>Now we begin to get the conditions. Construction of the proposed college is subject, in the first instance, to the availability of the necessary capital resources and to the agreement of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee to certain conditions laid down by her Department in this matter.  There was a further question on 13 December where greater elucidation became possible with regard to what these conditions were and it is here that we get, for the first time, the explicit indication that the Minister feels that there is going to be a substantial and continuing decline in population numbers and that the building of the college without certain conditions attaching would create an unaceptable level of surplus accommodation in the area &mdash; a laughable statement I may say, that the north inner city is going to be burdened with an <i>embaras de richesses.</i>  It beggars credibility.  In these circumstances she has decided that the provision of the college will be conditional on the closure and sale of North Stand Vocational School.  I would like to say that I consider this blatant idiocy.  The North Strand Vocational School is purpose built.  It was intended as a school.  It has a thriving population, and yet apparently the Department of Education feel that it would be appropriate to close this successfully functioning school, purpose built, and make this a condition for removing children and young adults from conditions which are simply appalling and which in fact break the law.</P>
    <P>I would like an answer if possible to the fact that the fire regulations, for example, and the Factories Act are clearly being breached in all the premises that I mentioned. I would like to know if it is the <Col N="336" /> policy of this Government and its Ministers to connive with a situation where the law is being broken in situations which may place the lives of young people in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>The final question to which I will refer was this year, 17 May 1989 when Deputy Gregory asked the Minister if agreement had been reached regarding the conditions set down by her Department to enable construction work to start on the proposed north inner city college.  The Minister replied that the conditions in question have been the subject of correspondence and discussion with the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee; that the committee will be authorised to proceed to tender stage on the basis of the existing building plans when the necessary capital resources can be made available.  May I say at this point that a hoarding announcing the new school was erected in 1982.  It was left there unpainted and untended and it has now collapsed and that hoarding is as far as this wonderful school ever got.  I consider that that is a reproach to the Department of Education and its officers. I would like to place on record some of the conditions existing in one of the schools, St. Garvan's.  There is no gym, no assembly area, no yard; classrooms which were never designed as such are unsuitable and cannot be adapted to function as modern classrooms.  Additional rooms have to be rented from the Institute of Adult Education, Mountjoy Square, and over the past 20 years additional rooms have been rented in three additional locations.  Staff and student toilet facilities are grossly inadequate. There are no canteen facilities for either staff or students.  The staff room is tiny; there is no storage space for books or equipment.  Because of its age and structure, narrow winding stairs, four storey narrow building above basement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Could you indicate when I have two minutes left because I would like to share it.  I was delaying in the hope that Senator Costello would arrive. Thank you very much for drawing my <Col N="337" /> attention to it.  I will not elaborate on the conditions.  I will say one thing.  I have had the assistance of political assistant Barbara Lord in drawing up this and a very good job was done and I am grateful to her for it.  Among the views that were elicited was the fact that the trade unions were unhappy at the idea that a deal would be done and the school site sold off.</P>
      <P>I would like in this instance to encourage the Minister as far as I possibly can to get the Vocational Education Committee and its works out of Parnell Square and out of North Great George's Street as quickly as possible, particularly No. 20 North Great George's Street which is one of the finest 18th century houses in the city.  The Dublin tourism authorities wanted to take it over as a town house to put in a resource of furniture, open it to the public, and they were denied this by the Vocational Education Committee, and I witnessed them demolishing a range of Gothic out-buildings, destroying the last 18th century garden in the city, levelling it and putting it under tarmac so that they could hold on to it as a car park for their staff in Parnell Square.  I urge the Minister to remove them from this situation to create a school which will be appropriate for their excellent teaching efforts and to free this school so that, as was done by the ESB in Merrion Square, the people of Ireland can witness the glories of their architectural heritage.</P>
      <P>I had better stop at that point because I wish to let my colleague add his words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few brief words in relation to this school which has been on the agenda for the last 20 years and still has not been constructed.  From time to time we get various promises that it will, but yet it has not materialised.  In the meantime, in the last 12 to 15 years six boys' and girls' post-primary schools closed in the immediate vicinity in the north inner city and there has been no replacement in terms of educational space and educational accommodation. The existing schools in the immediate area, St. Garvan's and Parnell Square are in very poor condition and furthermore, as a clear indication of the Department's intention to rationalise on this matter, <Col N="338" /> the principalships in St. Garvan's and in Parnell Square have not been filled for over two years.  Obviously there is not a commitment to those existing schools but there has been no return in relation to the provision of the community school that has been mooted for such a period of time.</P>
      <P>There is growth in some of the primary schools in the area.  There is the bringing in of the financial centre into the area which, of course, has tremendous potential for growth.  There is a growing recognition that inner city living is desirable compared to the view held 20 years ago. From that point of view there will be numbers for the school and indeed there are so many of the youngsters in the area who do not go on to second level education; they drop out because there are not adequate services for them.</P>
      <P>Finally, there will be a need for second chance education because so many of the people in that particular area have not had the advantage of good schooling. There is a lot of illiteracy or semi-literacy. What we would envisage is a community school of quite a different type, a community school that would have a wide range of facilities, would be a type of home away from home for people and that would cater to a very broad range, not in the traditional formal method in which post-primary schooling takes place.  That was the manner in which the school was envisaged when it was first mooted.</P>
      <P>I fully support Senator Norris and urge the Minister to immediately set about providing the funding and getting on with the construction of the school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the Senators, I wish first of all to give some background information on this specific project.  The question of providing a new vocational school in the north inner city area originated in a proposal from the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee in 1973 for one central vocational school to replace the existing schools in Parnell Square and Great Denmark Street.  The Department of Education, following consideration of the requirements of the area, accepted <Col N="339" /> the proposal and the VEC were asked to investigate the availability of a suitable site.  The site located at Seán McDermott Street was identified in 1978 by Dublin Corporation but at the time the VEC had some reservations regarding its suitability.</P>
      <P>In 1982 a decision was taken to proceed with the provision of a new community college, under the aegis of the VEC, at the Seán McDermott Street site and the architectural planning of the new school was then commenced.</P>
      <P>The new school, which it is estimated will cost approximately £3 million for site purchase, design, construction, furniture and equipment, is intended to cater for 600 pupils and will have the following facilities: eight general classrooms; two lecture rooms; one commerce room; one audio typing room; one language laboratory; one junior woodwork room; one building construction room; two metal-work rooms (junior and senior); two mechanical drawing rooms; three science rooms; one demonstration room; two domestic science rooms; one dress design room; one arts and crafts room; one music and drama room; one general purpose room; one library; one guidance suite; one sports hall; social areas, staff offices, créche.  From the foregoing, therefore, it will be seen that the range of facilities to be provided is extensive and will allow a comprehensive programme of education to be made available in the new school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current position regarding the project is that the architectural planning has been completed and it is the intention of the Minister for Education that the new <Col N="340" /> building, as planned will replace the existing schools at Great Denmark Street, Parnell Square and North Strand, unless an alternative usage of any of the buildings has been authorised by the Department of Education.  It will be appreciated, of course, that the rate at which the buildings project may proceed is dependent on the availability of financial resources.  This is the case with all such capital projects.</P>
    <P>In the light of the very special circumstances pertaining in the area which the school is intended to serve, the Minister is extremely anxious to advance the project as soon as the financial circumstances allow it.  It is hoped that the new school will play a major part in any effort to revitalise the area in question. It is intended that the school's programme will be as responsive as possible to the special needs of this deprived and disadvantaged area and that a heavy emphasis will be placed on such things as practical subjects and adult education. For these reasons, therefore, the Minister does not wish to see the building of the new school delayed any longer than is necessary.</P>
    <P>However, the financial situation has inevitably restricted the level of resources available for the public capital programme generally and, accordingly, this has meant that it is not possible to proceed with capital projects such as this one as quickly as we might wish.  You will understand, therefore, that the Minister is not in a position at present to give an undertaking as to when the construction of this school may commence.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.55 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 15 November 1989.</P>
