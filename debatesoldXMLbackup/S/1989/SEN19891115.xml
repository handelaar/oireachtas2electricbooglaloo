      <P>I have a notice from Senator Joe Costello that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The urgent need for the Minister for Education to clarify the position in regard to the reconstruction of the Primary Model School in the grounds of the Department of Education, Marlborough Street, Dublin, in view of the long delay in providing permanent accommodation for the schoolchildren of the parish of the Pro-Cathedral.</P>
      <P>Tá fógra agam ón Seanadóir Pól Ó Foighil:</P>
      <P>An gá atá leis go dtabharfadh an tAire Oideachais aird ar dhrochstaid an Chórais Bus Scoile atá ag freastal ar an Scoil Chuimsitheach, an Cheathrú Rua.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by both Senators Costello and Ó Foighil as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matter raised by Senator Costello and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Ó Foighil may give notice another day on which he wishes to raise the matter.</P>

      <P>It is intended to take Items Nos. 1 and 4 today &mdash; Item No. 4 to be taken between 6.30 p.m. and 8 p.m. The report of the Committee of Selection will be taken at a time after the committee have met; I presume it will probably be at 4.30 p.m.  It is just a matter of reporting back on the Committee of Selection.  Tomorrow, it is intended to take Items Nos. 5 and 2.  Item No. 5 will be taken at 10.30 a.m.  The Minister will come in at 1 p.m.  We will take Item No. 2 from 3 p.m., with the Minister to come in at 5 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I do no want to be disruptive or unco-operative today.  I appreciate the steps that are being taken behind the scenes to improve the ordering of business and the conduct of business in the House.  I certainly would not do anything to pre-empt what is happening there, but give it my full support.</P>
      <P>However, I am greatly concerned that on Item No. 1 today the Government amendments arrived only this morning. They are significant amendments to a fairly important Bill.  That creates a problem for the spokespersons in the various parties who have to do their research and prepare for a Bill which is as important as this Bill.  I would like to place on record my concern about the matter.  I ask the Leader of the House &mdash; I do not blame him for this &mdash; to convey to the Goverment Whip our concern that Government amendments, and all amendments, should be in proper time so that people can give them proper research and consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Senator Manning said about the improvements in the Order of Business and also welcome the Cathaoirleach's own words when he spoke about the possibility of reform of the Seanad.  I am sure he will have the co-operation of Members on the Independent benches on this.  If I could just draw the Cathaoirleach's attention to the fact that I feel &mdash; I think a number of <Col N="343" /> people would also feel &mdash; that with regard to difficulties that have traditionally been caused on the Order of Business, this is largely because there is no provision whatever for any form of Question Time. There is a natural tendency when people wish to raise matters to put them down as motions, and then to try to see by questioning if they cannot be raised.  It is a kind of illicit Question Time.</P>
      <P>I would also like to ask a question which is related to the parliamentary debates which are published.  I was a little surprised and concerned to notice that Senator Donie Cassidy's contribution on the Adjournment is not included in the printed volume I received this morning. The sitting ended at 11.05 p.m. so I do not think it is the case that it went into a new day.  I wonder if you could have some information on that?</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Leader of the House has given an undertaking that the important motion on Cambodia will be taken tomorrow.  I will not be arguing with that but I regret a little that it has not been found possible to take it today, because the vote in the United Nations is taking place tomorrow.  If we wished to have any impact on our policy on the United Nations, surely today would be the day to have the debate rather than tomorrow when we will simply be reacting to events which will be taking place either simultaneously with our debate or that would have taken place before we have actually had an opportunity to discuss that.  In effect, we will be talking very much in a political vacuum without any power or influence.</P>
      <P>I also very much welcome the fact that Item No. 4 will be taken with regard to the very important developments in eastern Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final matter on which I seek some information from the Leader of the House is that I raised last Thursday an item which is today Item No. 40 on the Order Paper.  It concerns the lack of response of the Irish Government to the decision in the European Court of Human Rights, which lack of response makes their position difficult in attacking <Col N="344" /> the continuance of the British derogration which was announced yesterday&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris, please conclude because you are making a speech for the last number of moments and I will not allow you to do it again.  I wanted to see if you would realise you were in breach of Standing Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling, but if I could conclude by saying &mdash; and this is directly relevant to the Order of Business &mdash; that the Leader of the House indicated that he would seek some information for me from the Government and that if this reply is either not forthcoming or not satisfactory I will be moving an amendment to the Order of Business today in order to take Item No. 40 first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understood the Leader of the House correctly, he indicated that the NESC debate would be taken tomorrow at 3 o'clock with the Minister coming in a 5 p.m.  That implies a conclusion of the debate on this subject. That is what I want to make clear here, because to me that would be totally unsatisfactory.  On this side of the House we have at least five further speakers on that report.  I would like to say to the Leader of the House, particularly in view of events in recent days that this report has assumed even greater consequences and greater importance for this country. We on the Fine Gael benches have five more speakers to contribute and two hours would not be sufficient to accommodate them.  It is reasonable to assume that there are speakers from the other parties in the House on this most important subject.  Therefore, I would have to say, that if it is the intention of the Leader of the House to conclude the NESC debate with the Minister's contribution at 5 p.m. tomorrow evening, it is unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support an observation made by Senator Norris in relation to the debate on Cambodia.  It is totally unsatisfactory that this debate will be taking place hours after our Government vote in the United <Col N="345" /> Nations on this issue.  I am dissatisfied with the time of this matter.  It could have been better arranged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I raise a matter on the Order of Business, as you have just ruled a member of the Independent group to be in breach of Standing Orders by making a speech on the Order of Business, I would like you to indicate the particular Standing Order which was in breach.  It is something which I will raise again, perhaps.  I am not aware of the Standing Order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I make is that there is a long-standing tradition&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not be anything new.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a long-standing tradition of speeches on the Order of Business.  It goes back to the foundation of the Seanad.  On the question of the motion on Cambodia, I rush to the defence of the Leader of the House who in discussing this matter earlier in the week indicated to us that the reason he would wish the motion to be taken on Thursday morning was because of the time lapse between ourselves and New York, in that it might well be disposed of here before it came to be discussed in the United Nations, and that he would take particular care to have information brought forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of committees, I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he could outline for us a number of points which are giving the Independent group some concern.  First, I will refer to Standing Order 78 (3) by which this House may set up committees on its own, and also Standing Order 60 by which it may set up select committees.  We would wish to be advised, first, whether in fact the Leader of the House envisages the House deciding on the committees which it will form.  Also, we are very much <Col N="346" /> aware of the fact that decision on committees and joint committees are taken by a committee which sits with the Government Whip of the other House. As we are the only group in this House that is not represented in the decision-making forum, we ask the Leader of the House how he can arrange for us to have an input into that committee where we believe we have a right of representation, although it is not covered by Standing Orders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I would like to ask the Leader of the House when the Government will be in a position to have debated in this House the report of the commission on the funding and financing of the health services.  This is a matter of major concern to all our citizens, and in particular those who are in need of health care and, indeed, to those who are engaged in the provision of health care.  I believe, therefore, that the Leader of the House and the Government should see to it immediately that this matter is debated in this House as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of disturbing the extraordinary outburst of harmony which has apparently taken over all sides of this House.  Indeed, if there are discreet things going on behind the scenes I do not wish to disturb them either.  Indeed, I would welcome them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have one particular problem and that is on item No. 8 on the Order Paper &mdash; the Abolition of the Death Penalty.  Last week &mdash; I think it was last week but it may have been the week before &mdash; I asked the Leader of the House whether he was prepared to take this Bill and he told me to ask him about it in private.  I asked him about it in private, and he told me to ask him about it in the House.  I suspect this circle might come to an end today when I now ask him whether he might consider first of all giving Government time to it, and, secondly, giving Government support to this Bill.  It is obviously the intention of the Government, and of the Progresive Democrats in particular, to support the abolition of <Col N="347" /> the death penalty.  Indeed, I should say this to him: I would be happy to introduce it for him.  As the Minister is obviously having difficulty drafting this, I would be happy also to accept amendments from the Government side.  While I do not doubt the integrity of the Government in promising that this Bill will be introduced at some stage, I think it might help this House if it were the first Bill to be introduced in the Seanad this session.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>In a public response to a private question, legislation will be introduced by the Government in relation to the abolition of the death penalty.  That is a guarantee given by the Government to the other House and to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>A solemn promise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not made in a solemn way or it is not a solemn promise, but there will be legislation forthcoming from the Government on this issue which is of grave concern to a number of people. That is a fact.  On Senator Kennedy's application to have the report on the health services brought before the House, if Fine Gael wish to bring that forward as their Private Members' business it is quite in order with me&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Government business, I suggest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;there is absolutely nothing I can do about it.  I will relay the request to the proper sources.  I think perhaps after the Health Estimates come out he may not be as forceful in his demands to have a debate as he would have been beforehand.</P>
      <P>With regard to committees, the Committee of Procedure and Privileges dictates what happens in this House.  Senator O'Toole can raise the matter of the committees of the House or joint committees at the Committee of Procedure and Privileges. That is the proper place to have that matter dealt with.  It is not a matter for the Leader of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the timing of the debate on <Col N="348" /> Cambodia, there has been pressure on this side of the House to have such a debate.  The first available time we could have that debate is tomorrow.  It was a request from the House.  It is an agreed debate.  The timing of the debate was forwarded to the Whips of each group last Friday and the content of the motion was issued to each of the groups.  Even though it might appear as if it is irrelevant because of a vote which will take place in the United Nations, I do not think that is so.  This House is being afforded the opportunity to discuss in an open manner what is happening in that country.  Basically, I cannot dictate when the United Nations order their business.  All I can do is respond to requests to have particular items debated.  The first opportunity we had to debate this item is tomorrow morning and the debate will take place then.</P>
    <P>On a matter of information, there was a request last week that we should have a debate on matters in the Middle East. That has been arranged to take place on Thursday of next week.  Again, I think that if we can have an all-party wording on that, fair enough, but if not it will be introduced under my name.</P>
    <P>The matter of question time has been raised.  That is not a matter for me.  The situation is that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges can discuss the suggestion that we should have a question time.  That can be raised by anybody at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. We can have the discussion then and come to a conclusion on that.</P>
    <P>In today's business we have a Bill in Committee on which there are Government amendments which were late coming in.  I would generally agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Manning.  I just want to say that we needed to have that Bill before the House.  It is an important Bill and I felt we should take it at the earliest opportunity. In general, I assure the House that amendments will not be foisted on the House on the day on which a Bill is put before us on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two matters in <Col N="349" /> relation to health which you omitted to reply to and I am entitled to ask for a reply.  One was on the omission of Senator Cassidy's contribution on the Adjournment.  The second was Item No. 40.  I would remind him that I intend moving&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise, I missed dealing with those matters.  There were two items.  One item raised by Senator Howard, I said no later than 5 o'clock tomorrow evening, that does not mean that the debate has to finish at 5 o'clock, but I am suggesting that we conclude business tomorrow at 5 o'clock.  May I confer with the Minister, and I will have a reply for Senator Norris tomorrow morning on Item No. 40?</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 1, amendments Nos. 4 and 8 are related and may be discussed together.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 16 and 17, to insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;lprison&rsquo; means any place for which rules or regulations may be made under the Prisons Acts, 1826 to 1980, or section 13 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960;&rdquo;. </P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, a Chathaoirligh, may I take this opportunity of offering you my congratulations on your appointment to the <Col N="350" /> very high office of Cathaoirleach and to Senator Naughten on his appointment as Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>The purpose of amendments Nos. 4 and 8 is to extend the power to take samples from persons who may be imprisoned, on remand or on conviction and who come under suspicion of having committed an offence in relation to which they would be arrested and detained in custody and be required to give samples were it not for the fact that they were in prison.  From time to time cases arise where a person who is in prison, whether on remand or following conviction, becomes a suspect for an offence unrelated to that for which he is in prison and where the Garda would like to be able to obtain a sample from him in an effort to procure evidence in support or in contradiction of that suspicion.  The effect of what is proposed in the amendments under discussion is to place the prisoner in exactly the position he would be <i>vis-ávis</i> the powers proposed in the Bill if he or she were a free person.  This is a logical and sensible approach.</P>
      <P>I would emphasise, lest there be any doubt, that a prisoner from whom a sample could be required under the extended powers of the Bill proposed in amendment No. 4 would enjoy all of the safeguards provided in the Bill, for example, the provision in relation to authorisation, consent, the taking of intimate samples, destruction of records, and so on.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 is a substantive amendment.  It extends the power provided in section 2 (1) to enable samples to be taken from persons in prison in the circumstances which I have described. Amendment No. 1 is consequential on amendment No. 4.  It defines the term &ldquo;prison&rdquo; for the purposes of amendment No. 1.  Amendment No. 8 is also consequential on amendment No. 4.  The existing wording of subsection 2 (3) (a) needs to be altered to make it consistent with subsection 2 (1) when amended as proposed in amendment No. 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to amendment No. 1, I refer the Minister to the <Col N="351" /> section where it includes the Prisons Acts, 1826 to 1980, whether the Children Act, 1908, and the provisions therein where somebody can go to prison if they are termed unruly, particularly in relation to section 2 (8) (c).  This Bill refers to the case of a person who has not attained the age of 14 years and the consent of the parent or guardian of that person.  In other words, is it intended that under the Bill imprisonment could take place for a person between the age of criminal responsibility and the age of 14 years, and that these regulations and rules could apply thereto?</P>
      <P>Secondly, in relation to section 4, would the Minister clarify subsection (3) (a), where the sample to be taken is required in connection with an offence other than the offence in respect of which the person is in prison or an offence of which he could be convicted on indictment alleging the offence?  First, could he exemplify the type of offence that he has in mind?  Would it not be more appropriate that &ldquo;or&rdquo; be deleted &ldquo;and&rdquo; put in its place?  It would then state that it must be an offence in respect of which the person is already in prison and that it must be an indictable offence.</P>
      <P>As we know, in the prison rules and regulations there is provision for the internal disciplining of an offender for offences that are prescribed under the 1947 rules and regulations, and that they can amount to very substantial disciplines in internal hearings.  Considerable harassment is possible within the confines of a prison.  It would be proper that it would be a substantial offence whereby such extensive powers are prescribed under the Bill.  It would be appropriate for the Minister to delete the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; and include the word &ldquo;and&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the amendments, may I draw the attention of the House to a small matter?  The press gallery is now empty, and the next time they write about the work of this House it might be appropriate to remember that.  It is a particular habit of the press to vacate the <Col N="352" /> gallery whenever there is a debate on Committee Stage of a Bill, which is when most of the work of both Houses of the Oireachtas is conducted.</P>
      <P>On these amendments, I have to say that I agree entirely with what Senator Costello has just said.  The provision that is being made here seems to me to invite a rather peculiar practice whereby a person could be charged with one offence, remanded in custody and then a detailed investigation takes place on another offence, which perhaps might take time. Whatever is wrong with the Offences Against the State Act and the Criminal Justice Act, there is at least a time limit under which investigations must be carried out.  In the case of the Offences Against the State Act, it is 48 hours, and in the case of the Criminal Justice Act, it could be 18 hours if you include a period of overnight detention, etc.  But we are talking about fixed periods.</P>
      <P>I would like to have clarified whether these amendments would apply to people who are remanded in custody as well as to convicted prisoners.  Does it apply to anybody who is in prison?  First of all, it seems to make a distinction between people who are remanded in custody and people who are remanded on bail.  I would like to inquire why this is.  If we are talking about convicted persons under these amendments, that is fine; but if we are talking about people who have actually been on remand, then you have a rather peculiar situation in which the Garda would have powers over people who are on remand which they would not have over people who are not on remand.</P>
      <P>I would simply like to clarify what is going on, because people who are on bail would still be subject to strict time limits under the Offences Against the State Act or the Criminal Justice Act.  But if the people are on remand in prison then you effectively have an open-ended investigation period, which does not seem to me to represent a fair balance between the interests of a suspect and the interests of the law enforcement agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support what Senator Ryan has said.  I am a little <Col N="353" /> concerned at some possibilities that seem to me to be inherent in the impact, or possible impact, of this amendment, particularly if I take into consideration some of the abuses of the Offences Against the State Act that have been noted, particularly by civil liberties organisations, and to express concern that there seems to be a possibility that this amendment could permit fishing expeditions by members of the Garda looking and trawling very widely for new evidence in order to convict people in prison.</P>
      <P>I would like to say that I share Senator Ryan's concern with the fact that no distinction seems to have been drawn, if I took up his point correctly, between people who are already convicted on the one hand and people who are remanded on the other.  It seems to be important that this distinction should be maintained in the legislation so that we sustain a very important point of law and that is the presumption of innocence.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to say that I cannot fully accept what the Minister says when he remarks that the people who are directly affected by this amendment, that is, persons in jail, are in exactly the same position as persons who are not in jail.  I may have taken the Minister's emphasis slightly incorrectly, but I do not think this is true.  We must be aware of the fact that persons who are already in prison are vulnerable, and I do not want to raise a scare.  I fully support the excellent work of the police.  I know there are already many difficulties surrounding their attempts to secure conviction, but nevertheless I would be slightly concerned that the wide powers conferred under this amendment could be abused if a malevolent member of the Garda &mdash; and there may from time to time be such &mdash; decided to use this as a form of harassment. Therefore for that reason I think that, in the case of persons who are in prison, not the same safeguards but considerably greater safeguards need to be instituted to protect the rights of prisoners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to make it <Col N="354" /> quite clear to Senator Costello that in regard to the person who is in prison the answer is yes, a sample can be taken under the powers proposed in the amendment. The same applies to a person in prison or a person outside of prison.</P>
      <P>In relation to Senator Ryan's point, there is no hidden motive to these amendments. They are intended to cover the situation where a prisoner may, following his imprisonment, become the suspect of a serious offence, like murder.  It would be wrong if the Garda could not get a sample to gain evidence of his or her guilt or innocence simply because he or she is in prison.  The safeguards of this Bill apply to those in prison as they do to somebody who is not in prison.  We must bear this in mind.  Every safeguard in this Bill applies to those same categories.</P>
      <P>I feel that it is unfair to indicate any hidden motive or that the Garda would take any particular advantage of the fact that somebody was in prison or on remand.  They would have the same powers and the same rights to obtain a sample as they would in respect of a person who was not in prison or in custody. The person involved would also have the exact same rights as a person who was not in custody or in prison. Therefore I would recommend the amendments to the Seanad for adoption. We are quite confident that they will safeguard the interests of all citizens of the State, whether they are in prison or whether they are outside of prison.</P>

      <P>May I just mention two points to the Minister?  First of all, would he not accept my point that the samples will be taken in different conditions, both physically and psychologically, from the point of view of the prisoners?  Secondly, I am less convinced now, having heard the Minister's speech.  Nobody wants a murderer, for example, to be facilitated in getting off scot free.  But there is a well-known procedure where by people on release from prison on one charge are immediately re-arrested on another. Certainly, with regard to taking genetic fingerprints, the genetic fingerprint will, I understand, remain the same and will <Col N="355" /> not be altered by the process of time, so there may be circumstances in which this amendment is not necessary.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister say specifically &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;: do the provisions of these amendments with respect to persons in prison apply to people on remand? &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;? It is a reasonable question.  I am not trying to be unhelpful.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister explain the wording of subsection (3) (a) then, an offence in respect of which the person is in prison?  How can you be in prison for an offence if you are on remand?  I would like to understand what is going on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support what Senator Ryan has just said.  I think there are needs for extra safeguards, particularly in the context of the prison situation, which is covered by the Official Secrets Act and where there is more scope for abuse, more scope for harassment. There is not in the section any provision for the taking of samples; and, where some of these samples can be taken compulsorily, there is scope there. I, too, would like to see a distinction made in relation to remand and to convicted offenders.</P>
      <P>In regard to the two question I have asked, the Minister has not referred to the terms of the Children Act, 1908, and whether under this Bill it is intended that children between the ages of seven and 14 can be imprisoned.  I would like an answer to that.  Is that intended and is that part of the definition of the word &ldquo;prison&rdquo; here?</P>
      <P>Secondly, in relation to section 4 (3) (a), surely an offence under which such wide powers can be granted should be an indictable offence?  I would like the Minister to address that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the point <Col N="356" /> raised by Senator Norris, I want to emphasise that in prison an intimate sample cannot be taken without consent, just as in the case of a person outside prison.  It is very important for us to realise that, in respect of a person on remand or in prison, you cannot extend greater rights to them than to the ordinary citizen.  I cannot understand the logic of the points being made by the Senators.</P>

      <P>The protection is there in the Bill to all citizens of the State, whether they be in prison or in prison on remand.  If an offence comes to the attention of the Garda Síochána and they wish to interview a person, surely you could not give extra rights to someone in prison than you would give to a free citizen.  I cannot understand the logic behind the arguments put forward by the Senators.  Quite frankly, I do not know who you are actually representing in this regard.  A person on remand in custody is in prison &mdash; a point raised by Senator Ryan &mdash; and if you are on remand in prison then it applies.</P>
      <P>In relation to the point raised by Senator Costello regarding the Children Act, 1908, it is not affected by this Bill.</P>
      <P>I believe I have put forward the case for these sections.  I am satisfied with the arguments we have put forward and I am not convinced by the arguments put forward here by the Senators.  I recommend, therefore, that we proceed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Most assuredly not.  I want the Minister to explain to me, in the sort of English I can understand, how these sections are envisaged as applying to a person on remand, because a person on remand is not in prison for an offence. There are two reasons why people can be remanded in custody in our society.  One is because the person is accepted by the court as being liable to attempt to interfere with witnesses and the second is because the Garda have satisfied the <Col N="357" /> court that the person is likely not to turn up for trial.  You are not remanded because the offence is serious or trivial; those are the two reasons for keeping people on remand.  There is no offence. The person is presumed innocent.</P>
      <P>What I am saying is that in the case of innocent people who have not been charged with an offence our law is extremely precise about the periods of times for which people can be detained and the rights they have.  There are very detailed regulations governing the rights of persons in custody in Garda stations, very important regulations which have legal force because they are regulations approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We are in a very different situation when a person is in prison.  I think it would be possible for the Minister to produce an amendment which would meet the objective he has, which is where something comes up under very specific circumstances what we have instead is a classic Department of Justice amendment which gives them a kind of a trawling power.</P>
      <P>We are entitled, not just in this House but in this country, to have precision in our legislation.  There is no reference in this amendment to people who are on remand.  They are a specific category and I think that the Minister forgot about them.  Persons who are in prison do not have the right to a solicitor where a person in custody who has been arrested has such right.  They do not have the right to make a phone call and do not have the protections that exist under the regulations governing persons in custody.  The situations are entirely different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister wants to extend these powers to persons in prison, then he should very carefully define the rights of the person in prison and make them clear and identical with those of a person in custody.  If a person is getting a sample taken, because he or she is suspected of an offence for which they have not either been charged or convicted, then they have the same rights as a free citizen outside.  Under this Bill as it stands they would not have those rights.  It seems to me that if a person is suspected of a minor <Col N="358" /> offence &mdash; for instance, of breaking a window &mdash; and of a serious offence such as a crime which follows subsequent to that, then the simple thing to do is charge the person with the offence of breaking a window.  If the person has a record you can say that the person is liable not to turn up and stand trial, remand them and then continue the investigations, not just within 48 hours but when you have sufficient evidence, and then come back when you have your evidence together and do your samples, perhaps a week or a month later.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to open possibilities.  It is not that I believe there is conspiracy, but I believe that the Houses of the Oireachtas are entitled to have legislation presented to them which is precisely drafted to meet only the precise objective that the Government say they want it to meet, and not with a lot of other possibilities that either they have not thought of or that they have decided to ignore.</P>

      <P>Just before I call Senator Norris, I would like to welcome the Mayor-elect of Phoenix, Arizona, Mr. Howard Adams, and his son, Howard, to the House.  He is visiting Ireland on an industrial and tourism promotion and I understand also that Phoenix is twinned with Ennis, County Clare. You are very welcome, Sir.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure we all join in those sentiments of welcome to our distinguished guest.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan has brilliantly amplified the points I was trying, imperfectly, to make and as he does so I find myself more convinced than ever of his correctness.  I used the phrase &ldquo;trawling&rdquo; for further evidence in a situation in which it is perfectly clear that a person in prison is not in the same situation as a person at liberty and that it is quite appropriate to be worried where a citizen is placed on remand.  I, again, return to the fact that there is a presumption of innocence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister is quite incorrect in maintaining that there is an equality of situation between a person in prison and a person at liberty.  Some of the technical <Col N="359" /> legal aspects and ramifications have been placed before the House by Senator Ryan.  I believe the Minister has not taken on board fully the differences in both physical and psychological environment. It is particularly important to make this point on a day when we read in the newspapers that a young member of the travelling community has actually hanged himself in one of our prisons.  The psychological pressure on inmates in our prison system is clearly such that there is a very disturbing rate of suicide in the system and I believe this would certainly be an additional pressure.  Is the Minister prepared to accept an increase in the rate of suicides within the prison system?  Is there in the Department of Justice an acceptable level of suicide?  These are the sort of questions that have to be answered.</P>
    <P>I will not be at all derailed by the kind of impertinent remark the Minister addressed to the House when he said that he wondered who we represent.  He ought to know perfectly well, if he understands the Constitution under which this House of the Oireachtas is established, who we represent because it is laid down there. It is not for him to question in any sense who we represent.  I ask him to withdraw that extraordinary and unjustified remark.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear the Minister state that the provisions of the 1908 Act do not apply to this Bill or, <i>vice versa</i>, that this Bill does not cover that area.  If that is the case, could the Minister explain why we have sections granting powers in relation to minors under the age of 14 &mdash; from the age of criminal responsibility to the age of 14 &mdash; if it is not intended that the provisions of this Bill apply to the 1908 Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, why there are inferences to be drawn in relation to those young people as well?  I am pleased that is the Minister's interpretation but on reading the Act I am still puzzled as to why, then, there should be sections like section 2 (8) (c), why the inferences in section 3 should refer to the same and why there should be a reference in section 5 (2) (b) making <Col N="360" /> provision for the taking of samples from a person who has not attained the age of 17.  I would like further clarification on that point.</P>
    <P>In relation to the taking of samples in prison, the Minister has not in any sense attempted to clarify section 4 (3) (a): &ldquo;...where the sample to be taken is required in connection with an offence other than the offence in respect of which the person is in prison...&rdquo;&mdash; there is a slight misspelling there &mdash; that can mean an offence, obviously, for which the person was arrested and is in prison, but it could be another offence committed outside other than that for which the person would have been put in prison on remand.  Secondly, the second section would suggest an offence on which he could be convicted on indictment alleging that offence, and that could be an offence that could have taken place inside prison.</P>
    <P>So what precisely is he talking about here?  If the offence would be other than the offence for which the person would have been remanded in prison, then surely it is an trawling matter?  Surely the person is being put into custody for the purpose of the samples to be taken in that environment?  A member of the Garda Síochána may take or cause samples to be taken.  At the same time, remember that the prison environment is a totally separate environment.  It is covered by separate legislation, the Official Secrets Act.  It is not subject to the standard laws of this country under the Constitution. Senator Norris referred to the young man who tragically died in prison yesterday. He was on remand and he was under very severe pressures and the maximum sentence he could have received if he was convicted was 12 months.  We can all understand just how different a type of society people in prison live in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ryan mentioned a point about a person on remand, that he cannot be arrested under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, or section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act. The only way a sample can be obtained from them is under the powers provided in this amendment.  It does not matter for <Col N="361" /> this purpose why they are actually on remand.</P>
      <P>In relation to Senator Norris's point, there is no question of trawling.  This amendment is simply and solely for the purpose I mentioned.  There is a limit to what we can do by way of safeguards.  If we water down the provisions any further there would be no point in having them at all.</P>
      <P>In regard to Senator Norris's point about &ldquo;represents&rdquo;, what I am referring to is the general public outside prison. They have the same rights as those of the person in prison.  The person in prison has the same rights as somebody outside prison.  There is a group out there in the population who also have a point of view as well.  That is the point, a Chathaoirligh, I am making in relation to the representation here of the other viewpoint, the viewpoint of the person who is not on remand or not in prison.  The person on remand or in prison has the same safeguards &mdash; I accept that it is a different environment &mdash; as a person who is free. That is in the Bill.</P>
      <P>In relation to Senator Costello's point that the power to take samples should be restricted to indictable offences, the offences which attract the power to take samples are only those to which section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, or section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, apply and which carry a penalty of five years.  The provision in the Bill about 17-years-olds is there to safeguard young persons outside of prison, just as they safeguard young persons in prison if that arises.  I feel that the fears being expressed by the Senators are genuinely unfounded.  The safeguards here apply to all citizens equally.  That is why the amendments are there.  That is our case and the argument we put forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe in being repetitious on Committee Stage but I do believe that when a Minister lands an amendment &mdash; I do not want to start a row about it &mdash; on the House at relatively short notice, we are entitled to considerable latitude in discussing what it means.  I do not know whether the Minister knows this, but if somebody is detained under section 30 of the Offences Against the Stage Act for 48 hours on a particular offence, then the Garda will have considerable difficulty in repeating that operation a second time without running into considerable problems with the courts.  You cannot keep on re-arresting somebody under suspicion of the same offence under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, any more than I believe the Garda could do under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  The courts will not tolerate repeated re-arresting of people under the provisions of this legislation.  Therefore, there is a very specific provision which protects the rights of the citizen.  In the case of a person in prison, there is no such provision.  The context is different, the atmosphere is different, the sense of having a right taken away is different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me there is a very good case for saying, for instance, that the only offences that could be referred to in the amendment would be offences of which the person was not suspected at the time they entered prison.  For instance, if a new offence arises for which the Garda have reasonable suspicion after the person has entered prison, then the Minister has a case.  What is not given here is any guarantee that a person will be charged on one offence, remanded in custody on one offence and then if there are a number of other offences of which they are suspected and they have not got around to investigating, where they have not got around to getting the forensic samples back perhaps from the victim, they can hang on a while if the person is remanded in custody and when they are ready go through them <i>seriatum</i> one after another.  Since the provisions are for a variety of samples, they could look for a blood sample one week, a urine sample <Col N="363" /> some other time, a sample of saliva another time, a sample of nail another time, depending on the forensic evidence that became available over a period of time and depending on how their forensic people work.</P>
    <P>It seems to me it is an entirely different context from that of a person who is arrested under section 30 on suspicion and is then kept for 48 hours and then either has to be charged or released and cannot be re-arrested on suspicion of the same offence in a short period of time.  It is extremely important to remember that.</P>
    <P>The other thing to remember is that the provisions of Offences Against the State Act, in so far as they apply to scheduled offences, are a fairly wide operation. I do not know whether people realise it or not, but malicious damage to property is a scheduled offence under the Offences Against the State Act, and that is a fine, sweeping one to enable people to be arrested and charged under a large variety of offences.</P>
    <P>While the Minister may feel he has answered the questions, we are only beginning to understand the questions, because the amendment is late and, in my view, is quite poorly drafted.  It deserves at very least to be withdrawn, reconsidered, and the Minister can reintroduce a better worded amendment on Report Stage.  That is what I suggest he should do simply to meet the precise demands he thinks need to be met by the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Ryan, I do not wish to be repetitious but I have about five points I would like to make. The first one is that the Minister can &mdash; and this has happened in the past &mdash; come back on Report Stage with some consideration of the argument that has been made in the House this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is that this Bill and these amendments really bear quite a lot of relation to the Offences Against the State Act, which springs from the emergency which was declared in 1939 and never repealed.  It is all legislation that comes in under that general body.  That <Col N="364" /> is the general context in which it is placed. That clearly implies that there is at least, as originally conceived, some possible political dimension and it is clear that in trials involving people who would consider themselves to be political activists we have an interesting context because the Minister, I am sure, will recall the campaigns against strip-searching in prisons. This is well worth bearing in mind in the context of these amendments.  I would like also to point out that if the procedures of taking intimate samples are not carried out under the provisions of this legislation they would themselves constitute a criminal offence.  It would be assault.</P>

There is only one final point I wish to make, that is to comment on something the Minister said. He spoke about the purpose of the Bill and the purpose of the amendments.  I accept, of course, that the purpose of the amendments may well be a good one and one whose intention is beneficial to the community, but that does not mean that the existence of this purpose or intent on the part of those drafting the Bill is not capable of being abused.  It is not just sufficient to say that the purpose of the amendment is such and such.  Here, particularly in a revising Chamber, we have to scrutinise the Bill in order to excise from it the possibility of abuse, I believe that is what we are trying to do here this afternoon.</P>

      <P>I would like to commence the debate by suggesting that we can deal with this point of view on Report Stage. I accept that the amendments came late. There was a difficulty in the Attorney General's office in getting them out.  The fact is that the points that are being put forward here by Senators can be considered by the Department of Justice in advance of Report Stage of this Bill.  I am <Col N="366" /> not giving any encouragement to the view that there may be any changes.  Nevertheless the views put forward here by the Senators will be considered by the Department of Justice and the Minister in advance of Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I feel, generally, the safeguards are in the Bill.  I am quite satisfied about that and about the amendments and I suggest we could move on with this Bill because we cannot add anything further.  The Senators have put their points of view, their concerns and anxieties, which they have expressed sincerely, on the record of this House.

      <P>I have a difficulty on which I hope the Chair can help me. The only matters which can come up on Report Stage are matters which have been raised but not disposed of on Committee Stage.  Does that mean that if this amendment is passed as at present worded we have effectively disposed of the matter raised, in which case it cannot be discussed on Report Stage, or do we need to have this amendment not moved by the Minister on this occasion?  If the amendment is moved, my understanding of Standing Orders is that it disposes of this matter, in which case no amendments on Report Stage are possible.  It seems if we are going to do what the Minister wants us to do, the reasonable thing is not to push the amendment at this stage and to leave it until Report Stage.</P>

I would like clarification from you.  I do not want to put the Leas Chathaoirleach on a spot so soon in his career but I need clarification.

      <P>In relation to the 1908 Children Act, I was not referring specifically to under 17 years, although I have concern there as well, but to those under 14 years and to the provision made for imprisonment under that Act and whether, because of the powers granted here in relation to the taking of samples, the forceful taking of samples in certain cases, and the inferences that can be drawn, the full force of this legislation will apply to minors between the ages of 7 and 14.  That has not been addressed by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has agreed to take the Bill back to the Department and the Minister for Justice to have a look at it again.  We have heard the views which have been expressed by all those sincere people who are genuinely interested and concerned with it and we should now move on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the point.  Is the Minister not moving the amendment today, because if he is not we are wasting our time and we should <Col N="368" /> move on.  He has been extremely helpful in that case and we can move on.  If he is insisting upon us taking a decision to insert this amendment in the Bill then, as far as I am concerned, under Standing Orders the matter is disposed of.  I do not know how we can come back to it on Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation in reply to Senator Costello is that it applies to minors with the same parental safeguards as in the Bill.  The safeguards are there with parental supervision, etc. and agreement I want.  The undertaking I am giving is that the Minister will be made aware of the points of view expressed by the Senators here and on Report Stage the Senators may put forward amendments and the Minister would also be entitled to put forward amendments if he wishes. I am not raising any hopes in this regard because we have assessed this very carefully. I am totally satisfied with the safeguards in this Bill, I am totally satisfied with the amendments which we have put forward which will strengthen this Bill and I am quite satisfied that this matter should be put before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is being very honest and open with us.  He is clearly saying that there will be a token gesture and no more.  There is not a hope in &mdash; I do not know whether you can mention certain places within these august precincts&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>My view is that I could not see any change in these amendments but if Senators can put forward suitable amendments to be considered by the Government and the Minister I would certainly not rule that out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister.  I would like to make a point.  I am <Col N="369" /> interested in the Minister's response to Senator Costello on the question of the rights of children and young people, as covered by certain sections here.  The Minister has brought another concern to my mind.  It seems to me he really does not understand the difference between being in prison and not being in prison. I hope the Minister has never had the experience of being in prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Nor the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Nor myself.  I will draw a discreet veil.  There is room for concern, for example, because the Minister spoke about the parental safeguards, the presence of parents and so on.  I am sure he knows perfectly well that in certain of the more deprived sections of the community &mdash; in particular I will come back to thinking of the travellers and so on &mdash; economically and geographically it is simply not possible very often for them to be present.  In the most vulnerable sections of the community there is certainly as far as I am concerned, a considerable worry that frightened children may be left on their own, that although they have a right to have parents present they may not have them present.  The Minister has inadvertently illustrated the concern of people like myself that there is once again here a form of class justice.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to refresh my memory on a very basic point.  My recollection is that it is possible for somebody to withhold consent but the withholding of consent may be construed in a certain fashion in court.  Will the Minister refresh my memory on this point and tell me if I am correct, that there is the possibility of withholding consent but a certain constriction may be placed by the court on that refusal?</P>

      <P>An intimate sample cannot be taken from a young person under 17 years of age unless his parents or guardian consents whether that person is in prison or not.  That is a provision of the Bill.  If the parent or guardian refuses to allow the sample to be taken, this cannot be used against the young person.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision in the legislation is that a parent or guardian has to give consent &mdash; that is in the Bill &mdash; for a person in custody or a person outside of the prison system.  Again, I put emphasis on those not in prison.  A majority of the population are not in prison and this Bill applies to them as well.  Let us not lose sight of that.  This is very important legislation. It is vitally important that we have every possible opportunity for the Garda Síochána to use the Bill as it is set out for those outside prison of those inside prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said a few minutes ago that the provisions of this Bill apply to minders.  He said earlier that the provisions of the 1908 Act do not apply so I am puzzled as to what precisely is the connection between the provisions of this Bill and the provisions of the 1908 Children Act.  As I see it, the provisions of this Bill can result in children under the age of 14 going to prison and there is provision for that in the 1908 Children Act.  Is it envisaged that the powers given here could lead to a child between seven and 14 years going to prison?  I still have not got an answer from the Minister on that and I certainly would like one.</P>
      <P>In relation to the other matter the Minister has just raised, we have an amendment in relation to intimate samples being taken with or without the permission of a parent or guardian.  Even so, they are intimate samples taken from a child.  If a parent or guardian grants that, he can be granting an assault on a child. That is a serious matter.  The fact that permission is given by a parent or guardian does not affect the fact that it is still an assault.</P>

      <P>The provisions do not affect the 1908 Children Bill.  That is my advice on the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three precise questions I want to ask the Minister.  The first is, can he confirm he has advice from the best sources that the phrase &ldquo;the offence in respect of which the person is in prison&rdquo; covers people who are on remand?  I cannot understand how a person can be in prison for an offence which it has not been proved he has committed. At the very most he is in prison on suspicion of the offence for which he is suspected.  I thought those people would be on remand not because of an offence but for two other reasons, that they may not turn up or they may intimidate witnesses.  You are not remanded because of the offence, you are remanded because of two other reasons.  That is the first question.  I would like to get specific, clear information from the Minister that the phrase there means what he thinks it means because I am not at all convinced.</P>
      <P>The second question is, will the Minister not concede that as the Bill stands there is no obligation on the authorities to inform a person that he may refuse consent?  The Labour Party to their great credit have an amendment to that effect but there is no obligation to inform a person that he may refuse consent.  In an authoritarian system where people are in the position, as the Guildford Four have so graphically described, of expecting to be given orders about everything they do and everything they should do, how in heaven's name are people going to know they may refuse consent if they are not so informed?  I need specific clarification on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Now I understand why the Minister did not address the question the Senator and I raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Staunton)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the question put by Senator Ryan is, yes.  The sample <Col N="372" /> is not taken because they are in remand. It could be taken if they were free.  This is the kernel of this Bill.</P>
      <P>There is such an obligation in section 3 of the Bill in relation to the two questions put by Senator Ryan.  I will say again that I am satisfied with the amendments which we have put forward and I recommend them to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>What really is required there is to make a distinction.  Section 4 (3) (a) is quite confusing on what precisely is the situation in relation to a remand prisoner, and somebody who has been convicted.  The Minister has been asked to clarify the further provisions in the Bill in relation to consent, about which there is no reference in this section whatsoever.  There is confusion as to what precisely is the offence mentioned in the first part of paragraph (a) and what is the provision &mdash; there does not seem to be one &mdash; in relation to a prisoner being entitled to be told about consent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the point put by Senator Ryan, subsection (1) of the section should not have any effect in relation to an accused unless he has been told in ordinary language by a member of the Garda Síochána while seeking his consent that the sample was required for the purpose of forensic testing, that his consent was necessary and then if his consent was not given the effect of refusal <Col N="373" /> by him, as covered in the section.  It is quite clear the person would be informed exactly of his rights.</P>

It is unacceptable as it stands.</P>

      <P>I found the Minister's explanation unsatisfactory.  I cannot understand why he simply did not postpone a decision on this, refer the matter back and if he wants, come back, having clarified the questions raised, on Report Stage and since we can only speak once on Report Stage he will have it through very quickly.  It is not, in my view, the way to do it, I will be seeking the best advice I can get on the phrase &ldquo;the events in respect of which the person is in prison&rdquo; because I am not satisfied that the advice that I would get would conform with that of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 29, after &ldquo;forensic testing&rdquo; to delete &ldquo;all or&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to give more precision to this legislation.  As the section is drafted, it can mean that any individual person who is being tested for the purpose of this Bill could have 11 different tests perpetrated on him.  The Minister in his opening remarks referred to the extra efficiency and the scientific progress that has been made in relation to forensic testing and it would seem to be unnecessary that a single individual who would come under suspicion should be subjected to that quantity of sample taking.  Also, it should be noted that many of the samples are taken compulsorily as provided in this section; some would be taken compulsorily; some with consent; some under medical supervision; some without medical supervision; some would be taken from minors <Col N="377" /> and children with the consent of guardians or parents.  Again this is an area where civil liberties are very much at risk. The purpose of this amendment is to seek to ensure that there is no serious infringement of body integrity and civil liberties and of minors who would be subjected to such tests.  It is an attempt to be more precise and to ensure that the very wide nature of these provisions is not allowed to operate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be no point in deleting &ldquo;all or&rdquo;.  To do so would not change the meaning of the provision in section 2 (1) and would be misleading in that the fact that the amendment was made might suggest that the member of the Garda Síochána was being limited to taking one sample.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I state that that is not or could not be constructed by what remains in the phrase, &ldquo;for the purpose of forensic testing, any of the following samples...&rdquo;.  There is no way whereby &ldquo;any of the following samples&rdquo; could be construed as limiting the Garda Síochána to a single sample.</P>
      <P>What I am seeking to prevent here is the harassment that could arise where somebody could be taken into custody under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, detained for 24 hours and, on the direction of a Garda Superintendent, that could be extended for a further 24 hours or taken into custody under the Criminal Justice Act, where they can be held for eight hours, extended by six hours, extended by another six hours.  The powers under those two Acts are extremely wide.  Persons could be subjected to continuous sampling and testing, many of which are very embarrassing, would be infringements of body integrity if they were not covered by a Bill of this nature and which can be perpetrated on minors and children over the age of seven years.  It is improper for legislation to be passed in such manner as to give wide powers that are so blatantly open to abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, of course, <Col N="378" /> has a point.  If we were dealing here with ordinary legislation to do with ordinary matters, then precise wordings like this would not trouble me at all but what we are dealing with here is something entirely different.  We are dealing with considerable rights to infringe in ways that are quite unusual.  It is important to say that the technological advances and the analytical techniques that have developed do make some of these things necessary and the possibility of catching offenders, particularly people who have committed serious offences, does in principle, justify the use of these powers. However, you only have to look at the record, the unfortunate but regular record of misuse of the Offences Against the State Act, with close to 90 per cent of those who are arrested never being charged with anything, or the extraordinary events that occurred in this country when President Reagan was here which resulted in 30 women being compensated with sums ranging from £1,000 to £3,000 or £4,000, by the State out of court for unlawful arrest, to realise that we do not operate in a perfect society any more than anybody else does.  Therefore, it is necessary that legislation which gives powers to do things to people should be written in as crisp and as tight language as possible and catch-all phrases which cover a multitude of possibilities, are not the way to do it.  I will return, when we get to the section, to some of the other rather more serious matters that are contained in the section and which deserve to be elaborated on.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello is perfectly right in endeavouring to have this legislation written with the sort of precision that unfortunately does not characterise legislation that has come from the Department of Justice either in recent times or further back.  If they get the chance, they want to give as much power as possible and then it is a case of &ldquo;trust me.  I know what I am doing&rdquo; from then on.  I am not entirely happy with that approach, I must say.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;All or any&rdquo; is used as a phrase and my advice is that this is an <Col N="379" /> appropriate phrase to use.  It was inserted by the parliamentary draftsman.  I understand the point being made but the technical advice is that it is an appropriate phrase to use.  If a member of the Garda Síochána sought for the purpose of harassment to take repeated samples he would at least be in serious breach of discipline.  Remember that the taking of each sample requires the written authorisation of a superintendent of the Garda Síochána.  A case could not be possible unless he was proposed to be a party to it.</P>
      <P>We have said enough, a LeasChathaoirligh, in relation to this matter. We feel it is essential to retain &ldquo;all or any&rdquo; in the Bill and we are not agreeing to the amendment being put forward by the Senators involved.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand the tenor of the Minister's remarks.  The Minister has stated that this is a most effective manner of testing.  It is a huge stride in revolutionising forensic testing.  I understood from the Minister that each of these samples and methods is sufficient to enable accurate findings to be made.  If one includes &ldquo;all&rdquo;, that is leaving it open to abuse and it is undermining what has already been said in relation to the effectiveness of this new type of testing.  I cannot see why the Garda would want to have the excessive freedom &mdash; that is the only way I could describe it &mdash; of having the word &ldquo;all&rdquo; inserted in this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions included in the Bill are at the recommendation of the parliamentary draftsman who feels that it would not be satisfactory unless they were included in the Bill and in the section.  I emphasise that if a garda sought, for the purpose of harassment, to take repeated samples he would be in very serious breach of discipline.  He must receive consent of the superintendent before he can take actual samples.  Abuse would not be possible unless the superintendent was proposed to be party to it.  The fears being expressed are rightly expressed but they are unfounded and <Col N="380" /> the words should be included in the Bill. We propose not to agree with the amendment.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister suggest to me any circumstances under which all of those would need to be taken?  Is there any conceivable offence where you would need blood, pubic hair, urine, saliva, hair other than pubic hair, a nail, any material found under a nail, a swab from any part of the body other than a swab from a body orifice or a genital region, a dental impression, a footprint, and so on?  Can the Minister suggest any circumstances or offence which has been known in the cavernous archives of the Department of Justice for the last 60 years which would need all of those samples to be taken. What are we at?  Let the Minister not quote the parliamentary draftsman.  I have been in this House too long to take the parliamentary draftsmen too seriously.  They have their substantial collection of errors and misreadings and there has been legislation passed through this House which I am certain neither I, the Minister nor his civil servants understood and ultimately we were told that it was the form the parliamentary draftsman suggested.  We should have reasons why things are necessary.  There must be a practical reason for something, or else we should not have it.  Why would anybody ever need all of these?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said the parliamentary draftsman believes that phrase &ldquo;all or&rdquo; should be included.  It is not for us to accept the wording of the parliamentary draftsman and the opinion of the parliamentary draftsman.  We are the legislators.  If it is our opinion that that wording is too wide, that is what counts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to what the Minister said, that it would be carried out by a member of the Garda Síochána with the sanction or authorisation of a superintendent, I do not know what that means, because I have never known a case under the Offences Against the State Act or the Criminal Justice Act where a superintendent has refused authorisation.  That <Col N="381" /> is a mere formality, and that is not a safeguard.  That is not a protection.  There is nothing sacrosanct about the wording of a parliamentary draftsman either.</P>

      <P>It would seem to me that what we need more is the opinion of a forensic scientist than a parliamentary draftsman as to why you would need to obtain information from all the samples, for example, blood, urine, saliva, etc.  My knowledge of physiology, such as it is, would indicate that in the vast range of circumstances I can think of the levels of material in all of those three fluids should very closely parallel one another.</P>
      <P>I have difficulty visualising why you would need to get a blood sample, a urine sample and a saliva sample.  The only purpose I can see for doing that is to confirm that the levels of whatever you are interested in in those substances would parallel one another.  There is a danger that they can be used &mdash; it does not say anything about where the blood sample would be taken from.  Can we not visualise a set of circumstances where the blood sample would be taken from very unpleasant parts of the body?  Is there anything in here to stop it happening? There are precedents of persons who suggest to medical practitioners in Garda stations late at night, after they have had a bottle of stout or two over the mark, that they should obtain blood samples from all sorts of obscure parts of their anatomy.  I am concerned that these possibilities exist and that the possibility of outrageous humiliating behaviour is not properly excluded in the terms being proposed by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>A single sample may not be enough.  Blood might be required together with a hair, nail clipping and some other samples.  Different samples are needed for different tests.  It is unlikely that all the tests will be required, <Col N="382" /> but we want to give the Bill strength, not to have it limited in any way.  Referring to the Senator's point in relation to reading the section, if you remove &ldquo;all or&rdquo;&mdash; and we are advised strongly not to remove that &mdash; it would make the Bill less effective.  We have been strongly advised by the draftsman and the specialists in this field.  Nothing has been put forward in the Seanad which would convince me not to take the advice of the experts in this field.  I am standing by our view on the amendment and we are opposing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I always have trouble dealing with legislation from the Department of Justice.  I have a different experience of the world from other people.  I am not sure why.  Legislation, particularly legislation that has an impact on the Offences Against the State Act, is abused regularly.  As recently as last Thursday night, a young man of 19 who was at a meeting where I spoke was stopped by a garda afterwards and asked for his name and address, and when he asked why, the Garda said, &ldquo;because we suspect you of being a member of an illegal organisation&rdquo;. The young man is no more in an illegal organisation than I am.  He happened to be at a meeting to deal with the Gibraltar Three and, therefore, became a suspect and was stopped and questioned and had his name and address taken.  He was quite frightened.  When I met him he was pale and his voice was trembling.  Those things happen.  This is an intelligent, interested, young man who came to a meeting that was publicly advertised.  This happens regularly, it does not happen in large numbers and things like this can be abused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no time for experts.  If the experts are so sure that the Garda need those powers, they should have given the Minister the evidence &mdash; not their opinion &mdash; on which they came to the conclusion that they were necessary.  Experts who simply say, &ldquo;Trust me, I know what I am doing&rdquo;, should never be trusted because if they cannot tell you what they are doing in clear, simple English, they do not know what they are doing.  They are simply <Col N="383" /> covering all their options.  It would be more helpful to give one specific case where all those samples would be necessary. Otherwise you come back to the suspicion that we are being had and that this is just a catchall in case they might, maybe they will, and if they should need it.</P>
    <P>It is not going to make an enormous difference, but there is the question of intent in legislation and how it will work in ten, 20 or 50 years time.  If these phrases are not tightened up now, they can have all sorts of different meanings over the years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the concern the Senators are expressing, but I wonder if we are looking at it from the wrong point of view?  This is in one sense quite a major change in relation to forensic evidence.  In another sense it is following up something we did many years ago when we brought in finger printing. We now seem to be entering into an era in which it will be possible to have specific information of a physiological nature, as the Senator indicated, which might indeed prove someone's guilt but might also quite conceivably be specific proof of the innocence of that individual.  I would prefer to see a comprehensive series of samples being available as much for the defence as for the prosecution to ensure that the correct answer is derived at the end of the day.  I sympathise with the emotional feeling but I must say I would be very concerned to see the word &ldquo;all&rdquo; removed.  I am not just thinking from the point of view of the Garda Síochána or the prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied from the information at my disposal, and from reading the Bill, that &ldquo;all or any&rdquo; should be included.  Some of the issues being raised are red herrings in relation to this issue.  The phrase &ldquo;all or any&rdquo; is used for drafting reasons and there is no danger arising from its use.  What safeguards are needed are already provided in the Bill. I am quite satisfied in relation to it and it would take from the Bill if those words <Col N="384" /> were deleted.  I do not think I can add anything further to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is appropriate for the Minister to describe our concerns in relation to this matter as being a red herring.  We are concerned when substantial new legislation is being put in place in relation to suspects about the powers being granted to the Garda authorities which may have a bearing on constitutional rights.  It is a very serious matter.  There is no question of a red herring being introduced.  We are attempting to be constructive and we would like the Minister to be equally approachable in the sense that he should accept the amendments we have put forward and look at them in a sympathetic way because we are trying to be helpful. I am not satisfied with the Minister's justification for this phrase, that his parliamentary draftsman thought it was necessary.  The parliamentary draftsman is only dealing with the technicalities of the Bill but we are concerned with the substance which is appropriate both to forensic scientists and to us as legislators. We are the only experts who are dealing with this.  Our concern is related to the people who will be the subject of these provisions.  Ours is a very real concern.  I do not think it is satisfactory to take the word of the parliamentary draftsman or to cite him as the authority in relation to this matter.  It is certainly not satisfactory to me.</P>
      <P>The point has been made that the word &ldquo;all&rdquo; should be substituted by the word &ldquo;some&rdquo; but what we have done by deleting the words &ldquo;all or&rdquo; is to leave in &ldquo;any&rdquo; which is more than one but not the entirety.  That gives the discretion to take a sample from the list given.  That would in fact, make the Bill much more precise and better legislation.  We are trying to be helpful and we would certainly appreciate it if the Minister accepted that useful amendment.</P>

      <P>I appreciate what Senator Costello is saying but even if somebody took all of those samples I do not think it would be a terrible infringement upon <Col N="385" /> the integrity of the body.  A blood sample is a pin prick, one pulls out a public hair, one urineates into a sample jar, one spits for saliva, one pulls out a hair, one clips off a bit of nail or one takes a sample from under the nail.  The whole thing is over in five minutes.  One may give a dental impression or a footprint.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole thing would be over in five minutes.  I know the Senator is concerned but I think he is making a mountain out of a molehill.  If he had any argument to make at all it should be in relation to a sample of a nail as in subsection (1) (vi).  The way that is written it gives the police permission to pull out a nail.  Apart from that, the samples are not strong infringements of the body. I admit that a swab from the genital region may be embarrassing but, as Senator Conroy said, it would be nicer to find out that somebody was innocent from this swab than to find out that he or she was guilty.  It may just prove people's innocence as well as their guilt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not a fundamental assumption that people are innocent until they are proved guilty?  People do not have to establish innocence.  That is taken as read and there is no need for any of these samples to be taken to establish innocence.  As I understand it, innocence is taken for granted.  These samples are designed to establish guilt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Senator's point but there could be a situation in which, for example, someone is accused unjustly of a sexual assault and it might be possible by these forensic tests <Col N="386" /> to prove without any question whatsoever that that person is totally and completely innocent.  Under the present tests that might not be possible.  I agree that everyone should and is presumed innocent before the law.</P>

      <P>I should like to extend and explain what is going on here.  Will the Minister who has the full advice of the Department of Justice &mdash; I know they know an awful lot, but they do not tell us much &mdash; explain the position of a person who is detained as a suspect, who is seven, nine or ten years old, and whose parent or guardian has given consent? Many of the law and order lobby are very big into making speeches about parental negligence and if they are to be logical they must assume that those negligent parents will be so disinterested they will give consent to anything to avoid trouble. Why should they have a swab taken from the genital region?  Why would it be considered necessary to take a swab from a nine year old child?  What would be required that could not be obtained in some other way?  What sort of overpowering law and order reason would suggest that one would need to take a swab from the vagina of a nine year old girl?  Will the Minister give me a good reason for that other than this preoccuption with all or everything at all occasions under all circumstances?  I am not suggesting it will happen regularly but why do we need the power put into legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ryan is raising these hypothetical cases to try to enhance his views about the need for this amendment. I am certainly not impressed by his arguments.  All the samples have to be approved by a superintendent of the Garda Síochána and logic would dictate the type of samples to be taken in the appropriate cases.  The point he is raising is inappropriate and I do not think it will arise.  We cannot provide for hypothetical cases that may arise in the future.  The provision gives the Garda Síochána the flexibility to take any of the particular samples they require, all or any.  It is <Col N="387" /> reasonable wording.  Irrespective of the view of the parliamentary draftsman, I am quite satisfied with the wording in the Bill and I would not be in favour of removing those words.  From my experience over a number of years, I am satisfied that those words should remain part of the Bill.  The removal of &ldquo;all or&rdquo; could take seriously from the effectiveness of this legislation and create difficulties when the Bill becomes law.  I am not accepting the arguments put forward; I am not accepting the amendments and I want the words &ldquo;all or&rdquo; included in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said difficulties could be created if the two words are deleted.  Will he detail some or any of the difficulties that might arise?  The Minister referred to a hypothetical situation as being inappropriate but could he give us a single hypothetical situation where all of these samples would be required?  We would be satisfied to hear of his hypothetical situation where all of these would be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to engage in a debate in relation to what may arise in relation to this Bill.  If we delete &ldquo;all or&rdquo; the words &ldquo;any of the following samples&rdquo; would remain.  Would &ldquo;any&rdquo; mean just one?  If we delete the words the Senator is suggesting we should delete &ldquo;all or&rdquo;, and the wording would be &ldquo;any of the following samples, namely...&rdquo;&ldquo;Any&rdquo; could be interpreted as just one. That is a reasonable point of view.  We do not want any misunderstanding about this Bill.  As Senators Conroy and Lydon have pointed out, numerous samples may be required and they may be to the benefit of the accused.  I am sure the Senators do not want to see the Bill being less effective, damaging to the accused or restricting the Garda Síochána from taking more than one sample.  That is why &ldquo;all or&rdquo; should remain part of the Bill and why we are supporting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's explanation has reinforced my point.  He is saying <Col N="388" /> that if &ldquo;all or&rdquo; was taken out, then &ldquo;any&rdquo; could be subject to an interpretation meaning one.  In fact, he is suggesting that &ldquo;some&rdquo; would be the correct meaning for the provision.  That is precisely what we are looking for.  There is no reason why the Minister cannot go back to his parliamentary draftsman to get an amendment along those lines.  I do not accept his statement that &ldquo;any&rdquo; is restricted to one; if may mean &ldquo;some&rdquo; If he can have it clarified he should do so.  We are seeking to delete the catch-all phrase &ldquo;all&rdquo;.  We cannot even envisage a hypothetical situation here or in the future. We want a reasonably precise provision to ensure that possible abuses that could arise will be prevented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am beginning to be somewhat astonished by the Senator. There are very obvious circumstances where these would be necessary, going back to the example of an horrific sexual assault and these, sadly, do occur.  In such circumstances it might be essential to prove the guilt, or hopefully confirm the innocence, of an individual rightly or wrongly suspected of some horrific crime or series of crimes, to be able to obtain a sample of blood, a sample of pubic hair, a sample of urine, a sample of saliva, a sample of hair other than pubic hair, a nail sample, material from under the nail, swabs, dental impressions and footprints. Each and every one of those might be required, or any combination of them or any single one.  It is essential that &ldquo;all&rdquo; should be retained in this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Conroy.  That is precisely the position. Any watering down of this provision or removal of the words &ldquo;all or&rdquo; could take from the effectiveness of the Bill. &ldquo;Some&rdquo; could mean one; it could mean more.  The words &ldquo;all or any&rdquo; are vitally important for this section.  I have nothing further to add.  We could go on for quite a length of time splitting hairs on hypothetical situations that may arise in the future.  Where a member of the Garda Síochána gets permission from the superintendent to take a number of samples <Col N="389" /> the flexibility must be there, even in the unlikely hypothetical extreme situations that may arise in the future.  We should not use this Bill to restrict at that stage the taking of all or any of the samples mentioned in section 2.</P>

      <P>I should like to put one final point to the Minister.  Senator Conroy in half a minute made a much clearer case for the Minister's view than the Minister made.  I do not mean any offence to the Minister.  Will he explain how the Garda, who are not forensic scientists, are going to know that they do not need all the samples if the word &ldquo;all&rdquo; is inserted?  How are they going to know they will only need blood rather than pubic hair, or are they, since the word &ldquo;all&rdquo; is inserted in the Bill, going to take all samples as a matter of course?  They will not be in a position technically speaking to make a distinction between what they need because they will not have the technological know-how.  If the word &ldquo;all&rdquo; is inserted, why will they not under routine circumstances take all those samples because they will not know which ones they will need and which ones they will not need?</P>

      <P>Senator Conroy has been helpful in giving a hypothetical case and we are thankful for that.  That hypothetical case would seem to relate purely to the area of where a rape or an indecent assault might have occurred.  Again, what we are anxious to point out is that the provisions in the Bill refer to the Offences Against the State Act and the Criminal Justice Act, which contain very wide-ranging powers.  We know that in the past there have been abuses in relation to suspects, the manner in which they were taken into custody and so on.  The point we are trying to make is that the Bill should be precise.  The Minister can envisage a hypothetical situation in relation to a specific offence but in the broad area of offences covered by the Bill, it would be extremely difficult to envisage hypothetical situations other than the one Senator Conroy pointed out. We want the Minister to look at the wording again and see whether an appropriate wording can be found to incorporate the requirements of the Garda in relation to crime and dealing with a suspect without going overboard.</P>

I have great confidence in the professionalism of the serious crimes section of the Garda Síochána who have available forensic facilities to investigate crime.

    <P>What we are seeking to delete are the words: &ldquo;a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent authorises it to be taken&rdquo;.  We want to replace them with these words &ldquo;a district justice authorises it to be taken, and&rdquo;.  I <Col N="392" /> referred earlier to the fact that the authorisation has to be given by a superintendent. It is my experience, and I would like the Minister to confirm or to deny this, that there is no recorded instance of superintendents refusing to authorise requests from gardaí in relation to the powers conferred on them in the Offence Against the State Act and the Criminal Justice Act for an extension of detention from 24 to 48 hours or from six to 12 hours.  If the Minister has information on that I would certainly welcome it.</P>
    <P>It is my belief, arising out of contacts with people over many years in these matters, including lawyers, that the inclusion of the word &ldquo;superintendent&rdquo; gives the impression of great authority and weight being given to the authorisation but that, in fact, it is a mere formality.  Therefore, we are anxious that some real weight &mdash; we are operating in the real world &mdash; should be given.  That is why the amendment seeks to substitute a &ldquo;district justice&rdquo; for a &ldquo;superintendent&rdquo;. Then we would know the reason for the action rather than a matter of opinion or something being done on the nod after a telephone call by the superintendent.  There should be substantial reasons.  We want to ensure that there is equity.</P>

      <P>We are not accepting the amendment.  A person may be detained under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 for a period of six hours or, if an extension is authorised by a Garda superintendent, for a maximum of 12 hours.  If a bodily sample is required it must be taken during this period.  It may be impossible to locate a district justice during such a short period to grant an authorisation.  Even if a justice can be located it may take some time and a person may, as a result, have to be detained in custody for longer than would otherwise be necessary, which is obviously undesirable.  In any event there is an implication in the amendment that a member of the Garda of superintendent rank cannot be trusted to exercise this function and this I cannot accept.</P>

      <P>The implication is not that he cannot be trusted.  The implication is that there are no recorded statistics available anywhere that will tell us the circumstances, the number of times the authority given to the superintendent has been exercised and the number of times it has been refused.  From my contacts with the legal profession I have been informed that this is a matter that, as I said, goes through on the nod.  It is a mere formality and the weight that seems to be attached to the office of the superintendent is only there in appearance and not in reality.  We want to ensure that there is some substantial authority and some means to ensure it is not a mere formality.  The Minister has said it would be difficult to have district justices available. It should be remembered that at present district justices are more available than they used to be.  There are evening and morning sittings of the courts.  The period for which somebody can be detained is 12 hours.  It is unlikely that a district justice could not be found during a period of time when a person is detained.</P>

      <P>I think there is reason to worry always that legislation which appears to have considerable safeguards built into it can become <i>passé</i> and be taken for granted with time, the classic example being the Offences Against the State Act.  Less than 20 years ago 90 per cent of those arrested under the Offences Against the State Act were charged with an offence.  In recent years there has been a switch in the opposite direction and the figure is about 10 per cent.  It is the same Garda officers who are authorising the detentions and their concept of reasonable suspicion which is what is needed in order to detain somebody has elongated itself from a position where nine out of ten of those who were arrested were charged to a position where one out of ten of those arrested is charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunately on the record in the case of a girl &mdash; the rules of the House prevents me from naming her &mdash; who was arrested outside a Fine Gael Árd Fheis because she was causing trouble under <Col N="394" /> the Offences Against the State Act on the grounds that the Garda officer who was a superintendent suspected she was a member of an illegal organisation.  She subsequently was paid compensation for unlawful arrest.  I mention this not because I want to be knocking the gardaí but because I think both sides of a case deserve to be heard.  There is a good case for taking an assessment like this away from those who are under considerable pressure to produce results and into the hands of those whose job it is to dispense justice.</P>
    <P>It is simply a question of a member of the Garda satisfying a district justice that this is necessary in order to investigate an offence.  I do not understand this resistance to doing it.  I do not accept the practical problems.  Practical problems of this nature can easily be disposed of if people want to: what are important are the principles involved.  The principle involved here is that a significant decision to intrude on somebody's bodily integrity, as this would perhaps dictate, is something that needs an external guiding hand to keep it under control.</P>

      <P>I am not convinced at all by the cases being put forward by Senators Ryan or Costello.  Section 2 (5) states:</P>
      <P>(5) An authorisation under subsection (2) (a) of this section may be given orally but if it is given orally, it shall be confirmed in writing as soon as is practicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The superintendent has to provide written confirmation that the authorisation was given.  It would be in impracticable to insist that a district justice should be contacted.  In fact, it may be impossible to locate one within that period of time. I do not think we should create difficulties to make this Bill effective.  I have total confidence in a superintendent of the Garda Síochána giving the authorisation. I do not see why there should be any question about the superintendent's position in relation to this legislation.  I am not agreeing at all with the amendment. We are satisfied that the Act, <Col N="395" /> which includes superintendents, is quite satisfactory and that, in fact, the requirement for district justices would be totally impractical and could delay the effectiveness of this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister if he had any statistics in relation to authorisation granted by superintendents in the provisions that are mentioned here &mdash; the Offences Against the State Act and the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 &mdash; as to how the superintendent exercises the authority given to him in those cases. How can the Minister state he has absolute faith that this will operate properly if he is not able to quote any incidences and where there is no recording or monitoring of the operation of the authority granted by superintendents in comparable areas? What we are talking about here is great powers being given.</P>
      <P>The Minister has stated that in section 2 he will not delete the phrase we wish to delete, so that now the great powers extend to the granting of samples in all of those areas that infringe the bodily integrity of an individual, including a child as young as seven years of age.  They are great powers and what we want to ensure is that there is proper authority. When I say &ldquo;proper authority&rdquo; I do not mean that there is improper authority in relation to superintendents, but that there would be further authority outside of the Garda Síochána themselves, and that that can be granted by a district justice who is an independent, impartial person who would not be giving an opinion but that would be making his judgment on the basis of the material evidence before him.</P>

      <P>In relation to the statistics, I do not believe the number of applications or refusals is available, but if such statistics are available we will give them to the Senator.  However, from my assessment to date I do not believe they are available.  I still believe that the amendment is not practical and that it would make the Bill too cumbersome if <Col N="396" /> we bring in the requirement that a district justice would be required.  I am satisfied that the Garda superintendent is the correct person who would sign the order.  I have no reason to change my view on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister one further very brief question?  We do not want to get involved in a dispute here about the Garda or anything like that but it does nobody any good to pretend they are all perfect.  The one fact we do know is that the Garda complaints board is absolutely swamped with work.  The Garda say it is criminals who are abusing the law.  Many other people believe it is simply a natural process of the function of a democracy that all agencies are imperfect.  I would not dream of interpreting what Senator Costello is saying, but it seems to me that we are talking about the same thing.  It is necessary always to draft legislation in terms of a balance of rights and powers.  We have a habit whenever we extend the provisions of criminal law to say the authority figure is a Garda superintendent.  The truth is that as crime has expanded in this country and the numbers of gardaí have not expanded in anything like the same proportion, the senior Garda officers are more and more under pressure.  They are having to adjudicate, and will have to adjudicate under section 30 and under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act.  It is very fair to suggest that perhaps we are putting too much responsibility on them in regard to this quasi-judicial assessment of whether a person should go through what could well be an ordeal.</P>
      <P>The point needs to be made that it is not in a comfortable cell in the training unit in Mountjoy Prison that a suspect is going to be detained.  It could well be in that appalling institute here in Dublin, the Bridewell, which is not fit accommodation for anybody that people would have to go though this ordeal.  Therefore, it is important that in that context the decision-making should be taken by somebody who can take a slight step back and simply look at the evidence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="398" /> This amendment seeks to ensure that the appropriate consent has been given in writing, not just in the limited number of sections that are covered there, but that the consent has been granted in writing in all of the areas.  We want to avoid a situation where certain powers are granted to take samples under pressure or under duress, without consent.  We would like to see it established that where a sample is sought in any and every case that the appropriate consent has been given in writing prior to the taking of that sample.  That would seem a reasonable provision to seek because of the extensive powers that are conferred on the Garda in relation to the sampling that is sought.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling.  I have already recorded my dissatisfaction with the numbers of amendments that have been taken together.  Some of those amendments are not directly related to each other.  Amendment No. 10, seeks to insert &ldquo;and&rdquo; after &ldquo;any proceedings&rdquo;. Amendment No. 11 seeks to insert &ldquo;that the person may refuse his consent&rdquo;.  Subsection (4) paragraph (c) states that a Garda will seek the consent of the person from whom the sample is required and shall inform the person.  He should inform the person that he may refuse his consent and of the inference, obviously, <Col N="399" /> that would arise from that.  What we want to have there is, while the sample may be given in any proceedings, the person still has the right to refuse his consent, and to have that inserted in the section.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 13 seeks to delete subsection 7.  Subsection (7) is the entire subsection which relates to further penalties and fines that can be imposed on any individual who might obstruct the Garda in seeking those samples.  We feel that it is undue pressure on an individual that either they do provide the samples or else, so it is a threat in effect.  It would be better legislation if that extra penalty was removed totally from it.  In any case there is a further reference to inferences being drawn in relation to whatever offence occurs.  This is an example of what you might call double jeopardy where there are two scenarios or two situations where a person could be doubly penalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 seeks to delete lines 10 to 15, that is paragraphs (b) and (c).  What we have here refers to minors under the age of 17 in one case and children or young people under the age of 14 in another case.  It allows the situation whereby those minors can give consent. Secondly, the consent of the parent or guardian would also be granted.  It does not improve the situation that the consent of a parent or guardian should be added to the consent of a seven, eight, nine, ten or 11 year old under the age of 17.  It would still be an assault.  Imagine a guardian or a parent giving permission for a sample to be taken from their child and giving permission for what effectively would be, if it was not covered by this legislation, an assault on a young person. The inclusion there of what appears to be consent is not consent.  It is merely giving the appearance of further authority for the assault on a young person. Because it relates to minors it would be much better that that section, or those two paragraphs of that particular section, be deleted entirely.  We all know that the age of criminal responsibility is seven.  It is difficult to envisage a situation whereby that type of infringement on the privacy <Col N="400" /> of a child of that age could be necessary. It would make much better legislation if those two paragraphs were deleted.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 19 seeks to delete paragraph (b).  That is connected with the previous amendment in that it states that &ldquo;make provision for the taking of samples from persons who have not attained the age of 17 years&rdquo; should be deleted.  It would be an integral part of it, so that would be the corollary of what we have said before in subsection (8) and paragraph (b) and (c).</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to repeat that I think it was an outrageous decision to link those amendments together.  Somebody made a mistake and the House is the victim of that mistake.</P>
      <P>Part of these amendments have to do with two different questions.  I will deal with them in the order that suits my case. We are saying that if I give consent as a parent in writing, a doctor or a member of the Garda Síochána may do certain things to my 13-year-old child, simply because I give consent to it.  I do not accept that that permission will necessarily hold up in court.  Children are not appendages of their parents.  Children have rights in their own case.  They have certain rights as persons separate from their parents.  It is not right to suggest that simply because a parent, perhaps an indifferent parent, says &ldquo;Go ahead&rdquo;, and gives the necessary written condition therefore, it is in order to go ahead for a doctor.  It would be a great tragedy if the members of the medical profession took samples from a person between the age of 7 and 14 without that person's consent. This is extremely important.  In the age group of 7 to 14, we are not saying that the person has to give consent.  If the person's parent gives consent, that is sufficient. Appropriate consent means the consent of a parent or guardian of that person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some reason or other, somebody somewhere has decided that children are people between 7 and 14 who do not have the right to make decisions themselves. We presume they are old enough to be responsible for crimes, because they are <Col N="401" /> above the age of criminal responsibility. Even though they are above the age of criminal responsibility we take away the rights that other people have to make decisions about themselves.  They are capable of being punished for the things they do, but we will not give them the right to take responsibility for the things that the law says may be done to them. We have them caught both ways.  We will treat them as responsible citizens as far as their crimes are concerned, but we will not give them the rights of responsible citizens as far as what are essentially assaults on their person are concerned.</P>
    <P>I would invite the Minister to justify to this House why anybody should be allowed to do those things to a child between seven and 14 years old just because their parents say so.  Parents are not absolute monarchs of their children. They have legal, moral and other rights and obligations to their children that are as clear as my obligations to this State. Parents cannot simply write away those and say: &ldquo;Right, you do it, I will sign the form&rdquo;.  That is not acceptable legislation. It is another example of sloppy drafting in this legislation.</P>
    <P>I also want to clear up a very subtle point that one of Senator Costello's amendments addresses.  I hope the Minister will listen carefully.  Senator Costello has an amendment which suggests that the person must be made aware that he may refuse his consent.  That is in the context of section 2 of the Bill.  Let us be very clear.  Section 3, as the Minister pointed out, says that subsection (1) of section 3 shall not have effect if the Garda officer has not informed the person that he may refuse consent.  The Garda officer does not have to inform the person at the time he asks for the sample that he may refuse consent.  It is only if the garda has an intention, or wishes to actually pursue the matter under section 3, that the question of being informed of the right to withhold consent arises.  It is a perfectly legitimate tactic for a member of the Garda not to tell somebody at the time that he may refuse consent if he thinks that that would influence the person's decision.  He has no obligation under the <Col N="402" /> legislation, as it stands, to tell somebody. The obligation only arises in terms of bringing a successful prosecution or using the powers under section 3 to draw an appropriate inference.  There is a difference between what section 3 provides and what Senator Costello wants.</P>
    <P>My feeling is that in all circumstances a suspect must always be informed before anything is done that he or she may withhold consent.  That is, of course, leaving out the suspects between seven and 14 years who apparently do not have a say in the matter at all.  All other suspects should be informed before anything is done to them that they have the right to withdraw consent.  It is quite clear that the only provision in this legislation to do with consent says, fairly reasonably &mdash; because I do not think any Irish court under our Constitution would be too happy otherwise &mdash; that if there is going to be an attempt to draw an inference in a prosecution from the refusal of consent then you must have told the person that he can refuse consent.  That is not too unreasonable.  That is only if you are going to use it in court.  If you thought a person was an individual who would be easily persuaded you might be less inclined to tell him.  You have no obligation to inform that person that he can withhold consent.  Under the section 2 there is no such obligation.  The obligation only relates to the subsequent inference that can be drawn from it, and that is different.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment Senator Costello because he has done the sort of work that others of us should have done on teasing out the meaning of this Bill.  The amendments are consistent.  There are two groups of amendments which should have been taken separately.  They deserve to be given the fullest consideration.  I hope the Minister will give them that consideration. We can come back to the section again, but the question of the right of the citizen to know that he can refuse consent is separate from the consequences of refusing consent.  A citizen should be told on every occasion that he can withdraw consent.  I think the Minister has an obligation to be very specific <Col N="403" /> about the fact that children from seven to 14 years can have these things done to them &mdash; all of them &mdash; without their consent.  Would he explain to me what threat to the State or to the security of the State or to law and order would justify insisting that that right should be given to the State without the consent of the children involved?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 6 would seem to envisage that consent should be necessary before any type of sample can be taken, even something as simple as a nail clipping or a swab from the hand.  I can see no justification for such an approach.  The taking of such samples is no more intrusive than the taking of fingerprints which can be taken without consent.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 envisage that no samples should be taken without consent.  Amendment No. 13 proposes the deletion of section 7, which makes it an offence for a person to obstruct or attempt to obstruct the taking of samples. This, of course, would be logical if the amendment was to be accepted and the taking of any kind of sample made subject to consent.</P>
      <P>Amendments No. 14 and 19 propose to delete the provision in relation to parental consent.  I presume this is tied in with the two amendments just referred to, although I cannot see that it necessarily follows from them.  Certainly, I will take some convincing that parental consent should not be necessary before an intimate sample is taken from the child or young person.</P>
      <P>In relation to Sentor Ryan's point, I think parental responsibility is there and is contained within the Bill.  A parent or guardian would not lightly give that consent if they have any worries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be the parental responsibility of a parent or guardian. The purpose of these amendments taken together seems to be to alter the Bill fundamentally so that samples, whether intimate or otherwise, may only be taken with consent, and that there should be no penalty or adverse consequences if consent is withheld.  This would remove all the teeth from the Bill and make the giving of a sample a purely voluntary exercise.  Under such a regime I find it difficult to imagine that any guilty person wishing to conceal his guilt is likely to volunteer a sample.  In my view, it would be better to leave matters as they are than to enact a Bill of that nature.  I strongly oppose these amendments because they just would not make this Bill effective.  If the amendments were agreed to the Bill would not be effective. I am opposed to the amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the Minister's answers.  Certainly there are substantial points of law involved in the amendments that we have tabled.  I do not see why consent should not be sought in relation to all of the matters or why it should be limited to some.  Is it not proper that when each of those procedures is proposed, which requires a certain degree of infringement on the bodily integrity of the suspect, that the suspect should be asked to give consent?  It is not something that is going to take an hour or a day or require any extra personnel.  It would certainly be a safeguard that in all cases the appropriate consent would be sought and given.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 11, seeks to insert &ldquo;that the person may refuse his consent&rdquo;. How can you draw an inference from somebody refusing his consent unless he is informed in advance and he has to be informed that he is entitled to refuse consent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 14, certainly Senator Ryan has elaborated very well on the points we seek to cover there. The principle is that no other person, no <Col N="405" /> matter who he is, parent or guardian, can give permission to a Garda officer to interfere with the person of a minor.  That could easily, I would imagine, be found to be unconstitutional.  Certainly in relation to paragraph (c), in the case of a person who has not attained the age of 14 years there is absolutely no reference whatsoever to the consent of the individual. That surely must be bad law.  I have no doubt a constitutional case could be mounted against that section.  I see no reason whatsoever why it is put in those terms.  That is why we have sought to delete it and to delete the paragraph in amendment No. 19.  I certainly would seek quite considerably more clarification from the Minister in relation to those substantial points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not usually get annoyed &mdash; Ministers have a job to do &mdash; but I am beginning to be a little bit irritated.  I want to ask the Minister two questions.  Perhaps he can try to answer the questions I ask, not the answers that are written in his brief to other questions that perhaps somebody else thought might be asked.  First, why is it that a child of eight can be deemed to be capable of committing an offence and accept the full criminal responsibility for that offence but cannot be given the right to make a decision?  It is not the parent who will be blamed for the child's offence &mdash; the child will be punished for the offence &mdash; but apparently the parent can dispense with the child's right to have a say over his or her own bodily integrity.  That, apparently, is what the legislation is suggesting.</P>
      <P>Normally in this House I must say, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, when we come up with a serious problem like that the response of a Minister under most circumstances is to say &ldquo;Right, that is a valid point.  I will not concede anything, but I will come back on Report Stage with it&rdquo;. But at this stage we seem to have met with a resolute refusal to consider anything. Let me explain the implications of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 (3) says that subsection (1), where inferences can be drawn, &ldquo;shall not have effect in relation to an accused <Col N="406" /> unless he has been told in ordinary language by a member of the Garda Síochána when seeking his consent that the sample was required ...&rdquo;  Will the Minister explain to me the connection between subsection (3) of section 3 which refers to &ldquo;the accused&rdquo; and the absolute unwillingness to seek the permission or the consent of a child between the age of seven and 14?  If a child between the ages of seven and 14 is to be tried and an inference drawn, is it their refusal to give consent, or the parents' refusal to give consent, or is somebody confused &mdash; which is what I suspect is the case &mdash; that is involved?  It is the accused who is referred to in subsection (3) of section 3. It is the accused's parent who is referred to and nowhere in this legislation does it say that a child between seven and 14 has to give their consent.  Where in it does it say the Garda have to seek the consent of a child?  It is sloppily drafted legislation.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it was the intention of this Minister or of the Department of Justice to enforce such appalling affronts to the bodily integrity of children.  I think they were not thinking of what they were doing and they forgot what they were doing.  They were trying to protect children when, in fact, they have taken away their rights from them, because the real rights of children are the rights they have themselves, not the rights they get via their parents.  That is one of the big problems in a lot of Irish legislation, because we have gone too heavily on the rights of parents and too lightly on the rights of children in many areas.  I do not think this Minister will be proud of the fact that he is putting through legislation which will give gardaí and doctors and dentists the right to effectively assault young children simply because their parents say it is all right.  That is what it amounts to. The forcible taking of swabs, urine samples, blood samples, etc. which is what this legislation will permit, is an assault on the bodily integrity of a child and it is a shameful provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Children and young people can commit serious offences and we are aware of that.  It is right that it <Col N="407" /> should be possible to obtain a sample from them.  However, cognisance must also be taken of their age and vulnerability. This is done by providing for parental consent.  By any standards what we are doing is reasonable.  Senator Ryan mentioned samples.  Samples for young persons between 14 and 17 years of age can only be taken with both parental consent and the consent of the young person. Both are required between 14 and 17 years of age.  It is only where the person is under 14 years of age that a sample can be taken with parental consent only.  This is because it is natural to expect a parent of a child of this age to be best fitted to act in their best interests.</P>
      <P>We are taking reasonable precautions here.  A parent is not going to lightly give permission to anyone to take those samples in the circumstances under the age of 14.  It is an excellent safeguard in the Bill that the decision is taken away from a person of that young age and that it allows a parent or guardian to make the decision on their behalf.  As parents, they will not give that permission lightly. Refusal, of course, would not in any way prejudice the young person involved. This should be quite clear; between the ages of 14 and 17 the young persons themselves have to give permission as well as their parents.  There are safeguards in relation to their position as well.</P>
      <P>I think the points being put forward are raising difficulties which are not really there at all.  I think that in regard to those under 14 years of age, a parent or guardian is somebody responsible and should be responsible for making the decision.  I think it is reasonable that those powers would be there.  Would the Senator prefer that the young persons themselves would have the right to make the decision without the rights of the parents to intervene in this area?  I think the parent is the person who has the judgment in this area and I would have confidence in their judgment in relation to allowing the samples to be taken by the authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it that there is a <Col N="408" /> distinction made between children under 14 and children over 14 years of age?  In the case of a child between 14 and 17, or a young person, it needs both person's consent and the parents' consent, that is two people who have to be consulted.  In the case of a child under 14 years of age, they do not have to be consulted at all. I am, unfortunately, aware of the fact that there is a considerable number of children in this country whose parents do not look after them.  We have children who are put into care, for instance.  We have children in many cases whose parents are extremely negligent.  It is very clear.  There is nothing in this Bill which says that the parent of a child under 14 has to have it explained to them in clear language what they are doing, because that only applies to the accused under section 3 (3).  The parent of a child who is being asked to give consent to what is, in my view, effectively an assault on the child and in my view no parent has the right to give that consent.  No parent has the right to authorise another person to do those things to their child.</P>
      <P>The second thing is that in seeking that consent the Garda are under no obligation either to indicate to the parent that they can refuse consent or to indicate in the words of subsection (3) that they tell in ordinary language, when seeking this consent, that the sample was required for the purpose of forensic testing and that their consent was necessary. That only applies to the accused; it does not apply to the parent.  What form the Garda choose to use when they are asking the parent for consent is a matter entirely for the Garda.  They can make it a one word telephone call or one line saying &ldquo;Will you sign this, please?&rdquo;  It simple means we can do a few tests on your child.&rdquo;  That is all they have to tell them, because they do not have to tell the child anything and there is no provision under section 3 (3) for any explanation to the parent.  It is the accused who must get the explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said over and over again, this Bill is appallingly sloppily drafted.  I do not want to believe it was the intention of either the Minister or the Department <Col N="409" /> of Justice that ten-year-old children should be physically assaulted by members of the Garda Síochána simply because their parents gave permission.  I do not want the Garda to have to do that and I do not believe the Garda want to have to do that.  Yet, we are saying that they have the right and the power under law to do it simply because the parents say it is all right.  I do not believe parents have those rights and I do not think we should even write it into legislation.  The Minister should at least insert in paragraph (c) the same provision that applies to paragraph (b) that both the consent of the parent and the consent of the child must be sought.  Otherwise, you are going to traumatise small children inside Garda stations in a most alarming and frightening way.  I hope it is not anybody's intention to do this.  I intend that, if the Minister insists on going through with this, I am going to make the loudest possible fuss about it.  We are giving powers to the Garda and to members of the medical profession simply because indifferent parents say so, with no protections and no guarantees that the parents have to be properly informed.  If the Minister wants it like that, then let him have it like that.  It is entirely inappropriate and wrong and I do not think it is what is intended.  The Minister should bring it back to the senior Minister involved and look at the whole thing again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support entirely the remarks made by Senator Ryan.  This is the nub of this amendment in relation to a young person under the age of 17 and a child under the age of 14 years.  The situation is quite categoric: that no parent or guardian has the right to give consent to another person to interfere with the bodily integrity of a child or young person under his or her care.  That is a fact under the law.  I would see that that operates in both sections, in relation to a person aged 14 to 17 and under 14.  Even if an amendment was included to have the consent of the person as well as the parents or guardian, I would still find that section unsatisfactory.  First, we are talking about <Col N="410" /> very young people giving the consent; secondly, we are talking about parents or guardians giving consent.  If we look at it, how can a parent or guardian, on their own, without reference to the child, possibly give consent for that interference with bodily integrity?  In conjunction with the child, what does that add to it?  What is being added to it is the parent and the guardian agreeing that there are grounds for an infringement of the bodily integrity of another person.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister in what he has said, that the purpose could well have been to protect the child, but that is not the result of this drafting.  The purpose would seem to be, as the Minister has described it, that a parent or guardian would take due cognisance and would be very loath to give consent, and so on. But, in effect, that does not get round the other problem that is created, because by giving consent the parent and guardian are authorising the assault.  Under this section there is no way out unless the Minister is prepared to accept the amendment and redraft it.</P>
      <P>There are major constitutional implications involved.  It is not sufficient for the Minister to say he is satisfied that there are protections for the child.  The intention might have been to get protections for the child but the effect of the provision is to create a major problem in relation to how the child is going to be interfered with by the powers that are conferred under section 2.  We have been concentrating on this section because it is crucial.  It brings the powers from the adult world to the world of the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might mention in passing, in relation to subsection (8) (a), I still do now know why the age of 17 is the age that is referred to.  Why can we not standardise that with the age of 18?  Eighteen is the age at which we are given, in law, the right to vote and the right to drink.  We are minors until that time.  Why should we have this strange 17 whereby there are certain provisions of the criminal law applied when we get full citizenship at the age of 18?  What is the reason for not standardising those two ages?  Surely, the Minister should be thinking in terms of <Col N="411" /> the new Children Bill and that there should be standardisation in relation to the ages.  Rather than between 14 and 17, it should be between 14 and 18.  That would standardise the situation in relation to rights that are conferred on our citizens.</P>

      <P>The adverse inference provisions cannot apply to the case of an under 14.  It can apply in the case of persons between 14 and 17 only.  They themselves refuse consent.</P>
      <P>I feel the word &ldquo;assault&rdquo; is very unfair. I think it is being used emotively to create the imagery that a person under 14 years of age, if the parents consent for samples to be taken from him or her by a registered medical doctor or dentist as the case may be, that is an assault on that young person.  That is very emotive terminology, Senator.  It is being used to enhance the case the Senator is making, but I am not impressed by it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan mentioned someone in an institution.  They would have a guardian responsible for them.  If there is a medical procedure involved, which happens regularly, consent is given as well for those procedures to be carried out.  In regard to the taking of samples from a young person by a registered medical doctor, is the Senator implying that the registered medical doctor is going to assault that young person?  That is a very wrong inference to take from the Bill.  It is very unfair.  We are including in this Bill that the refusal of a parent or guardian will not be brought forward as evidence against the young person involved.  Therefore, you have safeguards which do not apply to a person between 14 and 17.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator is raising issues and exaggerating the problems that would arise. Young people can commit serious offences.  A person under 14 years of age can commit serious assaults.  In the situation where a parent or guardian <Col N="412" /> would give consent for the taking of samples, I feel they will only do so on the basis that it would be in the interests of the child.  I feel the concerns the Senator is expressing are genuinely unfounded.  It is unfair to the medical profession, who carry out procedures in hospitals as intimate as the samples that are being taken and more intimate than the samples that would be taken in this type of case.</P>
    <P>As far as the ages of 14 and 17 are concerned I think 17 a reasonable age to allow for someone to make a decision. The question of extending it to 18 and standardising the age at which one is regarded an adult is something that could be considered.  The Children Bill is going to a Special Committee of the Lower House where all those aspects, which I know will be of great concern to this House, will be considered.</P>
    <P>We are satisfied about the safeguards in this Bill.  Speaking as a parent, I consider that the consent of the parent or guardian is in the best interests of the children involved.  It will not be given lightly, or at all, if the parent or guardian feels that it would not be appropriate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and, indeed, the law and order lobby, cannot have it both ways, because one of the favourite phrases of the law and order lobby is that it is the parent's fault.  There is this scenario, and there is a certain truth in it, of an increasing number of neglectful parents who are not willing or able to take responsibility for their children, to look after their children and to mind their children.  We are not talking about the large body of children.  I can assure the Minister that if any child of mine ever came into a situation like this I would be profoundly unwilling to give consent.  It does not even say, for instance, that the parent has the right to talk to the child before this consent is given.  It does not even say that the parent must consult the child.  It does not say anything.  The parent does not have to be even in the Garda station.  The parent could be visited at home, could be visited in a pub or anywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not say anything about the child <Col N="413" /> at all.  The child is a non-person as far as this legislation is concerned.  The child has no rights and it is ludricrous to compare this consent with the consent to an operation.  Apart from anything else, hospitals increasingly are orientated to eliminate even the slightly threatening nature that they have for small children. They are more and more aware of the fact that a hospital can be a threatening place, and the fact that what is involved here is life giving health.  We are talking about the investigation of a criminal offence by hard-pressed gardaí with a child in custody in a Garda station on, perhaps, a night when there is considerable pressure on the Garda when they know they need the parent's consent.</P>
    <P>With respect, I really think that the Minister is defending the indefensible, and he is simply leaving himself wide open.  Why not say with the consent of the child?  What is wrong with that?  The child is deemed to be capable of committing a criminal offence.  Under our law the child would not be in custody if he or she were not deemed to be capable of committing a criminal offence.  The whole point of having a child under 14 is that we believe the child is capable and responsible of committing a criminal offence.  We are believing because we believe this nonsense of a seven year old age of criminal responsibility, that the child is capable of committing a criminal offence.  It has the capacity, the freedom and the knowledge to do that and to be culpable for it.  But we are then saying that the child is not capable of taking a free decision to give consent or to withhold consent.  Or is it, as I suspect &mdash; and I am beginning to get malicious at this stage because of the Minister's unwillingness to listen to reason &mdash; is it that people are afraid that in every case a child will refuse consent because it would be so scared in a Garda station, or what is it?</P>
    <P>It is absolutely unjustifiable.  At least in the Criminal Justice Act we were given assurances in regard to questioning of children that those children who were detained under the Criminal Justice Act <Col N="414" /> would not be questioned, other than in very exceptional circumstances, in the presence of their parents.  I do not know how well that works; I have my suspicions about it.  Is there a crusade going on against our children because half the country thinks that half the children are running wild, or what is it?  I can tell the Minister that he has the numbers in this House to push this through, but I can tell him this is only the beginning; and the reason it is only the beginning is because the Minister cannot give us a single convincing reason for excluding the child's consent from this.  He is effectively saying that parents can give consent to other people to do things to their children.</P>
    <P>It is an absolute red herring for the Minister to shoot off and say we are casting aspersions on the medical profession. Of course, the vast majority of doctors will not participate in this.  But the Minister would want to remember who it was that devised various tactics that were used in Northern Ireland not so long ago against suspects.  It was not strangers. There were members of the medical profession involved in that.  Say the member of the medical profession is simply called by a garda and told &ldquo;Right, we need these things&rdquo;.  Do not forget that the Minister insisted on all of these samples &mdash; blood, public hair, urine, saliva, hair, nail, any material found under a nail, the whole list of them.  The Minister is insisting that the simple consent of a parent &mdash; given at a distance, without being properly informed of what is going on, because there is no obligation to properly inform, to inform that they can withhold consent &mdash; can allow the garda, or a doctor or a dentist to do all those things to a child, even if the child is petrified, even if the child is frightened out of his wits.</P>
    <P>I am not interested in the argument as to whether Garda will do it or not, because I hope they would not.  What I am interested in is the fundamental principle that we are giving that power to the Garda and to the medical profession and we are giving it to them irrespective of how the child feels, irrespective of how frightened the child is, irrespective of <Col N="415" /> how terrified the child is, or indeed irrespective of how young the child is, because a child needs only to be seven years and one day to be covered by the provisions of this offence &mdash; seven years old.</P>
    <P>I have no idea how anybody with any sort of a feeling for children could defend that piece of legislation, because the children who will suffer are the children of indifferent parents &mdash; and they do exist and they are an increasing proportion of our society for whatever reason.  What we are simply saying is that those indifferent parents can, on a sheet of paper, sign away the rights of their children and then a whole lot of things can be done to their children, irrespective of how the children feel.  For the last time, will the Minister at least show that he has a heart as well as a head?  As well as officials sitting behind him, as well as having a senior Minister who, perhaps, is a bit intimidating, he has his own feelings and his own convictions.  Indeed, he was a Minister responsible in the previous Government for children's legislation. Can he please remember that the whole object and thrust of legislation dealing with children is to protect the child, because children are children?  We must remember that.  We are not talking about hardened criminals; we are talking about seven, eight, nine and ten year olds.  The Minister apparently is happy with the idea that they can have all these done to them however they feel, however frightened they are, however scared they are, simply because the parent signs a consent form.  That is an outrageous proposal and it is one that should be resisted.</P>

      <P>Written consent must be given by the parent or guardian and this is a major protection.  This is to protect the young person, not to have an adverse effect on the young person who is being charged.  The adverse inference provision cannot apply in the case of under 14s; it can apply in the cases between 14 and 17. The fears that the Senator is expressing are unfounded.  Senator, we are not agreeing to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not find the Minister's remarks in relation to assault acceptable.  There is provision for taking samples of blood, pubic hair, urine, saliva, hair other than pubic hair, a nail, any material found under a nail and a swab from any part of the body other than a body orifice or a genital region, so there is an infringement on the bodily integrity of a person.  It is no help to say that it is not an assault.  It constitutes an assault.  In this case we are talking about a very young person, as young as seven years.  The Minister should be aware of and be concerned about that.</P>
      <P>In relation to paragraphs (b) and (c) the Minister has referred to irresponsible youth, but there are also irresponsible parents.  We are talking about consent.  If there is consent from the parent in relation to paragraph (c), there is no provision for consent from the child.  If the Minister is prepared to put forward the concept of irresponsible youth, we can talk also about the concept of an irresponsible parent.</P>
      <P>The Minister is missing the point here in that even if a parent or guardian gives consent &mdash; I will acknowledge that in the age group between 14 and 18 it combines the two, the person and the parent or guardian &mdash; it is not solving the problem. The consent given by a parent or guardian is, to my mind, compounding the problem because I do not believe that it is proper that there is a right for a parent to give consent to the infringement of the bodily integrity of one of his or her children.  The legal and constitutional implications of that have to be faced.  The Minister has not properly addressed that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has acknowledged that inferences would not be drawn, but at the same time there is no provision for parents or guardians to be informed that <Col N="417" /> no inferences would be drawn.  They would still regard it as a threatening matter.  There is no provision in the Bill in relation to it and I ask the Minister to address that matter.</P>
    <P>I gladly accept his remarks in relation to subsection (8) (a), that he would like to see a standard age of 18 introduced because that in law is the age at which young people are given their rights to citizenship, their acceptance as adults, the right to vote and so on.  It would be proper for that to be incorporated into criminal law as it is the standard age in other areas.</P>
    <P>Nobody is saying that the Minister is not trying to protect children and nobody is doubting his <i>bonafides</i> in this.  I believe that the Bill has been drafted with the intention of protecting children but the effect of it will be the opposite.  It leaves the position open to abuse.  The problem is that there has not been satisfactory drafting of this particular section.</P>
    <P>We are concerned here with protecting the child and young people from very serious powers in relation to their bodily integrity.  We acknowledge that there will be provisions in the new 1988 Children Bill that will raise the age of criminal responsibility, but we have no idea when that Bill will be passed.  At it stands, there are two categories of young people who are very vulnerable and this Bill opens up the way towards increasing their vulnerability. I am not satisfied that the Minister has answered the criticisms that have been directed towards it.  I would have liked him to take on board some of these amendments, particularly this safeguard amendment, and while he might not agree with all the details in the amendment he could accept the principle and come back to us with a change in the drafting of this section that would do what we are seeking to do here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to sympathise greatly with the underlying emotions and, indeed, many of the sentiments which have been expressed by the previous two speakers, Senator Ryan and Senator Costello, particularly the reasoned arguments which Senator <Col N="418" /> Costello is putting forward.  I agree that the Minister is very conscious of the need to protect children and of the great difficulties of expressing that satisfactorily in legislation.  I have great sympathy with that view.  I also have sympathy with the views expressed by Senator Ryan with great emotion.  This is an area we will be increasingly concerned with, one which is addressed in the Government's Children Bill which, hopefully, will come before us shortly.  He raises very valid points in relation to children but perhaps his emotions carried him away a bit.</P>
      <P>I am very proud to be a member of the medical profession and by and large I believe we are doing a good job.  I am sure it is not always perfect but I take exception to the imputations which Senator Ryan made with regard to the medical profession in this country.  I am sure they were made just in the emotion of the moment and because of his genuine concern for children.</P>
      <P>We have to take the realities as they are at present and realise that this is a Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Bill and regrettable though it may be, there is a need for such a Bill.  Unfortunately, there are certain facts, and there are ample statistics to bear this out, which show that the age of violent, severe crime is not going downwards.  There are, indeed, many youngsters, for whatever reasons and however sympathetic we may feel towards them, who are engaged in some pretty horrific crimes.  I agree that a child of seven or eight may not perhaps be able to give a degree of informed consent and, indeed, I would turn that slightly around.  That is why it is so essential that there be consent from the proper authority, the parent or other person responsible.  It is a very difficult situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made a very good effort to attempt to express, on the one hand, the necessity to be able to obtain the forensic evidence and, on the other hand, to see that children are protected and that their parents must give that informed consent.  I certainly have a great deal of sympathy with the emotions which Senator Ryan is expressing in that <Col N="419" /> we must consider children as individuals. We are trying to do that in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I agree very much with what my two colleagues have been saying here.  Before I get into the philosophical argument about it, I would like to understand the practicalities, being a pragmatist at heart.  Before I address those particular points I want to get a number of points clarified.  I want to bring it into the context of the real world as well as to take it out of the confines of a philosophical debate in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Very often the people who are being dealt with under our legislation are down and out and indeed, as Senator Conroy has just said, may well be very young people.  I want to ask two particular questions about them.  How does the Minister propose to get the written consent of an illiterate down and out?  He or she cannot write and cannot articulate very well.  I want to know precisely how that would be done on his or her arrest.  If the Leas-Chathaoirleach wandered around O'Connell Street he would find young people, well under the 14 years of age mentioned here, who are involved in every kind of activity from prostitution to drug addiction.  They have been rejected by society.  Many of them get into trouble, as Senator Conroy has so clearly outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the Bill, in order for this proposed legislation to be operable it would be necessary, in the case of young people like those who are perceived to be in trouble, to take, as part of the material evidence, a sample of the six various things referred to on this item, blood, pubic hair, urine, saliva, swab or dental impression, etc.  Most of these people have been abandoned and do not know where their parents are.  How does the Minister propose to get the consent of the parents or guardians of people who have no idea where their families are? They are under 14.  I am not presenting anything that is totally out of range.  This is within half a mile of us.  Just down the road, off O'Connell Street, you will find plenty of examples.  I look forward to the <Col N="420" /> Minister explaining that to me, before I get involved in the philosophical argument of my problems with the section.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann warmly welcomes the moves towards greater democracy in eastern Europe and urges the Government to use its influence both unilaterally and within the European Community to encourage this process.</P>
      <P>I want to thank the Leader of the House and the Minister for facilitating this discussion this evening.</P>
      <P>We can all welcome recent historic events in eastern Europe especially since the movement towards greater trust, peace and freedom is a popular, bloodless, mass progression and I am sure all Members of the House note these historic steps with satisfaction and joy.  We must wish our brothers and sisters success and happiness in their new freedoms and I hope they will evolve.</P>

      <Col N="421" /> One year ago, I had the honour to participate at the first ever meeting of presidents of parliaments from both east and west which was held in Warsaw on 26 to 28 November 1988.  Parliamentary speakers or presidents from some 30 countries attended, including eight from the eastern block countries.  The meeting, speeches and discussions were of extreme interest to the Ceann Comhairle and to me; we had the honour of representing the Oireachtas.  I took from that conference the obvious determination of the eastern block speakers for stronger and greater democraticisation in their countries and following from that I am not surprised in the least at the historic events and changes we have read about over the past number of weeks.</P>
    <P>My impressions of Warsaw were of a beautiful city of history, tradition and culture and yet it brutally revived for me childhood memories during the Second World War: hardly any consumer goods for sale in the shops, shop after shop with nothing on the shelves, huge queues for commodities such as milk, bread and meat, the general population apparently living on minute incomes compared with the situation here in the West.</P>
    <P>I availed of the opportunity of the biannual debate on the development of the EC to record my impressions of that visit and I advocated then the granting of Community aid to Poland which I am happy to note has been given, but only one consignment, I think so far.  I appeal to the Minister of State to use all his influence, both unilaterally and at EC level, to expedite the continuing shipments to that country.  The EC must not lose the opportunity to crown the dreams of the founding fathers of the EC to progress towards peace, unity and tolerance in our future, not just in western Europe but indeed in Europe as a whole.</P>
    <P>On 23 June, 1989, on behalf of the Cathaoirleach, my colleague Senator Tras Honan, I accepted from his Excellency, Mr. Viatcherlav T. Boius of the Russian Embassy, a special message from the New Congress of the USSR People's Deputies addresses to the people of Ireland through the Seanad.  With your <Col N="422" /> permission, Sir, I propose to quote the message and leave it on the Table of the House.  It states:</P>
    <P Just="Center">CONGRESS OF USSR PEOPLE'S DEPUTIES.</P>
    <P>Address to Peoples of the World.</P>
    <P>We, USSR People's Deputies, gathered for our first Congress in an atmosphere of <i>glasnost</i> and openness to lay down the legal foundation of all-round democratic renewal of our socialist society.  As full-fledged representatives of the many-millioned Soviet people we are fully aware of the historic responsibility resting on us.  We realize that the problems facing our motherland today are huge, and we proceed from the view that there is no alternative to radical restructuring in all the areas of its life.  We have chosen this road firmly after thorough consideration, and we shall not abandon it.</P>
    <P>Man with his joys and sorrows, hopes and cares is in the centre of our attention.  We are convinced that socialist society does not have, nor can it have, other moral orientation than the interests of the people, aspirations and rights of free man.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Perestroika</i> is an internal matter of the peoples of the Soviet Union.  It was prompted by the vital needs of the country.  But we do not separate ourselves from the world community, from the processes that determine the contemporary civilization, and we regard freedom of the individual, democracy and social justice as fundamental values on which the life of our society must be based.</P>
    <P>We view <i>perestroika</i> as part of the progressing democratization of the world order, as the Soviet Union's contribution to the solution of global problems facing humanity.  They are all interrelated and form a dangerous tight knot.  It can and must be untied, but the pooling of efforts of the world community for the sake of its survival is necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="423" />
      <i>Perestroika</i> radically alters our attitude to the world today.  We are now open to the world and are prepared to co-operate with everyone for whom human life and dignity are supreme values, and we count on mutual understanding.</P>
    <P>One cannot live by old rules and standards in the rapidly changing world.  One cannot hope to consolidate one's security and ensure well-being while neglecting the interests of others. It is pointless to turn international relations into an arena of ideological wars.  It is criminal to deplete the world economy by the arms race and to neglect to care for the preservation of the environment.  No matter what barriers might divide us, we are all children of mother earth, and we have a common destiny.</P>
    <P>Therefore we call for an end to animosity and strife among peoples.  A new peaceful period in the history of humanity is possible, and this possibility must be translated into reality.</P>
    <P>The Congress solemly assures peoples of the world that it assumes the responsibility for strict observance by the Soviet state of the principles of peaceful coexistence in respect to all states and peoples of the world.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the new political thinking, the Congress of USSR People's Deputies established the principles by which our state must be guided in international affairs.  They are, essentially, that:</P>
    <P>the security of our country must be ensured above all by political means as part of universal and equal security in the process of demilitarization, democratization and humanization of international relations with the reliance on the United Nations prestige and potential;</P>
    <P>nuclear arms must be eliminated as a result of talks aimed at disarmament and reduction of defence potentials of the states to the limits of reasonable sufficiency; <Col N="424" /> use or threat of force to achieve some political, economic or other purposes are impermissible, respect for sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity are indispensable in relations with other countries;</P>
    <P>dialogue and talks aimed at the balance of interests, and not confrontation, must be the sole way of solving international problems, and settling conflicts;</P>
    <P>the Soviet economy must be included organically in the world economy on a basis of equality and mutual advantage, must actively participate in the shaping and observance of the rules of the contemporary international division of labour, scientific and technical exchange, trade. </P>
    <P>Our Congress as the supreme body of state authority declares that the Soviet Union intends strictly to adhere to these principles in its foreign policy. Such is our foreign policy strategy from now on.  Such is the open and honest line of the Soviet Union and <i>perestroika</i> in the international arena.  Such is the Soviet people's choice.</P>
    <P>We make a call to the peoples of the world, to the world public opinion to develop to the utmost the exchange of ideas and people, cultural and spiritual values, contacts and dialogue at every level and in every area, to look jointly and find mutually acceptable compromise to safeguard peace on earth, for the sake of wellbeing and progress of entire humanity.</P>
    <P>That message from the People's Deputies of the USSR is the cornerstone, the basis for the great political changes we are witnessing in eastern Europe during these times and I am sure that Senators from all sides of the House will note with satisfaction the words addressed to us from the Congress of USSR.  Reading and studying that historic message from one republic to another must surely give us all hope and confidence in our peaceful future.  To my mind it underwrites peace, progress and prosperity.  For, if the words <Col N="425" /> of those Deputies have any meaning, they clearly indicate a new order which heralds the lessening of tensions and, therefore, a reduction in the huge cost of armaments, which will enable greater resources to become available for the ordinary humane requirements of peoples right across Europe, both east and west.</P>
    <P>This is a very appropriate moment for this country to play a significant role in this whole ecomonic process.  We should avail of our neutral status at the present time where we affiliate neither to the eastern bloc, the Warsaw Pact or NATO. Whether that is going to change or not, I do not think is important at this time. But, how should we respond, as a nation and as a member of the EC?  This country for a number of years now, since the Cosgrave Government of the early seventies &mdash; in 1975 or 1976 they opened our first embassy in Moscow &mdash; recognised the importance that closer relations with the USSR would have for us.  I hope we will be able to continue strengthening both our economic and cultural links with the USSR.  I want to compliment the Government on the expansion of trade with the Soviet Union in recent times.</P>
    <P>I hope that we, as a member of the EC would avail of the present atmosphere to press for closer co-operation with eastern and western Europe.  It is some 16 years since the COMECON negotiations were first established.  We can accept that progress has been, by any standards, relatively slow.  It is true to say there is now a great opportunity, both at Council and at Commission level, to push forward the negotiations, with a view to an EC agreement with the German Democratic Republic, with Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and with Yugoslavia, at least to increase diplomatic and trade relations with those countries.  By doing that, my firm belief is that we will be then in a position to really savour the ideas that the founding fathers of the Community had in mind years ago when they sought to conserve and preserve peace in Europe by co-operating and joining together to ensure that by constant inter-governmental communications there would <Col N="426" /> never need to be a reason for strife or war in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The present situation, where there is an ease and almost a freedom of movement in eastern European countries, has meant that last week for the first time at a meeting of the European Union of Christian Democrat Parties held in Malta on 9 November, representatives from new parties of central and eastern Europe took part.  The chairman of that movement, President Emilio Colombo, had the great distinction of welcoming the Leader of Hungary's People's Party, Mr. Karczay.  He has, I understand, requested admission for his party into the European Union of Christian Democrats and similarly, Mr. Sila-Novicki of the Polish Christian Democrat Party asked to apply for the opportunity of participating in the Union of Christian Democrats. We must welcome that.  The freedom these people have now been accorded to travel to these meetings is a sign of a more peaceful future.</P>
    <P>The recent demonstrations by hundreds of thousands of people, perhaps in Berlin and other European cities, have made it quite clear to the authorities that the populations of these countries want to have a peaceful co-existence in the years ahead.  They want to be able to work towards greater and closer co-operation with the west.  This is a tremendous opportunity for the Community to respond in fully and generously to the needs of these people.</P>
    <P>Those who have had the opportunity of travelling in eastern Europe over the past number of years clearly see the very level of economic development.  I shudder to think what life would have been like on this island if our economic situation as it was prior to 1948 had remained unchanged for the past 40 years.  The Poles have a very old developed culture, an excellent standard of education, and it must be very difficult for them to accept that there has not been economic development.  I am glad the masses of the people in a peaceful and bloodless fashion, have demonstrated their impatience and have forced the authorities to change their policies so as to <Col N="427" /> give to the coming generation the right to choose the kind of democracy they wish to serve and live under.</P>
    <P>At the meeting of the EC COMECON exploratory discussions last week, the Secretary of COMECON, Mr. Sytchev, indicated seven fields in which he felt co-operation could be developed from group to group&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>May I finish this sentence and my speech will be concluded. I was saying that at last week's meeting of the EC COMECON discussions the secretary indicated seven fields in which he felt co-operation could be developed from group to group and he expressed a preference for bilateral co-operation between the EC and each COMECON country individually.  They were: the environment, energy, transport, science and technology, standardisation of statistics and economic forecasts.  I hope our Ministers will be able to support the <Col N="428" /> aspirations of the eastern block.  There are very sincere signs of peace and harmony in the future and I hope we will individually benefit in the years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate and I should like to thank the Leader of the House for agreeing to hold it and the Minister of State for attending.  We are talking about Eastern Europe and the move towards greater democracy.  We are urging the Government to use their influence, both unilaterally and within the European Community, to encourage this process.  In rising to second this motion I should like to say that the debate is very appropriate and pertinent for this country in two senses.  We are a sovereign State and, equally important, a member of the European Community on the point of assuming the Presidency at a time when these major events will be discussed within the Community.  Again, as with many other areas since we joined the European Community, we appear to have an influence that is out of all proportion to our population and that is very satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has been happening in recent months, and especially dramatically in East Germany in recent weeks, are probably, without exaggeration, the most dramatic events in European politics for at least a generation because we are witnessing the collapse of communism.  It is especially dramatic in East Germany because, as some Germans have been pointing out to us, we are not simply talking about the breakdown of communism and the breakdown of totalitarianism after a 25 to 40 year gap.  The East Germans have been under two totalitarian regimes, the first being under Hitler.  In fact, East Germany has not had any real freedom since 1936, more than 50 years ago, a gap of two generations. When we saw East Germans flooding into a free West Germany in recent weeks, it was an entirely dramatic event which had not been foreseen.  None of the commentators in the international <Col N="429" /> press, none of the major world statesmen, could conceivably have foreseen that events of this nature could have occurred at this speed.</P>
    <P>It is probably pertinent to point out that the events which have unfolded in East Germany, Hungary and Poland, and beginning to happen in Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, could not conceivably have happened without the tacit approval of President Gorbachev of the USSR. That underpins what is happening, because hundreds of thousands of people are not going to go into the streets if there is a fear that the troops are going to come at them as they did in Hungary previously and elsewhere.  A compliment has to be paid to President Gorbachev in relation to that.  The free world owes him a debt for the type of statesmanship we have seen in recent years.  He is the key factor which makes these recent events completely different from previous risings in Central Europe.</P>
    <P>There will, of course, be natural fears, given European history in this century. There are many people who use the pet phrase, people in France and Germany who do not like the reunification of Germany, that they like Germans so much that that is why they like to have two Germany states.  I do not know that events since the last war need lead us to have such fears, because West Germany as a modern state has been an entirely democratic state and an impeccable member of the western European alliance and of the NATO alliance.  Talk about reunification at this time, while there seems to be a logic that that should inevitably happen, is not being fuelled from either West Germany or East Germany. They are not seeking it, but I believe there is a certain inevitability about it.</P>
    <P>We have a major role to play as a European Community member.  We are one around a table with 11 others and one voice out of 12 that has a considerable influence.  Recent events, putting them into context, shatter completely any Community pre-conceptions that might have existed concerning Europe.  It has to be remembered that the European <Col N="430" /> Community was formed out of a will to build up a free, united and strong Europe, but it was against the background of the non-availability of central European states for membership of the European Community because they were totalitarian and were east of a certain line and east of a certain wall.  There has been a build-up of the European Community since the idea was conceived.  We had, first, a Community of six countries which, in 1973, was extended to a Europe of nine countries when we, Britain and Denmark joined.  Subsequently, we had Greece, Portugal and Spain joining and we may have Austria and Norway later.  The European Community, and the leaders in Europe, are receptive to the Community being a large entity which can embrace within it a large number of states.  It has been called a European Economic Community but it does not make narrow economic sense for the Germans, the British and the French to agree to the inclusion of Greece, Portugal or Spain, but it makes huge political sense because if we bring in the states on the periphery and can lift the income of the poorer countries on the southern flank, we are building up a united and a free Europe and a bulwark against future aggression.</P>
    <P>Within that context, looking at the unfolding of recent events, the future possible non-alignment of the eastern bloc countries is a matter of great moment for the European Community because it is conceivable, and senior European Community figures have in recent days been pointing to this, that in the future countries such as East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary may well become aligned in some sense or other and possibly eventually be admitted to full membership of the European Community.  We have a major role to play in that context.</P>
    <P>Recently, West German attitudes have been positive.  They have a commitment to route funds through the European Community to bolster the East German position, but that will be at a price and the price must be free elections.  I do not know that we are talking immediately about reunification going ahead.  There <Col N="431" /> are many parallels with the position in Northern Ireland.  They are seeking, firstly, reasonable elections, free speech and a fair deal, independent of flags.  No doubt this is going to happen.  We will need to watch certain positions because problems are going to arise.  If we are going to have floods of eastern Europeans coming on to the protected job market in the European Community it will create problems for the young Germans looking for jobs in the work place and for Irish nationals who are seeking jobs in countries such as West Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands.  However, we cannot speak narrowly against the momentum of these kind of events.</P>
    <P>What has happened in recent years, where the Germans are concerned, has been that modern communication has played a huge part in bringing about changes.  For a number of years there was a massive influence of West German television reaching through to most parts of East Germany.  The build-up was there for all of this to happen.  I have no doubt that in the fullness of time reunification will take place, because we are talking about the same people, the same culture and the same language.  I do not think there is anything that can stop this happening. The exodus in the past weeks of up to a quarter of a million people from a single country is an enormous indictment of the type of totalitarian regime that existed there.  There is great instability there at present and we must hope that this will be contained.  Again, this is where strong action by countries such as West Germany and the European Community is needed.  Our Government, and the Taoiseach as President of the European Community in the next six months, has, with his Minister for Foreign Affairs, a major role to play in that regard.</P>
    <P>When we are speaking about eastern Europe as it relates to Ireland there are a couple of observations that should be made at this time concerning diplomatic representation.  We are a very small country with limited resources and against the background of very limited resources we have remarkable diplomatic <Col N="432" /> representation around the world.  Our budget has been severely strained because our membership of the European community has forced us to have major diplomatic representation with each member state of the European Community, in addition to a permanent mission to Brussels.  All of this has put an enormous strain on the budget of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Up to this time diplomatic representation in Eastern Europe was not a matter of high priority.  It appears that the present position is that we have only one resident ambassador in the entire East bloc and that is in Russia.  In the range of countries about which we have been speaking, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, East Germany, Poland and Hungary, there is not a single resident ambassador. We have representation in Vienna and they look after countries on the periphery, but I do not think that is entirely satisfactory.  We will now have to face up to the problem whether we like it or not. If there is the political will to do things money can be found.</P>
    <P>In the last two years there has been a huge development in trade between countries such as West Germany and Poland and between the United Kingdom and Hungary.  We have an enormous amount of trade at present between the United Kingdom and Hungary.  They have enormous clout.  There is enormous trading going on and there are constant receptions and festivals.  There is a two-month Magyar festival in London at present.  There have been visits by heads of state and the to-ing and fro-ing that goes with that.  There is revenue coming from that.  It is not just the debit side of a balance sheet and the pouring out of money that we are dealing with.  There is revenue coming from those contacts. Where we have shown great flair for such a tiny country with three million people since we joined the European Community is in developing the kind of representation we have abroad.</P>
    <P>The time has come to take a very serious look at Eastern Europe.  There is a certain inevitability about the Government and the Department of Foreign <Col N="433" /> Affairs being forced to start opening up on that flank.  If they are going to be part of a free Europe there will be major interests where this country is concerned. They are being neglected at this time.  I am not saying that in any political sense and I am sure an alternative Government would have the identical problems and strains.  This is the time for review and this is the time when it is pertinent to look at these issues.  I grew up against the background of the end of the Second World War, the advent of communism, the imprisoning of Cardinal Mindszenty in Hungary, a country which was largely Catholic.  We all grew up with a very strong, negative attitude to communism. I am certain that was reflected in the political and commercial connections with such countries but we have to take these shackles off now.</P>
    <P>Under the surface in all these countries there are good people who light candles in dark hours.  In Russia today one can see the re-opening of monastries and churches; the Faith never died.  There are contacts on which we can build to a great extent.  On a much broader front, and on a political front, the people in Eastern Europe need our help as much as they do that of any other people in the free world. I urge the Government, on our behalf, to play a generous and interested role in their interests and in the future of Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>We on the Government side very much welcome this timely motion and the very detailed and comprehensive speeches we had from Senators McDonald and Staunton.  All the sentiments which have been expressed by the proposer and seconder of the motion are ones with which Members on all sides could warmly agree with.  It is a sea of change in the whole situation in Europe and, indeed, in world politics generally.  Certainly, few of us who were in the debate last week in relation to the implication of changes for Ireland outlined in the NESC Report on <Col N="434" /> the European Community could have imagined that within a matter of hours after that the Berlin Wall would at long last be broken.  It is, I suppose, relevant in that for the past 40 years the world, and particularly Europe and our country, has been frozen in a sort of time warp from the effects, many of them apparently permanent and yet in reality as Senator Staunton has suggested, very artificial and superficial, of the second of the two World Wars that have occurred in Europe in this century.  They have all centred around Germany.  Germany is essential to Europe.</P>
      <P>The changes which are occurring now, which are going to affect this country, and which we greatly welcome in an emotional sense and I hope also in a practical sense, mean that we are going to become much more peripheral in many ways to Europe as it existed until a few days ago.  We must be very glad now that we joined the European Community, very glad that we took such practical measures as joining the EMS but still the realities have fundamentally changed. Germany is once more not only economically but politically the major power in Europe.  For good or ill as that may be, that effectively is the reality.  Let us not imagine that it is a reality that is not seen by Mr. Gorbachev, and his colleagues in the Soviet Union, and let us not imagine either that it is necessarily one that they greatly welcome and, from their point of view, with very good reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should, perhaps, also consider why these changes are taking place first of all in that part of eastern Europe which is at present the Soviet Union.  It would seem that on the one hand there is that genuine and deep feeling which all people have for freedom.  At the end of the day no matter how it is suppressed it bubbles back up to the surface again.  There are also some economic realities.  The situation facing the Soviet Union was that it could not continue with the enormous arms <Col N="435" /> burden which it had undertaken.  Its economy was tottering into total chaos.  Curiously enough <i>perestroika</i> and <i>glasnost</i> and other political changes, no matter how much they may be welcomed, in the long term are perhaps more important from an economic point of view, but at present the economy of the Soviet Union is going further downhill.  One of the big objections that people on the streets have from what we hear is that goods are becoming even scarcer.  Many people are complaining either that <i>perestroika</i> has not gone far enough or that it has gone too far.  We should also recollect that whether it was Tzarist imperialist Russia, the Soviet Union, or whether it is this apparently new democratic Russia the strategic aims of Russia and its requirements are not basically going to alter. They may be expressed, hopefully, in better ways and in more peaceful ways but they are still there.  We would be very foolish to live in cloud-cuckoo land imagining that they do not exist.</P>
    <P>One of the other reasons for <i>perestroika, glasnost and the rapprochement</i> with Germany which would have had people shuddering 40 years ago &mdash; some people are shuddering today over them &mdash; is the necessity for the Soviet Union to have the financial and economic support of Germany.  That is reality and it may turn out to be a very good reality. So we come back to Germany over and over again when we look at this situation.</P>
    <P>It was within the Soviet Union itself where we saw the first cracks beginning to appear in Listonia, Latvia and in Lithuania. It was, after all, as a result of a German-Soviet pact that these countries came under the aegis of the Soviet Union and are now attempting to reassert themselves. There is a somewhat similar situation in the Ukraine.  Senator Staunton has referred to the persistence of the beliefs of the Christians mainly in the Ukraine.  Ukrainians do not regard themselves as Russians; they are Ukrainians. Whether Russia, or the present Soviet <Col N="436" /> Union, can really continue on a course which at present effectively means that the next largest state in terms of area, of industry and of population can continue to move towards autonomy, is a question which gives a lot of worry to those in charge in the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>Closer to our own hearts, and we have many direct contacts, is the situation in Poland.  Of course we welcome the improvements that have taken place there but there are a lot of Poles who are finding them very difficult.  It is true there is a Catholic Prime Minister in Poland now.  Solidarity, effectively with their allies, are in Government.  They are having to impose economic measures which are very harsh and which are probably at present totally inadequate.  It is not really a very happy situation.  There, again, Germany comes back into the picture in a context in which those of us in the EC have got to pause and consider the situation.  Herr Kohl of Germany is now giving massive financial support to Poland.  That was agreed at a recent meeting with the Polish Premier.  That support will be coming directly from the Federal Republic of Germany to Poland despite earlier suggestions that this should be an EC initiative or should in some sense be channeled through or associated with the European Community. This is a very major break.  It has occurred almost immediately and it has great implication for the future.</P>
    <P>In East Germany itself the walls are breaking down now.  One is probably going to have some form of union, be it direct or indirect, between the two Germanys and this is greatly to be welcomed. There has been the tragedy of separated families and so on, the human tragedies involved, but that wall was not lightly erected.  It was put there for very strong economic and political reasons and it is now being dismantled.  Among the many effects is that the two Germanys will now probably become an even stronger united economic and financial unit or pair of units whether or not they actually <Col N="437" /> have full political unity.  The only objection the Soviet Union has indicated to unity between the two Germanys is that associated with the Warsaw Pact which itself is beginning to look irrelevant.</P>
    <P>I did the photographs for my own MSc thesis as a medical student in Czechlovakia and got out just in time when the Soviet troops moved in during the Dubcek Spring.  Indeed, it is fascinating that Mr. Dubcek 20 years later, is now being spoken of as a new leader of Czechoslovakia.  Again, this was a cultural and economic centre of Europe.  It will be total change if once more Czechoslovakia becomes involved directly with the rest of us in Europe.</P>
    <P>Hungary is being put forward in some sense as a model.  Indeed, there have been changes in Hungary which predated those in the Soviet Union.  The economic situation there is not very satisfactory either.  Many people in Eastern Europe, as well as in the Soviet Union, are going to find, unfortunately, that democracy in itself does not provide a sudden key to economic prosperity and happinness.</P>
    <P>Other countries such as Bulgaria, Romania and Albania are still attempting to maintain the rigid Stalinist mode which now seems to be collapsing so quickly. We could look at them all.  There is no time to go through all the possible aspects.  I would just like to take a couple of other points.  Over the last 40 years we have seen this fossilised, artificial situation in two powers, one of which was totally removed from Europe and the United States and the other which was basically in many ways an Eurasian power rather than a purely European power, whose economic might, great though it was, was not anywhere nearly equal to that of Europe.  For a time, because of political and military success in 1939-1945 war &mdash; and again whatever the rights or wrongs of that war &mdash; let us not forget that it needed a union of the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and other countries to defeat Germany which <Col N="438" /> is, effectively, an indication of the enormous strength which that country has, which can be exercised for good or ill. We are seeing this change involving Germany, which particularly affects ourselves in all sorts of ways.  Only a couple of weeks ago, Senator Staunton and I were discussing some of these aspects with German parliamentarians.  A few weeks previously they would not have believed that this sort of thing could happen and they are still completely dumbfounded by what has occurred. There are still certain realities there.  We live in very interesting times.  The trend towards democracy in the Soviet Union seems to be continuing.  There is no guarantee whatsoever that this trend will continue.  We hope it will.  There are enormous strains and pressures.  There are doubtless many Soviet military men and other people who are talking &mdash; just as the Chinese leadership did &mdash; and long for some way of suppressing present events.</P>
    <P>Some of the problems which the Soviet Union face are pretty well intractable and could well lead to considerable instability. As the Chinese said, these are very interesting times.  They have a proverb &mdash; or rather a curse &mdash; to live in interesting times.  We must welcome what is happening. We must do all we can, peripheral though we are, to help in this process and to see that it turns out to the benefit of all the peoples of Europe and that the EC, as the Treaty of Rome says, will lay the foundations for an ever-closer union among the peoples of Europe.  In some ways, the European Community as such has probably never been more threatened with disintegration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Needless to say, I support the motion.  I cannot possibly imagine anybody opposing it.  The pace of events has been so rapid and the future is so uncertain that we should not jump to conclusions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People are speaking of the death of <Col N="439" /> communism.  Certainly what we are witnessing are the death throes of bureaucratic state socialism.  I hope we are not witnessing the death of communism.  We have to distinguish between the rigidity of Marxist-Leninist dogma or doctrine, on the one hand and, on the other the vision which inspired the October Revolution in the Soviet Union in 1917.  I am still in favour of that vision.  There is no vision like that in the West.  We were so fearful of that vision in the West, and in this country in particular, that it conditioned our whole attitude towards eastern Europe over the whole of the period since 1917 and particularly during the years of the Cold War.  I hope the vision of the Winter Palace and of Red Square will not perish, because that vision is the vision that poverty can be eliminated and men and women can live in social equality and harmony.  There is a thirst there for justice which I do not see in any of the western ideologies.</P>
    <P>The newspapers, perhaps, were too quick to draw a lesson from the dramatic events of the last few days.  I am not altogether sure that the phrasing of this motion does not share something of the same error, namely, that the East Germans and the East Berliners were, of course, rejoicing in a new-found freedom of movement.  They thronged to West Berlin for all kinds of reasons, not least to wonder at the glories of consumerism, but, at the same time, many of them were not ready accept the full values of the consumerist society which they saw.</P>
    <P>Let us make no mistake about it, what has happened in the last few days is not a victory for capitalism.  It does not prove that the capitalist values have won out. It means the eastern Europeans, while wanting to preserve what they have achieved, want to share the better values of the west.  It is not a simplistic alignment between freedom on the one hand and tyranny and oppression of the other.  Let us remember that while in the west we cherish values like freedom of movement <Col N="440" /> and freedom of speech, in a sense these are only formal freedoms.  In the real world in which we live very few people have the opportunity to exercise freedom of movement or freedom of speech in any meaningful sense.</P>
    <P>Marxists would claim that freedom from hunger, freedom from unemployment and freedom from inability to be treated when you are ill are the real, substantial freedoms.  I would suggest that we are in a situation where the people of the East, if we may just describe them generally, have a thirst for the better things in western values but they are not going to abandon some of their own vision which is a very noble vision.  A better social democracy is what they are looking for.  There is, I suggest, a lot more to inspire them still in that vision of 1917 than there is in Bush's America, with its glaring contrasts of wealth and poverty, in Thatcher's England, and indeed in Haughey's Ireland.</P>
    <P>As previous speakers have pointed out, it is not just East Germany.  All of eastern Europe is now in turmoil, except the curious state of Albania and the grotesque and tyrannical régime in Romania.  Even in the last few days, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia have also indicated signs of change.</P>
    <P>Again, as Senator Staunton pointed out, so much depends on the Soviet Union.  It is now widely accepted that the reasons &mdash; as Senator Staunton also pointed out &mdash; why the East Germans could demonstrate without fear of reprisal or retaliation or fear of Soviet tanks was that they had been guaranteed by Gorbachev that the Soviet Union would not interfere.  So much depends on him and on like-minded people in his circle.</P>
    <P>Senator Staunton and I were having a word or two during the break about this. I said that in the normal course of events one man is such a fragile thing that even if Gorbachev were to vanish from the scene there would be other Gorbachevs who, perhaps, would carry through the <Col N="441" /> aims of <i>perestrokia.</i>  On reflection, we would all be fearful about that.  What is special about Gorbachev is his own personal charisma.  Rarely in the history of the 20th century were mankind's hopes pinned so much on one man.  Truly, if the phrase in the song can be applied to anyone, it is he &ldquo;who has got the whole world on his hands&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>No one can predict what is going to happen.  The Soviet Union has its own continuing turmoil with nationalist fever asserting itself in the various republics and, indeed, in Russia itself.  One of the factors in the situation is, of course, Russian nationalism and how Russian nationalists will react to the peripheral nationalisms, if you like, around the borders of the Soviet Union.  Obviously, we must do what we can.  The West must do what it can to promote stability, peaceful change and not exploit the situation for its own purposes.  Above all, the West must make clear that this is a time for not brandishing military threats or claiming that NATO is the essential bulwark of our freedoms.  Rather we must learn from the lesson of bloodless revolution, which has been taking place before our eyes, to reduce the arms race and to look anew at NATO and the Warsaw Pact.  The really startling fact now facing us is that if this peaceful change goes on &mdash; and it is a very big &ldquo;if&rdquo;&mdash; then NATO has no longer a justification, nor has the Warsaw Pact, nor the United States military presence in Europe.</P>
    <P>One of the implications of what is happening now is that Europe, in the proper sense, is having its own power.  In the last few days we have begun to talk about Europe in the correct sense of the ancient Continent of Europe, not just a section of Europe, which for so long we used as a misnomer to describe the European Community.  It is Europe's power.  The United States must realise this.  It is for Europeans to try to realise their vision of a Europe stretching from the Atlantic &mdash; or, to put it in a more homely phrase, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, which you will <Col N="442" /> appreciate, stretching from Kerry to the Urals.  In that vision we, as a small State, have some part to play.  I said in this House before, and in the debates on foreign policy, that Irish people tend to swing to two extremes &mdash; one extreme is to say to ourselves we do not matter at all, we are of no importance; we are only of peripheral importance; the other is to exaggerate, <i>Southern Star</i> like, our place in world affairs.  It so happens that we do have a role to play, particularly in the next six months, during our Presidency of the Community.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made here tonight to the prospect of German unification.  I suggest it is far too early to talk in these terms.  The East Germans themselves have made it clear that despite whatever rush of blood to the head that people like Chancellor Kohl got in the last week or two, unification of Germany is a long way down the road.  It is a prospect that does not appeal to many of us, certainly not to many Europeans who have good reason to dread and to fear what a united Germany did to them before, and it does not appeal to nations as far apart as France and the Soviet Union.  It would be all very well if the Fourth Reich of 77 million people were to be a peaceful Fourth Reich in a peaceful Europe outside of armed alliances.  That, perhaps, is a prospect that we could look at with equanimity, but certainly not a re-unified German nation state as it was in 1939. Indeed, I understand from my colleague, Senator Norris, that Mr. Gorbachev made it clear in his speech today that that kind of united Germany is certainly not a prospect the Soviet Union is going to stand for.  There has been a lot of facile talk about that.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland should not approach what is happening in any selfish spirit. There is a tendency already to say, &ldquo;Is there going to be less for us in the European Community treasure chest?&rdquo;  This, I suppose, in effect means the German treasure chest.  It would be very shortsighted and very selfish were we to look <Col N="443" /> at these momentous events from the point of view of whether we were going to get less from the begging bowl.  I hope our vision would be larger than that.</P>
    <P>One lesson we could learn &mdash; and we might well be fearful about this &mdash; is that if people power has won the day in East Germany there is no guarantee that there will not be a demonstration of people power in this State if it does not get its social and economic act together and if it persists in tolerating the spectre of poverty among a large number of its citizens. Also, it seems to me an entirely mistaken moral has been drawn by some people in suggesting that because the border between East and West Germany and the Berlin Wall is coming down, then that somehow makes the partition of Ireland equally irrelevant.  Of course, there is absolutely no similarity between the two. If any people power has been demonstrated in this island in recent years it has been in the massive mobilisation of the Protestant people of Ulster against the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>Our Presidency of the EC will give us some room to hope to influence events, but above all &mdash; this is my final word &mdash; I hope we will now stop talking about our obligations to participate in a European defence pact.  It seems to me that the people who kept on emphasising our obligations to become some part of a European military alliance were always out of step with what was happening in these last few years.  I am more than ever convinced that what has happened in the last few weeks has made our neo-Cold War warriors look totally irrelevant, or at least they have been preaching the wrong kind of doctrine.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State was present when he had this debate on neutrality.  He will remember I was the sponsor of that debate and that I emphasised how important it is in a changing Europe that an unarmed and peaceful Ireland should give that kind of peaceful witness.  That is now more important then ever in the <Col N="444" /> months ahead.  The times are so momentous that an historian particularly, perhaps, can only stand trembling on the threshold of history but hoping that this is not only the prelude to a new and peaceful Europe but to a new and peaceful world and that Tennyson's Utopian vision of the federation of the land, the parliament of the world, is now in its first phase.</P>

      <P>During the past week while we here in Seanad Éireann were debating the economic considerations placed before us in the NESC report we were suddenly catapulted into consideration of the political unity of Europe.  It is interesting that Europe now takes centre stage of world events precipitated by President Gorbachev's <i>glasnost</i> policy.  Little did we realise some months ago, perhaps 12 months ago, when he set the wheels in motion that movement would be so rapid.  Another world power leader, President Bush, responded, prophesying that the nineties would be the decade of democracy. There have been some cautionary responses from French and British politicians <i>re</i> the development of another superpower in the event of the re-unification of Germany, premature fears and ones that will take considerable development in the next number of years.  Of course, there will be a fundamental transformation of the European Continent as the Eastern countries move towards greater democracy.  All those words that we have become accustomed to &mdash; European Monetary Union, farm policies, budgets &mdash; now move out of the limelight as the ideal we sought, and still seek, seems more attainable.</P>
      <P>Looking back through the stages of history.  Europe has come through many difficult periods &mdash; periods of disintegration, empires collapsing, followed by reunifications.  We can remember all the words from our history books.  Surely it is history repeating itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come to the spirit of the motion. <Col N="445" /> How can we in Ireland, how can our Government encourage, assist and facilitate this rapid surge towards democracy? In many ways, I would suggest.  We have a particular role to play as a neutral nation.  We are in a unique situation to assist in allaying the fears that may still lurk in the minds of the French and British in relation to, for example, the prospect of a united Germany.  We are a committed member of the Community without being a member of a military alliance.  We can empathise with Eastern countries overshadowed by a superpower, seeing that we have been overshadowed by Britain for so much of our political life and history.  We can appreciate how we felt in the fifties.  I can remember the fifties as a time of widespread emigration.  We can understand the predicament now of these migratory people coming West.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that our thirst for freedom is still not satisfied in relation to a divided Ireland.  This is a very important thing that we have to think of now.  We have turned our backs.  We see these people thirsting for freedom.  We still have to complete our island if we are to talk about real freedom.  Our diplomatic skills, as Senator Staunton mentioned a moment ago, will be called into play now in an effort to defuse the possible tensions that may arise in relation to national boundaries.</P>
    <P>Our cultural ties with Eastern Europe can be traced back to the migration of the Celts, spreading out from India through the Middle East, right through southern Europe, right through eastern Europe.  You could honestly say that our roots are meeting again.  Our hands are clasping across mainland Europe.  We have a deep appreciation in our country of the diversity of cultures, languages and contrasting landscapes.  These span over a long period.  Again I say history is repeating itself, but economic considerations always come to the fore.  They must be considered in the context of the <Col N="446" /> wider community.  We ask ourselves: how will we respond?</P>
    <P>Much has been said already about our peripheral position.  We have fears, perhaps, that we will be even more peripheral in the light of a more consolidated, mainland.  From an agricultural view point, eastern European agriculture is poorly developed, but with an enormous capacity to produce.  Funding, which we have fought hard for, from the central coffers of the developed centre will be stretched.  Hopefully, we will respond to the greater challenges which face us as full members of the European Community.  We will have to show generosity of spirit.  We will have to make sacrifices.</P>
    <P>Again I refer to Northern Ireland. Have we shown that ability in the light of Northern Ireland?  Have we succeeded in removing that localised frontier, particularly if it called upon us to make economic sacrifices?</P>
    <P>This brings me to the concept of freedom. What constitutes freedom?  I think what Senator Murphy has said would give us food for thought for many a debate. The constant stream of young and old in pursuit of freedom, perhaps, causes us to look cynically at the El Dorado that many eastern people possibly expect to find. Some have found this El Dorado and called it the decadent West, adoring the false god for consumerism.  Are those people leaving behind secure employment, availability of housing, access to education, and access to health services? Are they moving into the rat race of a highly competitive society, acquiring the new stresses of that acquisitive society in a world of ever-changing values?</P>
    <P>Again I refer to Senator Murphy's reference to social justice.  Will they find social justice in the western world?  We Irish must apprise ourselves at this crucial moment in history and question our concern for our European neighbours, and, also, especially, for our Third World kindred who are queueing up too for aid from the European Community.  Will <Col N="447" /> they be pushed further down the queue for that economic support?</P>
    <P>We have experienced the delicate and fragile make-up of a new state.  We have experienced the newness of independence. We have experienced the traumas and tensions which brought us to our present situation, a member state of the European Community growing, hopefully, towards full integration.  It behoves us to encourage and assist the democratisation of these countries in a practical way through economic help within the European Community and through sharing with them and helping to recreate the true freedoms of equality and choice.</P>
    <P>The unknown stretches before us.  We fear it.  We are in a position now to evaluate our concept of democracy and freedom, which has certainly been tarnished through complacency.  On a more positive note, perhaps we are entering a new, powerful and peaceful period in the history of mankind.  We are survivors.  We have journeyed through many revolutions &mdash; intellectual revolutions, political revolutions and technological revolutions.  It is incumbent on us, who have suffered so much and have gone through the exeperiences that our Eastern neighbours are going through now, to encourage them, to respond to their needs and to help them fulfil their role in a new sense of freedom.</P>

      <P>We move now to the Adjournment Matter. You have 20 minutes, Senator Costello, and if you wish to share your time with somebody, you should say so at the beginning of your contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I wish to share some <Col N="448" /> remaining minutes at the end of my time with Senator Norris, with your permission.</P>
      <P>I would like to thank the Cathaoirleach for the courtesy of giving me the opportunity of speaking on this Adjournment Matter.  It is a matter that concerns me very directly, because I live in Seán McDermott Street and the school in question, the Central Model School, is in Marlborough Street, which is just around the corner about 100 yards from where I live.  The people I am talking about, the parents of the children, are my neighbours, my friends.  I am chairman of the Seán McDermott Street Community Association and indeed many of the parents are also members of that association and I am in constant contact with them.  I speak on this matter from some experience.</P>
      <P>I would like, first, to give some degree of background in relation to the subject, namely, the Central Model School, which is located in the grounds of the Department of Education.  Indeed, the Minister would see it daily as she drives in or walks in, as the case may be, from opposite the Pro-Cathederal.  It is located in the parish of the Pro-Cathederal.  She would see the conditions in which the children of the Model School &mdash; it is rather ironic to use the term the &ldquo;model school&rdquo;&mdash; are accommodated in the grounds of her Department.</P>
      <P>The Central Model School itself was burnt down on 17 March 1982, thereby leaving the shell of what was once a very fine 19th century building.  The shell itself is in good condition.  The building itself was a fine architectural piece and indeed the school, having been purpose-built for its time, was a show piece and intended to be a show piece in education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present the school is located in prefabs. There are six or seven prefabs with 17 or 18 classrooms and that is the way it has been for the last seven and a half years.  When it was burnt down, on that <Col N="449" /> occasion the Department officials categorically assured parents and teachers that alternative accommodation would be provided in prefabricated structures on a temporary basis only until such time as the permanent structure would be refurbished, reconstructed, and they would then be reinstated in the old building.  That was a promise that was made seven and a half years ago.  Funding was promised to be made available for this.</P>
    <P>In the seven and a half years since then nothing at all has happened to fulfil that promise.  In the meantime the teachers and the children are working in progressively worsening conditions. Remember we are talking about prefabricated buildings that are not seven and a half years old; we are talking about prefabricated buildings that are 18 years old.  They were old buildings already at the time they were commandeered for this &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; purpose that has gone on for seven and a half years.  They have far exceeded their usable lifespan at this point in time.  Even minimal standards of maintenance of security and cleanliness are a constant struggle for the staff and for the pupils who are accommodated there.  That has been the situation over the last number of years with no prospect of any improvement in sight or indeed any apparent attempt at or suggestion of a restored Central Model School building.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to take note of a number of points which I think are extremely pertinent in relation to this matter and for her to take immediate action to restore the Model School under her direct jurisdiction and again situated in its traditional building in the grounds of her Department of Education.  It is a severe embarrassment that this so-called Model School is accommodated in such a fashion and that it is further located right in the backgarden of the Minister herself and has remained in such condition.</P>
    <P>First, our primary concern has to be <Col N="450" /> for the safety of the children themselves. These are children who are living in what would be regarded as one of the most disadvantaged areas in the city centre. They are accommodated in unsafe, leaky buildings.  I was down there the other day when it was raining and the children were putting buckets under the leaks that were coming through the flat roof.  When it rains it is simply impossible to maintain it in adequate repair.  That must be a serious worry to parents of very young children, from infants up to primary school leaving age.</P>
    <P>The condition of the toilets is atrocious. The Minister herself must be well aware of the primitive conditions in which the children have to go to the toilet. There are no towels available for the children and it is quite unhygienic.</P>
    <P>The prefabs are subject to extremes of temperature.  In winter they are too cold, in the summer they are too hot.  The day I was there they were exceedingly stuffy. That is the nature of prefabs; there is very little ventilation.  It is quite unsuitable for young children and it creates a climate where they are subjected to colds, flu, and bronchial illnesses, asthma and so on.  A survey was done recently of the children in the inner city, whom we would be concerned with here, and it showed that there was an excessively high level of bronchial problems brought on by the conditions in the inner city, particularly related to lead poisoning.  These children are then accommodated throughout the day in further unsatisfactory conditions under the jurisdiction of the Department of Education.  It is quite unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>In relation to repairs on the building, it is simply impossible to do adequate repairs.  Painting flakes; the building simply does not hold good quality painting. Money that is spent on repairs on the roof is simply wasted.  I heard it described very well &mdash; that trying to do repairs on the prefabs was like trying to rearrange the furniture on the <i>Titanic</i>, that that was the effect it was going to have, it simply was not going to have any effect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="451" /> Secondly, I would like to point out to the Minister that it must be a concern of her Government that a whole generation of primary school children grow up with an understanding of the Department of Education, the Government of this country, having no real interest in them, that they should be neglected for the duration of their primary education. Remember, that is essentially the extent of the education that most children in that area receive.  Every day they walk past the office of the Minister, coming into the school they have to pass the fine structure that is the Department of Education.  They see in relation to themselves no activity other than the bureaucratic inactivity of promises that are not fulfilled.  One day they will grow up to realise that they were wronged as young children.  That augurs very badly for the future.</P>
    <P>They will grow up with a chip on their shoulder.  How can they be expected to respect law and order if that is the way they have been treated at the most vulnerable times in their lives?  They are already deprived in the circumstances in which they are living; they are being further deprived by the continuous neglect and by the false promises, the unfulfilled promises, of successive Ministers.  I am not referring specifically to the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke.  There have been successive Ministers who have neglected this running sore in the inner city.  At the same time millions of pounds are being poured into private developments in the vicinity.  Only last week we heard the announcement of a luxury hotel being built on the corner of Seán McDermott Street and Marlborough Street and a site has been acquired for a huge office block at the corner of the Department of Education buildings in Marlborough Street itself.  These are developments of a luxury nature taking place right in the vicinity of severe deprivation and neglect in relation to the prefabs in which the children are housed.  That is literally only <Col N="452" /> seconds' walk away from the prefabricated schools.  Surely the youth of the future is a more valuable resource and deserve that our elected Government and Minister would care sincerely for them and take a special care in that particular area of deprivation.</P>
    <P>When we &mdash; the public representatives of the area &mdash; met the Minister for Education about five weeks ago we saw that the Minister was opening an extension of a third level college in Bolton Street.  It is an extension which cost in the region of £8 million.  None of those youngsters is going to have an opportunity to avail of that level of education, part of the reason being that the primary level is certainly not adequate.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister if she could inform us what has happened to the insurance claim following the fire of 1982?  Indeed, I would like to know if a claim has been made and, if the claim has not been made, why has it not been made?  Was there a malicious damages claim against Dublin Corporation? Indeed, could I ask the Minister was the building insured at all?  If the building was insured &mdash; and I presume it would be part of the responsibility of the Department of Education to ensure that all public buildings of this nature would be insured &mdash; then the money that would have been obtained in 1982 and the interest that would have been acquired since, surely must go a long way towards the reconstruction and refurbishment of the old Model School.  If the building was not insured then certainly there is a question to be asked in relation to the Department's standards and in relation to its protection of its material assets.</P>
    <P>At present the school is completely viable.  There is no question in relation to the viability or the non-viability of the school.  From a minimum of 180 pupils around 1985 &mdash; the reason for the low level at that stage was that Dublin Corporation had relocated quite a number of families out of the area to new suburbs, which was corporation policy, and there <Col N="453" /> was a decline in the number of families in the neighbourhood &mdash; the numbers have risen over the last few years.  At present there are 251 pupils in the school. That is an increase of more than 35 per cent and it breaks down into 148 senior pupils and 103 infant pupils.  Therefore, roughly the same figures of schoolgoing population are present now as there were in the early eighties at the time of the fire.  The population is not just stable but has been increasing over the last few years.  There is no question of lack of viability in relation to the school itself.</P>
    <P>Part of the reason for that, is the growing confidence of people in relation to the inner city.  In the sixties and, indeed, in the early and late seventies, there was a belief that the inner cities were going to die.  They had been so neglected, in particular the inner city of Dublin.  There is growing awareness that the inner city is a desirable place to live in, that the inner city is the place of the future, so that there is new confidence and growing numbers of people coming to the inner city.  There is also the commitment, in industrial and financial terms, to the Custom House Docks development where up to £300 million is presently being invested in the financial centre and all the concomitant developments and services that will follow on that.  There is the likelihood of new jobs &mdash; skilled, semi-skilled, unskilled &mdash; which were not available in the city heretofore, coming onstream.  Therefore, there is greater likelihood of people settling in the inner city, because now there will be, for the first time in over two decades, the possibility of new found employment in the vicinity. Remember that part of the reason for the failure and the decline of the inner city was the decline in the docks.  Many people lived by working on the docks as labourers but the onset of containerisation meant that labouring work was no longer available.</P>

      <P>In two minutes I will hand over to Senator Norris.  It is essential that the Central Model School should continue in Marlborough Street.  There is a long tradition of teaching excellence in the school.  The parents have always spoken very highly of the school and I am aware of that.  It is very accessible to youngsters in the inner city.  It is the school of the Pro-Cathedral parish.  It is a focal point for the community.  It is a school that we should and must remain justly proud of.  It is the actual physical accommodation that we are concerned with.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> makes explicit provision for education assistance and support for disadvantaged areas.  There can be no more disadvantaged area than the north inner city of Dublin, and at the heart of the city there can be no more disadvantaged primary school than the prefabricated school in Marlborough Street.  Money invested now in the education of the young boys and girls who attend the school will be money well spent.  Only a small percentage of pupils progress to second level and virtually nobody from the area goes to third level.  Unemployment is high.  What the State saves in not caring for the young in the parish of the Pro-Cathedral it spends a hundredfold on the Garda, the courts, the prisons and unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would say it is a question of priorities.  If the priority is investment in the children of the future then the prefabricated buildings must be demolished. The Model School must be reconstructed in the grounds of the Department of Education and the children of the parish must be given a fair chance in life.</P>

      <P>I rise to join with my colleague, Senator Costello, who lives in the area and who is, like myself, a teacher, <Col N="455" /> as indeed is the Minister.  The Minister, I am sure, will agree with me that a good education is very difficult in a poor environment and this is what we have here in a school that is the Model School &mdash; some model for the Minister to find so embarrassingly close to her own backdoor. The building, which was a fine building, is now an eyesore and I very much hope that for a variety of reasons it will be possible to restore the buildings to its original use.  It is an historic building.  It is the building in which Bernard Shaw was educated.  We have just seen the acquisition of the Shaw house for an enormously inflated price because of the international respect in which Shaw is held.  Surely it is necessary in this area of deprivation that we do not just take a fossilised view of culture but that we are prepared to spend money.</P>
      <P>I imagine the Minister will &mdash; I am prepared to predict this &mdash; plead budgetary constraints.  But I would like to know from the Minister what the costings are and have a date for the completion of this, if it is possible.  I know there are difficulties, but I think it is a matter of very considerable importance and I am sure the Minister, who is a humane person, whose presence in the Chamber is always a delight, will agree with me that in a situation of such enormous deprivation in the north inner city it is necessary to practise what is known as positive discrimination, because the children in the north inner city are already so deprived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conditions have been spelt out by Senator Costello.  I had to spell out last week the same kind of conditions which broke the Factories Act, fire regulations and so on, in St. Garvan's and in No. 20 North Great George's Street.  The Minister has the opportunity now to leave her mark on the area and change the environment of the building in which she works; Tyrone House, home of the Beresfords, among the great oppressors of Ireland, and who had a sign in 1798 <Col N="456" /> hung outside their door saying, &ldquo;J. Beresford, launderer &mdash; mangling done here&rdquo;. The Minister, I am sure, is aware of Padráig Pearse's noble essay on education as the murder machine.  We must ensure that it is no longer a mangling factory in the grounds.  She is a splendid Minister.  I am sure she has the capacity to give us, not only the Model School, but also the North Inner City Community College because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>May I begin by congratulating all those who have returned to this House and welcome the new Members from all sides of the House who I am sure have, had a hard road to get here and who, I am sure, will leave their mark on this Seanad.  I am very fond of the Seanad, as I said before in a previous debate, and never refuse a chance to come here.  I thank Senator Joe Costello for raising this matter and Senator David Norris who is also associated with it.</P>
      <P>Just a few points I want to clear up before we get into the content of what I have to say.  I thought that both contributions were very fair.  Obviously because Senator Costello had a longer time he was historically, in the cumulative sense, very detailed as to all that went on.  As always, Senator Norris added great panache and spice to what he said.  I did not know about the mangler, but it is very interesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not claim to call it the Model School.  Much play has been made of the term; but, as we all know in this House, the model school is historically the term used for these particular schools, and <Col N="457" /> there remain some around the country, in Dublin, Limerick, Cork and various places.  That is the term that was put on them in the last century and that they have remained.  They are peculiarly in the care of the appropriate Minister for Education of the day.  Yes, it is in my backyard; and, yes, I do not like it.  No, I do not sweep by the children; I stop and talk to those children every single morning.  By now I nearly know their names and their mothers' names, because it is mothers who come with their children &mdash; sometimes the fathers, but mostly the mothers.  I was not happy and I do not remain happy at the sight of it.</P>
    <P>I just wonder, if Senator Costello is being slightly political, the school was there for all of them from 1982 to 1987 when his party was a partner in Government and there was not a move out of them to do anything about it.  I make that point because it is relevant.  There was not a cheep out of any of his party about the Model School and the condition of the school.  It has suddenly become an issue now.  He is entitled to make a point &mdash; we are living in a democracy &mdash; and I am entitled to point out that fact, too.</P>
    <P>I would object to the Senator objecting to Bolton Street.  A note of envy crept in &mdash; again, a partisan point.  Bolton Street is a very fine third level establishment available to all the people of the land, but particularly Dublin people.  There is an increase in the student intake into Bolton Street and this year 94 per cent of the students there are receiving full fees waiver.  I think Bolton Street is a fine addition to the inner city and should not be mentioned in an envious sense in regard to other developments needed in the inner city.  Surely Bolton Street was entitled to have its extension?  It was a pure coincidence that the day the delegation came in to see me was the day I opened Bolton Street.  Why should I not be delighted to open Bolton Street?  Taxpayers' money went into the building of it and it is an enhancement of the inner <Col N="458" /> city.  I would just like to put that on the record.</P>
    <P>Five weeks ago I met with the parents and the public representatives, the management and the teachers of the model school, and I told them as soon as the Estimates were out, which were delayed for the last ten days, and I had a full chance to scrutinise my allocations, I would then be meeting with the group again whom I met earlier.  That remains my position.  I hope to set up that meeting within the next week to ten days.  I have put it in train today and I will be meeting with them.</P>
    <P>I remain highly disposed towards this school for a great number of reasons. One, I am aware from my constant knowledge of the school itself that there are excellent teachers in it, with a great love of the children in their care.  I remain convinced there are excellent parents doing their very best to bring up children and intent upon giving them an education. They come in there very early in the morning.  They are trotting along, and children are children, whether they are from County Westmeath or the inner city of Dublin.  There is life and hope in their faces.  There is a brightness and an expression which you could only warm to.  That is very evident in the pupils of that school.  I again put this on the record, because when I met the deputation I said the same thing.  The children may well be deprived, as are many children in the land in prefabs.  I taught in prefabs for 20 years myself &mdash; I never left a prefab &mdash; but the quality of care which they are getting from teachers in this country is second to none in the whole of the world. The teachers in that school are remarkable for what they are doing for the pupils in their care.</P>
    <P>The cost would be approximately £1 million.  The whole matter of the insurance is a tangled web which I am seeking to untangle.  I hope to have the facts for the meeting which I told the people concerned would be held when the Estimates were over.  If I had the <Col N="459" /> money that is where I would put my £1 million and a lot of other millions around the country.  I remain very committed to it, as does the Minister for Labour, who represents the constituency and who is prodding me daily about the particular school, as are the other public representatives. He and I yesterday spoke about that school.  I know the numbers are viable, I know it is a well run school.  I know they are doing a very good job.</P>
    <P>I do not take from it when I say that there are many other schools in the land which have prefabs as well.  It is not unique.  It is unique only because it is centre city.  I make that point because it would seem from what you said, Senator Costello, that it was the only school with prefabs left in the land.  It is not so.  The school is unique in many factors &mdash; unique in where it is, unique in its title, unique in the type of child it strives to serve, unique in the service it is giving and unique in that I feel &mdash; and Senator Norris touched upon it &mdash; culture can be a physical, spiritual and an emotional thing.  I feel that that area of Dublin would benefit greatly by being seen to rise again, from the ashes, so to speak the re-emergence of the aesthetically beautiful building which was there before, plain as was the architecture and the style, plain but beautiful.</P>
    <P>I hope that when I meet with the parents in the grouping, which is composed of public representatives, teachers, <Col N="460" /> management and parents, within the next eight or ten days, that many issues, on which I have to get facts will have been resolved and that at that time I will be able to develop my ideas further on the matter.  I thank both Senators for raising the matter.</P>
