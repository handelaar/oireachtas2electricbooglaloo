      <P>I have notice from Senator Katharine Bulbulia that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to respond with urgency to the recently announced decision of the North Europe-US Atlantic Conference to delete Waterford as a designated tariff arbitrary port and to put a 10 per cent increase in tariffs on Irish exporters; these decision to come into effect from 15 May 1989.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator David Norris of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need, especially in the light of recent tragic events, for the Minister for Justice to consider urgently the immediate opening of the facilities at Wheatfield Detention Centre.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Bulbulia and Norris as suitable for discussion. I have selected the matter raised by Senator Bulbulia and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Norris may give notice another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is not agreed.  Until five minutes ago it was my understanding that we were taking Items Nos. 1, 2 and 3 today.  My group wholeheartedly support Item No. 1. Suddenly, without any indication or notice, it has been withdrawn from the Order Paper today.  The reasons we have heard outside is that this has been withdrawn because the Government Whip in the other House does not want to have the proceedings of this House televised in two weeks' time.</P>

      <P>Everytime there is a difficulty in this House the question arises why was there not agreement among the Whips and why was this matter not sorted out beforehand.  We have a clear understanding on the Order of Business of the House that there is certain notice given on certain days in advance.  It is the clear understanding of this group also that until an hour ago Items Nos. 1, 2, 3 were being taken on the Order of Business.  Without the courtesy of a reason or an explanation as to why it should happen, the Leader of the House cursorily dismissed Item No. 1.  I would like an explanation, a Chathaoirleach, from the Leader of the House and indeed also an explanation as to what it is we have been wasting our time on in the Committee on Procedures and Privileges for the last two years <Col N="1143" /> where almost every other agenda for the CPP contains an item regarding the televising of Oireachtas proceedings.</P>

      <P>I am not discussing the rights or the wrongs of the televising of the House.  I am discussing the narrow point of the placing of it on the Order of Business for today.  It was my clear understanding, and I think the Members of this House are entitled to know, that at the last meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges it was decided to place this motion before the House for decision.  It was decided to place this motion before the House today for many reasons, including that of allowing RTE to have coverage of the proceedings in the copy of the <i>RTE Guide</i> which was to be published next week.  The Members of the House are entitled to know the reasons why it was ordered originally for today.  With due respect, a Chathaoirligh, I do believe I am not discussing the rights or the wrongs of it.  I think the Members of the House have an entitlement to know&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is a fact, we would have to ask the Leader of the House, that because we have been <Col N="1144" /> accused, if you do not mind, by the Whip of the other House of slowing down the televising of the Business of the Oireachtas, he would not allow our committee to &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much regret what has happened and the loss of a very active and very valuable Member of the House, even for a short period.  This matter could be resolved if, first, the Leader of the House would assure this side of the House if there is still agreement in principle to the substance of Item No. 1 and, secondly, that no pressure of any sort has been brought to bear to have this item dropped today by the Government Whip in the other House.</P>

      <P>First, I want to pay tribute to the people who arrange the Order of Business for us.  In comparison with times past, we now know in advance what the Order of Business is.  We are given good advance information.  Therefore, I exercised myself for the past several hours on thinking about the implications of Item No. 1.  In fact, I met a prominent RTE personality who was going to be involved with the implementation of Item No. 1.  One of the points I was going to make was that we should be sure that this televising is done with proper regard for the membership of the House, not simply to show off a restored Chamber.  Now I find that this item has been removed, with total mysteriousness, from the Order of Business. The rumour is commonplace that this is because the Fianna Fáil Party is indignant that the Seanad should have such pretensions as to want to be televised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I also feel strongly that it is important that this item of business be dealt with.  Perhaps the Leader of the House can give us an indication of the position because it has been suggested to me unofficially that one of the reasons is that there was not consultation with all of the bodies concerned.  Can the Leader of the House give us an undertaking that this item will be taken tomorrow, for example?  I am sure you will agree with me, a Chathaoirligh, it is important that this Chamber be made as relevant as possible to the people of Ireland.  There is no doubt, and the experience of the televising of the Upper Chamber in England makes it clear, that this precise thing does make such a Chamber relevant.</P>
      <P>I would like to end by placing on the record, as other people have seen fit to place on the record what I would consider disparaging remarks, my considerable esteem for Senator O'Toole and my regret that he has been removed from the House because he has some extremely substantial and important amendments in his name to the Firearms Bill.  I hope they will be moved so that the people of Ireland will not be deprived of his wisdom.</P>

      <P>You have assured me I am incorrect in assuming that your interpretation of repetition has changed and I will, therefore, withdraw the remark. May I also direct to you, A Chathaoirligh, my request that you, as chairwoman of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, do not allow the decisions of that body to be hijacked by people who have no role in this House?

      <P>When you stop interrupting me, a Chathaoirligh, I will stand up again.  With considerable restraint, given the record I think I have of taking this House extremely seriously, and anybody who doubts that can look at the large number of amendments in my name on the Order of Business of this House over the years.  I am simply saying that I, as a long-standing Member of this House, deeply resent the fact that the decisions of our committee &mdash; the Committee on Procedure and Privileges &mdash; apparently can be hijacked by people who have no connection with this House.</P>
      <P>Let me say in conclusion, because Senator O'Toole asked me to say this, that I invite in particular from the Leader of the House an assurance that the Government party are not endeavouring to give the franchise for televising the Houses of the Oireachtas to some body other than RTE and are attempting to defend the interests of their friends in another place by preventing this motion from going through.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I wish to move an amendment to the Order of Business that Item No. 1 be taken first today.</P>

      <P>I understand the significance of the last remark fully.  I do not wish the House to get into a divisive situation whereby Members of your own party are <Col N="1152" /> congratulating you and people from this side are criticising you but we are getting very, very close to it.</P>
      <P>I think it is only fair to say on the Order of Business that this House has made a total disgrace of itself today and the disgrace rests squarely on the Government side of this House.  Senator O'Toole, who is an active Member of this House, was making a very serious and very cogent point.  He was demanding, which this House has a right to, an explanation for the outrageous behaviour of the Leader of this House and the chaos in which this House is being conducted. It is absolutely unacceptable to anybody on this side of the House that items should be placed on the Order Paper without any notice and should be taken off without any reason having been given. It is contemptuous to this House and it is absurd.  I regret that you, a Chathaoirligh, allow this House to be treated in this way.  I think we deserve from the Leader of the House serious explanations not only for that but also on whether a decision been made by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that this would be taken on this date?  If that is true and if it is so, why has it been removed?</P>
      <P>I regret enormously the fact that Senator O'Toole has been removed for making these points which I am making now when certain other Members of that side of the House do not even bother turning up regularly.  I think it is very important&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Order of Business <Col N="1154" /> so far seems to have been dictated by innuendo and rumour and various other things form outside the House.  Various things were said before I got the opportunity to speak.  It is regrettable that any Member has to be asked to leave this House.  Nevertheless, I believe it was right that that should happen today.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning was the first person to speak and he mentioned that business ordered for today was not being adhered to.  I would remind Senator Manning that no business is ordered in this House until the Leader of the House orders it.  It does not make any difference what appears anywhere.  It is the Leader of the House who orders the business and I ordered the business for today.</P>

On the question of consultation and various other items that were raised about the televising or broadcasting of proceedings of this House, it would seem that lack of courtesy has been very much to the fore in various places.  I do not know who was consulted by RTE on the matter of broadcasting or what was going to happen.  I definitely was not consulted at all by them, in particular in relation to the matter before the House today.  We are going to take Items Nos. 2 and 3 today.  We go on the Order of Business as proposed by me earlier.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, the Leader of the House said it is he who orders the business of the House.  There is a convention going back a very long time in this House that the Order of Business is determined by agreement in <Col N="1155" /> advance and that all sides of the House are informed what the business is to be. We were informed that Item No. 1 was to be the first item taken today.  I think it is only reasonable in those circumstances if that item is withdrawn that some explanation is given.  I endeavoured to allow the Leader of the House to give us an explanation.  All I want is an explanation. I am quite prepared to have this business deferred to another day.  I asked him for an explanation.  I asked him if, in principle, it was being&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think you will agree that I am probably one of the most reasonable Members of this House but I believe in the interests of the House that we are owed an explanation; otherwise we may have behaviour forced upon us which we certainly would not like to adopt.  Secondly, I greatly regret the tone of the debate today.  I regret in particular the sweeping allegation made by Senator Ross.  I feel it is not in the interests of the House.  He should either substantiate or withdraw that allegation which put a shadow over every Member of this House.  I regret that.  The substantial point is that I have on three occasions invited the Leder of the House to give us the reason why the Order of Business was changed.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, the Leader of the House is, of course, technically within his rights in saying that it is he who proposes the Order of Business but he also referred to lack of courtesy.  I suggest that were there is an obvious and expected concentration of Members' interest on a particular item and then mysteriously that is not referred to whatsoever, that is lack of courtesy. Senator O'Toole's suspension might well have been avoided had the Leader of the House told us at the outset why it was that Item No. 1 was not being ordered. He has not even told us in his reply.

This change is necessary because of the additional provision which it is proposed to introduce into Part II in the amendments to be discussed.  Some of these, like the proposed new offence of reckless discharge of a firearm, can be brought into operation immediately while others, like that providing for the inclusion of stun guns and crossbows as firearms, will require a period of grace before they can be brought into operation.</P>

      <P>The combined purpose of the amendments is to provide that a crossbow will not be defined as a firearm or will not, therefore, be encompassed by the controls in the Firearms Acts. As an alternative form of control, the Senator has proposed by amendments Nos. 11 and 12 to include crossbows with knives and similar articles the carrying of which is prohibited in section 5 (1) in certain specified places of public entertainment and resort and by amendment No. 13 to include a crossbow among those weapons which it would be an offence to have under section 6 while trespassing on premises.</P>
      <P>The effect of the Senator's amendments, if accepted, would be to make it an offence to have a crossbow in places like public houses, football grounds, dancehalls etc., or while trespassing on private premises.  Otherwise there would be no controls in the availability or use of crossbows.  Anybody would be entitled to buy one and to carry it on the street or in any other public place other than specified areas of public entertainment and resort where, indeed, it is unlikely to be carried anyway.  Such a level of control would be so ineffective as to be worthless.</P>
      <P>The position is that crossbows are dangerous weapons with lethal potential. They have many of the characteristics of a gun.  They can be carried pre-loaded and ready to fire.  They can be accurate and lethal over a considerable distance. They can be used without need of a great deal of skill and are reasonably compact.</P>
      <P>In considering what controls should be placed on a weapon like that, the most important question is who should be allowed to have them rather than where they should be allowed.  This means a licensing system and the most effective licensing system for weapons is that provided in the Firearms Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With particular regard to amendments Nos. 4 and 5, the Garda authorities are of the very strong view that the words in the existing definition of firearm which these amendments seek to delete should be retained.  They report that the words in question are used in the fight against terrorism to secure convictions in relation <Col N="1161" /> to homemade rocket launchers and projected grenades, neither of which would otherwise come into the legal definition of a firearm.  The relevant provisions are also used to deal with a variety of missiles which can be projected or thrown in a number of different ways.</P>
    <P>For those reasons I am sure the House will understand why it is impossible for me to accept Senator O'Toole's amendments.</P>

      <P>These amendments are related.  They are for the purpose of amending the Firearms Acts to the extent necessary to enable this country to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on the Control of the Acquisition and Possession of Firearms by Individuals.  The purpose of that convention is to regulate and control the movement of firearms and ammunition between member states of the Council of Europe with a view to preventing illicit traffic on those items.  It applies in the situation where a resident of a contracting state to the convention wishes to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of a firearm or ammunition to a resident of another contracting state or <Col N="1162" /> where a resident wishes to move to another contracting state and take a firearm with him.</P>
      <P>States who became party to the convention may agree either to adopt a system, known as the notification system, whereby they merely have to notify other contracting states when a firearm is being sold or transfered to one of their residents, or they can also agree to apply a more rigorous system known as the double authorisation system whereby they undertake not to allow a resident of their state to transfer or sell a firearm to a resident of another contracting state until they have first satisfied themselves via the channels provided for the convention that the authorities of the latter state have authorised the transaction.</P>
      <P>It is our intention when ratifying the convention to adopt the provisions of the convention in full and to apply the notification and double authorisation systems appropriate and the amendments are framed on this basis.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 7 provides that silencers and telescopic sights of the type referred to in the amendment will be deemed to be component parts of a firearm, thus making them subject to the provisions of the Firearms Acts.  This is necessary because these items are defined as firearms in the convention.  There is also another purpose for this amendment in so far as silencers are concerned and this will be discussed in the context of amendment No. 9.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 proposes to insert a new subsection (3) (A) in section 10 of the Firearms Act of 1925 to provide for the operation of the notification and double authorisation systems provided for in the convention.  Paragraph (a) of the proposed new subsection will provide that a person may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of a firearm or ammunition to a person habitually resident in or to a company or organisation at an address in another state which is party to the convention unless the sale etc. is authorised by the garda superintendent of the district in which the firearm or ammunition is kept.  Before granting such authorisation the garda superintendent <Col N="1163" /> must satisfy himself that the authorities of the state to which the firearm is being sent have authorised the transaction.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) is for the purpose of modifying section 16 (4) of the Firearms Act of 1925 which exempts a person who is the holder of a firearms certificate from the requirement to obtain authorisation to export the firearm if he carries it with him from the state.  Under the provisions of the convention the double authorisation system must be applied where a person intends to take his firearm to another contracting state on a permanent basis.  Section 16 (4) must therefore, be modified to provide that where a firearm is being taken to another contracting state on a permanent basis, the authorisation required under section 16 must first be sought and paragraph (b) secures this.  Paragraph (c) is merely for the purpose of excluding stun guns and crossbows as these are not covered by the convention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 covers a specific range of weapons.  I would like to ask the Minister about imitation firearms, many of which today are very sophisticated in the degree of imitation and they are very convincing indeed.  Should they be brought within the scope of the Bill under section 4?  I know that on Second Stage the Minister said that imitation firearms are already covered in law, that the law provides for severe penalties for the use of imitation firearms in the commission of crimes &mdash; up to 14 years &mdash; but should they be brought in under this section here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised and I am glad to get an opportunity to say to Senator Manning, that any imitation guns in the course of a crime are treated as if they were real guns and they are dealt with accordingly under the law.  It is only when imitation guns are used for the purpose <Col N="1164" /> of committing crime that we can deal with them.  We have not been able to have any legislation to deal with imitation guns, as imitation guns.</P>
      <P>There is a difficult area for us to come to grips with in that there is genuine concern everywhere, right across the board that quite a number of these imitations are so real and so life-like that it is practically impossible for members of the security forces to know whether they are real or imitation when they are confronted with them.  That is why the courts take a very serious view of the use of imitation guns and treat them as if they were genuine guns when the people are brought to court.</P>

      <P>Perhaps to contribute a little to what has just been said, I do think there is a serious question about imitation guns, not just in regard to commission of crime but the whole matter of children and toy guns.  In a society that has the problems we have had over the past 20 years, may I suggest to the Minister that, in the way that it is illegal to print any play money that in any way could ever appear to resemble real money in order to minimise the risk of forgery, that one could consider legislation, &mdash;and I would suggest it &mdash; which would prohibit the manufacture of any toy guns which could in the eyes of the Garda Síochána be seen to represent real guns.  There are all these elaborate sort of ray guns that nobody would believe for one second looked like a real gun and kids play with them.  But there are also imitation guns that, as the Minister said, at first glance look authentic. I do not think they should be on sale anywhere.  I have three small children myself.  In a country that has the problems we have, we should not do anything that encourages a cavalier attitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in agreement with Senator Ryan and Senator Manning very much in this particular area, as I am sure does every other Member of the House.  The problem is that to deal effectively with the issue that has been outlined by Senators Manning and Ryan, would necessitate, I am told, a total ban <Col N="1165" /> on all sorts of toy guns because they are all so real, they all imitate so well the real thing.  I have seen &mdash; I am sure others have too &mdash; cases where we have the Armalite and the Uzi in toy shapes and a whole lot of items which one could not know were real or not.</P>
      <P>Having regard to our circumstances and the concern that exists and the availability of these toy guns, I think the day may come when we will be talking about legislation banning all toy guns altogether. I am sure I would be told at that stage, if I did come in with proposals of that nature, that I was going overboard. I feel it is something that does not now come within the scope of this Bill but I share the concern that is there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's response and thinking on this matter and, coming from the area that I come from, it is of particular importance. The reference here regarding toy guns has to be looked at in the context that if you are looking at the muzzle end of a gun you react in a certain way and you do not deliberate whether it is a toy gun or a real gun.  I think that has got to influence the drafting of legislation.  What the gun was used for and how the person who was challenged with it reacted in the situation has to influence the drafting of the legislation.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's thinking on toy guns because those of us who cross the Border often would not be very comfortable if a toy gun of any shape or kind was accidentally in the car.  It could have serious repercussions, serious consequences.  This has been stated time out of number by the military authorities in the North of Ireland.  This is an equally important matter.  I am glad the Minister has responded in a positive way, and I am glad to know his thinking on this matter.</P>

    <P>Government amendment No. 8:</P>
    <P>In page 4, before section 5, but in Part II, to insert the following section:</P>
    <P>5.&mdash;The Firearms Act, 1925, is hereby amended by the insertion in section 10 after subsection (3) of the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3A) (a) A person shall not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of a firearm or ammunition for a firearm to a person who habitually resides, or to a body at an address, in a country that stands prescribed for the time being for the purposes of this section unless the superintendent of the Garda Síochána of the district in which the firearm or ammunition is kept, being satisfied that the transaction is authorised by the competent authorities of that country, also authorises it.</P>
    <P>(b)  This subsection is without prejudice to the other provisions of this section and to section 16 of this Act but subsection (4) of that section does not apply to a firearm or ammunition for a firearm carried by a person from the State for the purpose of transferring it permanently to such a country as aforesaid.</P>
    <P>(c)  In this subsection &ldquo;firearm&rdquo; does not include a firearm specified in paragraph (c) or (d) of section 4 (1) of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1989.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>Government amendment No. 9:</P>
    <P>In page 4, before section 5, but in Part II, to insert the following section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;(1)  A person shall be guilty of an offence if he has in his possession or sells or transfers to another person a silencer unless the possession, sale or transfer is authorised in writing by the <Col N="1167" /> superintendent of the district in which the first-mentioned person resides.</P>
    <P>(2)  A superintendent shall not grant an authorisation under this section unless he is satisfied that the person who is to have possession of the silencer or to whom it is to be sold or transferred is the holder of a firearm certificate for a firearm to which the silencer can be fitted and that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  having regard to all the circumstances, the possession, sale or transfer concerned will not endanger the public safety or the peace, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the person has a special need that is, in the opinion of the superintendent, sufficient to justify the granting of the authorisation for the silencer.</P>
    <P>(3)  The superintendent of the district where the holder of an authorisation under this section resides may, at any time, attach to the authorisation such conditions as he considers necessary for the purpose of preventing danger to the public or to the peace or of ensuring that the silencer is used only to satisfy the special need for which the authorisation was granted.</P>
    <P>(4)  An authorisation under this section may be granted for such period not exceeding one year as is specified in the authorisation and may be revoked by the superintendent of the district where its holder resides.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to introduce very strict controls on the availability of silencers for firearms.  As the law stands, silencers are regarded as accessories rather than component parts of a firearm and, thus, they are not subject to control under the Firearms Acts.  The Garda authorities have advised that they consider the ready availablity of silencers a serious threat to public safety, given the use which may be made of such items by criminals and that they would like to see their availability strictly controlled.  Amendment No. 7 which has already been discussed in the context of the convention will provide that a silencer will be deemed to be a component part of a firearm.  The effect of this will be that the silencer will be available only to the holder of a firearms certificate or to persons specifically authorised to have component parts of a firearm. This, in itself, would still leave them too widely available and that is why there is a need for this amendment that I have here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's comment here but I would like to have more clearly stated.  Would the Minister consider going a little bit further because I believe it is much more important than a component part of a firearm. Anyone who has a silencer has it for a purpose.  Certainly his intentions are not good.  I would ask the Minister to consider the person found with a silencer on <Col N="1169" /> his person, in his car, in his house, or anywhere under his control should be treated separately and very seriously, much more seriously than a firearm, because the intentions are lethal at that point.</P>
      <P>I strongly believe that there must be special legislation and special provision for dealing with that one specific item.  A silencer means that somebody intends to commit a serious crime undetected and it is there for one purpose only.  I would like to see the Minister being absolutely clear and positive about this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am indeed and I thank Senator McGowan for the views he has expressed.  I share those views, as I am sure every Member of this House would share them, that anybody who has a silencer in his or her possession has it for no good reason whatsoever.  Indeed, it makes the carrying of a gun more dangerous in itself because of the effectiveness of the silencer and the reduction of the danger of being caught because of the effects of the silencer.  The Bill now provides for the maximum penalty of five years for anybody caught with a silencer in their possession.  I am very concerned about it.  As I say, a maximum penalty of five years is quite a serious penalty and I would hope would be effective in dealing with it.</P>

      <P>We would want to have a quick look at our priorities.  You can get more than five years for stealing a car, or at least the same penalty.  I want to put on record that I agree with Senator McGowan.  It is not often I say that in this House so when I do say it, I may as well say it clearly.</P>
      <P>I cannot imagine any reason than a nefarious one for somebody being in possession of a silencer.  It would appear to me that in specifying a five year sentence, given the other areas of criminal activity which are far less sinister in their implications that carry a five year sentence, we are perhaps being less than consistent. This is not usually my position in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Gaeltacht (Mr. D. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is for the purpose of inserting a new section in the Bill to provide for an offence of reckless discharge of a firearm. There is a gap in the law at present in relation, for example, to a situation where somebody fires a gun at a person's dwelling&mdash;not with any probable intent to injure but perhaps to frighten &mdash; or otherwise discharges a firearm in circumstances where there could be a serious risk of injury to a person.  The difficulty is that existing statutory provisions which might seem applicable to <Col N="1171" /> an action of this sort require proof of intent to cause injury or endanger life. This may not always be possible to prove in the case of the action at which the proposed new section is directed.</P>
      <P>The person discharging the gun may well have had no deliberate intent to cause injury or endanger life.  He may have had some other motive for his action, such as to frighten or intimidate, a motive which would also be difficult to prove.  Again, he might simply discharge the weapon without any care as to whether some person might be injured.</P>
      <P>Ownership and use of a firearm carries with it a duty of responsibility and care and it is right that the law should punish any deliberate or reckless misuse of a firearm which could result in injury to a person.  The wording of the amendment itself is clear and does not call for any further explanation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>

      <P>I am happy to support this amendment.  I seem to remember a prominent member of Senator Manning's party letting fire with a shotgun at a travellers' site one time, not doing anybody in the nation any great good.  He was actually a Minister at one stage in the Government.  I remember him for other reasons too; I think he had a hand in the resignation of a President subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister one question.  What are the implications of this section for members of the security forces?  Are they covered by the provisions of this amendment?  There are areas in which there has been some considerable public concern in recent years about members of the Garda firing what are called warning shots with fairly powerful weapons in a situation where it could not necessarily be argued that the <Col N="1172" /> Garda were personally threatened themselves but where there was a possibility of serious disorder.  Are members of the security forces who are in possession of firearms covered by this amendment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Senator Ryan raised that point and that the Minister responded because we are not talking here about a theoretical possibility.  A source of great concern to the citizens at large was the incident in O'Connell Street not so long ago when a person discharged from the courts was followed in a busy shopping area and a shot was discharged to the great concern of all the citizens. I am very glad to hear the Minister's assurance that this section will apply across the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Not because of any concern with precedents such as the one cited by Senator Ryan, I am a little bit concerned about the Minister's reply.  I have two cases in mind.  Is the Minister saying that a garda who, in his proper judgment discharges a shot over the heads of a crowd because it is his view that this is the most effective way of bringing order to a situation which is disorderly, would be acting illegally in that case?  There may very well be situations where a shot fired over the heads of a crowd might help to bring people to their senses.  It might well have such an effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was another situation at the Munster Hurling Final a year or two ago in Thurles where, I believe, a garda fired a shot over the heads of the crowd when it looked as if there was going to be crowd trouble.  I take a view that there may well be situations in which a police officer, in using his own experience and judgment, may have well come to the conclusion that greater good is done and harm is averted by firing a warning shot.  I would like to know if the Minister could clarify for us whether that type of situation was <Col N="1173" /> always illegal, or is it now illegal under this Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to agree with the previous speaker in so far as it is an area where you cannot say it is black and white.  We have to depend a good deal on the professionalism of the Garda and the Army.  On the outside there are groups of people in this country at present who are ready to lynch and are ready to condemn.  If a well trained professional garda or a member of the Army has to react in a situation and takes what he calculates is the best decision in the long run to save life there are people who actually want him crucified on the spot. The person concerned is the subject of headlines in the media and the national papers and he finds himself defending that action, perhaps with not a lot of support.  In the case of the garda who decides in his wisdom to act, I would like to see legislation there to prevent him from being punished when he made a decision he considered to be the correct one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points to be made there by way of commentary on what Senator McGowan has said.  The general intention of this Bill is to remove from the private citizen whatever remaining rights he has, if you like, to have resort to the immemorial right of self-defence.  I agree with this.  I agree that in our society citizens have to forego whatever claims they have on the right to bear arms and so on.  I think that is a totally out-moded concept anyway. However, it carries with it a corresponding obligation on the part of the security forces, gardaí or whatever, who now in effect will have the monopoly of force under law in society.  Therefore, they are all the more seriously obliged to discharge &mdash; that is not an inappropriate verb &mdash; their responsibilities very, very seriously indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda or the security forces themselves must observe the law.  In any case, the recklessness or otherwise of such action is going to be determined by the courts.  Is that not so?  Therefore, I do not <Col N="1174" /> think there will be any vindictive pursuit of a garda or soldier who discharges a shot like this.  As I say, the matter will be decided responsibly by the courts.  I am quite happy to see the section standing and to have it applied across the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reiterate my view that it should be very clear, and I was happy when the Minister said it, that this applied to the security forces.  Let us remember that as far as the Garda go, those gardaí who most likely and most frequently carry weapons are not identifiable as members of the Garda.  They are usually in plain clothes.  The possible consequences to a large number of people of a civilian suddenly producing a gun, however well-intentioned and I am not denying or disputing the good intentions, can be quite disturbing.  I think it is important to remember as well &mdash; it sounds like the most obvious thing in the world &mdash; that what goes up must come down and firing a firearm into the air is not firing it into outer space.  It can do damage.  If somebody were to unfortunately discharge something more serious than a pistol you could have serious consequences.</P>
      <P>The reality is that firearms are extremely dangerous things that are in the possession of the security forces only for circumstance of extreme need in the defence of themselves and us from those who would use weapons for all sorts of appalling reasons.  They are not things to be used as a substitute for good crowd control, as a substitute for dealing with a riot or anything like that.  I think it is extremely important that they should be seen as such.  Otherwise, you can have a beginning of a feeling that in any situation where perhaps the occasional use of a firearm will produce an immediate response it could be justified.  If there is evidence of a reckless use of a firearm by any person in our society, then the culpability of that person should be a matter for the courts and that should apply to every person.</P>

      <P>That would be the case in relation to our armed forces as <Col N="1175" /> well.  As Senator McGowan has said, we have to assume that they are people trained in the use of firearms and would know exactly what is the right thing to do on a particular occasion.  Anybody discharging a firearm recklessly would certainly come under this section here, irrespective of whether they are in the Defence Forces or not.  That would be regarded as using the firearm recklessly.</P>

      <P>This may be slightly out of order, and if I am I am sure the Chair will tell me.  We have an example of the professionalism of members of the Garda and the extraordinary restraint which was exercised in the rescue of Mr. O'Grady from his kidnappers when the gardaí who rescued him were under fire and obviously declined to use firearms because there were too many risks for innocent civilians.  At great risk to themselves they did not use their firearms because of the possible risks in a crowded street in a heavily populated area of using firearms. I think that is an indication that most members of the security forces under most circumstances realise what we are dealing with.  Because of that I do not think anybody in the security forces who operates according to the normal disciplines of the forces will have anything to worry about from this, but it is a reminder that everybody is covered by the law.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment Nos. 11 and 12 not moved.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 deals with the burden of proof.  It puts the burden of proving innocence on the person found with the alleged offensive weapon.  The burden will be to prove lawful authority or reasonable excuse on a balance of probabilities.  This goes against the recommendations of the law Reform Commission in the report on vagrancy <Col N="1176" /> and related offences.  They considered that, provided the accused adduced sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue as to whether he had lawful authority or reasonable excuse, the burden of proving the contrary should be on the prosecution. They took the view that it would not be desirable that a burden such as proposed in this Bill should be placed on the accused.  This strikes me as being a fairly major shift in practice &mdash; that the burden of proof now rests with the defendant, the accused, rather than with the prosecution &mdash; and I would like to get some opinion on this from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the words in brackets in subsections (1) and (2) &mdash;&ldquo;the onus of proving which shall lie on him&rdquo; is to place a persuasive burden of proof on the accused if he raises the defence of lawful authority or reasonable excuse.  The Law Reform Commission recommended in their report, LRC 11-1985, paragraph 13.8 that the words in brackets be omitted and that only an evidential burden of proof be placed on the accused.  Their recommendation is not being followed as it is considered that to place only an evidential burden on an accused could make the securing of a conviction more difficult and would, therefore, greatly weaken the effect of the subhead.  For example, if a person were to be charged with having say a Stanley knife in a dancehall he might say in his defence that he was using it at work that day and had forgotten to take it out of his pocket.  This might discharge his evidential burden and it would be very difficult for the prosecution to disprove his statement.  However, with the persuasive burden to discharge, if he raised this defence he would be obliged to produce enough evidence to satisfy the court on the balance of probabilities that this excuse was true, for example, the testimony of a colleague who had seen him work with the knife that day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of statutes require an accused to discharge persuasive burden of proof in relation to criminal offences, for example, larceny, that is in the 1916 Larceny Act, section 28 paragraph 2.  This <Col N="1177" /> provides that the onus of proving lawful possession of house-breaking implements at night shall be on any person so found.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Senator O'Toole I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), line 24, after &ldquo;sells&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, repairs&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 8 (1) states:</P>
      <P>Any person who manufactures, sells or hires, or offers or exposes for sale or hire, or has in his possession for the purpose of sale or hire, or puts on display, or lends or gives to any other person, a weapon to which this section applies shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>It is only logical that a person who repairs these weapons should be in the same category of suspicion or guilt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Professor Murphy and Senator O'Toole who introduced these amendments initially.  It seems to me to be entirely illogical and without justification to make it an offence to sell offensive weapons, to hire offensive weapons, to offer to expose for sale or hire, or to have in one's possession for the purpose of sale or hire, offensive weapons and not to specifically include &mdash; because it would not be covered by <Col N="1178" /> sale or hire &mdash; anybody who, as a favour to those who use weapons, decided to repair them.  He might not be selling them, he might not be hiring them.  It is important to make it clear to people that it is a serious offence punishable by a considerable period of imprisonment to contribute in any way to the availability of offensive weapons in our society. Therefore, it is extremely important that the full detailed rigours of the law should be clearly spelled out and that it is as serious an offence to repair an otherwise defunct offensive weapon as it is to sell it because it puts another weapon into the hands of those who will only use them to do great harm and great damage.  It is as bad to repair a weapon that would not otherwise work as it would be to sell one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly support this amendment unless the Minister can persuade me otherwise or unless the word &ldquo;repair&rdquo; is not quite the adequate word to describe the function the Senator has in mind.  Take the situation, say, of people who have these offensive weapons who alter them in certain ways, for example, sawn-off shotguns, or where weapons are altered or repaired or changed in some way to make them even more lethal.  Are they covered under this section of the Bill already?  If the word &ldquo;repair&rdquo; could be brought in to cover them.  I would certainly urge the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The section does not cover firearms, but these amendments are not being accepted for the following reasons.  Section 8 is designed to prohibit commercial trade in prescribed dangerous weapons.  The purpose is to close off outlets where these weapons can be bought or otherwise obtained.  It does not prohibit personal possession of such weapons.  It will be quite lawful for a person to have such a weapon in his home, although if he takes it outside his home he may well be caught by other provisions in the Bill.  If &ldquo;repair&rdquo; were introduced into the section in the manner suggested in the amendments, then we would have a situation that, while it <Col N="1179" /> would be lawful for a person to have such a weapon, it would be unlawful for him to repair it.  The absence of &ldquo;repair&rdquo; from this section will not impair its effectiveness as it is aimed principally at closing off sales.  The types of weapon involved, in any event, would not normally be brought somewhere for repair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to press the Minister a little further on this. As Senator Manning has developed the point, &ldquo;repair&rdquo; could mean, and frequently in practice probably does mean, someone who is an expert in this area and who is also, perhaps, in an illegal atmosphere, doing a favour, or for hire, or whatever, adapting and improving the lethal quality of a weapon.  It does not seem to me that the section covers that kind of situation, that someone who is actually dealing and improving these weapons should not be subject to the rigours of the law.  What provision would the Minister make for that kind of situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to refer to the section to explain the amendment.  Perhaps the word &ldquo;repair&rdquo; is not the appropriate word.  I am a great believer in leaving the issues of detail to those who are best qualified to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to explain to us why it is unacceptable to the Government that people who repair offensive weapons are somehow not making available an increasing supply over those who would sell them.  If the weapon does not work and somebody is prepared to repair it so that it becomes an offensive weapon, it is then an additional weapon made available.  Even if he does not sell it to somebody, if he simply takes money for <Col N="1180" /> making it work, for instance somebody who has experience in firearms, then the Minister is leaving a small loophole in the legislation.</P>
    <P>I appreciate there may be objections in detail to the precise wording of these amendments in the sense that they might not precisely have the intent we would like, but that is not the same thing as dealing with the principle, which is that we are not actually saying that it is an offence <i>per se</i> to repair these offensive weapons in the way that it is an offence to sell them, or an offence to hire them.  If a person has an offensive weapon illegally and finds somebody who is prepared to repair it, what offence does the repairer commit?  He does not sell it, he does not hire it, and he does not have it in his possession other than for the period of time when he actually has it.</P>
    <P>It should be an offence simply to do the job of repairing an illegally held offensive weapon.  In other words, all areas of dealing with offensive weapons ought to be covered by the law.  It appears to me that it would not be necessarily an offence simply to do the job.  If one of the alleged heroes of this country who do things in our name that none of us could justify finds somebody who is half sympathetic who will fix a weapon, a weapon which is jammed or damaged, or as Senator Murphy said who will modify a weapon &mdash; I am sorry in some ways we did not put in &ldquo;repairs or modifies&rdquo;&mdash; will the person who does that job and does nothing else, who does not have it any longer than half an hour in his possession, be guilty of an offence?  If he is not, he should be.  That is the issue of principle.  We can argue about the details; I leave it to the Minister, the officials and the Parliamentary Draftsman to draft an amendment for Report Stage.  I want to ensure, not that this amendment goes in, but that it is quiet clear that somebody who does the things I have described is actually guilty of a serious offence, because he should be.</P>

      <P>I oppose this amendment from the point of view &mdash; I will be raising something else under the section <Col N="1181" /> later on when this amendment is dealt with &mdash; of fish filetting knives and knives for skinning deer which are manufacturered in my county.  If a fish filetting knive was brought in for repair to somebody, it would be an offence if we had this amendment.  Most of these fish filetting knives &mdash; I brought up a sample to show to the Minister for Justice and his Department &mdash; are for export but some are used in this country.  They look a fairly offensive weapon, but they are actually for filetting fish.  If this amendment were included it would prohibit people from repairing these knives and also knives for skinning deer.</P>

      <P>With regard to the manufacture of knives I raised this matter here the last day we were discussing this Bill.  A company in my county manufacture knives.  They have 140 people employed and 95 per cent of the knives are for export.  At the request of the Minister I brought samples of the knives for the Minister and for the officials of his Department to look at them.  Mainly they are fish filleting knives, knives for skinning deer &mdash; I did not know those knives were there until I saw them in the factory &mdash; and other types of knives.  I would like to get the views of the Minister, to know if he has studied them and if there will be any prohibition on the manufacture of those type of knives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has welcomed observations and the constructive points that have been put forward by Members.  In this very same area I urge the Minister to think about the periodic examination of defective weapons, whether they be knives, guns or anything that can be described as a weapon.  A defective weapon can be as lethal as one that is not defective.  Even if the weapon is legally held, I urge that periodic examinations take place.  This would apply mainly to guns.</P>
      <P>It is wrong that any dealer, store or shop of any kind should have quantities of weapons of any kind stored, whether they be defective or in working order.  I see the possibility of arms dealers having collections of weapons and they could describe them as antiques or items of interest.  This is dangerous, I urge that special provisions be provided in the legislation to cover this area.  You could have a sword on the wall or behind the door and say &ldquo;Well, my grandfather took that back from the Boer War.&rdquo;  There would be one hundred excuses and one hundred answers.  There has got to be clarity on this point as to what is a weapon, what is a defective weapon, what is there for repair, who owns it and there has to be examination.  I would urge that the examination be very strict as far as people who store guns are concerned. If you go to any gun dealer you will see a number of weapons that could be used to commit a crime.  The gun dealer is allowed to have them and to say that they are not capable of being used.  This is not enough.  Now that the legislation has been introduced, I urge strongly that special provision be made to cover that situation.</P>

      <P>I note the Senator's remarks in relation to all of these matters. They are certainly very important.  This section empowers the Minister for Justice to make the regulations prescribing weapons other than firearms, which are dealt with in the Firearms Act, whose manufacture, importation, sale, etc., will be prohibited.  The types of weapons which will be prescribed in the regulations be <Col N="1183" /> weapons which are considered particularly dangerous or undesirable for which there is no legitimate use or need.  The Garda authorities are being consulted in this regard and a tentative list of such weapons has been complied.  Items already on this list are as follows: flick knives, belt knuckle knives, throwing stars, hand spikes, foot claws, judo sticks, lead-filled gloves, lead-filled saps and knuckle dusters.  Some of these terms are quite new to me.  They are an example of some of the things that are being included.  A further list will be drawn up in consultation with the Garda who come up against this kind of thing regularly.</P>

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator Farrell.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have added my name to this motion.  I have discussed this matter with the Minister for Justice on a number of occasions.  I believe the Government will welcome the motion and accept this debate and Members' contributions as indication of public feeling on this matter.  The Government must engage in a review of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956 and its anomalous provisions must be examined carefully.</P>
      <P>My county, in particular, has come in for a lot of criticism.  We have had our difficulties.  The time has come for the Government to legislate and take control over the whole area of gaming.  It is a very serious matter.  The problems must be addressed.  The unfair criticism by the national media has done a serious injustice to my county.  It is my belief that the provisions of the Gaming and Lotteries Acts are abused no more in Donegal than in any other part of the country.  I do not know why we have more gaming machines per head of population in County Donegal.  However, this is not merely a local, parochial, regional matter, it is a national one that must be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have stated on a number of occasions that local authorities are left with the responsibility of implementing the provisions of the Act or declining to do so, <Col N="1185" /> which subjects their members to much unnecessary pressure.  It is also my belief that positive action taken to remove that responsibility from members of local authorities &mdash; particularly in determining prospective business &mdash; would be much welcomed by them.  The subject has been raised at my local council on a number of occasions and has been extensively discussed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McGowan we must be careful here because, as you are aware being a member of Donegal County Council, that matter is before the courts and is <i>sub judice</i>.  I say that for your guidance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Cathaoirleach's guidance in the matter.  I will endeavour not to infringe on any areas which might be subject to litigation or court proceedings.</P>
      <P>Most people know there is much genuine concern in the country about addiction to gaming.  I believe and accept totally that it is possible to be addicted, to be gambling money that should be expended on the provision of food and general housekeeping needs.  I have been a member of a local authority that has been subject to pressure from organised groups known as the anti-gaming lobby. I could not accept that in all cases their intentions were crystal clear or absolutely pure.  In one particular case an anti-gaming lobby was headed by somebody who had himself tried very hard to get established, who subsequently took up the cudgel as an anti-gaming leader having been unsuccessful in acquiring suitable premises.  That is the kind of practice that must be abolished on the part of local pressure groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we are now adopting and conforming to so much European legislation it is only right and proper that the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956 should be reconsidered in the light of our membership of the EC, so that our future laws and regulations are in harmony with those prevailing in Britain, the North of Ireland and generally in Europe.  The provisions of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956 <Col N="1186" /> are totally out of date.  We are in a totally different league in this respect.  No matter which aspect of the problem one examines, one sees there is clear evidence of the need for change.  I urge the Minister to urgently re-examine the whole gambling scene, not to confine that re-examination to the Gaming and Lotteries Act only but to scrutinise those areas in which there must be legislative control.</P>
    <P>Like other Senators I have had correspondence and requests from a firm of solicitors who represent the gaming and amusement arcades.  They requested the establishment of a public inquiry into the matter and said:</P>
    <P>We are quite certain that the industry will be overwhelmingly vindicated by such a public inquiry.</P>
    <P>I would never support such a public inquiry.  There are all kinds of groups who are dissatisfied, who are not part of the legislative system, who want inquiries, who want to break down all of the administrative and procedural structures of democracy.  Therefore, I would be bitterly opposed to those who would seek the establishment of such a public inquiry on this matter.  I believe that is the responsibility of Government.  I have no doubt the Government will welcome the opportunity to respond to the discussion of this motion and that there will emerge improved legislation.  I am confident that will be the outcome.</P>
    <P>The solicitor, writing on behalf of the association, says that the plain truth is that the vast majority &mdash; over 90 per cent &mdash; of those who play gaming machines are moderate gamblers spending less per day than the cost of a pint or a packet of cigarettes.  That may be true.  I would be inclined to the view that it is correct. Nevertheless there is clear evidence of abuse.  That abuse can be measured only under the provisions of new legislation.  I strongly urge positive action on the part of the Minister for Justice and the Government in formulating legislation covering every aspect of gaming, bearing in mind conditions prevailing, the pressures there are on people to pay rent and other essentials.  Unfortunately, nearly <Col N="1187" /> always the poorer sections of our community are most affected by the abuses of and addiction to gaming.</P>
    <P>The Association of Gaming and Amusement Arcades cannot complain any more than any other section of the community if the legislation governing the licensing of their business is reviewed by Government.  I have no doubt that the Government will be fair to those engaged in any business.  There is need to examine that legislation constructively in the light of the Single European Act and the advent of 1992.  It will be important legislation to which, I predict, members of local authorities will not want to be party.</P>
    <P>It has reached the ridiculous stage when one elected member of a local authority, in Donegal voted for the adoption of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 at an urban council meeting in Bundoran and very shortly thereafter the same member attended a meeting of Donegal County Council and voted that they should not adopt its provisions.  It is ridiculous that gaming and lottery activities can remain uncontrolled in Bundoran, Letterkenny and other urban towns while a different law prevails in the rest of the county.  I understand the same situation obtains in Dublin city and county.  Therefore, the argument for the revision of the current legislation is well understood and well-proven.  I would ask the Minister to carry out such review in the short term. Hopefully, he will move an amendment when we will have an opportunity of representing the various interests and from which will emerge constructive legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty in supporting this motion.  The legislation it seeks to have reviewed is legislation which simply has not worked over a very long period.  There is a great deal of urgency about this review.  I would hope that when this motion is passed here this evening &mdash; as I am sure it will be &mdash; the Minister will take this as an indication of the concern felt on all sides of the House; that he will set about a review leading to <Col N="1188" /> a constructive conclusion and will do so with the greatest possible speed.</P>
      <P>As other speakers noted last week, and as some of the speeches reflected, there is a great deal of emotion on this subject. I have to say that much of the emotion surrounding it is well deserved.  However, I must say also that some of it has been spurious, some of it has been politically motivated or motivated by the desire to seek headlines; frankly, some of it has been exploitative, has sought to exploit addiction, has sought to exploit circumstances rendered worse by this type of exploitation.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I must say very emphatically that much of the bad publicity which has surrounded the gaming industry has been well deserved.  It has been well deserved for a number of reasons, partly because over the years sections of the gaming industry have been greedy, unscrupulous, have sought to evade even the minimal restrictions which legislation sought to place on them. They have not come straight with the law, they have not been straight with the public and have shown a degree of social irresponsibility difficult to match in our society.  In addition, the industry itself has shown little readiness, as a whole &mdash; there may well be sections of it which are responsible &mdash; to monitor its affairs, to take sanctions against those who transgress or indeed to attempt to bring these people to the notice of the authorities. The industry has taken a very long time to come up with its proposals for reform. The question has to be asked, had there not been so much of the publicity of recent years would proposals have been forthcoming at all?  The industry lived in a very cosy position in which it was, to a large extent cut off from the rest of society.  However, the industry has been disturbed out of its comfortable position in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many responsible people in the industry.  There are many legitimate jobs in the industry but to any fair-minded person, looking in from outside, it is obvious it has taken the furore of recent times to galvanise the responsible <Col N="1189" /> section of the industry into action.  Certainly it is not an industry which can take any great pride either in its role or its history over the past number of years, especially in its record of self-policing.</P>
    <P>We now find ourselves in circumstances in which public opinion &mdash; in some cases exploited, in some cases manipulated &mdash; reflects a genuinely-felt conviction among very many people that something is wrong in this industry.  We have now reached a stage at which choices have to be made and hard decisions taken.  There is a strongly held view in the country that a blanket ban on all types of gaming machines is what is needed. This is a view in a case which is very easy to make, a case which will find many powerful supporters throughout the community. It will be fuelled and fed &mdash; as it was quite recently &mdash; by the well-publicised experiences of those who have been the victims of gaming.  It will be supported by those who see it as an easy political issue on which they can capitalise. However it will be supported also by many people who genuinely believe that this is what is needed to tackle a problem that is all too obvious.</P>
    <P>I would strongly oppose that line for a number of reasons.  I would oppose it, first of all, because on a purely philosophical basis I believe the right to choose what one does with one's recreation, with one's disposable income, is a right which this House should not curtail to the extent of abolishing it completely.  I would take the same view that drink is liable to abuse.  That does not mean that we should seek to prohibit drink but we regulate it, we decide the hours in which drink can be taken, we determine the conditions, the sort of people who are fit to serve drink and those who are fit to get drink. It is the same with tobacco.  Tobacco has very deleterious consequences.  I remember being a fairly lonely voice in this House during the Tobacco Bill debate before Christmas when I argued very strongly against some of the sanctions on smoking which have now become law. Perhaps I was wrong but I felt this was too great an intrusion into the right to choose.  It is the same on other issues. <Col N="1190" /> For example, on the right to divorce I have argued passionately that this is a right which people should have, they are not obliged to exercise it but at least it is a right which they should have, the right to choose.  It is something which, as far as possible in a democratic society, should not be curtailed so long as it is not in conflict with the common good.  I am afraid, that is the balance we must strike in all of this.</P>
    <P>The second reason I consider that blanket sanctions, a blanket banning of gaming, would not be wise is that I believe it would be unenforceable.  On different issues in the past we have seen prohibitions applied in every area of life. Where a total prohibition has been applied inevitably the end result has been that people through various imaginative means, have found ways around it.  Inevitably they use their imagination to frustrate the intentions of the legislators. Much worse that that, total banks, total prohibitions, almost certainly drive underground the activities we are describing.  They would drive them totally into the arms of criminals, putting them totally under the control of criminals with the result that the far from satisfactory position obtaining would become infinitely worse.  For that reason a total prohibition on gaming would lead to a worse situation when whatever element of control there is at present &mdash; whatever element of control there should be which is far greater than obtains at present &mdash; would become an impossibility.</P>
    <P>Before saying what I would like to see done I should like to deal with the point made by Senator McGowan, that is, the role of local authorities in this issue.  As a member of a local authority I am not at all persuaded that local authorities are the best groups to judge such cases.  Very often local authorities are subject to a variety of pressures to which an independent board is not subjected.  It can be legitimately said, that members of a local authority frequently will have a better on-the-ground awareness of the consequences of particular circumstances.  I would hope that in a case of regulation this awareness, this local knowledge and <Col N="1191" /> local concern, would be capable of being transmitted to those who will take the decisions.</P>
    <P>My experience has not persuaded me that the atmosphere surrounding these decisions is the calm, objective atmosphere which one would like to see such decisions taken.  I am not convinced that the pressures often brought to bear on councillors in such cases lead to the best decisions.  Indeed, I was struck on my local council by the irony of one group arguing very strongly for the banning of gaming machines in clubs while another part of the same organisation was profiting from the existence of such clubs in a different part of the country.  There can be a degree of hypocrisy and playing to the gallery in all of this.</P>
    <P>I support the motion this evening.  I very much want to see an immediate, thorough review of the workings of the 1956 Act.  I would like to see an inquiry, not necessarily a public sworn inquiry, but an inquiry into the operations of that Act and into the effects of the current position on the general public here.  I would like to see it done by trained people away from the emotion and publicity which has surrounded the issue up to now.  I believe there is a great deal to be said for a thorough reform, for new rules, which can be enforced.  One of the great Irish problems in so many areas is that while we are extremely good at making rules and regulations, we are very bad at enforcing them.  We can see it in virtually every area of Irish life where the laws are there, whether it be dog licences, with regard to emission of noxious fumes for motor vehicles, safety standards in cars, whatever the subject frequently legislation does exist but what is absent is the means or the will to enforce it.</P>
    <P>Whatever we do this evening, we must send a message to the Minister that whatever changes are brought about must have the full sanction of enforceability behind them.  Otherwise we might as well go for the worst option of all which is the total ban on gaming activities.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of merit in the proposal of one section of industry for the <Col N="1192" /> establishment of a gaming board which would have full control over the industry. It must be a gaming board with very real powers, a gaming board which has a definite length of time within which to sort out the problem.  It must have the sanction of a total ban hanging over it.  I would like to see such a gaming board having general powers of supervision in relation to all aspects of gaming and lotteries, including newspaper lotteries.  I would like to see it having the right to issue licences in respect of all premises and persons engaged in the manufacture &mdash; which is a major problem &mdash; the distribution and the operation of all gaming and amusement machines.  I would like to see the conditions applicable to all of these determined by such a board.  It must have the power to revoke such licences and to determine the procedure for revocation and penalties.</P>
    <P>It must have the power to determine the suitability of those who engage in gaming, of those who run gaming arcades or machines.  This is a major problem because there is no doubt whatsoever that many of the people who are engaged in the gaming industry at present have a whiff of criminality about them.  This makes it extremely difficult for those who want to run a responsible industry to get their point across.  The gaming board, as I would envisage it, would have very strict powers to determine the suitability of those who can engage in these activities. It would issue enforceable guidelines on age limits, on the amounts to be paid out, on the margins of profit and so forth in all aspects of gaming.</P>
    <P>I envisage this gaming board having its own inspectorate, paid for by the gaming industry, but nonetheless an independent inspectorate of sufficient numbers and quality to ensure that everything in the house was being kept in order.  I would envisage such a board being directly accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Minister for Justice, that it would not be just another independent quango out there.  It would be a board which would have to furnish an annual report to the Houses of the Oireachtas, which would be answerable <Col N="1193" /> to the Minister for Justice and which would have at its head a person of sufficient credibility and stature to ensure that its activities would be generally accepted by the general public.</P>
    <P>I believe we are at a crossroads as far as the whole question of gaming is concerned.  The reason I support this motion tonight is that I believe there is a duty on Government &mdash; and it is a duty where I believe the Minister is anxious to give the lead at this time &mdash; to ensure that there will be a hard, detailed, searching examination of the industry and current legislation.  Having done that, the Government must then come back to us and tell us whether in their considered view they would favour a total ban, as many people advocate, or whether they believe the industry can be policed, put in order, can be made acceptable, the abuses ruled out, having established that only those who are fit and proper to do so be allowed to operate in the industry.</P>
    <P>My view, as I have made very clear, would fall very heavily in the latter category. I should like to see this motion going through this evening.  I would like to have an earnest from the Minister of his sense of urgency, of the wide-ranging review he would like to see take place, perhaps also of the type of machinery he would like to see in place so that this problem can be faced up to once and for all, so that those who are not fit to be in the industry are driven out of it, and kept out of it, and those who want to run it honestly are given the opportunity to do so within firm and definite legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this motion because I would like to see the Gaming and Lotteries Acts reviewed and updated.  I have had a lot of correspondence from people on this particular issue, especially in reference to gaming machines or slot machines.  I would like to see these machines banned completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I would like to see this is because of the highly addictive nature of these machines.  Studies have shown that if a gambler continually wins he, believe it or not, soon becomes bored, because <Col N="1194" /> the thrill for the gambler is not in the winning but in beating the system.  Again, if he continually loses he will soon give up.  The only way he will continue to gamble is if he is reinforced and this is precisely what happens with these machines.  The gambler is subjected to a very powerful form of reinforcement, namely, intermittent reinforcement.  He wins occasionally, just enough to keep him hopeful.  He keeps hoping the next one will be the jackpot.  The operators of these machines admit to these machines being stacked in favour of the owners, sometimes as high as 85 per cent for owners, 15 per cent for the punter.</P>
    <P>Another of my arguments is that the difference between gambling on machines as opposed to other forms of gambling is that the element of chance has been almost removed completely.  In other words, the gambler cannot possibly win, he must, if he continues to gamble, eventually lose.  It has been suggested, that if the gaming machines were banned it would be hypocritical of us not to ban all forms of gambling.  This is not so, because of the reasons I have just stated &mdash; the removal of the element of chance. If a person bets on a horse race he can either lose or win.  Similarly in a card game, depending on the turn of a card he may either lose or win.  However, with gaming machines the odds are mechanically or electronically fixed so that ultimately the gambler must lose.</P>
    <P>Because of the enormous scope for profits, the operators of these machines can mount publicity campaigns favouring their retention.  They can employ professional lobbyists who can issue statements quoting from statistical studies and also quoting selectively from such items as the letter on travelling people issued by His Grace, the Archbishop of Dublin. However, the huge profits that are made in this area are very rarely mentioned.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator McGowan and Senator Manning that the whole area of this decision-making process must be removed from the hands of local representatives, who come under such pressures, and should be ultimately in the hands of the Government or of the <Col N="1195" /> Department of Justice.  It has also been suggested that certain areas of the city or county perhaps should be designated as an area in which these machines would be permitted, where they can be carefully monitored.  This simply will not work.</P>
    <P>I have seen such an experiment in New Jersey, where gaming is permitted in Atlantic City.  What has happened?  Well, the same as here.  Most people go and visit.  There are ten shows.  They just lose a few dollars on the slots and go home. That is the acceptable side but there is another side to the enterprise which is not publicised.  Every week I have seen busloads of old age pensioners, brought free of charge from as far away sometimes as New York city down to Atlantic City, where they are given a free meal and then are admitted to the casinos. These poor unfortunates go home broke. It is a sad, sick scene and I should hate to see this experiment repeated here. Also in these casinos people are given free drink as long as they gamble.  They can watch free shows; they are given free meals.</P>
    <P>The Minister is, I am sure, well aware of the great potential that exists for organised crime to take control of this type of industry, just as happened in the USA and, I understand, to some extent in the UK.  I ask the Minister to bring in legislation banning these machines and I feel certain that such legislation will get easy passage in both House and very probably all-party support.</P>
    <P>The Minister, during the present session alone, has introduced a very considerable body of progressive legislation. I would ask you to look carefully at this whole area and, particularly, to remove from local representatives the decision as to the licensing or otherwise of these addictive machines.  The very minimum I would like to see is a complete review by the Government or the Department of Justice of the Gaming and Lotteries Acts, 1956 to 1979.</P>
    <P>It has been said &mdash; and I have been lobbied on this &mdash; that many jobs will be lost in this industry.  That may be so, and nobody would like to see that; but I just <Col N="1196" /> cannot believe that these machines are good for anybody in particular because of the removal of the element of chance. If there was a fifty-fifty chance than I would say &ldquo;go ahead&rdquo;, but when it is both mechanically and electronically stacked against the punter, then I would say that these machines are not good for anybody at all.  It has been said too that they are needed for some holiday resorts, that people would not go there if these things were not available.  Frankly, that is an argument I do not accept either. However, I am willing to listen to what the Minister has to say and I look forward to his speech later on.  I have made my point.  That is all I have to say on the matter at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Seanad has decided to discuss this matter. I have got just a small number of points to make on it.  It seems to me that the principal philosophical area for debate here runs along the lines of a conflict between individual freedoms on the one hand and the wider welfare of the community on the other.  This is why I feel strongly that there is a need for some severe restraint on the operation of gambling machines.  It is not simply a question of the individual and his right to enjoy freedom of expression.  It seems to me that the idea that an individual should be able to indulge himself or herself is limited by a particular factor and that factor is damage to the community at large.  There is no question of doubt whatever in my mind that the provision of electronic gambling facilities, particularly using television screens, one-armed bandits and all these sort of things have a seriously detrimental effect.</P>
      <P>It may surprise Members of the House to hear me say this because I am very much a proponent of the rights of the individual.  But I have direct and personal contact with this problem from a number of people who have been placed in serious jeopardy by virtue of their addiction to the quite simple forms of gambling, so that I am aware of this problem at first hand and of the heartbreak it brings to the most vulnerable areas of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1197" /> It also leads to a further radiation of anti-social behaviour.  For example, I am aware of a number of enterprises in the city of Dublin, including, for example, the operation of the national bus service, where people who are placed in possession of fairly sizeable quantities of cash in the form of coins find themselves becoming addicted to gambling.  Because many of these gambling dens are placed close to bus stops and termini, they are put in a situation of temptation.  It is a situation which, I am sure, CIE, which is a very responsible body, or Bus Éireann, as I understand it is now, will confirm that this problem does exist.  I am not pointing the finger at this particular profession and suggesting that bus conductors are naturally dishonest or anything like that but they are placed in the way of temptation and I am certainly aware of a situation where gambling by operatives of Bus Éireann has led to serious problems psychologically and in terms of theft from the company in order to sustain this gambling habit.  This clearly is, as I would describe it, a further radiation, an escalation of anti-social behaviour.  It means we are not just allowing an individual the right to damage himself or herself; we are tolerating behaviour that has a wider social dimension.</P>
    <P>I was most interested in what I hope I may describe without being patronising as the excellent speech of Senator Haughey, where he considered in the most sober and reflective way the whole question of these restrictions under the present Acts.  He indicated there was an area which required consideration, and that is whether or not we could permit this form of activity but in restricted areas and also resolve the conflict between the jurisdiction of courts &mdash; District Courts on the one hand and local authorities on the other &mdash; by permitting the operation of these gambling facilities in seaside resorts, one example he gave, or in other areas.  This does worry me a little bit and I will give the House the reason.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1198" /> It is quite normal for people in middle-class residential areas to object very vociferously and &mdash; I will not say to manipulate &mdash; but to act upon their local representatives in such a manner as to ensure that planning permissions, for example, are denied for the opening of these sort of premises.  The net result of that is a kind of domino effect so that these operations tend to wind up in areas where you do not have a concentration of middle-class people &mdash; you have instead the most vulnerable sections of society largely.</P>
    <P>How do I know this?  I know this because I live in an area of the north inner city of Dublin.  I have had experience of gambling dens and casinos being dislodged from residential areas of the north city suburbs and finding them all strung together along areas like Parnell Street, for example.  I cannot state definitively that there is a direct correlation between the increase in housebreaking, in petty vandalism and other forms of anti-social behaviour, ranging from nuisance to downright criminal behaviour, but as a resident of that area I can tell you that I and many other residents believe that this is directly related, at least in part, to the existence of these gambling halls.  It is very much resented that they should be dislodged from one area and then concentrated in another area.  I hope the Minister will look very carefully at the review, if it is undertaken, and ensure that whatever legislation is framed does not have the operation of merely relegating these activities, which I certainly see as undesirable, to another area of the city that does not want them.</P>
    <P>I accept that there are many difficulties for the Government, because we have recently engaged on a system of public financing depending upon a national lottery. These are elements even here that worry me.  I accept that there is a conflict in the Government's position.  If they are to restrict the operations of these slot <Col N="1199" /> machines and so on, they have a philosophical difficulty because the Government are embarked on financing some public expenditure from gaming.  Perhaps the Government should also look again at this area, because it is quite clear that, once more, vulnerable sections of the community are spending very sizeable sums of their weekly budget in purchasing lottery tickets.  Again, it is a moot point as to the extent to which Government can actually get directly involved in restricting the rights of individuals in this area.  However, it is important we ensure that we do nothing to encourage anti-social behaviour.</P>
    <P>I would like to place on the record of this House also that I consider it extremely regrettable that members of local authorities have apparently been threatened by interests associated with this lobby.  I place on record, for example the experience, widely publicised in the past few weeks, of Councillor Martin Lynch who, as I have read in the newspapers, has been subjected to a telephone campaign, including death threats.  It would be very wrong of me to point the finger at any particular person or personalities involved but I would point out that the operations of these kinds of gambling machine were originally most popular in the United States of America, where they were associated with criminal elements, and in particular the Mafia.  I wonder if we want to open up the possibility of the exploitation of our most vulnerable sections of the community and the possibility that public representatives may be threatened by people who feel they have an interest, whether they do or not, in this area?</P>
    <P>Therefore, I welcome the fact that this debate has taken place.  I hope the Minister will bear in mind the serious reservations of many Senators who feel that, notwithstanding our interest in the rights of the individual to freedom of expression and to engage in anti-social behaviour, we are also aware of the limits that need <Col N="1200" /> to be placed upon that anti-social behaviour when it can be demonstrated so clearly to have a damaging impact outside the scope of the individual's own wellbeing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusCullimore" hpid="Mr. Cullimore Mr. Cullimore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to compliment the Minister on all the Bills he has brought into this House since his appointment as Minister for Justice.  I agree with previous speakers that it is important that we update the 1956 Act. There are a number of anomalies in this Act which are causing great public concern. Many families are experiencing grave cash shortages because of these anomalies and abuses by arcade owners. If we are to bring in new legislation I think it is important that a proper balance be struck.  We must encourage those who are professionally managing their arcades, who are confident and competent in the handling of their business; but we must ensure that those who are corrupt and who are abusing their positions are totally barred from the process of gambling and amusement facilities. There are many reported abuses of the gambling and gaming Acts.  It is very difficult for the Garda to get proof for the conviction of these people.  When one thinks that by the mere flick of a switch the machines can be turned off, it shows how very difficult it is to get proof.</P>
      <P>I understand that under the 1956 Act only people up to 16 years of age are barred.  I would like to see a situation where this age level was increased to people up to 18.  If new legislation is to be brought in, I think we should provide for centralised power in regard to gaming and amusement.  It is very difficult to understand how one law applies in Donegal, another in Wexford and another in Dublin.  Legislation as it stands at present places county councillors in a very difficult position.  Often the work of local authorities is sidetracked because of participation in debates on the rules and regulations regarding gaming and amusement centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1201" /> I would like to see under any new legislation a reassessment of the amounts that are gambled.  At present the Act allows for £10,000 for national draws and the maximum payout is two and a half and 50 pence.  When we think of the rate of the weekly wage in 1956, this has increased by 2,200 per cent.  I think it is important that if legislation is brought in that situation should be addressed.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish the Minister every success.  I hope we will have a Bill to combat the abuse of power by some owners of arcades and amusements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity provided by this motion to have a debate concerning gaming.  I congratulate the Senators who tabled this motion as it provided a very good opportunity of airing the different views on the topic.  I am thankful to the Members of this House for taking up my suggestion to have this matter debated in this House.  I have issued a similar invitation to Members in the other House because I want their views too on this important matter.  As soon as we can arrange between ourselves time for that debate, then we will get it under way.</P>
      <P>I regret I was unable to be here on Wednesday last for the first half of the debate on the motion.  Senators &mdash; and some in particular &mdash; will know I had another official engagement in the northeastern part of the country on that afternoon and it was not possible for me to be here.  Nevertheless, I have read with interest the contributions by the Senators who spoke last Wednesday and I have also listened with interest to this evening's speakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion notes the need to review the Gaming and Lotteries Acts to ensure that proper control is maintained in the area of gaming.  Let me say, first of all, that the Gaming and Lotteries Act and, specifically, gaming are kept under continuing review in my Department.  We must continue to do this because there is a very deep concern running throughout <Col N="1202" /> the community with the way the situation is developing at the present time.</P>
    <P>The question of gaming, gaming machines and gaming halls is one which has seldom been out of the news in the past few years.  Various aspects of the matter have been in the forefront of the publicity from time to time.  Indeed the media coverage shows that there is a great diversity in views on gaming.  Some of the topics that have figured largely in the headlines in recent years have been addiction to gaming machines and the consequent hardships; publicity concerning very high prize money being available from gaming machines, and indeed high prize money being given by the operator standing behind the machine, being given in some instances when he feels it is pretty safe for him to do that.  We have had headlines in recent times about court cases concerning the prizes and the stake limits for gaming machines.  We have had headlines about the part played by local authorities in regard to gaming in their areas; and, indeed, the pressure that members of public authorities were subjected to by those who have vested interests in this area.</P>
    <P>Members of this Oireachtas will be aware of a situation not so long ago during the life of the previous Government when Members were verbally abused by those who were lobbying at the particular time for an amendment to the gaming laws to suit their needs.  I, myself, was accosted during that particular period by Members who were trying to get legislation rushed through at that time.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, also news items concerning allegations of gaming continuing in the Dublin area despite the fact that the corporation had rescinded the legal provision allowing gaming there. The most recent area of publicity has been a series of articles in a Dublin evening newspaper concerning the position in Dublin city.  As Senators are aware, that Dublin Corporation rescinded its <Col N="1203" /> adoption of Part III of the 1956 Act over three years.  The contention was that, despite that decision, gaming in arcades continued in Dublin city.  This was a matter of particular concern to me and I had a number of discussions with the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and the Assistant Commissioner in charge of the Dublin Metropolitan Area on the matter.  Following those discussions I was satisfied, and remain satisfied, that the Gaming and Lotteries Acts are being enforced by the Garda in an active and dedicated manner and that they will investigate in a thorough manner any alleged breaches of the law brought to their attention.  This is the position in Dublin city and it is also the position throughout the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>In this context I should mention that there was a very big increase in the number of detections and breaches of the Act in 1988 as compared with 1987.  The number of detections in 1988 was 420 as compared with 127 in the previous year. On this question of enforcement by the Garda, I have to stress that where there is evidence of illegal gaming all possible evidence should be made available to the Garda.  They can only go to court when they have evidence and, accordingly, they need the co-operation of the public in this matter.</P>
    <P>May I say that, following my discussions with the Commissioner and his senior staff and my own legal advisers I can report to this House that I have asked the Commissioner and his legal advisers and my advisers to have consultations with the Office of the Attorney General to see how best we can use all the resources of the State to deal with those who are involved in illegal gaming.  I am satisfied that the outcome of those consultations will be of great help to the Garda.  We will hear more about them in due course.</P>
    <P>It has always seemed to me that the most crucial aspect is the provision in our law which gives local authorities the right <Col N="1204" /> to allow or to refuse gaming to take place in their own areas.  When the 1956 Act was enacted a conscious decision was taken to give local authorities this power. Those who wished to allow gaming did so by adopting Part III of the Act and those who did not simply did not adopt that part of the Act.  What happened was that most local authorities did adopt Part III of the Act and so allowed gaming in their administrative areas.  In recent years some of those local authorities have rescinded their adoption of Part III and, accordingly, gaming is no longer legal in their administrative areas.  Dublin Corporation, as I have already mentioned, took that decision in recent years.  Other local authorities are considering whether to rescind their previous adoption of Part III.  I should mention that there have been also a number of cases where local authorities have considered whether they should rescind Part III and have decided not to do so.</P>
    <P>It is clear that in recent years some local authorities felt that a very serious problem had developed in their areas and, accordingly, decided to reverse their previous decisions and so outlaw gaming in their areas.  Perhaps other local authorities should view the matter in the same light now.  Many suggestions have been made for various changes in the system of control of gaming but I must emphasise that these suggestions mean, first of all, that the powers which local authorities have at the moment under the Act should be taken away from them and that the decision as to whether gaming is allowed should be made centrally.</P>
    <P>I think it is fair to say that many of these suggestions imply that there would be no total ban on gaming anywhere. This is a very big question.  It relates to the powers which local authorities should have and the balance of powers as between local authorities and the central authority.  It is an area that I would have to consider very carefully as, apart altogether from its importance in relation to the topic of gaming, it has relevance &mdash;<Col N="1205" /> Senators here will be fully conscious of this &mdash; to other areas also.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has also been media coverage of such aspects of gaming as the court cases that were taken in relation to the constitutionality of the Acts, addiction to gaming machines and gaming by persons under the legal age. All of these are aspects of gaming which require attentions but in my view the debate we are having this evening boils down to two main questions, which are (1) is the present legislation adequate; and (2) are the Garda able to enforce it? I have dealt already with the position of the Gardai and enforcement, and I am satisfied they are doing their best to enforce it.  As I said, in an effort to strengthen their hands, I can inform the House that the Garda are at present involved in top level discussions with the Attorney General and his Office and the senior legal advisers in my Department with a view to helping them in this particular area.</P>
    <P>On the question of the adequacy of the present law, my position is that I am open to be convinced that there is a case for amending legislation.  One of the suggestions that has been made in this area is that there should be a gaming board. That is not a new idea; it certainly is not. That was one that was floated to me over ten years or so ago in my previous term as Minister for Justice by those who were involved in the industry.  It implies that there would be no total ban on gaming as envisaged in the 1956 Act either nationally or in local areas.  At that particular time I did not accept the need for a gaming board and I still do not accept it.  Apart from the extraordinary reversal of our present system involved in such an idea, as far as I am aware gaming boards have not been a great success at all in other jurisdictions.  At any rate my view is, and it is a view I hold very strongly, that the responsibility in this area should remain with the Minister for Justice of the day, that he should be answerable to the Oireachtas on the matter and be <Col N="1206" /> prepared to come and meet people like yourselves who have the authority to enact legislation and to discuss legislation rather than trying to deal with a body with whom you may not even have the right of audience.</P>
    <P>I will not be considering in any shape or form a recommendation for the inclusion in legislation of any such board. If the buck stops here, it stops here.  You are the people I am answerable to, as I am answerable to the people in the other House, and that is the way it is going to be.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion is that the hands of the Garda should be strengthened by amending legislation as regards enforcement. I am open to be convinced that the gaming laws need to be strengthened.  I have told you of the meetings and discussions that are taking place between the Attorney General's Office, my office and the Garda.  If I get a recommendation arising from these, and in particular from the Garda whose function it is to enforce the law, if they feel that the law as it is framed is not helpful to them, I will very gladly do something about it and come back here with legislation for your consideration.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that this debate is taking place.  I have read with interest the comments made by Senators last Wednesday and what the speakers said this afternoon.  I will give very careful consideration to their views.  Perhaps I might ask as a <i>quid pro quo</i> that Senators who have a particular interest in this subject would give some consideration to what I have said, especially in relation to the removing of control from persons elected to local authorities.  I fully understand the pressures that have been exerted on members of local authorities. I have to be careful on this, having regard to certain matters that are <i>sub judice</i> at present but I am free to comment on pressures that I personally was subjected to when I was not Minister for Justice in this House to lend my support to proposals that I felt were disgraceful.  I <Col N="1207" /> resented the fact that I was intimidated and harassed at the particular time, as I know were many other Members of the Oireachtas of the day.  The Oireachtas was picketed and it was only with great difficulty that we could get admission; we were descended on in the dining halls and in the public rooms of the House by those who were trying to railroad legislation through as a matter of urgency within a matter of hours.  I am glad that members of all parties withstood that pressure.  I am satisfied, and I say this in particular to the Senators having regard to their obligations under the Act, from the local authorities point of view, that perhaps when we come back to you with legislation we will consider a section of the Bill that would deal with anybody who tries to pressurise members of local authorities in any way to such a degree that they would not try it a second time.  I would be very open to suggestions on that.</P>
    <P>When I have completed my studies, and I will only have them completed when I get the views of Members of the other House so that I can study them together with the views that have been expressed here, then I will have to make a decision on what has to be done concerning the Gaming and Lotteries Acts. If I become convinced that amending legislation is necessary, then Members of this House can feel assured that I will make the necessary proposals to the Government.  I have started the process of examination already by having the Garda consult with the Attorney General and with my own people to see how best we can make the legislation work and the recommendations they give me will certainly be considered.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Members of this House, the Senators who proposed this motion, and to say to them that in areas such as this, where we are totally non-policital but where we all have the interests of the community up front that it is only right that we should have a <Col N="1208" /> debate and discussion and the views that are expressed in this House will be heard as they must and should.  May I say that the views of all those who are not in this House, will also be listened to and will be considered.  I say to those who are here this evening representing the interests involved in gaming, that their views will be considered but, equally, I say to them that if they believe they will intimidate Members of this House by publicity campaigns or the like, they are not going to succeed.  They will not intimidate any Member of this House or any member of this Government in any way into introducing legislation other than legislation that will be properly thought out and considered in this House.  I do not think they are doing their case any good, bearing in mind the way they should have learned the lesson the last time that Members of this House were intimidated and bullied.  If they want the goodwill of Members of Oireachtas Eireann, of all parties, they certainly should have a little consultation among themselves and decide what tactics they should not use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Did you ever hear it said that you should move with the power and not against it?  I only heard the last part of the Minister's contribution.  It would be very foolhardy of me, even on the basis of the last few remarks, to try to move against the power that exists at the moment in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the idea of a review of the Acts.  What makes it acceptable is the fact that we have not had a full debate on this whole problem for a long time in this House.  There is some confusion, if you look at the lobbying that has gone on.  It is very hard to refute the facts as set out.  On the other hand there is the attitudes of the various councils that have been involved in making decisions in this area.  I cannot resolve my thinking as to whether it is not too bad in the amusement area and if you separate the amusement from the gaming side of an arcade <Col N="1209" /> I do not know whether that would be a workable proposition.  I am not sure whether if you installed new machines and put the accurate amounts onto the machines that would work.  I am not sure in respect of quite a few things in this area.</P>
    <P>I do not think total abolition ever works in anything that affects the human emotions.  I do not think it is a practical proposition.  For example, the case against gaming machines may be stronger in the urban areas than it is in the rural areas.  Quite frankly, we do not know because we have not had enough dialogue and debate about it.  We have been trying to sort out our thinking on the basis of the attitudes taken up by various councils but when you go through some of the paper cuttings etc. of which I have copies here, there are imbalances in those attitudes. Some want a complete ban, others believe all that needs to be done is for the Minister to be given the full rights and authority to act in the normal way with regard to bringing in legislation, etc. I believe there is a need for a total review of the 1956 and 1979 Acts.  Normally, I would say to the Minister why not bring in the legislation rather than having this type of motion.  The Government will be accused of trying to please everybody, not standing on anybody's corns.  You cannot do that.</P>
    <P>I do not if the people who put down the motion wanted to keep everybody happy in the whole gaming area for political reasons.  I am not attributing that to them but it could have been a motivating factor.  On the other hand, it could be that a lot more thinking needs to be done on this and that, therefore, the Minister is correct in taking his time about it. Hopefully, when he does review the matter he will look at the question of how the law should stand.  Then I suppose the question of review of whatever legislation comes in would be an important factor also.</P>
    <P>Quite frankly, even though I have been lobbied, have spoken to people and so <Col N="1210" /> on I just could not oppose the motion that is before us because it does nothing except asks us to note the fact that the matter needs review.  What I can do, on the basis of the way the motion is put down, is to urge the Minister to say that the problem is a grave one not only from the emotional point of view of the family and so on but also that there are people who make their livelihood from this business. Some of them do it well but others are just cowboys.  The problem is that the Minister has to have time to sort out the cowboys from the people who are genuinely concerned about amusement arcades, who do not mind laws being introduced that would be restrictive in a sense because it would give them control over the situation as well as everything. I do not think most of the good operators, particularly on the amusement side of it, would object to the legalising of a certain type of machine, to ensure there could be no interference with it and that it said exactly what it meant.  The age of the person who would be allowed into such premises should also be laid down.</P>
    <P>Most of the good operators would welcome alterations in the present system. it is a dilemma.  We get very emotional when we hear of someone taking their life or something like that but we must not forget there are people genuinely concerned about trying to make sure the public get good entertainment. naturally they are after the profit.  Nobody goes into business for nothing.  It is like a butcher or a publican saying: &ldquo;I do not want to make any money&rdquo;.  They do make money but in a clean, legitimate way.</P>
    <P>I am a little bit confused as between the urban and the rural scenes.  I have not resolved my own thinking on the matter yet.  I would be the last to condemn it on the basis of just reacting in an emotional way.  That is why I say that we favour the idea of a review.  This has been going on quite a while now and it cannot drag on indefinitely.  When you have various county councils, urban councils etc. in conflict among themselves, somebody <Col N="1211" /> has to come in and resolve the problem and I think it has got to be done fairly quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from a county that has never adopted section 3 of the Act so, therefore, we have no gaming machines at all.  Secondly, I have no interest in the matter.  However, I proposed this motion because I believe this matter should be discussed in a cool and calm atmosphere because many subjects today are discussed in a hyped-up and in an emotional atmosphere.  Pressure groups are very good.  I would not blame the gaming machine lobby.  I have been 22 years in public life and I have found in the past nine or ten years that all pressure groups put unreasonable pressure on public representatives on every issue. Very often the pressure groups only represent the views of two or three but it is so easy to get people hyped-up on something.  If you ask them whether they have read the full report on something you find they have not.  It is a case of, &ldquo;Dúirt bean liom go ndúirt bean léi&rdquo; and away they go.  I would not like to think we would just lambast the arcade owners. I know they are well able to hold their own corner.  They are just a symtom of the times.  All pressure groups are being unreasonable at present and I said that at a council meeting the other day.</P>
      <P>I am delighted this motion has got broad acceptance in this House and that all Senators believe it is something that should be discussed.  I welcome the Minister's statement that he is going to have it discussed in the other House as well and that it is being reviewed by the Garda. Between the two Houses and the legal lobby we should get legislation that will be acceptable to everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amazed that this activity was referred to by a Senator in the House as being anti-social.  Other people would regard it as a pleasurable pastime.  Probably what the good Senator regards as a pleasurable pastime many of us would <Col N="1212" /> regard as anti-social.  It is a case of every eye forms its own beauty.  It depends on how you look at it.  I would not regard it as being anti-social, anyway.</P>
    <P>I would welcome a new Bill.  I do not think it should be with the local authorities. My reason for that is that local authorities are not legally minded and after the council does agreed to do it it still has to go before the courts.  If they agree to adopt section 3 of the Act, it does not mean that they are in full charge as they still have to go before the District Justice.  It is a waste of time and it is unnecessary duplication.  All laws should be handled by the State.  I would agree with the Minister on that.  You apply and you either succeed or do not succeed in the courts.  That would be fair for everybody. Going to the local authorities and coming back to the law courts is a bit cumbersome and can hype-up the situation because, as we all know, the council chambers are not renowned for their peace and calm at all times.</P>
    <P>Finally I would like to say a very special thanks to the Minister.  It is a clear indication of his dedication and his intention to really bring the Act to as effective a state as possible.  He came and stayed here with us all evening even though he could have sent a junior Minister to this House.  It is a clear indication of how seriously he looks at this whole situation. I thank him very sincerely for that, as I am sure every Member of the House does.  I believe he will come back to this House with a Bill that will be well researched and well presented, and one that will bring peace and comfort to the councils, to the arcade owners, to the punters and to all concerned.</P>
    <P>We have not mentioned the manufacturers. We should ensure they manufacture machines that cannot be interfered with.  They also should be covered in the new legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Harte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have notice from Senator Katharine Bulbulia that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to respond with urgency to the recently announced decision of the North Europe-US Atlantic Conference to delete Waterford as a designated tariff arbitrary port and to put a 10 per cent increase on tariffs on Irish exporters; these decisions to come into effect on 15 May 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I am indebted to the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine for coming here this evening. I cannot emphasise sufficiently how very seriously this matter is viewed in Waterford and, indeed, the urgency attendant on it.</P>
      <P>The news first broke when the Irish Shippers' Council alerted the harbour board and other interested parties to a decision of what is, in effect, a cartel who are attempting to drop Waterford as a base port.  In Waterford this decision has been described as outrageous and it has been roundly condemned from all quarters. An innocent looking little notice appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> about ten days ago indicating that the North Europe-US Atlantic Conference was giving notice to the shipping public about traffic from Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to the US Atlantic ports in the East Port Maine, Key West, Florida &mdash; both inclusive &mdash; range and continental US interior and coastal points via such ports.  It went on to say that Waterford was being deleted as a designated tariff arbitrary port and that there was also going to be an increase in the arbitrary charge.  Both of these were going to come into effect from 15 May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody who has the interests of <Col N="1214" /> Waterford and its port at heart is determined to resist this unilateral attempt on the part of the cartel.  There was no consultative process, there was no lead-in to this.  It is fair to say that it was a bolt out of the blue.  Such an action had been attempted in the past when it was tried to do this to both Waterford and Cork but Waterford and Cork came together and defeated the cartel's actions in this regard.  It is certainly the intention of everybody in Waterford to do precisely that again this time around.  However, we need the Minister and I hope this evening he will indicate his very firm support for our concerted action in Waterford. I look forward to that reassurance from him.</P>
    <P>He knows, and everybody in Waterford knows, that the port is of fundamental importance to our city, to our county and, indeed, to the surrounding south-east hinterland.  It is a nationally strategic gateway to our export markets. This threat of deletion would totally undermine development proposals which are currently being considered for EC structural funding and, in so far as the national plan spelled out anything, it was certainly indicated that in relation to the sub-region south-east the port of Waterford was due to get special attention under structural funding.  Officials from the Minister's Department have been down to meet with the harbour board and have given very positive indications of the importance with which the port is viewed by the Department and the wish to see it grow and develop and become the vital strategic port which we know it to be.</P>
    <P>The cartel's decision, if it is not defeated, will come into effect on 15 May next and there is no time to be lost.  I attempted to raise this matter in the Seanad as a matter of urgency under Standing Order 29 but was unable to do so.  I do not think the urgency was sufficiently understood.  Nevertheless, I would like to indicate my gratitude to the Cathaoirleach who understood the <Col N="1215" /> significance of this and who allowed me to take it on the Adjournment here this evening.  Anybody involved in importation and export will be making advance plans. The decision comes into effect on 15 May but a lot of the pre-planning will take this into account and will become apprehensive and fearful and may, in fact, select the ports of Cork, Dublin or Belfast rather than Waterford.</P>
    <P>I hope the response from the Minister will be strong, that it will be well coordinated with attempts from Waterford and that it will be determined.  The Irish Shippers' Council who alerted us at local level to this are deeply unhappy at the decision.  It is important to mention that the base port concept is that up to the present various shipping lines, none of which call to Irish ports, would accept cargo at what they referred to as base ports covering Cork, Waterford, Dublin and Belfast from where containers were transshipped to and from the UK and continental ports.</P>
    <P>This deletion of Waterford as a base port is most serious for Irish shippers in as much as it is one of the main ports in the south serving the Continent and the UK having daily services to both destinations. In effect, it means that shippers from the south of Ireland and indeed the Waterford areas will have no choice in the routes to which their goods will travel but will have to use Cork or Dublin at the behest of the Conference with consequent increased inland carrier costs. Anybody who knows even the slightest thing about economics and the importance of our balance of payments knows we have got to be competitive and that we cannot afford to incur any loading on to our export costs.</P>
    <P>Waterford, as I have already said, is one of the main strategic gateways for goods from the southern half of the country, and indeed from all over the country.  In view of the upgrading of this port by the new £15 million plan recently announced it will have even a greater <Col N="1216" /> importance.  In the event of strikes at the other base ports, the cargo could not be diverted to Waterford and that is a very obvious example of how things could go very badly wrong.  The Conference's Irish arbitrary charges are fixed charges to all exporters and importers for transshipping their containers.  There is no justification whatsoever for an increase in this service. Conservatively, it is estimated that on the North Atlantic alone Irish importers and exporters pay up to £4 million annually in addition to the ocean freight for these charges.  The arbitrary charge represents approximately 15 per cent of the total freight charge.  That is just an additional point because it is the second of the two decisions which were announced by the cartel.</P>
    <P>The Irish Shippers' Council met the representatives at these two conferences in Dublin on 11 April and I am very pleased to put on the record of this House the fact that they flatly turned down their proposals regarding both the deletion of Waterford as a base port and the increase in the arbitrary charges.  They made the very obvious point that Waterford was of significant importance as a route for cargo coming to and from Ireland.  They also refused to accept the increase of 10 per cent on the transshipment charges pointing out that access transport costs for Irish exports and imports are at present regarded as punitive and cannot under any circumstances bear further increases as they make Irish goods much less competitive on world markets than those of our competitors.</P>
    <P>Despite the strong arguments which were put forward by the Irish Shippers' Council to date, they have been advised that the Conference are going ahead in filing the proposed changes and in issuing &mdash; as we now know they have issued &mdash; a notice through the press to the trade. The Shippers' Council urges all importers and exporters to refuse to accept these conditions and make the point that they have the alternative of using the excellent non-Conference operators who serve the <Col N="1217" /> trade.  However, the Shippers' Council, who I am sure have been in touch with the Minister and his Department, intend to continue to oppose the Conference operators and they have taken the matter up with all the relevant organisations.</P>
    <P>The decision shows a certain contempt for the Irish economy.  It is an attack not only on Ireland's most efficient and cost effective container port &mdash; which is what Waterford is &mdash; but it is, in fact, an attack on the Irish flag.  Seven of the nine Irish flag container vessels trading in and out of Ireland are registered in Waterford and daily trade in and out of the port. An Irish flag vessel is a vessel owned, managed and crewed in Ireland and, as such, these vessels must receive at least equal treatment, and preferably a certain special treatment.  To find them treated with the contempt that is part and parcel of this decision-making is totally and absolutely unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Nobody knows the motive behind this decision.  One may well try to have a guess at it.  One seeks to see who will benefit on foot of this decision should it succeed.  I hope it is not going to.  It is a particularly incomprehensible decision when one checks worldwide container port rankings in the containerisation yearbook of 1989 because Waterford is listed in that book at 120 worldwide. Dublin is listed at 72 and Cork at 201 which gives some figures for comparison. Waterford is not a Mickey Mouse port. It is not a port to be kicked around and it certainly is not a port to be deleted.</P>
    <P>My intention here this evening is to call on the Minister for the Marine and his Minister of State to take appropriate action with the companies and the agents involved and to take the matter up with the fair trading department of the European Commission in Brussels.  I think Ireland's right should be demanded, and the right is that Irish flag vessels will not be excluded from carrying our exports, with the consequential job losses which would flow from that.</P>
    <P>To me it amounts to a very simple fact. <Col N="1218" /> There seems to be a caucus set up to screw the Irish shipping industry.  We have seen the demise of Irish Shipping. B &amp; I and Bells are really what is left and what appear to be under a concerted attack by this cartel.</P>
    <P>I would also like to make the point in relation to Waterford that it is a green port.  By that I mean it is the only port in the country that has, as a vital part of its infrastructure, a rail link.  Fifty seven per cent of the cargo from and to that port goes by rail.  The effect of that is that it keeps so many heavy lorries, juggernauts and huge containerised cargo off what we know to be totally inadequate roads.  For that alone I feel it would be unacceptable to any environmentally-conscious Minister and Government to allow the deletion of Waterford.</P>
    <P>This attempt to axe Waterford is of tremendous importance locally.  Any industry based in Waterford and the south-east generally would be forced to transport their cargo at extra cost to the other ports.  This, of course, would erode our competitiveness and increase the costs of our exports.  I have no idea what the Minister is going to say but I want him to understand how terribly important this is, how pleased I am that the Cathaoirleach recognised that fact and gave me the opportunity to raise the matter here this evening.  I hope that the Minister's reply will be comprehensive, that it will give Waterford people who care about this some feeling of optimism that the Minister is in charge of the situation and that the appropriate moves are being made to rescue the day, not only for Waterford but for the south-east and for the entire country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to confirm to the House the precise position and what exactly has been done by us since this announcement some few weeks ago. I believe we must always be very conscious of the implications of any decision <Col N="1219" /> which affects our transport costs, but particularly those associated with sea transport because of the fact that within the next few years we will be the only island country in the Community.  Of course, the mere fact that we are on the periphery means that increased transport costs have serious effects for us because we are all selling on the one market. The more costly it becomes to export, or indeed to import then, seriously affects the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>In fact, I was on my way to address the annual dinner of the Irish Chamber of Shipping on Friday week last when I heard mention on the car radio of a decision which appeared, at that time to have implications for Irish importers and exporters in general and for the port of Waterford in particular.  At first glance the issue seemed extremely complicated but the chamber dinner presented me with an opportunity to discuss the decision, and the implications of it, with many representatives of the shipping community and the users, including in particular those connected with the port of Waterford.  Having established the implications I decided the matter was serious enough to warrant representations at the highest level.  To that end, officials of the Department of the Marine were asked by me to make contact with appropriate agencies and representative groups to discuss means and ways of tackling the problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was on Friday evening, when the news first broke.  The following Monday officials of my Department were in contact with many of those involved, particularly the Irish Shippers' Council &mdash; Senator Bulbulia has made reference to their meeting which took place in Dublin on 11 April.  Having heard the news, I was extremely worried because I knew that, without realising the full implications of it, it would have serious implications for the country as a whole, not only for Waterford or the south-east.  We must recognise that Waterford is an <Col N="1220" /> extremely important port to the country as a whole, with scheduled sailings to and from the Continent.</P>
    <P>I should like to make reference to the traffic projections over the years.  This year, 1989, we expect to export through Waterford 1,540,000 tonnes and we expect that figure to be 2,210,000 tonnes in 1993.  That is how important it is to us.</P>
    <P>I listened to Senator Bulbulia who fully realises, coming from Waterford, the importance of the port to Waterford.  I fully share her concern regarding the recently announced proposal by the North Eastern Atlantic Conference Line to increase transshipment charges and to delete Waterford as a designated feeder port to their service.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should begin by clarifying a few matters in relation to these proposals. First, there has been communication with the Irish Shippers Council which represent both exporters and importers by the Conference Line which serves the east coast of the United States.  The Conference Line is essentially a commercial consortium of ship-owners who pool their vessels on a particular route offering regular scheduled services to the exporter.</P>
    <P>Long sea transport of Irish trade has always relied on Conference Line.  Up until the early 1970s, Conference Lines made direct calls to Irish ports but then, for alleged reasons of economy, direct services were terminated.  The Conference believed that economies could be effected by centralising their operation from a smaller number of larger European ports such as Liverpool and Rotterdam. Irish traffic would be transshipped via these ports, the first leg of the sea journey being on board feeder ships from Dublin, Waterford or Cork.</P>
    <P>At the time shippers were advised that transshipment costs to Conference-serviced ports would be offset by other economies and would ultimately be absorbed by the Conference into its overall cost structure.  This situation proved to be short lived, however, and soon additional <Col N="1221" /> charges for transshipment to Conference ports were introduced.  Over the years, these charges have increased to the point where today they stand at more than 70 per cent of what it would cost the exporter if the Conference port, for example Liverpool or Rotterdam was in fact the final destination.  These transshipment costs are termed &ldquo;Irish arbitrary charges&rdquo; and represent an unwelcome surcharge which exporters must bear while remaining competitive on US and world markets.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to describe this but the best way of illustrating it is to use an example.  Say, for instance the normal economic cost of sending a cargo to Rotterdam, where Rotterdam is the final destination, is £100.  The cost of the same journey even where the ultimate destination is the United States is more than £70 despite the fact that the initial leg of the journey is not more than 13 per cent of the total cost.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware of the importance which the Government attaches to the preparation for the challenges which the achievement of the single European market will bring.  The House will have noted that the national plan contains far-reaching proposals in relation to our seaports and the development of sea freight services.  Efficient services at competitive rates are essential for economic development and this has been reflected by the proposal to invest approximately £15 million in the development of Waterford port, enhance and enlarge existing lo-lo facilities and equip the port to meet the needs of the 1990s and beyond.  I am quite certain the Government would not have decided on an expenditure &mdash; I do not think the people of Waterford would have insisted on it &mdash; of £15 million if Waterford was to be deleted as a base for the Conference Line.</P>
    <P>I am particularly familiar with Waterford. For that reason I say that many other parts of the country, apart from the south-west, are depending on Waterford. Many of our lift on-lift off containers &mdash;<Col N="1222" /> 20 foot in particular, without mentioning any company &mdash; pick up on the west and north-west coast of the country, use dry boxes, insulated boxes, dry ice and give an excellent service from door to door. I am only familiar with onward to the Continent but if that is indicative of the service which is being given to the United States then it is no doubt an excellent service and one which this country cannot do without.</P>
    <P>In 1987 more than 30 per cent of total lo-lo traffic from this country was shipped from Waterford and represents about 108,000 20 ft. containers filled in the main with high-value Irish exports.  Under current development plans this volume of trade is conservatively projected to double by the end of 1993.</P>
    <P>The exporters and importers have made the Conference representatives aware in no uncertain terms of their dismay at the proposed increases and the serious implications of the proposed deletion of Waterford as a base port. It seemed to the Irish shippers that the Conference was unaware, or not fully aware, of the major role which the port of Waterford plays in the transshipment of Irish trade.</P>
    <P>The Senator made reference to the meeting which took place between representatives of the Conference and the Irish Shippers' Council.  We have been in constant contact with them and with other companies such as Bell Lines Limited. I took the opportunity of meeting their representatives in Dublin at their annual function there and I made them fully aware of the support of the Minister and myself.  We realised the implications and said that they would have our full support in trying to ensure that these proposals would not be implemented on 15 May.</P>
    <P>The North Eastern Atlantic Conference has provided sea transport services to the Irish trade for many years and effectively control the factors which <Col N="1223" /> govern the rates at which goods are carried within the area to which the Conference arrangement applies.  The decision in this case is, in essence, a matter for the Conference itself but when issues of national importance arise as a direct result of such decisions, they cannot be ignored.  The Minister and Department officials have already been in contact with the Irish Shippers' Council, the Irish Exporters' Association and the Confederation of Irish Industry to assess the implications and to see what action could be taken to remedy the situation.</P>
    <P>Following upon these consultations the Minister has written directly to the chairman of the North Eastern Atlantic Conference indicating his concern over these developments.  In that letter he made it perfectly clear that the imposition of further increases in Irish arbitrary charges represents a highly unwelcome additional burden on Irish exporters and renders their task of competing in the international market all the more difficult.  He also impressed upon the Conference the importance of Waterford port to the Irish economy and the plans for investment in expansion of facilities there.</P>
    <P>I find it extremely difficult to understand why the Conference should even recommend the deletion of Waterford port.  We must have an explanation.  I genuinely feel it is impossible to explain why it should be.  I feel confident that the Conference must rescind their proposal to implement the deletion of Waterford and the 10 per cent.  If we go back to the 1970s we are reminded of the fact that none of the ports in the country had direct access to the Conference Line or that the Conference Line did not call at our ports and that we were left with a number of bases where there would be no additional charge.  I understand that meant from door to door, to Rotterdam or Liverpool, not just from Waterford but from the exporter's door or the importer's door depending on which way the traffic was <Col N="1224" /> going.  The Minister added that while in the past there was little that Irish exporters and importers could do but accept these increases whether they considered them to be justified or not, the arrival on the scene in recent years of major non-Conference shipping lines had radically altered the situation.</P>
    <P>I understand that perhaps 70-80 per cent of trade now carried on Conference Line to the US and other markets could if necessary be transferred to non-Conference lines who, in fact, offer a service at rates which in some instances can be up to 10 per cent cheaper than those currently charged by the Conference.  It should be evident to any observer that Irish exporters may have little option but to take their custom elsewhere if the Conference Lines become uncompetitive.</P>
    <P>In that regard the shippers' interests have been assured that should it become necessary, every effort will be made on their behalf both by the Minister and myself and by Department officials to ensure that Irish trade, both in terms of imports and exports, will have access to competitive and efficient international transport services to and from the United States.</P>
    <P>The Minister has strongly urged that the Conference Line undertake to review the decisions relating to arbitrary charges and to Waterford Port.  I am hopeful that these particular circumstances will be borne in mind and that these compelling arguments will influence the Conference to reassess their proposals.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to refer to the importance of sea transport and to record the fact that in volume terms the dominant access transport mode is accounting for over 80 per cent of total merchandise trade and approximately 50 per cent of passenger movements.  To ensure that Ireland can compete on equal terms with other member states the <i>National Development Plan</i> has proposed substantial investment and commercial port infrastructure.  I made reference to the proposal to expend some £15 million on <Col N="1225" /> upgrading the port of Waterford for lo-lo or lift-on lift-off facilities.  All this investment, however will not achieve its full impact if the costs associated with shipping goods abroad increase out of line with those of our competitors.</P>
    <P>We should also bear in mind that over two-thirds of the country's exports pass through sea ports, with freight to Britain accounting for 35 per cent and to other European countries a further 47 per cent of total exports.</P>
    <P>We cannot ignore the contribution made by our exports to other countries including the United States.  These exports from our country and from Waterford in particular are sufficiently significant to make every effort to ensure that costs of shipping on these routes do not escalate.</P>
    <P>I made reference to the fact that the Conference Lines could make their own decisions.  But the Conference Lines are in business and they must realise that while mention was made of a cartel &mdash; that may have been true some time ago &mdash; there are other Conference lines.  The only handicap there is they do not run as frequently as the Conference Lines.  I know you cannot change overnight, but there is room there to move.  Other companies would only be too pleased to carry much of our traffic.  Saying that does not mean that we must accept this, and that we have to accept the increase of 10 per cent and the arbitrary charge and that we have to accept the deletion of Waterford. It could have very serious implications not alone in the south-east but for all of the country in the case of exports and imports.</P>
    <P>The first step is to make this direct approach to the Conference which the Minister has done by way of letter.  The Shippers' Council have met with representatives of the Conference and have made them fully aware of the serious implications of their proposals.  There are other avenues which we must pursue.  We in Government and the Department of the Marine have a duty to pursue such <Col N="1226" /> possibilities associated with EC competition policy.  These must be explored as well.  We cannot accept a situation where we have one Conference line who can take decisions having such effects without any prior consultation with the Shippers' Council, the Association of Chambers of Commerce in Ireland, the Confederation of Irish Industry, Córas Tráchtála and the Irish Exporter's Association.  I am not aware of any consultations that took place in advance.</P>
    <P>The Senator is absolutely correct when she says that the Irish Shippers' Council at their meeting on 11 April made it abundantly clear to the Conference that they are not prepared to accept this.  I want to make it abundantly clear to the House that while these people can make their own decisions we have an obligation to impress upon them the detrimental effects involved and to remind them of the decisions taken in the early seventies when there were no direct calls to this country and we were left with a number of bases, and it was made clear that because of the economies that would be made it would be more cost effective and more advantageous for us.</P>
    <P>Either myself or my Minister will request a meeting with the Conference Line to discuss this very serious problem.  This will depend on the reply to the Minister's letter which we expect in the very near future.  We are extremely anxious to ensure that this problem be resolved as quickly as possible.  We cannot accept the 10 per cent increase; neither can we accept the deletion of Waterford Port or indeed any other port, lest one might think because of the volume of business in any of the three ports that there could be a <i>quid pro quo.</i> The situation is that all are important. While the Senator pointed out the tonnage going through Waterford is approximately 30 per cent as far as that is concerned there will be no <i>quid pro quo</i> and as far as the 10 per cent is concerned I ask the House to leave it in our hands. <Col N="1227" /> The Senator can be absolutely assured that I and my Minister feel as strongly about this as she does, and as the people of Waterford and of the south-east do. We shall do our utmost to try and resolve this problem and to try and find a solution in time.</P>

      <P>May I put on the record my thanks to the Minister for his vehement and robust reply.  He covered absolutely every element that I raised and I am convinced that he is aware of the urgency and indeed of the enormous concern about this issue in Waterford.  I feel confident that he and his Minister will continue to press this matter and will expedite it.  I would add one little caution. So far, there has been no reply to the Minister's letter from the Conference, <Col N="1228" /> and the date of 15 May has the habit of sneaking up.  I urge if there is no reply by tomorrow or the next day, that a further missive, more strongly worded, be sent and they would not be allowed to delay the matter until 15 May when it will become a <i>fait accompli</i>.  I am sure the Minister is aware of that possibility but I would like to place my anxiety about that on the record.</P>

      <P>I will just say to the Senator that I fully appreciate that.  We realise that 15 May is not too far away and we do not want that situation to arise. I am sure, as a politician, the Senator will agree with me that we all act better when we are under pressure.</P>
