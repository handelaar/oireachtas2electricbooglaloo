      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we start into the business of the day I want to pay a very sincere tribute to the late Frank Cluskey. Frank Cluskey was a man I did not know in a parliamentary sense but I did know him in a personal way for many years.  I also have read what he has said in the Houses of the Oireachtas, in his capacity as a trade union leader and, indeed, as a very fine gentleman.  Frank Cluskey has epitomised for me what was best in Irish life.  He did not in any sense sectionalise the people of Ireland.  He addressed himself to the problems of all the people of this island and this is one of the reasons why so many tributes were paid to him. He represented the great tradition of the Labour movement in Ireland and he made no bones about that.  He did address himself to the problems of the Labour Party and the trade union movement, but he never forgot the rest of the people and he attempted at all times to be fair in his actions, his deeds and words. He was a great raconteur.  He was a great friend and, on behalf of the Seanad, I would like to sympathise very sincerely with the family and friends of Frank Cluskey and, indeed, with the Labour Party and the trade union movement <Col N="1426" /> which he so ably represented for so many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Frank Cluskey was the most effective parliamentarian I have ever known.  He was warm, he was witty, he was tough, he was stubborn and, most of all, he was compassionate.  He made a very real contribution to Irish public life in Government, in Opposition and as party leader.  He served this country well and he will be greatly missed.  On behalf of Fine Gael I would like to join in this expression of sympathy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking for the University Senators.  I should like to say how much we shall miss Frank Cluskey as a colleague, as a human being. One of the privileges of membership of the Oireachtas is to make friends with and meet people on a natural basis, irrespective of political ideology and Frank Cluskey was an immensely likeable person.  I should like to underline the uniquely good example he gave by his public life in general, by his resignation from Cabinet office on a matter of principle in particular.  We all know that in this country there is an image of politics as a game, an image of politicians as self-serving and cynical, if not corrupt.  It is an image which is, unfortunately, all too prevalent, an image which is based on some element of truth, regrettably.  I think Frank Cluskey's lasting legacy will be seen to be that his whole life, his whole political career was a shining contradiction of that adverse image.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past four to five days wonderful tributes have been paid to Frank Cluskey, and quite rightly so. This, of course, is a clear indication of the esteem and the respect in which he was held by both opponents, who were not always enemies, and by his friends. The great respect shown to Frank as a politician and a human being in those various tributes I have mentioned, were in fact borne out and given emphasis to in a much stronger way by the presence of the hundreds of people at his removal, people who travelled from parts as far <Col N="1427" /> away as Schull and the other side of Killarney, etc. and indeed the presence of many notable dignitaries.  All this gave further emphasis to the respect and esteem in which Frank Cluskey was held.</P>
      <P>If there is one lasting memory that will stand out about Frank Cluskey for years to come it must be the concern and activity he displayed in regard to those in our society who had nobody else to represent them.  It would be superfluous for me to cover that ground now when it has been clearly recorded in both Houses of the Oireachtas over the years and in the many tributes that have been paid to him over the last few days.  Above all, Frank Cluskey will be remembered by the most deprived in our society for whom he made life that little bit easier. They will remember Frank for that.</P>
      <P>Frank had iron put into his soul.  It was put there at a very early age by witnessing the deprivation that was inflicted on the weaker sections of society.  That iron could not be drawn out of the man.  That is the sort of a man he was.  It could not be drawn out of his soul as long as people were being discriminated against or deprived in other sorts of ways.  He never believed in the concept that the poor must wait.  He always believed that there was corn enough for everybody.  He demonstrated this quite clearly as a junior Minister, or as a Parliamentary Secretary, as they were then known, when in the Coalition Government.  In fact, at the time he was described as the last of the big spenders by Deputy Garret FitzGerald.  Frank Cluskey saw the corn was there.  He saw there was plenty of it, enough to go around; and, being the type of person he was, he made sure that the most deprived in society got their fair share of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a lot of talk about how formidable an adversary Frank was.  He was a tremendously loyal man.  We have also heard about his tremendous wit. Obviously, some of his remarks could not be put on the record.  I would like at this time just to give the public a little indication of the type of wit that Frank displayed in adverse situations, when the <Col N="1428" /> cards were stacked against him.  I had been driving him around the country during an election and we were two days away from polling day.  He had been working from 8 o'clock that morning until after midnight.  His first meal was around one o'clock in the Great Western Hotel, Galway.  Later, we set off for Dublin. Frank fell asleep.  Somewhere near Athlone he woke up and said to me: &ldquo;Jack in about two or three months' time somebody is going to tip you on the shoulder in Leinster House and say to you &lsquo;I have just come from Grangegorman. There is a guy up there with a beard and glasses in a straitjacket and he thinks he is An Tánaiste.&rsquo;&rdquo; That was a man who knew his seat was about to go in two days' time.  There are many stories attributed to Frank.  Overall, I would like to say to the public that when you are thinking about Frank Cluskey the politician do not forget the human side of the man.  Some of us who were close to him knew of many examples of this.  On one occasion, when a colleague's wife was near death, he took the children home to his own house, where he and his late wife, Eileen, took care of them.  Those are the things that are not well known about him, but I would like to put them on record.</P>

      <P>I, too, certainly would like to be associated with the remarks made here.  I found him a very good friend when I came up here in the early seventies.  I would like to sympathise with the Labour Party on their loss.</P>

    <Title>Re-opening of Seanad Chamber: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will commence today's formal business with statements to be made on the resumption of sittings in the Seanad Chamber.  Senators will recall from the Order of the House last week that each group are entitled to have one speaker, who has two minutes, and <Col N="1429" /> the Leas-Chathaoirleach will then conclude the statements.</P>
      <P>I have the honour today, as Cathaoirleach, to preside over this special and unique occasion in the history of our Parliament on the first sitting to take place in the refurbished Seanad Chamber.  In honour of this occasion it gives me great pleasure to welcome to this sitting my colleagues, former distinguished Cathaoirligh, former Leaders of this House and distinguished friends.  We have waited a long time for this day.  It is over two and a half years since the Seanad sat in this Chamber.  Even in the year before that, in 1985, we had to put up with scaffolding and temporary ceilings while the extent of the work to be carried out was investigated.  In praising the Members for their patience in carrying on the sittings in the cramped temporary accommodation, I want to pay a special tribute to my colleagues on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, who were of enormous support to me in communicating with the Office of Public Works officials and generally overseeing the whole project with them.</P>
      <P>I would like now to turn to the restoration work itself.  This entire project has required the exercise of skills of the highest order by everybody involved &mdash; management, architects, engineers, surveyors and craftspersons.  Surely the highlight of this work is the ceiling.  The restoration of the magnificent 18th century decorative ceiling, designed by James Watt, was carried out by a team from the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>This work on the ceiling was carried out by a specialised team of craftsmen and we are indeed fortunate to have in the Office of Public Works the services of such a skilled person in this highly specialised field as Mr. Val Ryan, who is acknowledged as one of the country's leading experts.  A team of plasterers, with Mr. Ryan, are now available to maintain the many fine ceilings and, indeed, other works in the public domain. Thus these specialised skills will be carried on to the next generation of craftspersons and will benefit the State for generations to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1430" /> The number of people involved in the restoration work, for which we are all so grateful, are too many to mention individually.  However, I hope I will not offend anyone if I pay a special tribute to some.  Everybody in this Chamber is well aware that I am on dangerous ground now, because if you single out people you leave out others.</P>
    <P>First of all, I would like to pay tribute to the Chairman of the Office of Public Works, John Mahoney, the architect, Jeffrey Johnston, Tom Sherlock, the project co-ordinator, and his colleague, Michael Fennelly and, last but by no means least, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Treacy, who put up with all our complaints, when we were in the temporary Chamber, about lighting, ventilation and everything else.  More importantly, he had the political will to push through the job to its successful completion.</P>
    <P>The restoration project was carried out while both Houses of the Oireachtas remained in session in the building.  As I have said already, the Seanad sat in the ante-room which was especially converted right next door to the work in progress.  Notwithstanding this, and the fact that the work was at times both noisy and dusty, there were no disruptions of the contract programme.  This reflects great credit on the Members and the staff of both Houses of the Oireachtas, but especially of the Seanad, who patiently tolerated the inconvenience, as did the Dáil Members who had to do without all the facilities of the main Library while the job was in progress.  I know Minister Noel Treacy and the Office of Public Works wish me to express their appreciation of the co-operation of the Members and staff of the Houses during the course of the work.  Credit is also due to the contractor, who was very flexible in scheduling the most disruptive work during the least incovenient times.</P>
    <P>Every effort was made by all parties concerned to keep lines of communication open about progress on the work front.  This is why I feel there was a high degree of understanding and patience from Senators as to the length of <Col N="1431" /> time involved and disturbance caused by the work.  I personally kept in close touch with the Office of Public Works and the officials and, in turn, reported back formally to this House at least seven times. On each occasion a committee meeting was held prior to making that report.  So I know Senators will appreciate the effort made by their representatives on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <P>The role of the Seanad has, over the years, been questioned, criticised, misunderstood and often ignored.  I hope that as our sitting here today is being televised it will give the people in their homes their first opportunity to judge us and to give them a greater understanding of how their Parliament works.</P>
    <P>The work of the Seanad does not stop here, but as with all living institutions is ongoing.  It is appropriate today, when we are to take the Bill dealing with the Blasket Islands, to be introduced by the Taoiseach, that I should thank him and the Government for the amount of legislation they have given to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I intend, with my colleagues on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, to ensure that the Irish translation service will be put in place for the next autumn session.  A translation booth will be required to be installed.  The Seanad has waited too long for that service.  Indeed, I had hoped that I would have had it in place today, but that was not possible.</P>
    <P>I would like to end on a personal note. It gives me great joy to be back in this Chamber, where I started my parliamentary career in 1977.  My great hope would be that I would remain here for many years to come, without interruption.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little left for me to say.  The Cathaoirleach has covered very adequately the ground that it was necessary to cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is indeed a great pleasure for us to be back in this Chamber once again and to see the fantastic refurbishment job that has been done under the auspices of the Office of Public Works.  For many years we have seen in other places the capacity <Col N="1432" /> of the Office of Public Works to rise to the occasion when necessary.  We have seen in many places around the country the excellence of the work they have done.  We have seen in many places that they have been able to hold together crafts that were dying.  We have often heard people giving out about them being slow.  But when we saw the end results we always realised that you cannot speed up the progress necessary for excellence. The fact that the workers in the Office of Public Works were able to restore this magnificent ceiling is a tribute to them which should not be forgotten by the nation.  It will stand for many years as a symbol of the excellence of Irish craftsmanship. It is a symbol of Irish craft-manship which, we should not forget, exists.</P>
    <P>It is a proud and a good day for us to come back here.  I am very pleased to be back in this Chamber.  It seems strange that I am looking at the Opposition Members face to face for the first time. For the last two and a half years I sat in front and had to turn around to find out what was going on behind my back.  I am not too sure whether things will change because there are people behind me who, perhaps, I should be watching from the back of my head.  Nevertheless, it makes good parliamentary sense to be able to address your remarks to the Opposition in a proper manner.</P>
    <P>Over the past two and a half years we have had many difficulties associated with the other Chamber.  The difficulties that we had were of a minor nature in a sense, but I must pay tribute to the staff of the House for the excellent manner in which they conducted themselves.  It has to be said that over the past two and a half years they worked in conditions that would not be allowed by the Department of Labour if they were working outside the House.  I must personally &mdash; and I am sure the House will agree with me &mdash; pay a special tribute to them.  The Cathaoirleach mentioned the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Treacy, and the officials of the Office of Public Works.  I do not have to reiterate what the Cathoirleach has said about them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1433" /> The business of the Seanad is not really about the Chamber.  It is about legislation and it is about the democratic system in which we work.  There have been criticisms in the past of the working of the Seanad.  Many people have suggested that the Seanad should be abolished.  The Seanad has stood the test of democracy. Many things have happened in this Chamber and in the ante-room, which was our Chamber for the past two and a half years, which have been a credit to the Seanad.  Many Bills have been changed and many Bills have been initiated.  I must pay tribute to the former Members of the Seanad who are here and I must pay a special tribute to former officials of the Seanad who are here.  It would be invidious for me to mention names, but we appreciate in the present day the work that they did in the past.</P>
    <P>I thank all of those who were associated with the work on this Chamber.  I sincerely hope that the work of the Seanad will continue and will enhance the democratic process, which is of vital importance to the continuing political scene in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>May I, first of all, join with the Cathaoirleach in saying &ldquo;welcome back&rdquo; to the former distinguished Members of this House who are here today for the re-opening of their Chamber. Obviously, it is a matter of great satisfaction to all of us to be back in this restored Chamber two and a half years later.  I would like to congratulate the Office of Public Works on a superb job, marvellously done, within time and within budget.  I hope that as many of the public as possible will be able to come and see this great national building over the coming years.  It is a building that should be shared with all the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The occasion today focuses attention on this House and it is important that we use the occasion to take a hard look at the role of the Seanad within the Irish policital process and to see how we can be more effective in serving that process and in serving the people.  There are many reasons why there should be a second Chamber.  As I have said before, <Col N="1434" /> there is only one fundamental reason for a House such as this and that is that it does its job well; that it does its job well in debating and examining legislation, in providing a voice for those who might not otherwise be heard; that it does its work in committee, in innovation and in broading the national debate.</P>
    <P>I believe that over the years these responsibilities have been well discharged. But I believe, too, that we must be more ambitious and we must push the potential of this House to its fullest possible development.  For that reason we in this House must not be afraid of change, whether it be in our electoral system, work practices, the scope and the range of our work.  I hope that this re-opening today can be seen by all of us as an affirmation of our willingness to face up to whatever changes are necessary and to expand our thinking and our horizons to ensure that this House is effective, responsive and innovative, that we will be judged worthy occupants of this magnificent Chamber and that we will be seen to have discharged our full political and constitutional responsibilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing that strikes me is that it is far too nice a place to get thrown out of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole, remember that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, indeed.  The other point that I will make is that it is also a spur towards re-election at a time when there is a lot of discussion about elections.  It is certainly a place one would like to come back home to again.  I will be working on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In looking around here we see a job of work that was designed, monitored, managed, directed and co-ordinated by the staff of the public service in the Office of Public Works.  The people should understand that the whole job was carried out by the Office of Public Works.  They were the people who employed the private contractors they wanted, but at the end of the day the intricate ceiling work, moulding, restoration, decoration and so <Col N="1435" /> on was carried out by the employees of the OPW, who in effect were resubcontracted back to the main contractor.</P>
    <P>It is also fair to say that what we see is the living proof of the effectiveness and efficiency of the Office of Public Works. The OPW is a department which has often been the butt of much detraction. They can certainly take a bow here today. This is also a testament to the work rate of that department, that they are able to finish this very difficult job almost half a year ahead of schedule.  The impossibility of determining where the old work finishes and the new work begins is a fair reflection of the common bond of skill across generations and centuries, from the craft guilds of centuries ago to the modern trade unions.  It is this common bond which enhances and in a sense, adds personality to the room.</P>
    <P>More importantly, as has been said by both the Leader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition, the House is about the business of the House.  I hope that the clever, intricate, bright and quality in-depth work here can be reflected in the debates that will take place here and in the work of the House from now on. The fact that we undertook the refurbishment, redecoration and renovation of this building should now also give us the courage necessary to look at the whole structure of the Seanad, from election to the methods of dealing with legislation, the methods of allocation of time, the contribution of ideas and thought, in order that we would also be prepared to reform and change in order to reflect changes in society.  We should look forward to making these changes.  In the meantime, the Independent group would like to offer our congratulations to all who were involved in producing this magnificent proof of their effectiveness and efficiency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would join with you and particularly with my colleagues Senator Lanigan, Senator Manning and Senator O'Toole, in congratulating everybody associated with the work carried out to <Col N="1436" /> this magnificent Chamber, work that was carried out under the supervision of the Office of Public Works.  As my colleague, Senator O'Toole stated, this work was done by the Public Service who are often criticised and, indeed, during the period of this reconstruction work they were criticised in this Chamber.  I have it on record in this House that I had always found it quite possible to defend what they were doing, to defend the meticulous way that they went about what is, in fact, a work of art, a masterpiece.  Under your guiding hand, a Chathaoirleach, we have sat on committees, we have visited this House on a very frequent basis, and gone very high and close to the scaffolding. We looked at what was being done and wondered if it was ever going to be possible to restore it to the grandeur and the magnificence this Chamber always exhibited from the first day in which it was used as a House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>We had complaints from Members; we had frustrations; we had noise and we had a dust factor to contend with, but in all of those periods, we looked to the day when we would be returning to the House.  We had many jokes about whether we would return to the House or not.  Indeed, the Leader and the Cathaoirleach have always defended the role of this House in legislation.  Those of us who have been directly involved in helping &mdash; both on the Government side and in Opposition &mdash; to improve legislation or, indeed, to initiate it, have always been very proud of the role that the Seanad has played as a House of the Oireachtas.  Nobody in public life should be allowed to denigrate the actual importance of this House in the area of legislation because we have a proud role, a proud function and we have a proud record of how we have approached legislation that was either initiated here or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to that, Private Members and Opposition parties have had an opportunity here, away from the spotlight of the political climate in another place, to debate at length what is good as legislation and debate with Ministers <Col N="1437" /> from all sides the kind of amendments we require to see being written into the Statute Book, matters that had not been dealt with in another place, whether due to restriction of time or for some other reason.</P>
    <P>At the moment, as you know, a review is being undertaken by the Standing Orders Committee of which I am a member.  I hope that with that review and change of Standing Orders we can meet the sentiments that have been expressed by Senator O'Toole, that in addition to having a bright and cheerful Chamber to work in, we would also approach our role here as Oireachtas Members in a different light and with a different outlook.</P>
    <P>Finally, a Chathaoirligh, you made a joke or some remark at the end of your own comments in which you said that you hoped that you would be allowed to remain here, that nobody would disturb you.  Could I respectfully suggest to you that the Taoiseach you have complimented on doing all this work in this House, with his Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, is the only man who can disturb you in this House?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the extensive and well deserved tributes paid by my colleagues to the outstanding restoration work carried out by the Office of Public Works to our Seanad Chamber. As one of the longer serving Senators I can honestly say, a Chathaoirligh, that I have never seen the Chamber look so well.  In fact the place looks so good that I am having second thoughts, for the first time, about leaving it for the European Parliament next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Chamber has a long and noble history as the seat of Parliament, the Second or Upper House.  The Free State Seanad commenced its sittings here on 11 December 1922 and the Seanad, under the present Constitution, on 27 April 1938.  The Seanad has sat here ever since up to October of 1986 when the restoration work commenced and the sittings were held in the adjoining ante-room. I am sure that today's proceedings will be in keeping with those historic first <Col N="1438" /> sittings and other days of special character, such as first sittings following general elections.  Much of the press coverage of the past few days of the restoration work executed here has been rewarding for and deserved by the Office of Public Works. Two points stand out for me.  One is that the work was completed no less than five months early and, secondly, that it was well within budget.  Those factors, along with work of the highest standard, the quality of which is obvious to all, puts the almost traditional criticism of the Office of Public Works to rest once and for all. We all owe a debt of gratitude to each and every one of those who were involved in this fairly substantial project.</P>
    <P>I believe it should also be put on record that we in the Seanad and the Committee on Procedures and Privileges were very conscious of the work carried out here. We did not look for any improvements or changes regarding the furnishing and fittings and we are happy to have the Chamber back as we left it from that point of view, with the essential repairs carried out.  The improved sound system would have been installed one way or another.  I was delighted to see that the distinguished conservation group, An Taisce, who all along were so concerned with the preservation of this magnificent ceiling, have praised the restoration and the quality of the work here.  There is a pristine freshness about the surroundings that I hope will augur well for the serious work undertaken in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I hope that our sitting today &mdash; the theme, I appreciate, is business as usual &mdash; will, through television, give our people for the first time a valuable insight into how their Parliament works.  Too often Parliament is ridiculed, perhaps a few times justifiably, but more often than not out of ignorance and the televising of the proceedings today will, I hope, go some way towards giving people a better understanding of what we do here as parliamentarians. In that sense, all of us are on trial here, as are, of course, the programme makers of RTE as well.  I hope that the special occasion afforded by our returning to this beautifully restored Chamber will be itself a fitting <Col N="1439" /> tribute to all involved in the restoration work.  I know that my colleagues will rise to the occasion in accordance with tradition.</P>

      <P>In view of the recent High Court judgment on Mallow Hospital the need for the Minister for Health to state clearly his support for the continuance of full general hospital services at Mallow.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Katharine Bulbulia of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to clarify the position of Waterford in the Government <Col N="1440" /> decentralisation programme by identifying the State agency or agencies to be located there and by giving a firm projection of the stage processing of the relocation.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Nuala Fennell of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to explain why some disabled young people attending sheltered workshops do not qualify for any payment or allowance other than £3.50 per week.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator John Murphy of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to ensure effective arrangements in assessing the large numbers of pupils to be examined under the new junior certificate curriculum in respect of aural testing and oral competence in the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Joe O'Toole of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The replacement of classroom assistants at primary level in schools serving disadvantaged and socio-economically deprived pupils.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Bromell, Hogan, Norris, Bradford, Bulbulia, Fennell, Murphy and O'Toole as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Bromell's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Hogan, Norris, Bradford, Bulbulia, Fennell, Murphy and O'Toole may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>It is intended to take items Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 today, that we take Second Stage of item No. 1 until approximately 4.30 p.m.  There has been agreement among the Whips that no Senator will speak for more than ten minutes on this matter today.  There will be ample opportunity when we get to the further Stages for people who have an <Col N="1441" /> interest in this very important legislation to make known their views.  We will take Report Stage of item No. 2, Firearms and Offensive Weapons Bill, 1989, and we will order item No. 3, Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Bill, 1989, Second Stage.  We will resume the motion at 7 p.m. and there are two hours and 15 minutes left for the motion which is in the name of Fine Gael.</P>

Secondly, could the Leader of the House give any information about item No. 33 and when it may be possible to have this matter debated in the House? May I say to the Leader of the House that we would be prepared to have this matter, the question of a report on press freedom and libel, debated without there being a Minister in the House?</P>

      <P>Without risking your ire, I would like to reiterate what Senator Murphy said about Nicaragua and that is all I have to say about it.  I should like to ask the Leader of the House whether he would consider giving time to item No. 9 on the Order Paper in view of the fact that Amnesty International have launched a worldwide campaign this year for the abolition of the death penalty?  It might be appropriate that the Government give time for this to be debated because Amnesty will be launching a campaign not only in the USSR and South Africa but also in Ireland for the abolition of that penalty.  Secondly, I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he would also consider giving Government time to item No. 31, which deals with the problems of disabled people in this country?</P>

I would also like to ask that the Government consider giving some urgency to item No. 21 which is a motion in the area of foreign policy dealing with the situation in Iran which has become a lot more critical with the continued issuing of threats from that Government.  Finally, is there any possibility that item No. 41 could be taken at an early date, bearing in mind the fact that both Senator Murphy and myself attempted to raise this matter &mdash; the question of the extinction of the art of ballet in this country &mdash; as a matter on the Adjournment but it was ruled to be out of order?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business today, a question was raised by both Senator Manning and Senator McMahon in relation to the situation about item No. <Col N="1444" /> 1.  There was an agreement at CPP that we would conclude Second Stage of this item at 4.30 p.m. today.  We have gone a little over time so there will be a certain amount of flexibility, but not very much, at the end of the time.  There was an agreement among the Whips as to how many people would be allowed to speak. I would suggest that, even though ten minutes does not seem to be a lot of time, possibly some Members might wish to split their time.  If a number of people are offering speakers might split their time to give five or seven minutes to somebody else.  In that way we will get through this important Bill and conclude Second Stage.  There will be adequate time on Committee and Report Stages to debate the nitty gritty of the Bill.  I am sure that by addressing ourselves to Second Stage today, with the Taoiseach, we will get through the programme for the Bill.  It is a technical Bill to which Members can address themselves on Committee and Report Stages.  Item No. 33 was mentioned by Senator Manning.  I agree with him that this is a matter that should come before the House at an early stage.  There is a difficulty in bringing it before the House as the Attorney General is involved in the matter.  I will talk to Senator Manning, and anybody else who wishes to discuss this matter, during the day.</P>
      <P>Senator Ferris is looking for Government time for No. 11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>He is looking for Government time on an Independent motion, which is an interesting one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Government time will not be allowed for this item.  I suggest that if the Senators who are interested wish to have this debated, that they bring it in as their motion whether it be an Independent motion supported by Labour or whether it be a Labour motion supported by the Independents.  I do not see any reason why it cannot come before the House at a time of their picking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I would say that the same applies to item No. 9.  I will not go into any further detail on that.  It is a Bill in <Col N="1445" /> the Independents' names.  It will not be given Government time.</P>
    <P>Item No. 31 is again a motion in the Independent Senators' names and the Independent Senators have the opportunity to be next to have a motion before the House.  If they feel that this is the appropriate motion, they can bring it before the House in that manner.  In other words, they can choose the time at which they can bring it before the House.  That item was also mentioned by Senator Norris and the same reply stands.</P>
    <P>Item No. 21 is in the names of Senators Norris and Ross and I suggest that they have an order of priority for their motions on the Order Paper.  It is up to them to decide the order of priority.  This matter can be debated when they bring it forward.</P>
    <P>Item No. 41, again is a matter for the Independent Senators to bring before the House on a motion.  In view of the fact that there is a large amount of Government business coming before the House over the next few weeks, I cannot see that it will have any chance of being regarded as a matter of Government priority.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan mentioned a debate on Palestine.  It is something which I would dearly like to see.  We can have a debate on Palestine if the Whips come together and we have an appropriate wording organised so that we can put down an all-party motion which could embrace Palestine as its essence.  The Order of Business stands.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  May I first of all congratulate you and the Senators on returning to this splendidly-restored, beautiful Chamber?</P>
      <P>Is scata oileáin iad na Blascaodaí amach ó leithinis an Daingin, Contae Chiarraí.  Is iad an chuid is faide siar de Mhór-Roinn na hEorpa agus tugann siad le chéile, ar bhealach ar leith, áilleacht mhór nádúrtha agus spéis litríochta.  Is í An Blascaod Mór, ar a nglaotar freisin an t-Oileán Thiar, an t-oileán is mó díobh.  Tá sé breis is trí mhíle ar fhad agus tá mile agus céad acra nó mar sin ann.  Is turas trí mhíle farraige é ón chuan ag Dún Caoin ar an mórthír go dtí caladh an oileáin.</P>
      <P>Ní raibh riamh níos mó ná dhá chéad duine nó mar sin ina gcónaí ar an mBlascaod Mór agus mhair siad ar ghabháltais de trí nó ceithre acra ag cur lena slí beatha ón talamh le hiascaireacht, sealgaireacht éanlaithe fiána agus tarrthálas ó thráth go céile.  Tá cur síos beacht ar shaol na n-oileánach déanta ag Tomás Ó Criomhthain:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba mhinic sinn ag dul chun farraige ar mhochóirí na maidine agus an lá oiriúnach a dhóthain agus faoi dheireadh lae bhíodh na daoine istigh ár gcaoineadh le droch-chló a thagadh ar an dtráthnóna.  Bhíodh orainn a bheith amuigh ist oíche agus níl cur síos ar an anró a leanann an sórt sin seilge. Tugaim díogha ar na gnóthaí go léir di a raibh cos ná lámh liom ceangailte ann.  Ba lánmhinic an fharraige ag gabháil lastuas dínn gan radharc againn ar thír ná ar thalamh &mdash; oíche mhór fhada fhuar mar seo ag comhrac na mara agus go lánmhinic ar bheagán <Col N="1447" /> fáltais ach ó uair go huair ag tnúth le cabhair Dé.</P>
    <P>Chothaigh na coinníollacha garbha agus contúirteacha seo spiorad ar leith I measc lucht an oileáin.  Ba fhíorphobal iad muintir na mBlascaodaí i gcónaí, d'ainneoin an bhochtanais a d'fhulaing siad le linn a saoil.</P>
    <P>Bhain saibhreas traidisiún agus béalaoideas le pobal an oileáin seo.  Bhí a saol agus a slite maireachtála, bunaithe ar an talamh agus ar an bhfarraige, mar cheangal leis an sean saol a bhfuil suim agus tábhacht thar na bearta ag gabháil leis.  Ar ámharaí an tsaoil, tá eolas faoin slí maireachtála sin caomhnaithe dúinn ag mórchuid scoláirí agus lucht litríochta, fir cosúil le John Millington Synge, Karl Marstrander, scoláire ón Ioruaidh a bhaist muintir an oileáin &ldquo;An Lochlannach&rdquo; air, agus Robin Flower, a thug siad Bláithín air go ceanúil.  Chuaigh siad go dtí na hoileáin nuair a bhí athbheochan mhór suime sa Ghaeilge agus i rudaí Gaelacha sa dara leath den naoú haois déag.  An rud is tábhachtaí, áfach, go ndearnadh saol an oileáin a chaomhnú dúinn i scríbhinní sainiúla na n-oileánach féin.  Is fear an-tábhachtach duine de na scoláirí a tháinig ar chuairt, Brian Ó Ceallaigh, mar is eisean a spreag an chéad scríbhneoir de chuid an Bhlascaoid, agus an duine is tábhachtaí díobh, Tomás Ó Criomhthain, chun a dhírbheathaisnéis, a scéalta agus a smaointí a chur ar pháipéar.  Thug scoláire eile, George Thomson, treoir do Mhuiris Ó Súilleabháin i ndáil le &ldquo;Fiche Bliain ag Fás&rdquo; a scríobh.  I bhfad níos déanaí scríobh Breandán Ó Beacháin dán álainn faoi na Blascaodaí tréigthe.</P>
    <P>Níl aon áit chomparáideach ar éadan na cruinne, le líon chomh beag sin daoine ina gcónaí ann, ina raibh bláthú chomh hiontach sin ar fhéith na litríochta.  Scríobh Tomás Ó Criomhthain, Peig Sayers agus Muiris Ó Súilleabháin leabhair atá tábhachtach ní amháin mar mhórshaothair litríochta ach freisin mar thuairiscí ar shaol speisialta an oileáin.</P>
    <P>Do chabhraigh saothar na scríbhneoirí <Col N="1448" /> sin go mór chun ceangal a choimeád idir scríbhneoireacht an lae inniu i nGaeilge agus na modhanna cainte a bhí nádúrtha dár sinsir; agus is féidir a mhaíomh freisin gur choimeád an saothar sin ceangal idir scríbhneoireacht an lae inniu i mBéarla agus na modhanna sin.  Bhí baint mhór, mar sin, ag a saothar le caomhnú na Gaeilge mar theanga bheo agus mar theanga traidisiúnta agus len í a choimeád i lár an tsrutha, fiú dár scríbhneoireacht i mBéarla.</P>
    <P>Tugadh saothar Hóiméarach ar leabhar Uí Chriomhthain agus cinnte is saothar den chineál sin é mar, cosúil le Hóiméar, aimsíonn sé a chuid filíochta i ngnáth-imeachtaí an tsaoil &mdash; saol a maireadh leis an bhfarraige agus leis na dúile ach go minic i mbaol uathu; agus ní fhéadfadh éinne na leathanaigh dheiridh de leabhar Pheig Sayers a léamh gan éad a bheith air roimh an suaimhneas a bhronn a saol ar na hoileánaigh.</P>
    <P>Is le déanaí a tháinig deireadh leis an modh maireachtála sin ach is maith an rud é nár milleadh fós an t-oileán álainn sin &mdash; a léiríonn a chórais pháirce agus na tithe atá fágtha ann an modh maireachtála sin go fóill.  Ach leis an mborradh ar an turasóireacht atá tagtha chun cinn ar chósta an Iarthair agus in áiteanna eile &mdash; rud atá an-mhaith ann féin &mdash; tá an toileán i mbaol.</P>
    <P>Cuireann na Blascaodaí duine faoi dhraíocht: baineann áilleacht uasal nádúrtha leo nach bhfuil a leithéid le fáil in áiteanna eile.  Is cuimhneachán beo iad freisin ar an tslí mhaireachtála a bhíodh ag móran Éireannaigh thar glúnta gan chomhaireamh.  Le blianta beaga anuas, tá An Blascaod Mór tagtha chun cinn mar áit oilithreachta dóibh siúd a bhfuil cion ar leith acu don Ghaeilge agus do bhéaloideas an Iarthair.  Is é an cuspóir atá leis an mBille seo ná chun an t-oileán a chaomhnú don am atá le teacht agus cosc a chur le haon fhorbairt nach mbeidh fáilte roimpi; chun cur lena luach agus lena spéis don chuairteoir; agus chun áit a bhfuil luach mór cultúrtha ag baint léi a chaomhnú do na glúnta atá le teacht.</P>
    <P>Bunaíodh Fondúireacht an Bhlascaoid ag muintir an cheantair sa bhliain 1986 chun an t-oileán a chaomhnú agus a chosaint <Col N="1449" /> mar chuid luachmhar dár n-oidhreacht. Ba é bunú na fondúireachta an chéim is fearr a tógadh, i mo thuairim, ó tréigeadh an t-oileán sa bhliain míle naoi gcéad agus caoga trí.  Léirigh sé go soiléir go bhfuil fonn ar mhuintir an cheantair sin go ndéanfaí an áit shainiúil seo a chosaint agus a choimeád mar ba chóir.  Gan í ní bheadh an reachtaíocht seo ann.  Tá sé soiléir, ar ndóigh, go mbeadh sé thar acmhainn ag aon eagraíocht phríobháideach tabhairt faoi na deacrachtaí atá le sárú agus ba léir gurb é réiteach na faidhbe ná go nglacfadh an Stát seilbh ar an oileán lena úsáid mar Pháirc Náisiúnta Stairiúil agus chun a chinntiú, i dteannta leis an bhfondúireacht, go ndéanfaí é a fhorbairt ar bhonn eagraithe.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom go dtuigfí go soiléir nach í an t-aon chúis leis an reachtaíocht seo An Blascaod Mór a chosaint ó thuilleadh meatha.  An phríomhchúis leis an reachtaíocht ná chun eolas ar an saol a bhí ar an oileán a athchur ann agus chun saoráidí nua a chur ar fáil, le cúram agus le cruinneas, a chuirfidh beocht úr san áit a bheidh mar ábhar spéise agus taitnimh do phobal na hÉireann agus do chuairteoirí ón iasacht.</P>
    <P>Is iad seo a leanas príomhfhorálacha an Bhille: Tabharfar údarás do Choimisinéirí na nOibreacha Poiblí seilbh a ghlacadh, le haontú nó go héigeantach, ar aon talamh ar an oileán ach ní bhainfidh na cumhachtaí éigeantacha, áfach, le tailte áirithe fós i seilbh daoine a bhí ina gcónaí ann ar an seachtú lá déag de mhí na Samhna, míle naoi gcéad agus caoga trí, an dáta a tréigeadh an t-oileán, nó má tá na daoine sin ar shlí na fírinne anois, lena ngar-ghaolta.  Áireofar talamh na gCoiminsinéirí, agus talamh eile lena nglacfaidh siad seilbh faoin reachtaíocht seo, mar Pháirc Náisiúnta Stairiúil.</P>
    <P>Tá sé leagtha amach sa Bhille go mbeidh na coimisinéirí freagrach as an bPáirc Náisiúnta Stairiúil seo a chothabháil, a bhainistiú, a riaradh, a chaomhnú, a chosaint agus a fhorbairt ar mhaithe leis an bpobal mar pháirc ina mbeidh oidhreacht náisiúnta, cultúr, nósanna an oileáin agus a mhuintire caomhnaithe agus léirithe agus ina gcumhdófar a <Col N="1450" /> fhásra, a ainmhithe agus a radharcanna tíre.  Leagtar amach ann freisin dualgais na gCoimisinéirí i leith na páirce, ar a n-áirítear an pháirc a fhorbairt mar ionad cultúrtha, oideachais, scíthe agus caithimh aimsire; usáid na Gaeilge a fhorbairt agus a chaomhnú; fásra agus ainmhithe na páirce agus na bhfarraigí mór thimpeall air a chumhdú; na tithe traidisiúnta agus foirgnimh eile ar an oileán a chumhdú, nó a athchur agus a chaomhnú; agus roinnt dualgais chuí eile.  Beidh sé de chumacht ag na Coimisinéirí fodhlíthe a dhéanamh i ndáil le haire, bainistíocht, caomhnú, cosaint agus forbairt na páirce.</P>
    <P>Tá forálacha ann faoina bhféadfar cumhachtaí áirithe de chuid na gCoimisinéirí a thabhairt d'Fhondúireacht an Bhlascaoid Teoranta.  Tá sé beartaithe go ndáilfear ar an bhfondúireacht na cúraimí maidir le bainistíocht ghinearálta na páirce.  Sa tslí sin, beidh lámh iomlán ag an bpobal áitiúil maidir le caomhnú agus cosaint a dhéanamh ar an mhaoin luachmhar tábhachtach seo, gur leis an náisiún i gcoitinne í ar bhealach amháin, ach atá freisin mar chúram speisialta ar mhuintir Chorca Dhuibhne.</P>
    <P>Faoi na forálacha seo, déanfar den Bhlascaod Mór áit ina gcuirfear an cuairteoir i dteagmháil láithreach leis an oiread sin atá leath-dearmadtha anois ag ár saíocht Eorpach; beidh sé mar thimpeallacht ina leanfaidh borradh agus fás ar dhúlra chósta an Iarthair; agus mar leacht stairiúil d'éirim scríbhneoirí na mBlascaodaí agus do chrógacht agus do bhuanseasmhacht mhuintir an oileáin.</P>
    <P>Tá an Bille seo á chur os comhair an tSeanad agam ar an mbonn go bhfuil tacaíocht ar fáil dó ó na páirtithe uile. Tá tacaíocht ann don Bhille faoi mar a thagann sé os bhur gcomhair ó na Teachtaí agus Seanadóirí uile ó Ríocht Chiarraí a raibh lámh acu san ullmhúchán dó agus ó bhaill Fhondúireacht an Bhlascaoid.  Ba mhaith liom tréaslú le gach duine as an mbealach inar chomhoibrigh siad go fial san obair chun An Blascaod Mór a chaomhnú do no glúnta atá le teacht.  Tá mé cinnte go n-éireoidh leis an reachtaíocht seo na cuspóirí atá roimpi a bhaint amach agus ba mhaith liom cuireadh a thabhairt do phobail áitiúla i gceantair eile den tír <Col N="1451" /> ina bhféadfadh cás den chineál céanna bheith sa treis treacht ar aghaidh le moltái oiriúnacha a d'fhéadfaí a scrúdú.</P>
    <P>The Blaskets are a group of islands lying off the Dingle peninsula, County Kerry.  They are the most westerly part of Europe and combine great natural beauty and literary interest in an unique way.  The largest of the group is An Blascaod Mór, the Great Blasket, also called An t-Oilean Thiar, the Western Island.  It is over three miles long and comprises 1,132 acres.  It is three miles by sea from the mainland harbour at Dunquin to An Caladh, the landing place on the island.</P>
    <P>At its most numerous, the population of the Great Blasket was never more than about 200 people who lived on holdings of three or four acres, supplementing the livelihood to be obtained from the land by fishing, hunting for wild birds and occasional salvage.  The life of the islanders is vividly described by Tomás Ó Criomhthain in words quarried out of the depth of his own experience.</P>
    <P>Often we put out to sea in fair weather at dawn, and when we returned the people were keening for us, the day had turned out so foul.  Often we had to be out at night, and the misery of that kind of fishing cannot be described.  I count it the worst of all trades that ever I set hand or foot to: the rollers towering overhead and shutting out the sight of land; a long, cold night battling against heavy seas, and often with little profit, just praying from one moment to the next for the help of God.</P>
    <P>These harsh and often perilous conditions fostered in lucht an Oileáin, the island people, a deep sense of mutual interdependence and trust.  It also gave them a strong sense of communal identity.  The people of the Blasket Islands were a true community and in spite of the poverty in their lives, in many ways a model one. This island community was rich in tradition and folk custom.  Their way of life and means of earning a living from the soil and from the sea, provided a link <Col N="1452" /> with the immemorial past which is of incalculable interest and importance.</P>
    <P>The details of that way of life have fortunately been preserved for us by the many scholars, antiquarians, linguists and literary men such a John Millington Synge, Karl Marstrander, a Norwegian scholar whom the island people called &ldquo;an Lochlannach&rdquo;, the Viking, and Robin Flower whom they affectionately called Blátheen.  They went to the islands after the great revival of interest in the Irish language and all things Irish which took place in the latter half of the 19th century.  Most important of all, however, is the fact that island life has also been preserved for us in the unique writings of the islanders themselves.  One of the visiting scholars, Briain Ó Ceallaigh, is a figure of great importance, for it was he who encouraged the first and greatest of the Blasket writers Tomás Ó Criomhthain to commit his autobiography, his stories and his reflections to paper.  Another, George Thomson guided Muiris Ó Suilleabháin to write <i>Twenty Years Agrowing</i>.  Much later, Brendan Behan wrote a very beautiful poem about the deserted Blaskets.</P>
    <P>No comparable area of the world's surface, inhabited by such a small number of people, has been responsible for such an extraordinary flowering of literary genius.  Tomás Ó Criomhthain, Peig Sayers and Muiris Ó Suilleabháin all wrote works, the importance of which, as literary masterpieces, outweighs even their value as records of a life whose dignity and nobility transcended the harsh conditions in which it had to be lived.</P>
    <P>The work of these writers has done a great deal to keep modern writing in Irish in touch with the syntax and the modes of speech which it was natural for our ancestors to use; and also, it might be said to keep modern writing in English in touch with such modes.  Their work has, therefore, played a large part in the preservation of Irish as a living but traditional language and in keeping it in the mainstream even of our writing in English.</P>
    <P>Tomás Ó Criomhthain's book has been <Col N="1453" /> described as Homeric and so indeed it is, for, like Homer, he finds his poetry in the basic facts of an existence lived in harmony with the sea and the elements but often in peril from them; while no-one could read the closing pages from Peig Sayers book without being envious of the philosophical calm which the life they led gave the islanders.</P>
    <P>That way of life has but recently vanished and fortunately this beautiful island, whose field systems and surviving houses still reflect it, has not yet been despoiled.  But with the very welcome increase in tourism on the east coast and elsewhere, which is now at hand, its preservation has been imperilled.</P>
    <P>The Blaskets fascinate and enthral; they are a place of great and majestic natural beauty in an incomparable situation. They are also a vivid reminder of the life that many Irish people lived for countless generations.  An Blascaod Mór has become in recent years a place of pilgrimage for those who love the Irish language and the folklore of the west. The present Bill is designed to safeguard it for the future and to prevent any unwelcome development, to enchance its value and its interest for the visitor; and to preserve for future generations a place of great cultural value.</P>
    <P>Fondúireacht an Blascaoid was set up by the people of the area in 1986 to conserve and protect the island as a valuable part of our heritage.  Its establishment was, in my view, the most beneficial development since the island was evacuated in 1953.  It represented a clear indication by the local community of their wish to see this unique place properly protected and cared for.  It made this legislation possible.  Clearly, however, the resources needed and the difficulties to be overcome would be beyond the capacity of any private organisation to cope with and it seemed to those concerned that the only thing to do was for the State to acquire the island for the purposes of a National Historic Park and, in co-operation with the Fondúireacht, to ensure its orderly development.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it clear that the purpose of this legislation is not simply <Col N="1454" /> to prevent further deterioration of An Blascaod Mór.  Its overriding purpose is to restore the past and to provide, with great care and sensitivity, new facilities and amenities which will bring to it a new life to be enjoyed and savoured by the Irish public and visitors from abroad.</P>
    <P>The main provisions of the Bill are as follows: The Commissioners of Public Works will be authorised to acquire, by agreement or compulsorily, any land on the island except that in the case of certain lands still in the ownership of persons who lived on it on 17 November 1953, which is the date the island was evacuated, or where such persons are deceased, their close relatives, the Commissioners may acquire them by agreement only.  The Commissioner's land and other land acquired under this legislation will be designated a National Historic Park.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that this National Historic Park shall be maintained, managed, controlled, preserved, protected and developed by the Commissioners for the use and benefit of the public as a park in which the historic heritage, culture, traditions and values of the island and its inhabitants will be preserved and demonstrated and its flora, fauna and landscape will be protected.  It goes on to set out the duties of the Commissioners in tespect of the Park including fostering and promoting the use of the park as a place of culture, education, leisure and recreation; fostering and promoting the use of Irish; conserving the flora and fauna of the island and the surrounding seas; conserving or restoring and preserving the traditional dwellings and other buildings on the island and a number of other appropriate functions. The Commissioners will be empowered to make by-laws for the care, detailed management, preservation, protection and development of the park.</P>
    <P>There are provisions whereby certain powers of the Commissioners may be delegated to Fondúireacht an Bhlascaoid Teoranta.  The intention is that an Fondúireacht will be entrusted with the general management of the park.  In this way, the local community will be fully involved <Col N="1455" /> in the protection and preservation of a valuable and important asset which in one sense belongs to the nation but is very much the special responsibility of the people of Corca Duibhne.</P>
    <P>An Blascaod Mór will, under these provisions, become a place where the visitor will be brought into immediate contact with much that our European civilisation has half forgotten, a habitat in which the wild life of the western seaboard can continue to flourish and a historic monument to the genius of the Blasket writers and to the courage and tenacity of the people of the island.</P>
    <P>I am putting this Bill before the Seanad on the basis of all-party support.  The Bill, as it comes before the House has the support of all the Deputies and Senators from the Kingdom of Kerry who have been involved in its preparation and the members of Fondúireacht an Blascaod.  I would like to pay a tribute to all concerned for the generous and co-operative spirit in which they have approached the task of preserving An Blascaod Mór for future generations.  I am confident the legislation will succeed in achieving its objectives and I would like to issue an invitation to local communities in other areas of the country where a similar sort of situation may exist to come forward with suitable proposals which can be considered.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that the first Bill to be introduced into this restored Chamber should be introduced by the Taoiseach.  May I say how welcome, Taoiseach, you are here today?  I hope we will see you here many times during the course of this Parliament.  It is appropriate also that the Taoiseach should introduce the Bill because he as Taoiseach, has continued the practice of his immediate predecessor, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, in having significant numbers of important Bills brought first to this House.  This is a practice which all sides of this House welcome and one which I hope will develop even further. It is also appropriate that the Bill here <Col N="1456" /> today is a Gaeltacht Bill.  When the first Senators met in this Chamber 67 years ago one of their first proposals to the Government of the time was a scheme for the indexing, the citing and the publication of Irish manuscripts; also a scheme for the scientific investigation of living dialects and for the compiling and publication of an adequate dictionary in the Irish language.  This report in 1923 was to be the basis for the later establishment of the Irish Manuscripts Commission and the Irish Folklore Commission.  In these respects, the Bill before the House continues that work and I hope it will be as successful as the earlier proposals proved to be.</P>
      <P>We welcome with enthusiasm the main purpose behind this Bill.  The establishment and maintenance of a national historic park and An Blascaod Mór is an exciting idea, especially if it succeeds in its stated purpose of fostering and promoting the use of the park as a place of culture, education, leisure and recreation, if it creates an awareness of our heritage as typified by An Blascaod, if it helps to conserve and restore the traditonal buildings on the island, and if it helps to conserve the flora and fauna on the island and, of course, if it makes the island accessible and real to visiting students and tourists.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach so eloquently pointed out, the Blaskets have a very particular place in our history.  Because of the constraints of time I cannot, but I am sure some of my colleagues will, elaborate on the basis laid down by the Taoiseach in his exposition of the unique place of An Blascaod Mór in our history.  One person who in recent times has brought that tradition home to most of us was Muiris Mac Conghail whose film work on the Blaskets &mdash; a marvellous, wonderful film &mdash; has helped to put the Blaskets into the context of our history for many of the younger generation.  I hope his work will have an even wider audience after this Bill has been passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has been proposed in this Bill is good in itself and it could also be a very useful model, as the Taoiseach pointed out, for other such developments where <Col N="1457" /> they are appropriate, not least at a time when we are seeking to build up areas of specialisation which would attract further visitors to this country.</P>
    <P>While welcoming the general principle of this Bill, I have to air a number of concerns I have about the Bill.  First of all, while the Bill and the move behind it is a good one, it will, I am afraid, remain merely notional unless there is a clear and urgent commitment of resources to achieve its purposes.  Unless certain necessary ground work is tackled, then the Bill may become just another piece of well-intentioned Irish legislation which fails to achieve its purpose because it lacks the necessary back-up and follow-through support.  In this context I am worried by note 12 in the explanatory memorandum and financial statement which comes with this Bill.  Perhaps the Taoiseach, when concluding could clarify this point for me.  Note 12 says that it is not possible to quantify the Exchequer costs which the Bill will give rise to.  That strikes me as an unusual approach and I would like to know why it has been adopted.  I would have thought that by this stage those who prepared the legislation would have had some reasonable idea as to the amount of money which will be spent over whatever number of years to achieve the purpose of the Bill. The island, the area in question, is small. The amount of work to be done is not difficult to quantify so I find it strange that there is not attempt made to estimate the amount of public money which will be involved.  Is this because the Government are not sure what exactly needs to be done and the Bill at this stage is largely aspirational, or is it because there are some unresolved difficulties about the question of title or ownership of the land in question, or is it because there may be some costly legal battles ahead?  It is vital at this stage that this aspect of the Bill be spelled out in detail, that any doubts be dispelled straightaway and that we be brought into the picture if there are any possible upcoming legal difficulties.</P>
    <P>I said a few moments ago that there was a certain urgency about the work to be done.  The fact is that the old village <Col N="1458" /> is now in a bad state of disrepair and while An Fondúireacht will undoubtedly help its long term conservation, the problems at present are urgent especially as far as drainage and dry coursing are concerned. If action is not taken soon it may be too late for An Fondúireacht to do much of what this Bill intends it to do.  I am told that if we have a good summer, and let us all hope we have, much of the urgent work on the old village which needs to be done could be tackled straightaway by the Office of Public Works or by some contractors agreed by them.  This is something which needs to be looked at straightaway.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a preliminary archaeological survey of the village.  A plan needs to be produced of who lived where and when.  There is need for documentation of the inhabitants of the island. This is urgent because of memory slippage, because people are getting older and much valuable information may die with these people.  Again this is something which might well be tackled even before this Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>When the legislation is enacted there will be a need for proper hostel accommodation on the island.  There are times when the island is inaccessible.  There will also be students who will need long term accommodation on the island to carry out their work, so I would see this as a priority.  One other important need will be for a proper interpretative centre on the island and also on the mainland, because undoubtedly the richness of the Blasket tradition will be lost for many visitors unless there is a proper interpretative centre there to explain, to educate, to point out to people just what are the components of the culture of the island and what it stands for in the broad, historical context.  Such interpretative centres have been very successful in other areas.  I need only point to the excellent interpretative centre on Bull Island which has been such a success in explaining the nature of Bull Island and its attractions to countless thousands, especially young people, each year.</P>
    <P>To come back to the question of finances, I would recommend, and I am sure <Col N="1459" /> it would have our full support in this House, that the work intended in this Bill be made a priority for funding from the national lottery.  I think it goes without saying that the purposes of this Bill are those which certainly were intended in the National Lottery Act and I can see few more useful purposes under this heading to which the finances could be devoted.</P>
    <P>However, there is one cloud hanging over this legislation.  I would like to refer to an article in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> which brings into public focus a matter which I believe should have been resolved before this Bill was published. As I understand it and as published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> today, there is an allegation, a very serious allegation, that Mr. Taylor Collings, who is belived to be the owner of 17 of the 25 holdings on the island, and who has said that he would sell his stake to the Irish people for a nominal sum may not, in fact, be the owner of the 17 holdings and that the real owners are a Mr. Peter Callery, a Mr. Jim Callery and a Mrs Brooks who lives in the USA.  If this is the case, and from the inquiries I have made Mr. Callery is an eminently reputable and respected figure who would not make allegations lightly, then some serious questions emerge which I believe should be resolved as far as possible today or certainly before we reach Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I must first ask why these questions have arisen now, why they were not resolved before the Bill was finally drafted?  Kerry is a reasonably small place and surely these problems could have been spotted and brought to some sort of resolution before we reached this stage.  Why is it that these questions are only now surfacing publicly?  I have to ask if proper home work was done.  I have to ask if the section in the Bill which refers to acquisition by agreement was properly worked through, if every attempt was made to see that the proper legal homework was done to see if the land could be acquired by agreement <Col N="1460" /> rather than, as may now happen, by compulsion and again by possibly contentious compulsion?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>If Mr. Callery owns the land and if he does not wish to dispose of it after the passing of this Bill, on what basis would it be fair compulsorily to purchase 17 holdings while ignoring the remaining eight?  What is the difference between these 17 and the other eight which would change their status in law? In fact, on the basis of equity alone, it might be more appropriate to include the entire island as being open for compulsory purchase rather than to include just one part of it.  Every effort should be made between now and the Committee Stage to establish the full facts, to see that there is fair play all round and, most of all, that we do not end up with unconstitutional legislation on our hands, or that we do not end up with long delays while the courts process the various claims.  I am appalled that these problems are arising now after the Bill has been drafted, but it is not too late to resolve them.  I would hope that the time between now and Committee Stage can be used to have these matters discussed in a full, frank and open way to ensure that we do not have the sort of problems I have mentioned and to ensure that there is fair play all round.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Taoiseach that we will co-operate fully in seeking to resolve these problems if problems there are because we, as he said, support the principle of this Bill enthusiastically and we look forward with enthusiasm to the realisation of the aspirations contained in this Bill.</P>

Cuireann sé áthas ar leith orm go raibh sé ar chumas an Taoisigh agus Aire na Gaeltachta teacht inár láthair inniu chun tús a chur leis an díospóireacht ar an mBille stairiúil seo. Maidir le hathchóiriú an Tí seo, tá a fhios againn uile go raibh géarghá le hoibreacha feabhsúcháin, agus tá anchreidiúint ag dul do gach duine a raibh páirt acu san obair mhór seo.</P>
      <P>Mar Chathaoirleach ar an gComhchoiste Oireachtais don Ghaeilge fáiltím roimh an deascéal a bhí ag an gCathaoirleach mar gheall ar an gcóras aistriúcháin comhuaineach sa Teach seo. Iarraim ort, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, an cheist seo a scrúdú a luaithe agus is féidir, mar bheart an-phráinneach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is cúis áthais dom fáiltiú go fonnmhar roimh an mBille atá os ár gcomhair anseo inniu.  Mar fhear a rugadh agus a tógadh i gCorca Dhuibhne tá bród orm go bhfuil an chéim dhearfach seo á glacadh chun an Blascaod Mór a chaomhnú do na glúine atá le teacht.  Tá tábhacht thar cuimse leis an mBlascaod Mór ó thaobh na Gaeilge de, agus tá clú bainte amach ar fud an domhain ag an scríbhneoirí a raibh cónaí orthu ar an oileán &mdash; Tomás Ó Criomhthain, Peig Sayers agus Muiris Ó Súilleabháin go príomha.  Caithfear trácht a dhéanamh freisin ar na cuairteoirí cáiliúla a tháinig agus a scríobh faoin oileán, Robin Flower agus Seoirse Mac Thomáis ach go háirithe.  Tá sé mar phríomhchuspóir don Bhille seo go bhféadfar gabháltas áirithe ar an oilleán a cheannach go héigeantach lena fhorbairt mar Pháirc Náisiúnta Stairiúil.  Leis an mBille seo, áfach, beidh suaimhneas intinne ag muintir na háite, ó tharla nach mbeidh orthu siúd a gcuid talún a dhíol i gcoinne a dtola.  Ina theannta sin beidh sé mar chuspóirí oidhreacht an Bhlascaoid Mhóir a chaomhnú agus an áit a riaradh agus a chothú.  Beidh cúram iomlán ar Aire na Gaeltachta i gcomhar le hOifig na nOibreacha Poiblí amach anseo.  Ach feictear dom go bhféadfar cumhachtaí agus dualgas ina thaobh a leagan at Fhondúireacht an Bhlascaoid.  Is eagras fíorthábhachtach í an fhondúireacht, agus is cúis áthais dom go raibh an chumas an <Col N="1463" /> Chomhchoiste don Gheailge gach comhoibriú a bhféadfaimis a thabhairt dóibh. Thugamar éisteacht do ionadaithe ón gcoiste náisiúnta anseo i dTeach Laighean ar 3 Feabhra 1988, agus bhí sé de phribhléid againn bualadh le hionadaithe ón gcoiste áitiúil i nDún Chaoin ar 20 Bealtaine 1988.  Táan-chreidiúint ag dul don fhondúireacht as ucht na hoibre atá déanta acu.</P>
    <P>Bhí sí mar aidhm i gcónaí ag an bhfondúireacht go rithfí reachtaíocht chuí d'fhonn an Blascaod Mór a chaomhnú. Thóg sé tamall chun an reachtaíocht sin a ullmhú agus tá an Bille seo os ár gcomhair anois.  Gúim gach rath ar an mBille agus táim deimhin de go mbeidh tacaíocht le fáil dó ó gach taobh den Teach seo. Nuair a bhuail an Comhchoiste don Ghaeilge leis na hionadaithe ó Fhondúireacht an Bhlascaoid gheall na comhaltaí ó gach páirtí a gcuid tacaíochta d'aidhmeanna an eagrais sin.  Táimid céim eile ar aghaidh ar an mbóthar anois agus táim dóchasach go mbeidh an tácaíocht forleathan a taispéanadh roimhe seo ar fáil go flúirseach arís anois.</P>
    <P>It is a great privilege for me to address the House on this historic occasion when the refurbished Chamber is being reopened and when this important debate regarding the Great Blasket Island is taking place.  I am particularly pleased that the Taoiseach and Minister for the Gaeltacht is present for the debate on this important matter.</P>
    <P>Much work has been carried out in refurbishing this House.  I welcome the Cathaoirleach's statement that simultaneous translation equipment will be installed in this House at the end of the year.  It is on occasions such as this that an interpretation facility is very important.  I ask you arís, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, to look into the matter urgently.</P>
    <P>This is a very special occasion when we are discussing a Bill to provide for the establishment and maintenance of An Blascaod Mór as a national historic park. The history of this island goes back over many centuries and of all the Irish islands it is probably the best known.  The literary heritage of the island is probably unique <Col N="1464" /> in modern times.  As an tOileánach, Tomás Ó Criomhthain said, &ldquo;people such as those who lived on the island will not be seen again.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The initial discussion of this Bill today is probably the most important occasion in the life of An Blascaod Mór since it was evacuated by the last remaining inhabitants on 17 November 1953.  It can be said, of course, that with the introduction of this Bill a whole new lease of life awaits An Blascaod Mór as a national historic park.</P>
    <P>As chairman of the Joint Committee on the Irish Language I am pleased that we were able to give every possible assistance to the work of Fondúireacht an Bhlascaoid, the Blasket Islands Foundation. We met with the national committee of the foundation in Leinster House, in February 1988, and with a local committee in May 1988 in Dun Chaoin. At these meetings all-party support was expressed for the objectives of the foundation. I believe that such support will manifest itself again today in relation to this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us contains many important provisions.  The limited time available to me will not permit me to mention all of them.  One point which is vital is that the former islanders or descendants of islanders will be exempt from the provisions of the Bill relating to the compulsory acquisition of lands on the Great Blaskets.  This will be a source of great relief to these people because the fear of losing their property was the principal issue which was raised with the members of the Joint Committee.  This fear was not unreasonable and I am glad that the matter has been resolved satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar a dúirt mé cheana is trua go mór nach bhfuil níos mó ama ar fáil do Chomhaltaí an Tí inniu maidir leis an mBille seo, ach sin mar atá an scéal.  Ba mhaith liom deireadh a chur le mo phíosa cainte, mar sin, leis an sliocht seo a leanas as &ldquo;An tOileánach&rdquo; le Tomás Ó Criomhthain:</P>
    <P>Scríobhas go mionchruinn ar a lán dár gcúrsaí d'fhonn go mbeadh <Col N="1465" /> cuimhne i bpoll éigin orthu agus thugas iarracht ar mheon na ndaoine a bhí í mo thimpeall a cur síos chun go mbeadh a dtuairisc inár ndiaidh, mar ná beidh ár leithéidí arís ann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Beidh cuimhne againn go deo ar laocha an Bhlascaoid agus cuirfidh Páirc Náisiúnta Stairiúil An Bhlascaoid Mhóir lena gclú agus lena gcáil.  Molaim an Bille.</P>

      <P>It has been agreed that we share our time, and I intend sharing my time with Senators Ryan and Murphy, in that order, three minutes each.  Cuireann sé as dom go mór nach bhfuil córas aistriúcháin anseo inniu, mar cuireann sé isteach go mór orainne. B'fhearr linn labhairt trí Ghaeilge ach, we have to repeat everything in English. In all fairness we should have double the time to say it.  Nílimse sásta chun mé féin a chur, ar chaoi, faoi mhíbhuntáiste, agus mar gheall air sin táim chun an méid atá le rá agam a rá trí Bhéarla.</P>
      <P>It bothers me to have to do that.  In three minutes I am not prepared to lose so much time by saying every thing on the double.  It would be ungenerous to let this occasion go by without marking the Taoiseach's personal interest in the Blasket Islands and also to welcome the fact that he has chosen to introduce this legislation on this important day for the Seanad.  I welcome it.</P>
      <P>I welcome it not just as a fellow Senator from Corca Dhuibhne, as my colleague Senator Tom Fitzgerald also is, but as somebody who went to school and shared a class and, indeed, a desk with fellow classmates from the last generation of Blasket Islanders to be born on the island, as somebody who is obviously a native of Corca Dhuibhne, a regular visitor to the Blasket Islands a member of Fondúireacht na Blascaod and also an Oireachtas Member for the Kingdom, to which the Taoiseach referred in his speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also been a student of the literature and I have yet to find anybody who has been to the islands who has not become a lover of the islands, therefore, it is with a very clear, vested interest that <Col N="1466" /> I stand to support this Bill today.  I resent deeply interference, in the interests of private property, in the implementation of what is set out in this Bill.  It should be resisted.  It is not acceptable and it is an insult to the people of west Kerry.</P>
    <P>I want to make three simple, brief points on it.  First of all, we should record our thanks to Fondúireacht na Blascaoid. This has already been done by the Taoiseach. This group came together and the foundation was launched simultaneously in Dublin and Kerry in 1986, for the sake of the preservation of the Blasket Islands and who today must see the culmination of their efforts, with the support of all the parties and all the Members of this House.  The unique culture of the islands has been charted and is available to us in the literature of the islands, unique in the sense of people with a culture which was fast vanishing, which was changing from an underdeveloped culture into the 20th century, and the fact that it is recorded in their own language, by themselves, is unique.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the protection of the environment which will be included in this Bill.  The tourist value to a disadvantaged Gaeltacht area is very much appreciated.  The fact of bringing high value tourists into the area will be welcome. It is a progressive measure.  It is a measure for which the Government deserve credit and it is something that should have the support of everybody in Corca Dhuibhne.</P>

Bhíos féin ar dhuine de na patrúin i dtosach báire, cé gur beag a dheineas ina dhiaidh sin.  Tá an-áthas orm inniu go bhfuil a saothar cúitithe le muintir na fondúireachta. Bheidís molta dá mbeimis go léir inár dtost, agus níor dheineadar aon dá leath dá ndícheall le bliain nó dhó anuas.  Ag an bpointe seo, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, níl ach pointe amháin le déanamh agam.  Is é sin le rá, an imní a chuir an Seanadóir Manning in iúl.  Ba maith liomsa tagairt chomh maith do cheist a bhí ag Teachta Dála ar maidin.  Dhein Teachta Dála tagairt do dheacrachtaí Bunreachtúla a d'fhéadfadh a bheith ag baint leis an mBille.  Ba mhaith liom go míneodh an Taoiseach cad a bhí i gceist ansin.</P>
      <P>In welcoming the Bill I also welcome the principle of the State intervening to make a national park available.  I note with interest the Taoiseach's offer to encourage similar situations where circumstances warrant it in other communities. I now suggest to him as a member of the governing body of University College, Cork, that the State should also take over Fota and remove us from a great deal of acrimony because of the situation there.  It is an admirable principle that the State should be putting this historic island at our disposal.  I would like to adopt the old historic maxim of the land for the people and proclaim that we should have the islands for the people. The Taoiseach might not welcome that fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1468" /> The Irish language and culture and the physical and cultural beauty of the Blasket Islands should be available to all the people of Ireland.  One of the troubles with whole Gaelic revival was that it never meant anything to the urban working class in particular.  Will this Bill mean that ordinary working class families from Tallaght and from Gurranabraher will be able to savour the beauty of their birthright? Will they be able to stand on the top of the Blasket Island and view that magnificent landscape or will it continue to be the privilege of those of us who are in effect an elite?  The whole language and cultural movement has been ruined by this kind of elitism.  Senator Manning referred to financial difficulties.  I want to see a stage ahead, some kind of imaginative plan that will perhaps subsidise public transport or whatever, but let the people in the full sense of that word enter into their birthright.</P>

Go háirithe, ba mhaith liom moladh a thabhairt don spéis agus don tacaíocht atá léirithe ag an Taoiseach don smaoineamh seo gur cheart an Blascaod Mór a thoirbirt don náisiún.  Is iontach go deo an pháirt atá imeartha ag na Blascaodaí i saol cultúrtha na tíre le céad bliain anuas.  Is féidir a rá gur siombail ar dhúchas na hÉireann an cúinne clúiteach seo den tír.  Tá ceannródaíocht tugtha ag muintir an Bhlascaoid do scríbhneoirí na Gaeilge, agus tá an oidhreacht bhéaloidis chomh saibhir acu is go bhfuil scoláirí ag teacht ó chian is ó chóngar chucu de shíor.  Is dóibh, thar aon dream eile, atá an chreidiúint ag dul as a maireann den Ghaeilge i gCúige Mumhan agus i gcuid mhaith eile den tír.

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is indeed a great pleasure and privilege for me to have this opportunity of contributing to this debate on the Blasket <Col N="1469" /> Islands.  My interest in the Blaskets goes back for a long time.  Perhaps it is a curious thing to say, but this was mainly brought about by discovering, through the Roddy the Rover column in <i>The Irish Press</i>, that somebody called Robin Flower had written a marvellous book called the <i>Western Island</i>.  As soon as possible I bought the book and I was enthralled by the people and the places it described.  Incidentally, I still refer to and re-read this book with as great an interest as I did on the first day.  Furthermore, reading about the Blaskets contributed to the development in me of an interest in what Flower, on another occasion, called the Irish tradition.</P>
    <P>An Blascaod Mór is much greater than something that provides an interest for an individual.  It is the concern of all of us.  As the Bill states: &ldquo;The purpose of the Act is to provide for the establishment of a national historic park in the interests of the common good&rdquo;.  In view of the contributions that its people have made to Irish literature and to the Irish tradition generally, as well as its natural beauty, it is essential that contemporary and future Irish society will maintain it. It is unthinkable that the island should fall into the type of ownership that would exploit it in a manner totally alien to its background.  Accordingly, I am pleased that the Bill provides for the acquisition of lands by the Commissioners of Public Works.  Furthermore, it is likewise important that proper provision be made for the care, control and maintenance of the park.</P>
    <P>In this regard I welcome the provision which allows the making of by-laws to ensure that the park is adequately preserved and developed.  Regarding the latter, I trust that this will be done in a sensitive way in order to maintain the traditional character of the islands but having visited most of the national parks whch are under the care of the Commisioners of Public Works I am sure that they will do an excellent job, in co-operation with the foundation.</P>
    <P>I have studied with particular interest section 2, which states that the park will preserve and demonstrate the historic, <Col N="1470" /> heritage, culture, traditions and values of the island and that the Commissioners, in performing their functions, will, amongst other things, foster and promote the park as a place of culture and education, leisure and recreation.  There are other important functions, especially those which allow for the fostering and promotion of the Irish language, an awareness of and pride in the national heritage, culture, folklore and values of the island and its inhabitants.</P>
    <P>We need a genuine rejuvenation of our culture.  Centering such an event on a place like An Blascaod Mór is very sensible because in this instance we see most clearly the issues involved in planning our cultural future.  Too often in Ireland we regard different aspects of our social life as conflicting with each other.  Here again, the Blasket experience will, I believe, demonstrate that such things as the development of the local economy, of social infrastructure, tourism and the strengthening and retention of our language cross-fertilise and actually promote each other.  Cultural tourism will increase in importance in the immediate future and we must ensure that what we have to offer will reflect our respect for the intelligence and the sound judgment of our tourists.</P>
    <P>We have in many ways a unique cultural experience in Ireland in that the old world has lived on in the new.  For that reason a place like the Great Blasket is rightly regarded as one of the most important parts of Europe by those who seek the common European inheritance. This has long been recognised.  All the major cultural researchers who first visited the Blasket Islands, as the Taoiseach has already pointed out, came from abroad.  These were people such as Norwegian linguist, Marstrander, the Swedish folklorist, Von Sydow, the French scholar, Marie Sjoestedt and, of course, the Englishman, Robin Flower, whom I already mentioned.</P>
    <P>The international interest in the Blaskets continues.  Just last week yet another translation of <i>An tOileanach</i> was published in Switzerland.  This international interest is of great significance <Col N="1471" /> but of greater importance is the fact that the Irish people themselves rely to a considerable extent on that area of west Kerry, of which the Blaskets form a part, for the preservation of our own language and culture.  Tomás O Criomhthain, Peig Sayers, Muiris Ó Suilleabháin and others are household names in Ireland, while the folklore heritage of the island has been described by scholars, such as Professor Bo Almquist, as being of extraordinary richness in a European, indeed in a worldwide, context.  Unfortunately, most of this remains as yet unpublished, so there may well be another <i>An tOileanach</i> hidden amongst it.</P>
    <P>The literary and related works of the Blasket islanders bear important witness to the local sense of <i>piatas</i> which, in other countries, has been creatively expressed by writers such as the Russian, Maxim Gorki or the American, Walt Whitman. As was the case with, say, Tomás Ó Criomhthain, they too were celebrating the essence of the human spirit as manifest in the lives of the ordinary people.</P>
    <P>On a broader front, one can regard An Blascaod Mór as one of the chief fountainheads of our current civilisation, but this park must not be looked upon as a park of remembrance to a vanished community and way of life.  &ldquo;Ní bheidh ar leithéidí arís ann&rdquo;, a duirt Tomás Ó Criomhthain, ach cinntimis leis an mBille seo go mbeidh leithéid an chultúir seo beo, go brách na breithe.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say at the outset that my party support this Bill and we will do everything in our power to ensure that it becomes law as quickly as possible.  I feel sure, from listening to other Members of the House, that all of us will give this Bill the very same support.  The public, who will be able to watch the highlights of this discussion in the House today, might find it unusual that there is such a level of unanimity about a Bill before us.  They can rest assured that such unanimity is the exception rather than the rule.  There will be many occasions in the future, as there have been in the past, when we will find ourselves in sharp disagreement with the Government of the day.  It is perhaps fitting that we should discuss and find agreement on a Bill which is designed to enhance our commitment to an important part of our heritage.  The occasion on which we are gathered is just such an occasion.  The room in which we are meeting, now magnificently restored, represents an important part of our political, social, historical and architectural heritage.  It is a source of great pride that the magnificent restoration of this room <Col N="1473" /> and this portion of Leinster House was carried out entirely by the public service. Perhaps the next time Senators might be inclined to pass snide remarks about the Office of Public Works, or the public service generally, they might reflect on the tradition of quality and craftsmanship which they so brilliantly exemplified in this Chamber.  I said at the outset that we welcomed this legislation and we will support it in principle.  In a way it is overdue legislation.  It was the leader of my own party, Deputy Dick Spring, a TD for the Kingdom, Tánaiste in the last Government, who initially welcomed the establishment of the Blasket Island foundation of which he is a patron.  In a statement issued on 4 December 1986 Deputy Spring said:</P>
    <P>This foundation and the work it is endeavouring to achieve is of vital importance as part of our heritage.  In terms of architectural, archaeological, cultural, historical and literary importance of our nation the Blaskets are unparalleled.</P>
    <P>He went on the express the hope that with the support of all other political parties, which has been referred to by the Taoiseach, the objectives of this foundation could be achieved.  Those objectives as spelled out when the foundation was launched in the same month, December 1986, are basically as follows: (1) To properly protect the island by having it designated as a national historic park; (2) To restore in its original form the village on the island so that people can live in the houses and sample the way of life and way of survival of a time now gone; (3) To have an interpretative centre in Dunquin which will introduce visitors to the literature and culture of the islands, attract scholars and students and to provide safe and easy access to the island.</P>
    <P>It can readily be seen that the powers in the Bill before us are essential to the achievement of these objectives.  It is unarguable that these objectives are worthwhile.  All Members in this House know how central a figure Peig Sayers is in our literary culture.  For most of us she represents one of the great images of <Col N="1474" /> our childhood.  The way of life that Peig Sayers represented is very much a part of all of us.  To allow that memory, that integral part of our cultural heritage, to wither and die would be a disaster, indeed a tragedy.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome too, for a different reason.  It is a positive measure.  Our culture and traditions form an essential and vital part of our overall environment, an environment which serves the needs of all our people, and it cannot be achieved without planning.  The present system of planning in our society was established to minimise the private abuse and exploitation of physical environment.  It cannot by its very nature and form of establishment positively ensure that the physical resources of the environment are managed and developed for the benefit of all the community.  The absence of positive planning in our society has resulted in massive surburban sprawl around our major towns and cities with the consequent decline and running down of the inner city areas.  This suburban sprawl is frequently ugly, badly serviced with community facilities, unevenly developed and totally without an efficient system of public transport.  Dublin, Cork and Limerick have been especially badly effected by this form of planning.</P>
    <P>The local authority of which I am a member have only one power through their development plans to determine where development should not take place.  They have no power to ensure that development occurs in any given area in an orderly fashion.  At the same time they are statutorily obliged to provide a range of services within their functional area. This results in the local authorities, acting on behalf of the community, being forced to respond to unco-ordinated and often contradictory proposals from private developers.  The result is an uneven and unbalanced development in our environment. In addition, the scarce capital investment funds of the developer are frequently wasted through delays and duplication.  Much of the development capital for urban expansion comes directly from the State and pension funds to which many employees contribute.  In <Col N="1475" /> addition, the State and semi-State sector of the economy are the largest consumers of new office accommodation which is built within our society.  Although the community provides the bulk of the capital used for urban development, either directly through the State or building societies and these pension funds, it has only a passive or negative role in physicial planning.  This is not a healthy situation. It benefits the quick profit speculator at the expense of the development company or the house builder.  Our population is currently growing faster than any other in Western Europe.  In addition, we are still urbanising.  Given this pressure of growth, the environment is now at risk from potential damaging development.</P>
    <P>In addition, because of our social system and inadequate planning machinery, our community is at full risk from unscrupulous developers concerned only with exploiting community needs for their positive private gain.  This type of planning determines not just the shape of our citizen towns, it also affects the development and protection of our heritage. To that extent part of the importance of this Bill lies in the fact that it sets out to achieve a number of positive objectives.  Its aim is not to prevent things from happening but to make them happen.  We believe in this type of model and if it were followed in relation to our planning system generally, the result would be a very positive one for the overall environment.</P>
    <P>I must sound two notes of caution.  The first concerns resources which have been referred to by Senator Manning.  The powers in this Bill are not enough of themselves to generate the development of the Great Blasket Islands that we all want to see at a time when the principal feature of our public capital programme is cutback after cutback and when Office of Public Works projects all around the country are held up for lack of funds.  I do not want to participate in an exercise that turns out to be frivolous and just a charade.  We will expect to see development of this project; we will not be content simply to pass this Bill and then allow <Col N="1476" /> the whole idea to stagnate for lack of funds.  I can assure the Taoiseach that my party leader will be keeping an active eye on him as he is, of course, positioned to do, being a Kerryman.  We will in particular want to be assured that the foundation collects private money for the purposes of this development and that such private money will not mean that any control passes from the foundation itself.  We want to see the island developed in the interests of all the people and not for any elitist reasons.</P>
    <P>My second and final reservation concerns the possibility of the constitutional action which has been referred to.  It is clear from a first reading of this Bill that the people who drafted it had the Constitution and its provisions relating to private property in the forefront of their minds.  I hope that the phrase &ldquo;in the interest of the common good&rdquo; in the Bill will be what will finally determine the outcome of any court case.  I suggest that the Seanad would recommend to the President before signing the Bill that he would submit it for opinion on its constitutionality.</P>
    <P>It is worthy of note and praise that the Taoiseach has seen fit to bring this Bill to the House.  We all know that he has more than a passing interest in the preservation and development of the Blaskets in the interests of the people.  Perhaps the day will come when he will see his way to make a small gift to the foundation and put it in the position of being able to develop the island of Inishvickillane as a historical monument.</P>

      <P>Is óg i mo shaol dom a chualas trácht den chéad uair ar an triúr scríbhneoirí móra sin, Peig Sayers, Tomás Ó Criomhthain agus Muiris Ó Suilleabháin, a tháinig ar an saol ar oileán beag amach ó Cheann Slé, i bhfad siar ó Loch álainn Léin.  Is beag duine de mo ghlúin nár chuala trácht ar na saothair a scríobh siad, &ldquo;Peig&rdquo;, &ldquo;An tOileánach&rdquo;<Col N="1477" /> agus &ldquo;Fiche Blian Ag Fás&rdquo;.  Dúirt Tomás Ó Criomhthain, &ldquo;Ní bheidh ár leithéidí arís ann,&rdquo; agus b'fhíor dó.  Tréigheadh an t-oileán sa bhliain 1953 agus tháinig a mhuintir amach chun na míntíre.  Is cúis áthais dom go mbeimid in ann cuid de na cuimhní is fearr ar shaol na n-oileánach a chaomhnú leis an mBille seo, agus go mbeidh fáil ag aos óg ár dtíre ar chuid fhíorthábhachtach dár n-oidhreacht chultúir agus teanga.

The fact that I come from the centre of and was bred in the heart of Dublin does not in any way detract from the great love I have of my Gaelic heritage.  The Irish language and the places in which it is spoken are an integral part of my heritage.  For that reason I heartily welcome the Blasket Island Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very young when I first heard of those three great writers, Peig Sayers, Tomas Ó Criomhthain, and Muiris Ó Suilleabháin who were born and bred on a small island out from Slea Head to the far west of the famed beautiful Lakes of <Col N="1478" /> Killarney.  There were few people of my generation who never heard of the works they wrote.  <i>Peig, The Islandman</i> and <i>Twenty Years Agrowing</i>.  Tomás Ó Criomhtain siad &ldquo;you will never see their likes again&rdquo;.  Alas, this was all too true. The island was deserted in 1953 and its people came to live on the mainland.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that we will now be able to preserve some of the best memories of their way of life throughout this Bill and that our young people will have available to them a very important part of their cultural and linguistic heritage.  Nor ought we to forget that this heritage is still alive in our midst, especially on the mainland opposite the Blaskets.  There the Islandman's nephew, Padraig O'Maolain, writes creative works in Irish.  He edited a full edition of his uncle's work, the <i>Islandman</i>, some time ago and more recently Fr. Padraig Ó Fiannachta, editor of the Irish language bible, published a new edition of <i>Twenty Years Agrowing.</i></P>
    <P>The young poets from the Dingle Peninsula are too numerous to mention.  I trust that this new venture will help the people of Ireland, especially our young people, to get to know the language, the island lore and the flora and fauna still to be found there.  I would like to praise in particular the Taoiseach and the Office of Public Works for their enthusiasm in undertaking this project.  I look forward to visiting the Blasket when it is ready and like the Taoiseach, I, too, will be a Blasket man.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome An Blascaod Mór National Historic Park Bill, the purpose of which is to provide for the establishment and maintenance of the main Blasket Island as a national historic park.  This Bill provides the Commissioner of Public Works with the power to acquire the land by way of agreement or compulsorily but I hope it will be by agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will enable certain lands on the Great Blasket Island to be acquired for the nation as a national park, its historic heritage, culture, traditions and values will be preserved and its flora and <Col N="1479" /> fauna and landscape protected.  We are very lucky to have several different types of national parks which depict all types of our heritage.  Our national park in Killarney is rated second in the world.  It has mountains, lakes, trees and shrubs and it is a most picturesque national park. In that national park we have the native red deer, sika deer and pure-bred Kerry cows.  There is a national park in Glenveagh with 23,000 acres where there is a beautifully preserved castle and deer. Letterfrack is typical of Connemara and has a lot of pure-bred Irish Connemara ponies.  I had the privilege of opening Letterfrack and we have the nucleus of a national park in the Burren in County Clare.  There we have very peculiar rock formations with flowers growing between them.  It is one of the finest sights in the world.  Now we are adding to our national parks by having an island national park. Selecting the great Blasket Island as a national historic park was a tremendous choice because it is a great example of the islands round our coast.  It is steeped in tradition, history and folklore.  It has produced some of Ireland's best known authors and is well known in the literary world.  Some of the best known authors who were born on the island were Muiris Ó Suilleabháin who wrote <i>Fiche Blian as Fás</i> and Tomás Ó Criomhthain who wrote <i>An tOileanach.</i></P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that <i>An tOileanach</i> was translated into several different languages.  It was launched recently in Switzerland and is to be launched in the very near future in Paris in the French language.  This is a tremendous boost for our country, especially for the Blasket Islands and the man who wrote <i>An tOileanach</i>.  All the writers who wrote about the island spoke of their admiration for the island and this can be seen in their literature.  Any island consisting of 1,100 acres, which produced so many authors and had so many writers describing it must be unique.  It is right and fitting that we make it a national park.  The island was occupied and had 25 holdings &mdash; all the people living in a <Col N="1480" /> quarter of the island &mdash; which were owned by them.</P>
    <P>The amazing thing about the island, which probably many people do not know, is that three-quarters of it was a commonage and because of that the 25 people who had the holdings in a quarter of the island had the privilege of grazing rights on it.  To me, a Kerryman, this is a unique and peculiar system of dividing an island.  One would think that this would lead to disagreement and rows but it did not as the people who lived on the island were very passive.  It is said that there was hardly any intoxicating drink taken there.  The island is three miles long and has 1,100 acres.  Seventeen of the 25 holdings are owned by Taylor Collings. One holding is owned by the Office of Public Works and I had the privilege of being in the Office of Public Works as a Minister of State when that holding was acquired.  One holding is owned by St. Brendan's Trust in Kerry and six owned locally.</P>
    <P>Eighty-four of the people who lived on the island are still alive, 46 of those are living in America and living in Hungry Hill.  It is called the West Kerry Centre. All are attached to the John Boyle O'Reilly club in America.  Michael Kearney is manager of that club and he is a west Kerryman.  The people who lived on the island did mixed farming.  They kept a few cows and sheep but their main industry was fishing.  Around the island is a great breeding place for seals and the flora and fauna are tremendous.</P>
    <P>It should be the aim of the Office of Public Works to create an historic national park for the recreation and enjoyment of the people.  The promotion of the Irish language and culture would be aided by an interpretative centre which would show the history and culture of the island and the community which inhabited it.  The preservation and cultivation of various species of animal, plant and marine life in and around the island, together with the development and restoration of traditional dwellinghouses and other structures on the island, should receive the attention of the Office of Public Works.  Attention should <Col N="1481" /> also be given to the development and maintenance of the landing facilities on the island and on the mainland which are not good at present.  This country and its people, especially the Office of Public Works, should be very grateful to the officers and staff of the planning section of Kerry County Council who photographed all the ruins of the old houses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have agreed to share my time with Senator Fennell and Senator Robb.  I welcome the Taoiseach to the Seanad on this unique occasion.  The Blasket Islands have a long and unique history. In 1586 the Blasket Islands were granted by the Earl of Desmond to a family by the name of Ferriter.  They did not stay with that family very long, they were seized by the Crown in the same year because a member of the family joined in a rebellion led by that nobleman. In 1586 they were granted, with other possessions, to George Stone and Cornelius Chapman.  Afterwards they were purchased by Sir Robert Boyle.  At that time the Blaskets had ten families living on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1588, during the time of the Spanish Armada, many lives were lost off the Blasket Islands.  There are several references to the Blasket Islands by writers <Col N="1482" /> and travellers which have given the islands uniqueness and this has been mentioned by a number of speakers here today.  The census of 1841 showed that there were about 153 people living in 28 houses on Blascaod Mór.  By 1911 that had risen to 160 people and 29 houses were occupied.  It is interesting to note that these houses and sites are exactly known today because at that time they were recorded by the Congested District Board.  I am most thankful to them for recording that information.</P>
    <P>After the First World War the number of inhabitants on the island began to drop with increasing rapidity and the final 22 families were removed to the mainland in 1953.  The Great Blasket Island is a place of great natural beauty and unique historical interest.  On both these counts it deserves special attention.  In the past, it faced two dangers.  One was the pressure from all over Europe to find remote holiday homes and once private ownership was established the general public would probably be excluded or made unwelcome.  The second danger was that access to the island might be removed. By presenting this Bill to the House today both these dangers are removed.  For that reason, I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <P>I was also glad to note in the Taoiseach's speech that the legislation does not just provide for preserving or preventing further deterioration of the island but also provides for the creation, with great care and sensitivity, facilities on the island.  I support Senator Manning's view that an interpretative centre on the island is of utmost importance.</P>
    <P>Finally, I hope that the legal difficulties mentioned can be overcome and that the necessary finance will be made available by the State to the Commissioners of Public Works to carry out the conditions set out in the Bill, as that is most important. I hope they will be able to carry out the Bills' intentions and expedite them in the same way as they did in carrying out the refurbishment of this Chamber.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome the Taoiseach here to this House and thank him for introducing the Bill on this important day.  To read Peig Sayers and to become engrossed in her splendid world of island life, its joys and simple pleasures, tragedies and privations, leaves one with a sort of craving to see the Blasket Islands and particularly Blascaod Mór.  To stand there with the winds blowing in from the Atlantic, to identify the homes she spoke of and to see the strand from which the islanders gathered wreckage and discarded cargo, is to be struck with a great sense of history and a sense of past culture. To visit the Blascaod Mór is a spiritual experience.  It is a splendid place which can give back a great ingredient to our over-stressed society.  It is almost as if the energies, love and the pride with which that society was invested for many years can now pay back dividends to a culturally more impoverished Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many of us the Blaskets have long held a unique place in Irish history and culture.  They are a place of unmistakeable beauty and tranquility, representing an unspoilt part of Ireland, untainted by some of the raw features of modern commercialism.  However, their importance transcends their mere physical beauty.  To many, they represent a symbol of the formal lifestyle which was <Col N="1484" /> poor in a material sense but abounded in cultural riches.</P>
    <P>The works of Peig Sayers, Muiris Ó Suilleabháin and Tomás Ó Criomhthain have left us with graphic and heartfelt accounts of the realities, traditions, hardships and joys of the way of the way of life of the Blasket people.  To read their books and to visit the island subsequently was for me a very enlightening experience, both in terms of identifying the physical features of the island and catching a hint of the spirit of the unique life of the former inhabitants of the Blascaod Mór. In Ireland we have always had a zealous and sentimental longing for the past, zealous in so far as there is a tendency to place a higher importance on that which has gone rather than on that which remains.  Appreciation of the past is essential to the well being of any civilised society.  However, this appreciation should not blind us to inaction on contemporary shortcomings.  It is no use attempting to commemorate the memory of the Blaskets unless we also endeavour to ensure that the present day islanders, living similarly unique lifestyles in the remaining inhabited islands throughout the State, do not suffer the same fate.</P>
    <P>The State should adopt a coherent policy, not only for the preservation of the memory of the Blaskets, but also for the preservation of the present islands, such as Tory, Inish Mór, Inismaan, Inisbofin, Aran Mór, Clare Island and Bere Island.  Failure to provide adequate pier facilities and regular means of transport in passengers and freight traffic can sound, and is sounding, the death knell for many of these remaining island communities.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and hope that it will focus attention on the desire of many to preserve the Blascaod Mór as a national historic park.  It is necessary to prevent such unique islands becoming the sole preserve of private landlords.  However, I hope that the level of interest in the Bill will focus the attention of all politicians on the need to protect the remaining unique communities around our coast. Unless firm action is taken now this House could perhaps be reminiscing about <Col N="1485" /> the uniqueness of the Aran Islands in 30 years' time.</P>
    <P>I welcome the involvement of the Commissioners for Public Works in this Bill.  Their professionalism and dedication has been proven yet again in the final restoration of this House and I have no doubt that the same level of commitment will be evident in their involvement with the Blascaod Mór National Historic Park.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>My thanks to Senator Doyle.  Two minutes for two points, a Chathaoirligh.  By way of introduction, I belong to the Viking surgeons who meet annually on island communities from as far as the north of Iceland down to the south of Spain.  Therefore, I do have some feeling for these island communities. The island communities represent today something we have lost but also something which we very much need if we are to restore health to the type of existence which we have in this super-technology society.  I would just like to take the opportunity of emphasising the points which Senator Murphy and Senator O'Toole made.  The first is that this adventure should not be an exercise in elitism, that it must penetrate to the people throughout Ireland, both North and South, that we must try to interest the schools and the trade union movement &mdash; if I may throw it back to Senator O'Toole &mdash; in it to try to introduce into the curricula the concept of islands and what islands stand for.  We should do everything in our power, therefore, to encourage Irish young people, Irish working people and Irish children to take an interest in their heritage through what these island communities mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I would make is to take up the point in relation to land conflict. There is a great conflict among Irishmen today in relation to the use of land as a form of currency for speculation and the use of land and what it represents to us in relation to our history, our forebears and our own good health.  I do hope, therefore, that this may prove to be a prototype in how we will begin to look as the year 1992 approaches and <Col N="1486" /> as to how Irish land, particularly Irish community land, will be used.  It should not be for rich Europeans with entrepreneurial flair; it should be for people to learn, to love and to relate to &mdash; the land of their birth.</P>
    <P>Finally, on this day seven years ago, An Taoiseach and you, a Chathaoirligh, very graciously welcomed me, along with Senator Séamus Mallon, to this Chamber. I would, therefore, like very much to join with other Senators in what they have said in regard to how pleased we are to see an Taoiseach return to his state of health and to be with us here today.</P>

      <P>Nach iontach an scéal inniu againn é, i dTeach athchóirithe an tSeanaid den chéad uair dúinn, gur ar an mBlascaod atáimíd ag cuimhneamh agus an Bille um Pairc Náisiúnta Stairiúil an Bhlascaoid Mhóir á phlé againn.</P>
      <P>Níl tuairim agam cad a déarfaidh Tomás Criomhthain nó Peig Sayers má tá siad ag éisteacht linn, agus is dóigh go bhfuil cluas orthu.  Is cinnte gur thuig siadsan go maith gur bhain tábhacht ar leith leis an gcineál saoil a chaithidís san oileán.  D'fhéachadar chuige, agus níor gan dua é, go mbeadh cuntais ar an saol sin ina ndiaidh.  Agus aithníonn an Bille seo gur bhain tábhacht leis.</P>
      <P>Is ceann de na hathruithe is mó dár tháinig lem linnse an tuiscint atá anois ag an bpobal gá an-mhór a bheith lenár n-oidhreacht a chaomhnú, is cuma cé acu fiashaol nó foirgneamh nó portach nó dreach tíre nó teanga is cultúr atá i gceist.</P>
      <P>Gan amhras tá go leor i gceist sa Bhlascaod ach braithim gurb í an oidhreacht teanga is cultúir an ghné is mó tábhacht. Thóg an Ghaeilge ina ceann é, mar a dearfá, gur sna háiteanna is iargúlta agus is áille a mhairfeadh sí beo.  Ach bhí na háiteanna céanna sin aistreánach, nuair nach raibh caranna, ní áirím heileacaptair, mar bhí sé deacair teacht orthu.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Miorúilt ab é gur éirigh le scoláirí, scríbhneoirí, agus bailitheoirí béaloidis an Blascaod a bhaint amach díreach nuair a bhí an áit lán den óige, den mheidhir agus den gháire, agus le linn do dhaoine <Col N="1487" /> a bheith thuas a raibh seilbh iomlán a n-oidhreachta teanga agus seanchais acu. Bhí spiorad ar leith ann san am, ní foláir, nuair a spreagadh pobal chomh beag sin chun an oiread sin de leabhair bhreátha a fhágáil le huacht againn.  Ceisteanna a rith liom féin go minic: dá bhfanadh Peig san áit ar saolaíodh í, ar an mhórthir, an scríobhfadh sí na leabhair úd?  Arbh é spiorad an oileáin a thiomáin i mbun pinn í?</P>
    <P>Is maith liomsa, ach go háirithe, gurb é an Taoiseach féin atá ag tabhairt an Bhille seo os ár gcomhair.  Is eol don saol mór go bhfuil eolas aige agus cion ar leith aige ar an mBlascaod.  Ní foláir agus é ag seoltóireacht i bhfarraigí an cheantair gur minic a chuimhníodh sé ar an bhfile Seán Ó Duinnshlé agus ar &ldquo;Beauty deas an Oileáin&rdquo;, an naomhóg len ar bhain criú an oileáin an rás i gCuan Fionntrá fadó.</P>
    <P>Tá fhios ag an Taoiseach nach é an chéad Jackeen ó thuaisceart Bhaile Átha Cliath é a thug taitneamh don áit.  Daichead bliain ó shin i bpríosún Mountjoy, thar a bhfuil d'áiteanna ar domhan, scríobh Breandán Ó Beachán a dhán &ldquo;Jackeen ag caoineadh na mBlascaod&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Beidh an fharraige mhór fé luí na gréine mar ghloine Gan bád fé sheol, ná comhartha beo ó dhuine Ach an t-iolar órtha deireanach thuas ar imeall.  An domhain, thar an mBlascaod uaigneach luite&rdquo;.  Sa dán sin labhraíonn an Beachánach ar &ldquo;thithe scriosta brúite folamh fé thost&rdquo;.  Bhí fhios cheana féin gur ghairid eile a bheadh pobal san oileán.  Bhí an scoil dúnta le seacht mbliana um an dtaca seo.  Ní raibh riamh sagart ná seipéal ann.  Bhain dua mór le gach rud, le cleamhnais, le géarchéimeanna tinnis, le socraidí féin.  Tá sé íoróineach gur fearr go mór a bheidh an córas taistil do thurasóirí ann amach anseo.</P>
    <P>Pé cumha atá orainn i dtaobh deireadh a theacht leis an saol sin níorbh fhéidir linn ligint don mhaoithneas a thabhairt orainn gurbh fhéidir le pobal fanacht ann, an uair sin ach go háirithe, nuair a bhi rogha acu le déanamh.  B'í ainnise an tsaoil a thiomáin a sinsir amach ansin an chéad lá.  Agus bhí an t-ádh ar an bpobal sin i mbliain a caoga trí go raibh pobal a bhí <Col N="1488" /> gaolmhar leo ar an dtaobh eile den chaolas farraige agus go mbeadh radhrac ag na hiar-Bhlascaodaigh agus ag a gclann ina ndiaidh gach lá dá dtagann ar a n-áit dhúchais.</P>
    <P>Tá áthas orm gurb é an Taoiseach atá in éineacht linn inniu, mar a dúras, ach ní toisc gurb é an Taoiseach é ná toisc dubhspéis a bheith aige sa Bhlascaod agus i gCorca Dhuibhne, ach toisc gurb é Aire na Gaeltachta é.</P>
    <P>Is léir gur sórt musaem den scoth amuigh fen spéir, már a déarfá, a bheidh sa Bhlascaod feasta.  Ach gairid go maith dó, ar an mhórthír, fanann an teanga, agus an cultúr atá an teanga sin a iompar, beo beathaíoch.  B'fhéidir gur thragóid é tréigean na mBlascaod.  Ach ba mhórthragóid é gan amhras tréigean na teanga sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Tá oileáin eile agus sí an Ghaeilge gnáth-theanga na bpobal iontu go fóill, oileáin atá buailte suas le ceantair Ghaeltachta ar an mhór-thír.  Féachaimis chuige in ainm Dé nach í an chríoch chéanna a bhéarfaidh orthusan agus nach páirceanna náisiúnta a bheidh iontusan freisin ag deireadh thiar.</P>
    <P>Táim cinnte lándeimhnitheach de gur chun tairbhe phobal Chorca Dhuibhne a rachaidh an fiontar nua seo agus go mbeidh Páirc Náisiúnta an Bhlascaoid Mhóir ina comhartha go maireann beo go fóill teanga, agus dá n-abrainn é, meanma an Bhlascaoid.</P>
    <P>I should like to express my delight at the introduction of this Bill.  What is now being contemplated is a credit not only to the Taoiseach but to those people throughout Ireland who contributed money and hard work to bring nearer that day when this national park will be a reality.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that on the day we repossess this tastefully refurbished Chamber that a non-controversial but wholly necessary Bill should be introduced. Much of it deals, after all, with conservation.  With the Blasket up for sale it was difficult to guess what sort of development would take place or might take place.  No matter what restrictions were possible within our planning laws and procedures, the fact remains that it is difficult to control the kind of change <Col N="1489" /> which may simply be vulgar or inappropriate. It might have been difficult, for instance, in the case of An Blascaod Mór to ensure that the public would have access.</P>
    <P>An Blascaod is indeed a place of special interest to the public.  Flora, fauna and landscape are mentioned in the Bill.  The restoration of traditional buildings is mentioned.  These are tangible things. But behind the word &ldquo;historic&rdquo; in the Bill's Title and behind words like &ldquo;culture&rdquo; and &ldquo;values&rdquo; in the text, the Taoiseach, as he has said, has many other aspects of the island's heritage in mind. The Taoiseach also mentioned the great amount of lore and story recorded by collectors such as Dr. Seosamh O Dálaigh; the connections with scholars such as Marstrander, Flower, Thompson and Jackson; associations with either the lives or works of poets and writers such a Piaras Feirtéar, Synge, An Seabhac, Breandán Ó Beacháin, Pádraig Ó Maoileoin.  But, above all, he will have had in mind the island's writers: Tomás Ó Criomhthain, Peig and her son, Mike, Muiris Ó Súilleabháin and the others who have contributed to what has become known as &ldquo;The Blasket Island Library&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As there is an educational side to this venture I must mention one aspect of life on the island which these writers did not neglect and which should not be neglected now, and that aspect is the hardship which the islanders had to suffer.  Accidents, ailments, the birth of children could easily become matters of stress and emergency for them because of rough seas.  There was hardship, too, in the island's dependence on nature.  I know a small amount about it: once, for my sins, I was left marooned on the Blasket, not by the Dúnchaoin men but by somebody else, and the Valentia lifeboat took me off that island after five days.  It was not all hardship, of course, for those people.  I remember reading in one of Sheáin Uí Chearna's books that when the fine day came the islanders could easily forget the other 12 days of hardship.  Fine weather made the island a paradise.</P>
    <P>But we should not forget that hardship <Col N="1490" /> nor should we feel now that the uninhabited island must be some kind of perpetual reproach to us, as the Deserted Village quite properly was and is.  The inevitable end of the island community came slowly after a steady decline in the population.  It is clear that the islanders themselves felt that there was no future. Those who were eventually evacuated were resettled among neighbours, one could almost say, with whom they had ties of kinship and common interest; and they had sight of their native place every day.  They moved from one part of the parish to another.  I would not wish, of course, to make little of the sense of trauma they must have had.</P>
    <P>At this distance, from that sad event it gives some satisfaction to reflect that the first arrival of scholars and writers was at a time of great liveliness on the island.  It was the interest the scholars showed in the language and culture of an Blascaod Mór that brought into the world those literary classics of which we are all so proud.</P>
    <P>It is of no small importance, too, that the Taoiseach who is presenting this Bill happens also to be Minister for the Gaeltacht. Just because it is uninhabited, it could be all too easily overlooked that An Blascaod Mór is very much a part of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>A national park in the place once the home of so many is a reminder to us that the Gaeltacht generally is particularly vulnerable in a time of change and of economic pressures.  Without a thriving Gaeltacht community this national park would become in time simply a reminder of the irretrievable loss of those essential elements and of continuity in our national life.  There are other islands the daily language of which is Irish and whose neighbours on the mainland are Irish speakers.  However much I admire this present initiative, the Taoiseach will agree with me that it would be unforgiveable if any of these other islands were to meet the same fate as An Blascaod Mór and become a national park.</P>

      <P>We are running away over time.  We did decide, on the Order of Business today on what we were going to do.  There are five Senators remaining to speak on this Bill &mdash; Senator Nioclás O Conchubhair, Senator Kiely, Senator McGowan, Senator Larry McMahon, Senator David Norris and Senator Ross.  I would ask the co-operation of those Senators to speak for two minutes and then allow the Taoiseach in. Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús fáilte a chur roimh an Taoiseach, Aire na Gaeltachta, as a bheith linn anseo tráthnóna, agus fáilte freisin a chur roimh an mBille seo.  Ach sar a dtosóidh mé ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leat féin de bharr go bhfuil sé i gceist córas aistriúcháin a chur anseo sa Seanad, rud atá thar a bheith tábhachtach do dhaoine nach bhfuil aon Ghaeilge acu.</P>
      <P>Mar gheall ar an mBille atá romhainn tá mé ag ceapadh gurb é an rud is suntasaí a tharla i gceantar Gaeltachta le blianta fada, agus tharla sé seo de bharr daoine as an áit a tháinig le chéile, go mórmhór daoine a bhí imithe as an áit go Baile Átha Cliath agus thar lear, chun airgead a bhailiú agus a chinnteodh go mbeadh Ríocht Chiarraí, is é sin na Blascaodaí, beo arís ar son mhuintir na tíre seo.</P>
      <P>Rinne mé féin cuairt ar a leithéid de áit thall in Boston a nglaonn siad Quaker Village air.  Rinneadh obair ar an áit sin agus tá a fhios agam go bhfuil an rud céanna i gceist a dhéanamh anseo sna Blascaodaí.  Cuireadh le chéile seanbhaile a bhí thiar sa seachtú céad déag agus cuireadh gach uile shórt isteach ann an chaoi ar mhair na daoine an t-am sin. Mhair na daoine ar bhochtanas, ach mhair siad ar saibhreas agus suaimhneas a bhí acu féin de bharr an an tsórt creidimh a bhí acu.  Chreid siad i saol éasca, saol nach raibh ag cur isteach nó amach ar éinne.  Is fiú an áit a fheiceáil, agus mholfainn do dhaoine a mbeidís thall in Boston dul a bhreathnú air.  Tá mé cinnte gur rud éigin mar sin atá i gceist ag an mhuintir atá ag plé leis na Blascaodaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Chuir sé áthas orm freisin i mbliana, ó tháinig an Rialtas seo isteach, agus an <Col N="1492" /> Taoiseach anseo é féin, gur chuir sé coiste ag plé le cúrsaí oileáin ar fud na tíre, rud nach ndearnadh riamh sa Stát seo, rud atá ag teastáil, mar tá deacrachtaí ag oileáin go leor ar fud na tíre, agus tá mé cinnte go bhfuil a fhios ag an Rialtas seo na deacrachtaí agus tá siad á bplé faoi láthair.  Luaigh duine éigin ar ball Oileán Arann agus oileáin eile, ach tá mé cinnte go dtiocfaidh feabhas ar na deacrachtaí atá ag na daoine ansin.  Mar atá a fhios agat, tá daoine ina gcónaí ar Inis Oírr, Arainn agus Inis Bó Finne amach go ceantar an Chlocháin, agus táimid buíoch den Taoiseach agus de na hAirí atá ag plé leis sin, mar tá a fhios againn go bhfuil go leor oibre á déanamh acu.  Agus tá mé cinnte go seasfaidh an t-oileán sin agus na daoine ag fanacht ar an oileán sin faoi láthair ach díreach beagán cúnaimh eile a fháil.  Tá tú ag caitheamh drochshúile orm, a Chathaoirligh, ach ba mhaith liom arís tacú leis an méid atá ráite anseo faoi na Blascaodaí.  Mar a deir an dán, agus chuir mé féin píosa beag leis, &ldquo;Brón ar an mbás, ní féidir a shéanadh &mdash; Tá na Blascaodaí ag aiséirí, ar bhuíochas an Taoisigh.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Taoiseach, indeed; I was coming to him.  I want to share the views of the other Members in welcoming the Taoiseach in coming here and staying with us so patiently.  Now I think I may be parting company with many of my colleagues.  Peig Sayers on her deathbed, four hours before she died, said: &ldquo;If they would only give us fresh running water, the electricity and the boat&rdquo;.  It was not a very big shopping list. I could have kept life on this island.  That is my sadness today.  This must surely be a very sad day for every surviving member of that fine group of Blasket islanders who were forced by circumstances completely outside their control to evacuate their homeland 36 years ago.  I believe it is a sad day for every <Col N="1493" /> islander living on the 16 or 18 inhabited islands on the west coast of Ireland.  They will see this Bill as an indication of what is likely to happen to their homeland.</P>
      <P>This Bill is not doing what the Government should be doing for the Blasket Islands, that is, to restore the village to a living village, build a pier and provide the necessary means for people to return and to live permanently on the island so that a living, vibrant community could have the opportunity of continuing the wonderful Blasket tradition spoken of by the Taoiseach and, indeed, many others here today.  This can be done alongside the national historic park.  There is no doubt about it.  We could divide the island fifty-fifty. Have your historic park.  Let anybody here put the most optimistic figure on the number of visitors who will visit this historic park over the next 50 years and then think of the numbers who would visit it if there was a living village there.</P>

      <P>I regret very much that my time is up, but the Leader of the House has indicated that we will have ample opportunity of debating the Bill on Committee Stage and at that stage I will have quite a lot more to say on this. I wish to thank the Taoiseach very much for facilitating us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like also to welcome this Bill.  In particular I would like to welcome the Taoiseach and Minister for the Gaeltacht to this House to introduce this very important Bill.  Not alone is it like a breath of fresh air blowing through the hills of Kerry, but it is, I think, a breath of fresh air to this nation at large.  I would like to congratulate the local people in Kerry who started this foundation and also the Government who came behind them to back it up with this legislation.  But resources will be needed in the years ahead and, as has been stated, the local resources would not be capable of making this a reality.  This national park will give a new dimension to Irish tourist plans, especially to the <Col N="1494" /> region known in Kerry as the Iveragh Peninsula.  I feel that the business people, and particularly those in the Cork-Kerry tourism area should now use this resource for new growth in that area.  It is equally important to provide the Irish people with an historic insight into the way people in island communities lived in the previous centuries and particularly the people in the Blasket Islands.</P>
      <P>I was delighted to hear the Taoiseach say that the overriding purpose of the Bill is to restore the past and to provide, with great care and sensitivity, new facilities and amenities that will bring the island to a new life to be enjoyed and savoured by the Irish people and by visitors from abroad.  The most important benefit to which will accrue from the Bill is that it will provide the Irish people with such an important insight that we will resolve as a nation never again to allow the demise of an island people, such as happened in the case of the Blaskets.  I am well aware that the Taoiseach has a very special commitment to the preservation of all island communities, both the Irish speaking and the English speaking islands, and I know that under his leadership and stewardship island life will not alone be improved but will be upgraded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming the Taoiseach here this evening I cannot but reflect on the last time the Taoiseach was in this House in very different circumstances, because at that time we had recalled the Seanad in the middle of the summer, in dire economic circumstances.  As a contrast today he is taking the initiative and he is introducing a very constructive Bill which is approved by all sides.  I would point out to the Taoiseach that, following that last debate for which he was here, he called a general election and in that general election he lost.  If that acts as any disincentive to him to do anything foolish in the next few weeks, I welcome him in here doubly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought you would welcome the Taoiseach anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome him doubly for <Col N="1495" /> several different reasons, a Chathaoirligh. You know that.  I would like to join very briefly in the unanimous approval which has been given by this House for this Bill on the Blaskets.  I believe that it is significant because it preserves and resurrects our own past as Irishmen in a way which is not divisive, in a way which can all approve of.  So often we preserve, resurrect and talk about the past in a way which causes hostility and difficulties. This debate this evening shows how proud we are as a House &mdash; all parties, Independents, everybody &mdash; of the past of Ireland in a non-hostile way.  It is a great example to us, I think, of what can be done, what should be done, what should be remembered and what should be forgotten.</P>
      <P>I would also like to say that perhaps this Bill should be regarded not only as a precedent in that way but that preservation should be pursued by the Government in other fields, and I think particularly of Georgian architecture.  I think particularly of Viking settlements like Wood Quay.  I think particularly of all national monuments, and I think also of historic houses.  I welcome this Bill as a forerunner, I hope, of many other Bills which will tackle controversial but difficult subjects of that sort.  Finally, I would like to reiterate what Senator O'Toole said: it would be totally inappropriate that the Great Blasket Island should remain in private ownership.  It would be totally wrong that this great part of our heritage should be exploited in any way for commercial reasons.  I welcome the fact that the Commissioners of Public Works have been in total charge of this island and have been given such enormous and sweeping powers so that they can preserve it, not in any way as a commercial entity but as an entity of which we can all be proud.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with other Senators in welcoming this Bill.  It is very important legislation not only for the people of Kerry &mdash; and perhaps the tone of the speeches would indicate that the interest largely comes from <Col N="1496" /> Kerry and from the Kingdom only &mdash; but I think there is a new awareness of the value of the preservation of islands and monuments and our heritage in general. The preservation of our heritage is now important to the people of the nation.  I would look upon this as a national treasure. I think we are very fortunate to have a Taoiseach who is very committed to the preservation of islands and monuments and other parts of our national heritage.  I would like to compliment the people in Kerry and also the Commissioners of Public Works.  I would also like to mention the success of our national park in Glenveigh, County Donegal, which was opened by the President, Dr. Hillery, in 1986.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was endeavouring to encourage those who are involved in a very commendable piece of work.  From the experience we have I think the success of this project is assured, but it will not be realised until the full development has taken place.  This view is based on some experience.  The Seanad is united in welcoming this legislation and all of us will look forward with great interest to seeing the full potential of the Blasket Islands being realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always nice not to have the ultimate word, which must be left to the Taoiseach but at least the penultimate word in a debate.  When I heard that the Blasket Islands were for sale in New York some years ago I was reminded of the character in James Joyce's &ldquo;Ivy Day Committee Room&rdquo; when he said that not only were there people in this country who would sell their country for fourpence but that they would get down on their bended knees and thank the Almighty Christ they had a country to sell.  The Taoiseach is an extremely practical man and he has addressed this subject with great practicality.  I am aware that he has indicated that he feels that tourism is a very significant part of the <Col N="1497" /> engine which will regenerate the economy of this country and that within that framework cultural tourism is one of the areas capable of the greatest growth.</P>
      <P>I think the Taoiseach is sending a message to us today, because I am quite sure that it is not an accidential choice of a Bill.  I think his message is partly financial &mdash; I welcome that.  I think he is indicating that we are prepared to defend our heritage. I think there also is another message in it and it is an extremely important one. Like many other people I read this great literature from the western seaboard of our country, not in its original language but in English.  I think that the transmission of this literature in its greatness is a happy example to cultural collaboration. It does not mean that I stop there; I did subsequently come to read it and enjoy it in Irish.</P>
      <P>I think it is important, as Senator Ross said, that we do not allow ourselves to become devisive in our appreciation of literature.  This is a happy example of collaboration.  I was always moved by the end of Peig Sayers where she said:</P>
      <P>Old as I am, there's a great deal more in my head that I can't write down here.  I did my best to give an accurate account of the people I knew, so that we'd be remembered when we had moved on into eternity.  People will yet walk above our heads; it could even happen that they's walk into the graveyard where I'll be lying but people like us will never again be there. We'll be stretched out quietly and the old world will have vanished...</P>
      <P>I believe that with the help of this Bill that old world will not quite or completely have vanished and I greatly welcome the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I might make one final comment, I hope to put down one or two amendments. I am sure the Taoiseach will consider them positively.  To one in particular I would like to draw his attention and that is to include among the activities that may be prohibited at the discretion of the guardians of the island, would be the playing of transistor radios in a public <Col N="1498" /> park because I think that would lessen the enjoyment which we all anticipate feeling.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá mé fior-bhuíoch de na Seanadóirí go léir a ghlac páirt san díospóireacht seo agus a chuir fáilte is fiche roimh an mBille.  Is léir dom go nglactar leis go forleathan gur ceart aidhmeanna an Bhille a chur i gcrích agus tá athas orm mar gheall air sin freisin.</P>
      <P>I want to express my deep appreciation of the approach of the Seanad to this Bill and to thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate, which has been indeed very helpful and very constructive. I am greatly encouraged by the welcome the Bill has received and it will enable us, at a political level and, perhaps more important, it will enable the Office of Public Works and the fondúireacht people, to proceed now with the aims and objects which we would all like to see achieved.</P>
      <P>Some points of substance were made which I will endeavour to deal with.  If I do not deal with them all this afternoon, we can come and have another word about them on Committee Stage.  The first point raised was the amount of resources which will be devoted to the purposes of the legislation.  Senator Manning raised this aspect first.  I would like to assure the Seanad that there need not be any undue concern about that.  We will ensure that adequate resources will be provided to enable the purposes and objects of the Bill to be implemented.  We have, clearly three sources from which we will be able to secure assistance.  The first, of course, will be the Exchequer and I would visualise the work that will be carried out on An Blascaod Mór as coming very much within the normal heritage activities of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Office of Public Works every year have an ongoing budget and included in their Estimates are reasonable amounts for the preservation of important heritage and cultural amenities so that there will be, to a greater or lesser extent, a <Col N="1499" /> contribution available through the normal finances of the Office of Public Works.  In addition to that we, of course, would have, as some Senator mentioned, access perhaps to the lottery.  This sort of work would be entirely appropriate for funding from the lottery.  We now have established a heritage council which will have some resources available to it from the lottery and that perhaps would be a channel to which some resources could be directed.</P>
    <P>I would place a lot of hope in the activities of the fondúireacht.  They have been very active already in raising funds and I am quite certain that they will make a very substantial contribution over the years to the general purposes we all have in mind.  I can give the House an assurance that this will not be legislation which will not have any practical effect.  The intention is that it will provide adequate resources to enable the purposes to be achieved.</P>
    <P>The question of an interpretative centre was mentioned and that, of course, will be a key element in the whole programme.  Some thought has already been given to that and there certainly will be an interpretive centre on the mainland, somewhere around Dunquin.  I think that would be the first essential.  If you have the interpretative centre on the mainland then you encourage visitors to make what can sometimes be a very hazardous voyage across An Bealach Mór, or the Blasket Sound.  They would perhaps be inspired by what they would see in the interpretative centre to make that journey.  It is only three miles but sometimes it can be a very perilous three miles. Whether you would have another interpretive centre on the island itself is something that can be considered later; probably something of that kind would be necessary.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning also mentioned the controversy that surfaced in the papers today.  He suggested that perhaps we should have sorted all that out before bringing in the legislation.  I am afraid the Senator misinterprets the situation in that regard.  This situation in regard to the <Col N="1500" /> legal ownership of An Blascaod Mór has dragged on now for many years.  It has been very difficult to get to the root of it and find out exactly what is the position. The fondúireacht have been working on that aspect and there is no doubt that this legislation is the only answer.  It is significant that the very advent of the legislation has inspired certain responses from quarters which, up to now, were very secretive about the exact position. The legislation is essential.  It will enable us, one way or another, to bring the whole question of the future ownership of An Blascaod Mór to finality.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House also that there will be no question of being unfair to anybody or treating anybody badly or shabbily.  That is not the intention at all. The Bill has two broad provisions in this area, one is the compulsory powers and the other is the authority given to the Office of Public Works to negotiate and to acquire by agreement.  Most Senators would agree with me when I express a wish that the compulsory powers may never have to be adverted to or invoked and that the properties will be capable of being acquired amicably and by agreement between the Office of Public Works and the proprietors.  The fondúireacht will play a very important role here too because, after all, they represent the local community and they will have a very important moral and persuasive influence to bring to bear.</P>
    <P>I hope that we will be able to proceed in that way.  However, anybody who knows anything about the west of Ireland, particularly the islands off the west of Ireland, will know that one of the big problems is title and tracing the owners. It was important in this legislation to deal with a situation where some particular piece of land could not be acquired because we could not trace the owner or because, if we did succeed in tracing the putative owner that person would perhaps not be able to establish a good title. The Bill gives the Office of Public Works the powers to deal with that sort of situation. At the end of the day, if everything else fails, they can go through the mechanism of compulsory acquisition <Col N="1501" /> which is laid out in the Bill.  Again, I repeat that it would be the wish of everybody that in so far as possible the whole island would be acquired by voluntary, amicable agreement.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy raised a point about elitism.  It is a point which is worth a word or two.  I fully agree with the Senator. The general view expressed here in the House was that there should be nothing of that kind.  My experience of the Blascaod Mór over many years is that in fact it is a place to which the public resort. It attracts the sort of people to whom Senator Murphy and Senator Robb referred.  I have been on the Blascaod Mór and in Dunquin during the summer months when the tourist traffic is at its height and when the ferry is operating. Anybody who does not know the situation there would be agreeably surprised to see the number of people from Dublin city and Cork who go to Dunquin and get the ferry out to An Blascaod Mór.  It is a place of popular interest and resort.  Also, every season there is always a great influx of teachers.  This, too, is very welcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Particularly if they come from Corca Dhuibhne.  I have noticed over the years many teachers going there so that when they return to their schools they are in a position to give their pupils first-hand knowledge of the places mentioned in those wonderful pieces of literature.  I can reassure Senator Murphy and other Senators on that point also, that it will be a public park.  It will be a place to which the public will go, where they can relax and enjoy themselves and where they will get a new and deeper insight into this cultural heritage that the Blascaod Mór represents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that whole question of our heritage I think we are making some progress. Our Irish heritage is a very beautiful and multifaceted thing.  Our being here today can illustrate that for us.  Here we are having restored one very important but very distinctive and, if you like, separate <Col N="1502" /> aspect of our Irish heritage by refurbishing this beautiful room.  In the Dáil today the Finance Bill is going through. There is a provision in that Bill for tax incentive to encourage people in the designated areas of our towns and cities to restore houses of importance and value. We hope that will have a very beneficial influence particularly on Georgian architecture in our city areas.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in my opening remarks and Senator de Buitleár mentioned also the fact that an inner city Dublin poet from the North Strand, Brendan Behan, was attracted to the Blasket Islands and wrote perhaps one of the most beautiful poems about the Blaskets that has ever been written.  Dublin inner city and the Blaskets are clearly all part of a common Irish heritage in which we can all take a certain amount of pride and particularly if now we are active enough in our generation to preserve and protect it for future generations.</P>
    <P>Some Senators indicated that perhaps it is all very well doing something for An Blascaod Mór but what about all the other islands which are still inhabited and need many amenities and facilities.  I can tell the House that we are making progress in regard to those islands also.  My own experience of island life is that the most important thing for any islander is communication, transport, access.  We are taking steps in regard to the islands, mainly off the west coast, which are still inhabited, to improve the situation of the people who still live there.  Last year we had to undertake major remedial works at Cape Clear, again to ensure that the ferry service could operate.  We are doing this in co-operation with Comhdhail na nOileán, a group who now represent the different islands and who are very active in drawing attention to the needs of the islanders.  I hope that we will be able to continue that work and make sure that in so far as it is possible to do so, these islands continue to maintain vibrant, living communities.</P>
    <P>It is not always possible to do that because different people on these islands have different priorities and inevitably a number of them want to get to the <Col N="1503" /> mainland for education reasons and social reasons and other considerations. In so far as any of these communities wish to stay on their islands I hope we will be able to encourage that and provide amenities and facilities which will enable them to do so.</P>
    <P>Many references were made during the course of the debate to Tomás Ó Criomhthain and to his final summing up at the end of his book, <i>An tOileánach</i>.  I would like, for the sake of literary accuracy, to remind the Seanad exactly what Tomás Ó Criomhthain did say.  It is very illustrative of the sort of people the Blasket Islanders were.  He did not say: &ldquo;Ní bheidh ár leithéidí ann arís&rdquo;&mdash; there will never be the likes of us again.  He said &ldquo;I have written these things down carefully and accurately because there will never be the likes of us again&rdquo;.  Being the practical éifeachtach type of man that he was, he was not just, writing his book for the sake of writing his book.  He had the concept in his mind that this was an important community, that it was about to disappear and would eventually disappear and therefore it was important that he should do this work, write these things down so that the sort of community it was will be remembered.  In fact, you can almost visualise him foreseeing what we are doing here today.  We are now engaged in, if you like, extending what he set out to do.  He set out to make sure that the life of the islanders and the sort of community they were would be remembered and that is exactly what we are doing in this legislation.</P>
    <P>I was very interested also to see the number of Senators who have a knowledge and a love of the Blasket Islands. The views of the Seanad and the attitude of the Senators to the Blasket Islands is comprehensive.  That will help us on Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>A Senator mentioned the question of constitutionality.  I have no particular worries about that, though we can all from time to time express some surprise at the unpredictability of what happens in our courts.  In so far as this legislation is concerned I would not have any worries <Col N="1504" /> about the constitutionality of it.  It is perfectly straightforward legislation following a pattern which is now well-established in our legislative process whereby for the common good or for particular social or other purposes compulsory acquisition is permitted provided, of course, that compensation is available.</P>
    <P>Senator Paddy McGowan was not really being totally parochial when he talked about Glenveagh Park in Donegal. What he wanted to draw attention to was the importance of national parks as such, no matter what part of the country they are in.  Glenveagh National Park, which again is a great tribute to the Office of Public Works and to their skills and to their dedication, had 90,000 visitors in 1988.  It employs 80 people and is, of course, a national asset of incomparable value and importance.  I hope that in time the national historic park in An Blascaoid Mór will assume the same sort of importance in our national affairs.</P>
    <P>I would like to place all this attention which we are paying here this afternoon in Seanad Éireann to our cultural heritage in a European context.  One of the encouraging things at present is that in the European Community there is a great deal of attention being given to the minority cultures and minority languages of Europe.  I have heard President Mitterrand of France, for instance, speak very enthusiastically about the unity and diversity of Europe and how important it is that we should preserve that diversity of cultures and languages and cherish them and particularly that the Community should pay attention to strengthening and preserving the minority language of which Irish is always mentioned as one.  Perhaps I might name-drop for a moment and point out that President Mitterrand visited the Blaskets last summer and expressed enormous interest in the whole cultural ambience of the Blaskets and its literature and <i>An tOileánach</i> is now being translated into French and we intend to present the President with a copy of that new edition. How proud Muiris O Suilleabháin would have been, and George Sampson his <Col N="1505" /> great friend and mentor, if they could ever have visualised that <i>Fiche Bliain ag Fás</i> from the Blasket Islands would one day assume such important international cultural significance.  Again I express my very deep appreciation to the Seanad for the very constructive and helpful way in which the members have received this legislation today.  I hope I have succeeded in replying adequately at this stage to the points which were raised and I assure the Seanad that we will have a further look at the legislation when we come to Committee Stage.  If there are any deficiencies or inadequacies in it, we can remedy them at that point.</P>

The co-operation between the Senators today, is an indication, I hope, of what might happen in the future in this House.  A number of Senators who wanted to get in did not get the opportunity at this stage but they will get the opportunity on Committee Stage to make points which are relevant to the debate.  I would also like to thank the Taoiseach for staying with us for the full debate.  I know that it is a matter of great interest to him.  I move that the Order for the next Stage should be taken next week contingent upon other Bills that are coming into the House.</P>

      <P>Before I move them, I would like to point out that I have looked very closely at the debate on Committee Stage on this section of the Bill and since that debate and in the intervening period a lot of information has come to light about the Bill that I have become aware of.  I do not think that it would be quite adequate to deal with it on Report Stage today.  I am looking particularly at the first grouping, amendments Nos. 1 to 6.  It is my view that that section needs to be teased out in some detail.  For that reason I would propose the Bill be recommitted in regard to amendments Nos. 1 to 6 so that they could be teased out and that we could have a discussion on them. Therefore I would formally propose that the Bill be so recommitted.  I hope the Minister will see fit to accept that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 5, to delete &ldquo;or other lethal weapon&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As I said on Second Stage I am very supportive of the general aims and objectives outlined by the Minister for Justice when he presented the Bill to us.  I understand why the Minister is not here today. He had a family bereavement.  I would like to extend my sympathies to him on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that Senators will bear with me. The general view is that crossbows and things like that are dangerous and, therefore, we should treat them like all other offensive weapons or all other lethal firearms.  I want to make a number of points.  I am referring in particular to the first three amendments.  In the first one I have proposed that the words &ldquo;or other lethal weapon&rdquo; be taken out of section 4. It would then read &ldquo;a lethal firearm of any description from which any shot or bullet can be discharged&rdquo;.  At the moment it reads &ldquo;a lethal firearm or other <Col N="1509" /> lethal weapon&rdquo; and it also adds &ldquo;from which any shot, bullet or other missile can be discharged&rdquo;.  I ask the Minister to give further consideration to this point which I made at an earlier stage.</P>
    <P>We all understand what lethal means. The clear simple definition of &ldquo;lethal&rdquo; is deadly.  A &ldquo;weapon&rdquo; is defined as any object which is used for attack or defence and a &ldquo;missile&rdquo; is defined as an object thrown.  I did not make that up.  There is no argument about that and there can be no discussion about that.  That is a matter of fact.  It is pure semantics and that is the way it stands.</P>
    <P>Let us apply that to ordinary situations. How can the Minister or anybody else say to me that a catapult is not an offensive weapon?  It can be deadly and it can certainly launch a missile and it does.  A clay pigeon launcher is used by sports people to shoot clay pigeons.  It is a little arm that throws a clay disc into the air.  That can be lethal.  People have been killed by them.  It fulfils all the requirements that are there.  In fact there are a whole lot of areas which could be covered by that.</P>
    <P>More importantly, the Bill further refers in paragraph (c) to a crossbow with a draw weight of at least 1.4 kilos.  I defy the Minister to explain to me what the position is of a long bow.  The crossbow is the one that is fired like a rifle, the William Tell effort, which is aimed and launches a bolt.  The long bow is the long one, or the recurve bow is the long one, with a little squiggle on the top and bottom.  Both of those do precisely the same job as a crossbow.  This Bill purports to say that we have to have a licence for a crossbow but there is no need for a licence for a long bow or a recurve bow. There is no logic in that.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be big enough to accept the argument that this is a serious flaw in the legislation.  My only interest here is in tidying up the legislation.  As it now stands a catapult could be considered to be a lethal weapon.  As it now stands we will be requiring people to have a licence for a crossbow but not for any other kind of bow.  In saying that, I am conscious of the fact that the Department <Col N="1510" /> of Justice have indicated to a number of groups that it will not be necessary.  I have here a letter from the Department of Justice written by a named official in February of this year.  It says:</P>
    <P>I refer to your recent letter in which you raised a number of questions in relation to the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Bill, that a firearms certificate should be required to enable a person to have a crossbow.  The position is as follows:</P>
    <P>Longbows, these are outside the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It might be all very well for a civil servant with the best will in the world to send that letter out to an interested citizen but I defy the Minister to explain to me how a long bow is not a lethal weapon which launches a missile.  It cannot be done.</P>
    <P>It would be better to say: &ldquo;I accept you are right but we are not accepting your amendment&rdquo;.  It would even be better to do the decent thing and accept my amendment.  Certainly as it stands this Bill is faulty.  For that reason I ask the Minister to accept amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out some of the difficulties that this will create for all sorts of people.  Archery is one of the few sports where we have total integration. Integration of the handicapped is an objective of the Government through many different Departments &mdash; through the Department of Social Welfare, certainly through Education and through many others.  Archery is one of the few sports in which a handicapped person can participate from his or her wheelchair beside a person who does not have any handicapped disadvantage or disablement. It is very difficult for people in these situations to cope with the cost.  We are now saying on top of everything else that in future those people will have to have a licence.  I have outlined the difficulties. To recap on that particular section, the wording is loose.  It creates difficulties.  It encompasses areas that were never envisaged in the Bill in the first place.  I do not accept that long bows <Col N="1511" /> or recurved bows are excluded from the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The last term I used was &ldquo;a recurved bow&rdquo;.  I explained it earlier.  There are a number of bows. There is the crossbow, the one that is held horizontally, and then there is the long bow, which is what we normally say Robin Hood used.  Then there is a variation of that, where just at the very top it goes through a sort of squiggle.  It recurves back at the top and at the bottom.  It gives added tension to the draw weight.  I hope that suffices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair.  I am glad you spoke in my defence because of these unruly interruptions from my colleagues beside me who were testing me on the issue.  I accept that all sorts of bows are dangerous, that they are lethal and that they should be controlled, so we are that far together.  I would accept a control that they should be restricted to certain age limits.</P>
      <P>I see the Government and various groups are talking about restricting access to alcohol in pubs to people under a certain age.  A similar arrangement might well be made in regard to the use of long bows, cross bows or whatever.  I propose taking those particular implements, crossbows particularly, out of section 2 and putting them into section 3 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the point of amendments Nos. 5 and 6.  In other words, I am saying they <Col N="1512" /> should be classified as offensive weapons. That means it would be an offence to have them and they should be regulated in the same way as a sheath-knife, a flick-knife or any other kind of dangerous pointed weapon like that.  It would be an offence to have them in a dance-hall, dance marquee, discotheque, cinema or wherever people are gathered.  It would be an offence to have them in any kind of premises for entertainment or in any kind of indoor situation except ones which are clearly obvious.  I will not read through the Bill on that.  I am saying it would be covered as outlined in section 8 and that would now apply to the bows. It is a very reasonable arrangement.  Not only that, but to take it a little bit further, we would include crossbows at the end of section 8 and again in the first part of section 9.</P>
    <P>The net effect then, of what I have proposed, is that we would look at the flaws which I have pointed out.  If we leave the words &ldquo;lethal weapon&rdquo; and &ldquo;or other missile&rdquo; in, we can require people to have licences for catapults and we can require people who have a clay pigeon launcher to have a licence.  Anything which fires a missile could be said to be lethal.  That is a very wide range of things indeed.  It can be taken very far.  It does not make any sense to leave it that way. I know that what the Minister will say will depress me.  He will stand up ably supported by Senators on the Government Front Bench and try to talk me out of a perfectly logical argument.  For once he should accept reason and bow to this argument, accept the proposals that I make and tighten up and improve this Bill.</P>
    <P>Let us tighten up the first one; let us be certain what lethal weapons are and be certain that the Bill does what we intend it to do.  That can be done by accepting the first three amendments. There is no possible way in which that can be interpreted to exclude long bows. Long bows do all the things which we have in the definition section.  Long bows are lethal and launch a missile.  That covers a long bow.  I believe that the Department would be willing to accept <Col N="1513" /> that point.  It is a very minor change to make.  Regarding the other one, so that we will control them, let us not call them firearms, let us call them offensive weapons. I am beginning to repeat myself.  I hope I have made the point adequately. I hope the Minister will accept my point and accept the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. In the unfortunate absence of Senator O'Toole during Committee Stage, I moved this amendment.  I had not the opportunity to study it or to think about it with the degree of detail I would have liked.  Reading the Bill now, there is a faintly Orwellian tone to section 4 because we are beginning to stand the English language on its head and say that essentially a firearm, notwithstanding what most people understand it to be, is what we say it is, irrespective of logic or English usage.</P>
      <P>We are beginning to define firearms as a whole lot of things that are not in any way conceivably firearms.  That is not in any way to suggest that other implements which are dangerous, lethal and need to be controlled, restricted and regulated should not be controlled, restricted and regulated.  We have a certain duty to ourselves, to the Oireachtas and, indeed, whether it be the English or Irish language, to ensure that what we put through the Houses of the Oireachtas is actually in coherent English and not a &ldquo;new speak&rdquo; that we concoct ourselves to meet our own purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to be that to attempt to define a crossbow as a firearm is pushing the English language beyond any limit which that poor, misfortunate language should be expected to go.  If we have a problem with these sort of weapons then let us have specific legislation to deal with them.  I would not be tied up in any way with any civil libertarian notion that people should be allowed freely to use dangerous and offensive weapons, to have dangerous and offensive weapons, to threaten people with dangerous or offensive weapons, or to do any of a number of things with them, but I feel the Oireachtas would do a disservice to <Col N="1514" /> itself by taking short cuts with the English language and by simply saying the handiest way to deal with extra items as they come on the market is to call them all firearms.  It is turning the English language inside out and saying that things are quite clearly not what they are simply saying that because we say it, therefore it is.</P>
    <P>I know we happen to have that great power of privilege, the power of the privileged to discuss and pass legislation.  We also have a responsibility within that power which is not to turn the English language inside out.  Senator O'Toole has made a compelling and logical case for a clear distinction to be made between those things which are firearms and which are clearly recognisable in the eyes of the public as being firearms or related to firearms and those things which are offensive, dangerous and deadly but which are not firearms.  It is very unworthy of this House and very sloppy drafting to simply say that the simplest thing to do is to keep on saying more and more things are firearms.  They are not firearms.  They are clearly not firearms and should not be called firearms.  If we need to regulate them with whatever stringency we need, let us do it, but let us not do it by taking short cuts that offend the English language.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the previous two Senators that we must not redefine the English or the Irish language.  When we say that a firearm covers some weapon that does fire and is an arm, I do not think we are going too far with the definition. We must remember why the Bill is here at all.  It is to ban offensive weapons. There was a case in Britain not so long ago where somebody was slain with a crossbow.  It would be necessary to redefine the whole Bill.  I can see no reason why any kind of crossbow, long bow, or the other type of bow &mdash; I know the Senator has many strings to his bow &mdash; cannot be included under a &ldquo;lethal weapon&rdquo; or &ldquo;firearm&rdquo;.  They should be made subject to the Firearms Acts.  A stun gun is included under prohibited <Col N="1515" /> weapons.  We could include them under that.  It makes no difference.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole wants to put the word &ldquo;crossbow&rdquo; into section 8 as well.  That section is really to guard against people carrying into dancehalls, discotheques, marquees or any other place, weapons that can be hidden, like knives, screwdrivers, pocket knives, pieces of glass or whatever.  I do not think anybody could walk into a marquee or dancehall in possession of one of these weapons.  One would want to be very tall to secret a long bow anywhere on one's person.  I do not see the need for the insertion of that word.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, the Senator will not be aware of a pistol crossbow which is a much smaller weapon.  One would not need to be that tall to carry it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the clarification. I was not aware of a pistol crossbow but, as I said, the Senator has many strings to his bow.  That is another one for me. However, I think we should include it under the Firearms Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what my two colleagues have said, particularly in regard to the question of definition.  I feel I am obliged to speak since the question of the English language is being called into operation here.  It would be professional suicide not to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is perfectly clear to anybody reading these sections that the only section which comes remotely close to a correct linguistic definition of firearm is in section 4(1)(a).  The rest simply do not apply.  I, for linguistic reasons, would be forced to agree with Senator O'Toole and Senator Ryan that it is actually dangerous to allow the development of a specialist legal language system which is so divorced from the common or garden English usage that it will cause confusion to those against whom or in the interests of whom the law is applied.  For this reason it is very appropriate that the amendment, which <Col N="1516" /> is a reasoned, carefully argued amendment, should be included.  Also behind this lies the notion that some instruments become offensive weapons according to context.</P>
    <P>This is part of the reasoning behind Senator O'Toole's amendment.  For example, carrying a screwdriver on a building site would not necessarily be construed as offensive, particularly if the person carrying the instrument was a carpenter. In a discotheque late at night attired in a certain manner with a particularly aggressive demeanour a screwdriver could certainly be construed according to context as an offensive weapon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if one were a carpenter as my colleague says.  I take both parts of his amendment as being well-reasoned and capable of logical support and sustension.  I would like, however, to refer to the fact that my good friend, Senator Lydon, referred to the inclusion of stun guns and so on.  In a way it is rather unfortunate because they, again, are very clearly different.  They are not lethal weapons.  In the kind of situation that I am very aware of in the north inner city, where premises, such as publichouses, are very frequently made the target of attack, a stun gun can be something that is employed as a method of defence that does no permanent damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here again in the list of definitions we are coming up against radically different categories covered blandly by what Senator Ryan has described as an Orwellian use of language.  I suppose he was probably thinking of <i>Animal Farm</i> and the redefinition of birds and so on, to fit the prevailing political ideology.  I would describe it as the humpty-dumpty effect in language where humpty-dumpty says &ldquo;words mean exactly what I want them to mean, no more and no less&rdquo;.  This is a reasonable principle for characters in imaginative fiction.  I suggest to the House with the greatest deference that it is not a particularly good principle upon <Col N="1517" /> which to base legal draftsmanship.  I am more than happy to support this series of excellent amendments.</P>

      <P>I cannot claim to have the range of knowledge of these crossbows and so on that Senator O'Toole obviously knows about, or the semantic range of Senator Norris's contribution. I know, however, that crossbows of the type above the weight specified in the Bill are really lethal.  They are elaborate pieces of equipment.  For all practical purposes they are indistinguishable from guns in terms of their appearance and impact.  As the father of five children I am particularly conscious of the safety element for children in general. Given the potential danger of crossbows of this bigger variety, the licensing provision is entirely reasonable.  After all, many of these lethal weapons are bought on impulse and they deserve a much more considered approach and the licensing of them is entirely reasonable.</P>

      <P>If the amendments were accepted for no control over availability or use of crossbows, the levels of control would make the Bill worthless. If we accept these amendments, people, irrespective of age, could go out and purchase these legitimately and use them in any public places other than those in section 8.  We must recognise the sophisticated type of crossbow that is on the market.  It is important that Members recall that a woman was killed by a crossbow in Britain not so long ago and that a young garda was injured in this country not too long ago.  One of the most lethal weapons used by poachers of game and deer in this country is the crossbow.  It facilitates an easy kill and also at the same time there is no undue noise level.</P>

      <P>I am not approaching this matter with any automatic commitment to my colleague's amendment. I listened very carefully because as I said on one occasion in this House the definition of an Independent is that he is independent of all other Independents.  I listened very carefully to Senator O'Toole's cogent argument.  I am against anything that will diminish the rigour of this Bill.  I am a hawk on these matters; I am in favour of the maximum banning of all these weapons.</P>
      <P>We made that clear on Second Stage.  It is not clear to me that Senator O'Toole's amendment would meet my concerns in that regard.  Of course, I share the concern of my colleagues about the looseness of language but I am not so sure that a firearm cannot legitimately be interpreted as a crossbow.  In any case, what surprises me about Senator O'Toole's amendment in view of the distinction that he drew between crossbow, longbow and recurve bow is why did he not introduce these terms into his proposed amendments so that that point could be clarified? I disagree with my colleagues in this regard.</P>

      <P>Yes, a teacher and a very dedicated Irishwoman, Lord have mercy on her.  In relation to the amendments they are not being accepted.  The combined purpose of the amendments is to provide that a crossbow will not be defined as a firearm and will not, therefore, be encompassed by the controls of the Firearms Acts.  That is the basic thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Murphy said he was a hawk. Basically in this we are all hawks to some extent at this stage because we want to <Col N="1519" /> have controls; we want to see offensive and dangerous weapons controlled and in some cases banned.  The people want to see this happening too, because there are far too many instances where dangerous weapons are being abused, misused and turning up in all the wrong places. They are being used to threaten people in their homes and cause damage and, as Senator Cullimore said used, by poachers to kill deer and for a whole range of other things.  We want to bring them under control.  They are extremely dangerous instruments.  They are very much akin to a firearm, much more so in practice and in experience than even the longbow or the curved one, to which Senator O'Toole referred.</P>
    <P>As an alternative form of control the Senators are proposing, by amendment Nos. 4 and 5, to include crossbows with knives and similar articles, the carrying of which is prohibited in section 8 (1) in certain specified places, in places of public entertainment and resort and by amendment No. 6 to include a crossbow among those weapons which it would be an offence to have under section 9 while trespassing on premises.  I can understand the intention of the Senators in their amendments but the effect would be devastating in that it would remove the requirement for certification for licensing.</P>
    <P>We want to know where the crossbows are, we want to know who has them. There should be a licensing system for crossbows because they are very dangerous weapons.  The effect of these amendments, if accepted, would be to make it an offence to have a crossbow in places like publichouses, football grounds, dance halls, etc., or while trespassing on private premises.  Otherwise there would be no controls on the availability or use of crossbows.  Anybody would be entitled to buy one and to carry it on the street or in any public place, other than the specified areas of public entertainment, and it is, of course, unlikely to be carried in those places in any event.</P>
    <P>Such a level of control would be practically worthless.  That point was made by <Col N="1520" /> a number of Senators, including Senator Lydon and Senator Hillery, who are concerned about children.  Senator Murphy was very concerned about the abuse of such instruments but we would not meet their requirements if we expected the amendment.</P>
    <P>Crossbows have to be licensed and the difficulties that have been mentioned can be overcome.  Crossbows are dangerous weapons with a lethal potential.  They have many of the characteristics of a gun: they can be carried pre-loaded and ready to fire; they can be accurate and lethal over a considerable distance, they can be used without a great deal of skill and they are reasonably compact.  In considering what control should be placed on a weapon like that, the most important question is who should be allowed to have them rather than where they should be allowed.  This means, of course, a licensing system and the most effective licensing system for weapons is provided under the Firearms Act.  That works very effectively and we see no difficulty for people who participate in the sport and use crossbows having a licence.</P>
    <P>With particular regard to amendments Nos. 1 and 2, the Garda authorities are of the very strong view that the words in the existing definition of a firearm, which these amendments seek to delete, should be retained.  They report that the words in question are used in the fight against terrorism to secure convictions in relation to homemade rocket launchers and projected grenades, neither of which would otherwise come within the legal definition of a firearm.  The relevant provisions are also used to deal with a variety of missiles which can be projected or thrown in a number of different ways.  For these reasons the amendments are not acceptable.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators mentioned cases of injury with crossbows.  There was an incident of a garda being shot and injured with a crossbow by a person resisting arrest.  Crossbows have also been found in possession of persons of very dubious character, for example, persons suspected of drug dealing and persons suspected of having connections with <Col N="1521" /> subversive organisations.  In England in a recent murder a crossbow was used.  In addition there have been several incidents where animals have been shot and cruelly maimed by crossbows and of a child being seriously injured while using one.</P>
    <P>There is none of this evidence against the long bow and none of this practical experience in relation to it.  Certainly in relation to the crossbow there is plenty of evidence and it is regarded as a very lethal weapon.  For this reason, the Minister is right in seeking to have certification of crossbows.  We are not accepting these amendments and I have dealt with the points which have been raised.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that in a sport such as archery there is the question of the integration of the handicapped but those cases will be covered by the licensing system and there would not be any difficulty in that regard.  A crossbow is such a dangerous weapon that you must know who has it and where it is.  If you have that kind of certification then the licensing system will cover it.</P>
    <P>I note that Senator Norris was quick to jump to defend the English language and was concerned about the legal language which might be used.  We are quite satisfied &mdash; and our legal advisers are quite satisfied &mdash; that the language is correct and that it will have the effect which is intended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that Senator O'Toole has managed to split the Independents even more than he normally manages to do in private.  He has now publicly done so.  I, like Senator Murphy, have an instinct about things like this. Whereas the amendment is proposed with the best will in the world, for very good linguistic and other reasons, it is wrong that we should be seen in any way to be making offensive weapons more readily available or less easy to control. Whichever way you look at this amendment, the effect of it, as I understand from what the Minister said, is to remove the certification of crossbows which are very offensive and lethal weapons.  I instinctively believe that anything that <Col N="1522" /> does that is wrong and that these weapons come under the same categorisation as what we traditionally understand as firearms, being guns of a lethal sort.</P>
      <P>I fully understand the points made by Senator Norris who stands second to none in his mastery of the English language about it possibly being a clumsy way of defining firearms and the wrong way of doing so.  The overriding argument here must be the one which the Minister, Senators Lydon and Cullimore made, that we must not make offensive weapons more easily available to anybody whatever and whoever they are.  Whereas those who hold these weapons legally will have nothing to fear, if this amendment is accepted I am afraid there will be more people holding more weapons which are not controlled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with points made it always concerns me when we talk about the licence and control of any kind of weapons.  I listened carefully to Senator Hillery and it worries me further when somebody stands up and says he is the father of five children.  I am the father of five children and I have views that that weapon should also be licensed.  In terms of damage that might be done that is no way to justify any need for licensing or control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have, however, taken great trouble to investigate the use of crossbows in matters of arrest and so on.  It is not giving the full facts to say that somebody in the course of an arrest was found with a crossbow.  I know the case mentioned, indeed I know of every case which involved a crossbow in this country over the last number of years.  The case mentioned was the well known one in Kerry which is referred to as the &ldquo;Big Chief&rdquo; case where a German citizen residing in the west &mdash; very close to the Blasket Islands &mdash; fired a shot through a hole in his roof which had been put there by gardaí while trying to make an arrest. The man had a lot of other difficulties; they were protecting him from himself and they tried to rescue him through the roof and he did release an arrow from a crossbow at them.  One shot was fired and <Col N="1523" /> the garda was wounded, but not seriously, I understand.  The facts of the case are as the Minister stated, but it is certainly not a case for licensing a crossbow because he could just as easily have done as much damage with a kitchen knife, flick knife, boiling water, a billiard ball or a lot of other things.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the case involving a drugs dealer but it is emotive to say that because a drugs dealer had a crossbow we should control it, licence it and stop it.  In the case to which the Minister referred, a drugs dealer was charged with possession of a crossbow. He came to his front door with a bow in his hand when the gardaí came to arrest him on other charges.  It is not even clear whether he had an arrow in the bow. There was no question of him releasing it and he certainly gave himself up.</P>
    <P>Another case involved a horse in Tallaght and another where a crossbow bolt was fired through the window of a Garda barracks in Cork.  There was another where a 14 year old released an object from a crossbow at a friend by pure accident. There was no malicious intent but a child was injured.  I have taken the trouble to go through them.  If you are trying to make the case for licensing on the basis of how they have been used over the last number of years, I assure you that the case is a non-starter.  Many other implements and weapons have caused far more damage over the last number of years.  Crossbows have traditionally had a bad press, from the 11th century when the Lateran Council denounced the crossbow as being a weapon hateful to God and fit only for infidels and Turks.  That kind of language today would find us in breach of the Incitement to Hatred Act outside this House.</P>
    <P>It has a long history but the people who use crossbows in this country are very responsible.  I would also like to refer to some of the points made by Senators, particularly the one made by Senator Lydon.  Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 do not just simply refer to the carrying of a crossbow in public places, dance halls, marquees and so on.  They also cover the <Col N="1524" /> carrying of crossbows in cases of trespassing or at night and in other premises or clearly having them with wrong intent. They go much further than that.</P>
    <P>I cannot even rely on my own friends and I certainly accept that defeat is staring me in the face.  However, I am a pragmatist at heart and I ask the Minister to just accept my argument.  I realise this Bill will have to go to the other House &mdash; I was very pleased to hear the Taoiseach today refer to &ldquo;the House down there&rdquo;&mdash; and it might just be changed there.  I would ask the Minister to take back what he said, that a crossbow is something that can be used without any skill.  That is a grave injustice to people who spend their life perfecting the art of accurate shooting with a crossbow.  It takes a fair amount of skill to shoot a crossbow, far more skill than to use a firearm.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there would be no problem for the handicapped.  Does this mean that handicapped people will not be required to have a licence?  The great difference between the crossbow and other things is how one identifies them. They are not appropriate for carrying serial numbers.  How do you keep a check on them?  Somebody said we would like to know where they are.  I can give statistics from my file as to how many there are in the country and what kind of dealer sold them.  Does the Minister realise that a regular sports dealer who deals in crossbows will now be required under the Firearms Act to build a strongroom and to fulfil all the conditions and regulations which up until now have been appropriate for guns and firearms?  Surely that is not acceptable.  It is an unacceptable pressure to put on dealers.</P>
    <P>There is a difference between the sale and the storing and sorting of guns, etc. The Minister is now saying that the shop that is selling crossbows, etc., will now have to build a strong room.  There is no evidence that terrorists or people like that have ever shown the slightest interest in crossbows and it is quite clear that they have never used them.  One point the Minister made is certainly new to me, that the Garda support this inclusion in the Bill.  That is not my information.  No <Col N="1525" /> group in the country, including the Garda, the farmers, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the veterinary profession and the medical profession, have called for the licensing of crossbows.  I want to make it clear that people dealing with what might be termed the results of the misuse of crossbows are not shouting for the licensing and the control of these things in the manner put in the Bill.  It would be fair to have a crossbow classified as an offensive weapon but not as a firearm.  Let us address this matter rationally and see it for what it is.</P>
    <P>At the earlier Stage the Government brought in an amendment to the effect that Part II of this Bill shall only come into operation on such day or days as may be fixed therefore by order or orders of the Minister and that different days may be fixed for different provisions of that Part.  Will the Minister indicate, perhaps by a nod of the head, seeing that he is not allowed to come back into the debate &mdash; which is why I originally wanted it dealt with on Committee Stage rather than on Report Stage &mdash; if the Government in bringing in the regulations in Part II in requiring licences now want to implement this Bill on section, say 1 (a), 1 (b), 1 (d), 1 (e), 1 (f) etc., leaving out 1 (c) for the time being, the one on the crossbow?  If that is possible it would allow us to fight it in another place, on another day.  I would certainly like clarification on that.  That would take a lot of the difficulty out of it because it would clear the road for the bona fide sports shop and for the bona fide person involved in the sport, until such time as the Department had more experience of this legislation.  If it is then necessary to extend it, perhaps it could be done by ministerial order.  That is not my wish but it is the fall back point I would put to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I assure the Minister that those people involved in the sport of archery would be fully prepared to support and work in any way possible with the Minister in that regard.  I have fought the good fight and I cannot take it any further.  I regret that <Col N="1526" /> the Minister is not prepared to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much more to say at this stage.  I accept that Senator O'Toole has made a spirited defence of his amendments but there is the underlying fact that these are weapons which can be extremely dangerous.  In fact, Seantor O'Toole confirmed what I had to say earlier, although he was not in a position to confirm the information about subversives.  I am not surprised at that, nor will he be in a position to confirm that because it is a matter about which the Minister and the Garda will know.</P>
      <P>In relation to the other points the Senator made, yes, they would have to be numbered and there would have to be adequate security.  That is something that can be discussed then with the Minister subsequently and in the implementation. There was a question about the different days and the idea there is to allow time for adjustment and for the introduction and regularisation of the position.  That again is something I will convey to the Minister.  I will let him know the Senator's views on that and his concern that adequate time would be provided to make suitable arrangements.  There is no intention in this of interfering with or upsetting the sport.  It is just that the weapons are regarded as dangerous and in that event we want to know who has them and we want to insist on certification. That is the basic point.  That is what people generally feel here in the House.  I am very happy that the Senator is prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I was not here on Committee Stage but the Minister purposes here to meet the concerns expressed by a number of Senators in the course of the debates on earlier Stages of the Bill that the repair and modification of weapons of the type dealt within section 11 should be brought within the scope of that section and should be made a criminal offence.  This amendment will largely achieve the same purpose as amendments Nos. 8 and 9 which have been put down by Senators O'Toole and Murphy but will, in restricting the application of section 11 to repair or modification of weapons by way of business, avoid the difficulties inherent in those amendments, that is if the terms &ldquo;repair&rdquo; were introduced into the section without the qualifying phrase &ldquo;by way of business&rdquo; it would create a situation where it would be unlawful for a person to undertake the repair of a weapon otherwise lawfully held by him.  If this amendment is accepted it will make it an offence for anybody on a commercial basis to undertake repair or modification of the weapons covered by the section.  This should meet the concerns of Senators O'Toole <Col N="1528" /> and Murphy and perhaps they will agree to withdraw amendments Nos. 8 and 9.</P>

      <P>The amendment will probably go entirely unnoticed, as most of us have learned to our regret.  When Bills are amended &mdash; often dramatically amended &mdash; in this House the matter goes unnoticed.  It is a matter which is worked on by large numbers of Members of this House from time to time.  Legislation is not Holy Writ and is considerably changed during its progress through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is not just one House in the Oireachtas in which legislation is debated and amended.  This is a simple response by the Minister to, I concede, Senator O'Toole's perspicacity in noticing this on Second Stage.  We can, of course, claim credit for rescuing Senator O'Toole from his own exuberance by being here to propose the motion.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendments No. 8 and 9 not moved.</P>

      <P>I want to say two things about the Bill.  First, I want to refer to section 17.  I am pleased to see other offensive legislation, the Vagrancy Act, 1824, repealed.  There are many other sections of that Act which I would commend to the Government's attention for immediate repeal, including the offensive sections dealing with begging.  The second point is a slight touch of nostalgia <Col N="1531" /> for perhaps a more innocent era.  I accept the necessity to classify airguns as firearms, although in my relatively recent youth such weapons were regarded as quite innocent and harmless and no great threat to anybody.  It is perhaps a reflection on a loss of innocence in our society that what used to be toys, which perhaps has some risk attached to them, have now, of necessity, to be treated as dangerous weapons.</P>

      <P>The portion of the Vagrancy Act being repealed refers to the deletion of the words &ldquo;being armed with any gun, pistol, hanger, cutlass bludgeon or other offensive weapons&rdquo;.  It is the language of another age.  Will the Minister indicate what a &ldquo;hanger&rdquo; is?</P>

      <P>The Act referred to is that of 1871.  At that stage I presume a hanger was a metal instrument for hanging meat. I can find out for the Senator and let him know.  This is to remove very old legislation with old definitions.</P>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their support, their suggestions and ideas.  I agree with what has been said by the Senators that if the Bill can have full consideration in the Seanad it will be a better Bill.  This is very important legislation.  It will strengthen the hand of the Garda in their fight against crime.  In particular it will prohibit stun guns, control crossbows through licensing and make the carrying of flick knives and other dangerous weapons an offence.  This is something which Members in this House and in the Dáil will be very happy to do, by giving support to the Garda in dealing with crime in this present day.  In conclusion, I would like to thank Senators for their support.</P>

      <Col N="1532" /> That Seanad Éireann offers its congratulations to the UNIFIL Forces on receiving the Nobel Peace Price and particularly notes the contribution of the Irish Defence Forces towards maintaining that peace in many parts of the world for the last 30 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyBromell" hpid="Mr. Bromell Mr. Bromell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bromell</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá áthas orm an deis a bheith agam anois leanúint ar aghaidh leis an méid a bhí á rá agam nuair a cuireadh an díospóireacht seo ar athló an tseachtain seo caite.  Bhí mé ag moladh fórsaí na Náisiún Aontaithe agus an pháirt ghníomhach atá glactha ag muintir na hÉireann agus trúpaí na hÉireann san bhfórsa idirnáisiúnta sin.</P>
      <P>Mar a dúirt de Valera nuair a tháinig sé ar ais go hInis tar éis a bheith gafa an uair sin: as I was saying when I was interrupted this time last week, our forces in the United Nations and the United Nations force itself have gained respect, principally in our case due to our neutrality and, secondly, due to the fact that they do not go out there on a confrontation basis: they do not go out as a colonising force, nor are they looked upon as an occupying force.  Therefore they approach their task in a very professional way.  The important thing is that they build up a relationship with the people in these areas where no peace exists, where people have had a very rough time, where people are thrown out of their living areas or exiled from their own places.  In this way they build up a relationship and a friendship with the people in these areas, particularly, for example in Lebanon today.  Therefore they are accepted there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was recalling this, particularly with regard to Lebanon, the thought struck me as to what might have happened in our situation, if in the Six Counties in Northern Ireland, a UNIFIL force had been brought in there in the late sixties and early seventies.  Perhaps in these times, when things seem to be getting worse rather than better, it is the time to look at this question again.  Even Mrs. Thatcher might be persuaded to look at the question of the introduction <Col N="1533" /> of a UNIFIL force into the Six Counties and that they could be accepted as a peacekeeping force between the various communities in the six county area.</P>
    <P>There have been many successes by the UNIFIL forces, many successes particularly by our own troops there.  I think it is important as well as to reflect on the many casualties they have suffered.  I recall over 30 years ago coming to Dublin at the time of the Niemba ambush when Captain Gleeson and some other members of the Irish force were killed there and the funerals were held here in Dublin.  We think of the many other casualties we have had, from that until quite recently, when three of our soldiers were killed in Lebanon.  It is frightening that these people who go out on a peacekeeping mission in these areas have to pay the supreme penalty of their lives. But it is done in the best interests of the people there, in the best traditions of our Army and in the best traditions of soldiering.</P>
    <P>The big question arises not so much with the dangers or the accidents that happen.  Soldiering is a dangerous occupation. Soldiers, being the professional people they are, accept the difficulties of their occupation.  We cannot accept the situation in certain areas, particularly in Lebanon, where there are forces backed by the Israeli Government and Israeli forces themselves causing more trouble for our soldiers in particular and for the UNIFIL soldiers in general.  This is not acceptable at all and definitely not acceptable to a country such as ours.  We have diplomatic relations with Israel.  We have had very friendly relations with that country since the establishment of the state of Israel.  We have had many things in common.  One thing that springs to mind especially is the question of language, about which we heard so much today and with regard to our heritage. We look with envy on the way the Israeli people were able to receive their language. We would probably say that if we had given the same amount of attention to our language or had we approached it in the same way with the same enthusiasm, <Col N="1534" /> perhaps we might have been able to do the same here.</P>
    <P>There is a President of Israel who is from Dublin.  Yet, despite the special relationship there, despite the fact that we have diplomatic relations with that country and therefore should be on a very friendly basis with them, they are and continue to be helping forces who are bombing our troops, who are firing at our troops, who are casualties and who are causing death among our troops.  Even the conduct of the Israeli army towards the members of our troops is very very questionable and something we cannot accept.  It is incumbent on the Government to make it known to the Israeli Government that this is not at all accepted and not at all tolerated and will not be tolerated by us.  The deaths we have suffered are bad enough but to think they have been added to by the unfriendly acts of what should be a friendly government is just intolerable.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise that the UN soldiers are going out on a peace mission and that our soldiers are involved in keeping the peace on a temporary basis between warring factions and, hopefully, creating the atmosphere that in time full peace will come to these areas such as Lebanon, Cyprus and the very many other areas in which the UN troops are engaged and in which to their credit our own troops were engaged as well.</P>
    <P>I was struck last week by the ceremonies in Arbour Hill.  It was one of these most moving ceremonies.  It was my first experience there &mdash; I hope it is not my last &mdash; but at least I was able to experience the moving tribute to the men of 1916 in Arbour Hill last week.  I thought of these men lying in these graves, and these were the people who really founded our national Army.  In the homily given by An tAthair Padraig Ó Fianachta from Maynooth he used the words &ldquo;Blessed are the peacemakers&rdquo;. How delighted Pearse and Connolly and the various other leaders of 1916 lying in that hallowed ground of Arbour Hill would have been to know that their successors were keeping the peace, endeavouring to keep the peace, in places such <Col N="1535" /> as Lebanon, Cyprus and the very many other area where our troops have played a heroic and very notheworthy part over the last 30 years.</P>

      <P>Without the interruption of Senator Murphy, I would hope that the peace that settled at that ceremony, the peace around the graveyard even with the ceremony going on, even with the bands playing, and the tranquility of that graveyard would transcend itself not only to the whole of Ireland, not only to that part of Ireland where peace does not exist at present, but through all areas of the world such as in Lebanon where people yearn for peace if only they were allowed to live in peace.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the new development with regard to the Garda and the involvement of the Garda in the UNIFIL forces. I think this is a most welcome development. The Army have been great here in this country.  They have been the backbone of our democracy.  They have defended our country and they have fulfilled a great task in the UN forces abroad.  I am glad that in regard to the Garda Síochána, who also have been the bulwark of our democracy here since the foundation of the State, that their expertise and their professionalism are available to the United National forces.  I wish them every success in a most difficult task that they have in Namibia.  It is a credit to our small country &mdash; I said this on the neutrality motion that was before the House &mdash; that we have gained in Europe and throughout the world a certain power, a certain precedence far in excess of our size.  It is mainly due to the fact that when we do a job we do it well; and much of that is due to our forces, both the army and, hopefully, now the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to take too much time.  The conferring of the Nobel Peace Prize on the UNIFIL forces is, of course, something that we are all <Col N="1536" /> extremely proud of.  I do not think there is anybody in this country who could be other than proud of the achievements of members of the Irish armed forces in the work of UNIFIL.  But I think the success of UNIFIL, the role of UNIFIL and the methodology used by UNIFIL invites us to reflect a little on what armies are, what armies should be, what their roles should be and what their image in society should be and, in particular, on the whole area of the use of weapons.</P>
      <P>I must say that I have profound moral reservations about some of the things that Senator Bromell referred to.  I cannot find any moral basis for the 1916 uprising by any ethic that I am aware of.  I have always said that.  I defy anybody to explain to me what the moral basis was for it.  The moral basis, in my view, was <i>post hoc</i> and subsequent and delivered when it had turned out to be something useful.  At the time it was disapproved of by virtually the entirety of Irish society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that because of a peculiarity about violence in our society that we have yet to deal with and I say it because of implications occasionally that I have somehow a less than clear view on the use of violence in our society.  In that context, however, I think that the whole world has an obligation to reflect on the whole idea of weapons and their use.  The sort of methodology use in South Lebanon by the UNIFIL forces is a methodology which has very little to do with the use of weapons and an enormous amount to do with the use of persuasion, with the use of moral authority, with gentleness towards civilians and with a sense of restraint in which firearms are rarely used &mdash; they are only used under the severest provocation and are never used in any way to impose one's will on people who are otherwise unwilling to have our views imposed upon them.  They are used entirely as a secondary and necessary defence if under threat.  I wonder, if we accept, as I think we do, that service in peacekeeping with the United Nations is perhaps one of the most important international roles of our Army, whether we should reflect on whether the image that we portray in advertising about the Army &mdash; the <Col N="1537" /> gung-ho blackened faces running through the night carrying guns, the large scale exercises in which large numbers of the enemy are in our imaginations demolished &mdash; is consistent with what their real job is, which is a job of restraint, of minimum force, of persuasion and of moral authority and whether the method of training and the methods that are used to inculcate discipline in our armed forces are the ones that best achieve that objective, or whether in fact we are in danger of having contradictory objectives.  We have this magnificent inspirational commitment to peace, a magnificent inspirational commitment to non-violence &mdash; to an extent it must be very difficult, but it seems to be done with a considerable degree of conviction by all of the UNIFFIL forces &mdash; but at the same time we convey an alternative image of aggression, of weaponary and of tough guy, macho sort of stuff.</P>
    <P>I think it is time that this whole area was talked through.  Everybody in the world will say that their own army is entirely there for peacekeeping and defensive purposes.  At the same time the obscene spectacle of armaments expenditure goes up and up.  It is close now to $1,000 billion a year.  That number should be repeated again and again &mdash; $1,000 billion a year is spent in the world on armaments.  If we are really to reflect on the significance of the role of an international peacekeeping organisation, in keeping the peace without any significant use of violence, simply by their presence and their moral authority, then we ought to think through what we expect armies to do in a world which is decreasingly unstable, which is increasingly cohesive and in which the possibility of external invasions is, thankfully &mdash; thanks in particular to the inspiring leadership that now runs the Soviet Union &mdash; far less and the world is a far safer and more peaceful place.</P>
    <P>The role of an army in a society like that is obviously one of being disciplined, of being there to support us when we are under threat but of being, above all, disciplined, peaceful, restrained and nonviolent. I do not think all of those things <Col N="1538" /> have percolated fully into the philosophical view of armed forces generally.</P>
    <P>I should like to agree with something Senator Bromell said, that is in regard to UNIFIL in particular in South Lebanon. I think it is high time that we in this country had a severe second look at the question of diplomatic relations with Israel.  If they persist and if they insist on defying every rule of international law and international morality to defend themselves against, in many cases, mythological enemies, then it is time &mdash; our Army is there to do a job of non-violence, of restraint and of peace &mdash; that we said to them: &ldquo;We are not prepared to treat you as another civilised power if your agents are responsible for the deaths of our soldiers who are there and who do not threaten you in any way and who do not threaten your allies in any way&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not call Senator Ross an interruption.  He deserves slightly better than that.  I could think of a slightly better effort but it would probably be unparliamentary.  The reason we need to express our disapproval is that Israel pretends to be one of the family of democratic nations. Nobody that I know who has visited Israel since the interfada could believe that any more.  It is an armed, sectarian tribe, determined not only to retain what it holds but to suppress those within its own self-defined boundaries who will not accept Israeli overlordship, in which armed settlers roam the streets of Jerusalem, out of uniform and carrying lethal weapons.  I do not believe that we should tolerate the pretence that this is a democracy when it arms people who attack our own people, when it often instigates the terrorists or guerillas who threaten our <Col N="1539" /> Army.  If our Army is to be allowed to do what it is supposed to do, which is to protect innocent people from interlopers from both sides, then not only must we talk well of our Army but we must talk very firmly and with great determination to those who are responsible for most of the threats to both our troops and the entire membership of UNIFIL in South Lebanon.  I do not think we can allow this pretence to go on any longer that a so-called democracy can be involved in stoking the fires of dangerous violence against our troops, who are there and who act with such enormous restraint under provocation.</P>
      <P>I want to conclude by saying again that I congratulate both UNIFIL and the Irish troops who have been, are and will be a part of UNIFIL.  I think, however, that if we are to continue with the role our Army has then the whole philosophy of the Army, the whole training of the Army and the way the Army projects itself ought to reflect peacekeeping, not aggression, restraint, not attack, and all of those things that are actually the characteristics of a peacekeeping force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to welcome the motion and to join in very sincere congratulations to the UNIFIL forces on receiving the Nobel Peace Prize.  It is a source of joy to us all as Irish people that our Army are a part of this team and rightly deserve this fine honour. Army personnel can be compelled as part of their contract to go overseas on duty. Implementation of this regulation has never been necessary to my knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personnel for some reason might decide not to travel &mdash; perhaps for obviour domestic reasons, because of health or some other compassionate reason &mdash; and this is totally acceptable.  The fact is that very often too many men are offering to take up active service overseas.  It is well known that the reason for this is they see active overseas duty as a natural part of their Army duties.  There is a chance to improve their professionalism as soldiers, and it has raised the level of the profession of the Irish soldier.  It is their <Col N="1540" /> only chance in a peacetime situation to get this experience of a full battalion active situation.  From an Army point of view it provides excellent practical training which stands to them during their Army career.</P>
    <P>There are other fringe benefits accruing &mdash; for example, the prospect of travel overseas, a chance to broaden their horizons, a chance to see and observe other nations of the world at work and at play. I am quite certain that service overseas has a positive effect on morale, which in an Army situation is very important.  As soldiers, the Irish are very highly regarded overseas.  They are seen as firm, competent soldiers.  They get on well with the locals.  I was not surprised to note that when the Chief of Staff visited the Irish headquarters in Tibnin after the recent tragedies the locals turned up in their thousands in support of the Irish involvement in the area.  The Irish clearly do build up great loyalty with the locals and that is well known throughout Army life as we know it.</P>
    <P>As a country our involvement is clearly excellent from a prestige point of view, taking our part with other nations of the world in the cause of world peace.  We have all noticed with some great pride that Irish army personnel are first to be called into any new arenas of world trouble.  I am totally convinced that we are highly respected as a force, no matter in what part of the world our troops have the honour of serving.  I am very proud of the role that many men of my own native town of Athlone, based in Custume Barracks, have played in the Irish battalions, whether it be in Lebanon, Cyprus, the Congo or other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>Senator Bromell in his speech referred to Niemba.  One of my most vivid recollections is of a letter I received from an Army friend of mine, a friend in sport, who was in Niemba in 1961.  I will never forget his letter to me at the time describing the deaths and injuries of the Irish in that infamous Niemba ambush.  He was from Athlone, he was part of the whole Western Command team who down the years have supplied their own company <Col N="1541" /> of approximately 150 officers, NCOs and men.  An average of 60 or 70 of those come from my own town and I know that they carry out their work with the pride and dignity which is necessary.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan referred to his aspiration that we should, as it were, leave down arms.  It would be wonderful if that could be the case right across the world.  Unfortunately, we are not in a perfect world and hence we are going to have situations such as we have today.</P>
    <P>I know of many cases where we would disagree totally with the actions of the Israelis.  I know too much about this, but I do not want to go into it because it would involve me commenting on very dear friends of mine who, unfortunately, lost their lives in Lebanon.  There have been tragedies.  A total of 67 men have died, some from natural causes and others in action.  The cost of world peace for this country has been enormous.  The heartbreak for the wives and families at home has been enormous.  I feel very strongly that when one of our men is killed on active overseas duty appropriate compensation should be available to the wives and families of the bereaved. Whether this be done by an extension of the Cafeinbo or Jambo schemes or other insurance schemes that are available for men and officers, or whether it be done as a State scheme or UN scheme is a matter for discussion.  I feel very strongly that compensation to the tune of £150,000 or higher should be automatically available in the event of fatality to the dependants of that particular person.  This matter should be examined immediately.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that specialist search teams are now to be part and parcel of each of the Irish battalions.  Their work will be very important and helpful.  It will involve the examination with specialist equipment of roads which Irish troops frequent.  The examination will be for roadside bombs or other explosive devices.  This will be seen as a very worth while and welcome development.</P>
    <P>Serving in the forces, whether it is at home or on active duty overseas, is carried on by our Irish soldiers with pride, <Col N="1542" /> obedience and an acceptance of the discipline of the job.  I am proud of the Irish Army and the men who have played their role in the UNIFIL forces in contributing to maintaining peace in many parts of the world for the past 30 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the motion that &ldquo;Seanad Éireann offers its congratulations to the UNIFIL forces on receiving the Nobel Peace Prize and particularly notes the contribution of the Irish Defence Forces towards maintaining that peace in many parts of the world for the past 30 years.</P>
      <P>I believe that the role the Irish Army have played and their contribution to the United Nations consistently over three decades is an exceptional record.  I am very happy to avail of the opportunity to add my praise and appreciation of the work, the dedication and, indeed, of the sacrifices of many fine young men in our Army in those 30 years.  Nineteen-fifty-eight is a long time ago.  That was when the first observer group went to Lebanon and that old Arab-Israeli border, unfortunately, is still there.  Later, in 1960 the United Nations Forces went to the Congo.  That particular service sticks in the minds of very many people because of the tragic losses that out Army suffered there.  By and large, I suppose that over the years our Army has gained from the experience of the various tasks that they so admirably carried out.  I believe that it is important that we should recognise the expertise that our Army have built up over the years, not just in the Congo or in Lebanon but indeed on the Indian-Pakistan observation mission or in Cyprus, or elsewhere.  Indeed, they are a very acceptable United Nations force in any area where there is difficulty and that I believe is because our forces have the discipline and the expertise that is readily recognisable and enables them to make a very full contribution to the work and the services that they are called upon to perform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It saddened me over the last few months to find an air of discontent expressed so very widely in this country about aspects of our Army and of our <Col N="1543" /> Defence Forces.  I would hope that the Army would take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that this situation does not continue for long.  I believe that if we are to have an Army at all then what we require is a contented, well-equipped, well-housed or billeted and adequately paid Army.  The Government must not just allow a situation to continue where discontent seems to be at all levels and is obviously fermenting there.</P>
    <P>In putting a few thoughts together for this debate I availed of the opportunity of contacting the Army Press Office.  I thought if I wanted information on the Army where better to get the official view than the Army Press Office.  I was taken aback to find that they were not in the business of giving out information, good, bad or indifferent about any aspect of the forces or the life in the forces.  That I cannot understand.  They referred me to the Department's Press Office which I found to be efficient.  They sent me on a lot of useful information for which I am very grateful.  But that leads me to the conclusion that the Army is not run by the chiefs or the generals but by the civil servants.  If that is true &mdash; and of course I do not know because I am not in a position to judge &mdash; perhaps it is not surprising there is a lot of discontent because really the people with the experience and the people involved should have an input into the general administration.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we should have a contented force.  What is the price of loyalty?  What use is an army?  What use is a defence force in this country if you cannot depend on them, if they are not loyal to the Constitution, loyal to the flag?  For that reason I would hope that the Government or any other Government would ensure that in the budget, even in difficult times from an economic point of view, would always have resources there to improve the situation so that when our troops are called upon to serve in dangerous situations in Lebanon or any other flash-point in the world they would be sent out with the most modern equipment and the latest technology possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1544" /> I was driving up this morning to the House when I passed two vehicles, armoured cars I suppose.  The number of them were ZD with three digits and if they were a day they were at least 30 years old.  I would say they saw service in the Congo itself.  How efficient and effective is that kind of equipment?</P>
    <P>I am very loathe to make a speech which would in the least reflect on the good name or the honour or the status of a force that I respect, that I depend on and look to for our security.  I am a true democrat and from that point of view we need Defence Forces to protect our interests here.  We have been fortunate in this country that our Army have had the opportunity of seeing service overseas as a contribution towards world peace. But a side effect and a spin-off of that, in my mind, is that it gives those men the experience and opportunity of seeing service that perhaps would not have been available to them otherwise.  From that point of view it is indeed very fortunate that our country can serve the United Nations and other peoples in the world by putting at the disposal of the United Nations the cream of our Defence Forces, a force that has always served the name of Ireland and the flag with great credit and with great distinction.  Therefore, in this motion tonight we can very sincerely offer our congratulations to the Defence Forces and every single person in our Army because it is a contribution that is made by every serving soldier in the entire force.</P>
    <P>I would like to avail of this opportunity a Chathaoirligh, in expressing my congratulations to our soldiers, to just ask the Minister, who I am sure would wish to maintain that tremendous loyalty and that tremendously high standard of service, to ensure that we are able to maintain those qualities by providing adequate funds to maintain our equipment for the Army at the most modern peak possible. I do not think we can afford to have an Army if it is not one that can claim and can demonstrate that it has the very latest in modern technology and equipment so as to ensure that our people are not at a disadvantage anywhere.</P>

      <Col N="1545" /> With those few remarks, may I again offer my warmest congratulations to the forces and assure them that in whatever way I, as a Member of the Oireachtas can be helpful in contributing towards their well being I would wish to do so?  I hope that this House will always ensure that we have respect for their work and that we look to them to serve the Constitution as the writers and founders of the Constitution desired.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we would all agree that the Irish Army have brought us credit down through the years.  Right from the foundation of the State they have always upheld the rule of law.  They defended us in the wartime emergency. They have served our needs on Border duty against terrorism and then they have served abroad, uplifting the name of Ireland in their peacekeeping role.  They were taken for granted.  We never considered the Army as playing an important role.  People were inclined to just overlook them until we had the terrible tragedy in the Belgian Congo with the Balubas.  Then we realised that the Army were serving an international need and at the same time serving this country well and giving us a great name abroad.  Their peacekeeping role is perhaps the one for which they are best known and especially their role in Lebanon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Their role in Lebanon is a very dubious role because they are in South Lebanon with the approval of Israel to keep the peace, to keep warring factions apart, but Israel has not respected the Irish Army. Israel has a militia there who have constantly attacked the Irish Army and Israel has disgraced itself in the process.  Israel's terrorist tactics at present are the cause of the tragedies among Irish soldiers and the Irish families who are mourning their lost ones.  We may have to reconsider the role of the Irish Army in Lebanon if Israel refuses to respect international law. Israel is a member of the United Nations. The Irish Army is in Lebanon with the approval and by direction of the United Nations and here we have Israel, through their paid militia, attacking the Irish Army and they have never been brought <Col N="1546" /> to justice on this point.  I think we should be acting in the United Nations and making Israel explain her role, particularly in South Lebanon where they employ this lawless militia, if I may say so.</P>
    <P>It is all the more sad because the Jewish people are a wonderful race.  They have contributed very positively to every country to which they have gone to reside and we are very proud to have the Jewish community in Ireland.  That is why it is all the more sad because they suffered and the holocaust is a glaring example of the terrible sufferings and tragedy of the Jewish people.  They, more than anyone else in the world, should be respecting the rights and sympathising with the rights of dispossessed people.  The Palestinians are dispossessed people, without land, without occupation, with nothing.  Here we have them rising against their inhuman treatment on the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank.  These are people with no lands, no homes, with nothing, being treated worse than the Jewish people were treated by the Nazi Hitler.  I think it is a terrible indictment of Israel that she should carry on in this ruthless, callous fashion against these people.  This is relevant here because it is the Israeli Government's attitude that is responsible for the Irish Army being in Lebanon today.</P>
    <P>Their obstinacy in refusing to negotiate with the Palestinians to seek some settlement for them, is the reason why our Army are in Lebanon today and why the Army are being put down over and over again.  We are losing very important members of our Army to the inexpressible grief of their families.  I would say that the good Jewish people in every country which has welcomed them should be loud and strong in condemning the Israeli Government for their actions.  I feel that the Irish representatives at the United Nations should make their voices heard in denouncing Israel and letting them know that civilised people will not tolerate what we have seen on television where innocent victims have been struck down by the Israeli soldiers.</P>
    <P>Their attitude and the way they are <Col N="1547" /> carrying on at the moment makes me wonder if Israel should continue to belong to the civilised nations of the world in the forum of the United Nations. I would think our Army have a role to play as a peacekeeping force but it was never meant to be subjected to this terrible slaughter that can happen.  I feel proud that we have a great Army.  I was very upset when I saw the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme which sought to hold our Army up to ridicule and I will say in many a country that programme would be considered to be treasonable because it exposed defects in our Army which would be of great value to terrorists. Terrorists might be inclined to think that our Army could not defend us and I thought that it was a very irresposible programme for a national station to produce.</P>
    <P>Of course the Army do not have the most modern equipment.  We are not the wealthiest country in the world.  We do not say we are.  We do not try to be.  This country has gone through an economic crisis in the last few years.  We cannot just pour out the money but there are dedicated men in that Army who have not raised their voices and all this talk about disquiet in the Army to me was media hype, unnecessary and irresponsible, because men I have spoken to in the Army are contented and there is a very big waiting list of people who want to join the Army, including a great number of ex-soldiers who want to return.  If the conditions were as bad as some of the media would have us believe, why is it so many people are on the waiting list to get into the Irish Army?</P>

      <P>I will try not to stray any longer except to say that the Army have done us credit.  We can be very proud of them and they have worked in an unobtrusive way and I doubt if any of us could ever say they have been guilty <Col N="1548" /> of discourtesy towards civilians on any occasion.  Never once in the execution of their duty have they ever been discourteous. They are the most courteous people I have ever come across and carry out their duties in a very unobtrusive way.  Besides offering them the congratulations of this House I feel we should consider how, in other ways, we can pay our respect to them and pay tribute to the Army.</P>
      <P>In wartime, armies in Britain have been very favourably treated by the public with special concessions for different functions and we should look at this idea and show our gratitude to them by the public and business, perhaps offering special concessions to them and in this way convey to them that we are very proud of the work they are doing, very happy that they received the Nobel Peace Prize.  They well deserve it for their work. I feel in this way we might show our appreciation in a practical way.</P>

      <P>Yes, agus go mbeidh ár leithéide aris ann.  I rise to support the motion.  One little niggling criticism perhaps &mdash; instead of the term, &ldquo;Irish Defence Forces,&rdquo; which annoys me rather in the motion, I would prefer to see &ldquo;our&rdquo; Defence Forces.  There is a post-colonial habit in this country of referring to the Irish Army as if it was necessary to distinguish it from the British Army.</P>
      <P>I am glad that this motion stands in the name of Fine Gael.  Before I come to that, however, I would like to say that I was very interested in the contributions made by Senator Bromell and Senator Ryan.  While I do not want to get into irrelevant arguments about the origins of our Army, I am inclined to think that there is a far stronger historical case for saying that our modern Army is in fact the descendent of the National Army of 1922.  It certainly stems from that most decisive event in our history when the Army was firmly put it its place by the civilian Government, a critical point in our history.  Whatever Senator McDonnell would say about the Army being dominated by its civil servants, I certainly am extremely happy that the Army is dominated by a civilian Government and long may it remain so.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan is a pacifist who really cannot justify his pacifism.  He does not like armies as such.  If they are to be there at all, he says, they have to do their work by blandishments and by kindliness.  But in fact, this is a contradiction in terms. Of course the Army must &mdash; as indeed it is doing in Lebanon &mdash; use the milk of human kindness.  In the last analysis, the Army is the ultimate sanction of the Government.  It is the ultimate guarantee of law and order.  In our situation in Ireland, it is the ultimate protection against the terrorism of the Provos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moving on from that, I am glad to see that it was Fine Gael who put down this motion, because Fine Gael are the unfortunate victims of certain anti-national smears which were attached to them in the past and somehow that impression lingers that Fine Gael is rather less national than Fianna Fáil, which is, of <Col N="1550" /> course, totally unjustified.  I am glad to see that Fine Gael are as concerned with things like the position of the Army in the UNIFIL forces and some weeks ago, Fine Gael, in this House effectively vindicated our neutrality policy.  I was delighted that Senator Manning and the party officially in this House gave the lie to the individual Fine Gael people who have been sniping away at neutrality over the last several months.  Their putting down this motion reinforces my view that there is a by-partisanship at work here among the two main parties on the most important issues of neutrality and the role we should be playing in the world at large.</P>
    <P>The United Nations have limited but important functions in the international order of things.  I think when the League of Nations collapsed back in the thirties and when it was quite clear that it could not keep the peace, there were very pessimistic predictions about what the United Nations would be able to achieve when it was founded in 1945.  Of course it was not, and has not been able to influence super-power politics.  Of course, the United Nations cannot keep the peace in the sense of guaranteeing us against nuclear disaster.  The ultimate ambition we all have, I hope, is that there will be a world federal government, so that just as armies nationally have been put under the control of democratic governments, finally the presence of physical force in the whole world will be controlled by a federal government, but we are a long way away from that.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the most valuable function the United Nations has to perform is to damp down flashpoints across the world. Over the last 45 years it has, by and large, succeeded very well in that.  Our contribution to that has been disproportionately important.  Of that I am sure we all feel proud.</P>
    <P>As I say, I am pleased that there is a consensus between our two main parties and indeed among the Independents as well as to the kind of role we should be playing in world politics in making our modest but effective contribution to the maintenance of peace.  It is sometimes <Col N="1551" /> said by those who have advocated in recent times that we should join a military pact, that we would be equally effective and equally welcome as a peacekeeping contingent were we to become members of NATO, were we to become members of the European Defence Pact.</P>
    <P>Such arguments point to the exmaple of Sweden or Canada.  It is argued that Sweden is armed, that Canada is a member of NATO and yet they are as acceptable peacekeeping forces as our armies.  But the whole point is this, that our special acceptability, particularly in Lebannon, is because we are recognised as a neutral country, because we are recognised as a country which has no imperial past, and were we to join a military pact now or at any time in the future, we would forfeit that respect and that special acceptability which we have as a neutral country.  I see the issue of neutrality and the issue of our role in international peacekeeping forces as being vitally linked.  I would hope then that Members will accept my point that there is an agreeable connection between the neutrality motion we had here some weeks ago and the Fine Gael motion that we are supporting tonight.</P>
    <P>As Senator Ryan said, the most remarkable feature of the behaviour of our forces in Lebanon is apparently their peaceable and friendly manner.  Whatever faults we have as a people, there is no doubt that our traditional friendliness and intimacy does pay dividends in that kind of difficult situation.  The greatest tribute to our foces out there was when after the recent tragic killings of Irish soldiers the local people apparently were very anxious that we should not pull out of Lebanon, that we are, as I say, especially acceptable to them in a particular way.</P>
    <P>I have always pointed out abroad when I talk about Irish foreign policy what an agreeable and pleasant paradox it is that in the light of the historical image of the Irishman, as the fighting Irishman, the troublesome Paddy, that our actual role in the world today is the very opposite. That we should have come out of history, <Col N="1552" /> out of a turbulent history, to become peacekeepers, I think says a lot for some of the satisfactory outcomes of our tragic history.  I am very pleased by that particular paradox.</P>
    <P>The point has already been made that the behaviour of our soldiers has raised the image of our Army at home.  There was a time, back in the thirties, perhaps before World War II, when our Army was derided by subversive forces as chocolate soldiers and so on.  That day is long past.  The price paid in the Congo in 1960-1961 was a high price but it did earn a new respect for our Army, which still persists.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that Senator O'Connell, who might care to wait for one minute more did not convince me when he said that the discontent in the Army was largely a matter of media hype.</P>
    <P>I know this is not strictly relevant but the suggestion has been made that the motivation of some of those who want to go abroad to serve in the UNIFIL forces is a less than perfect motivation &mdash; that they go there because they need the money, they need the extra allowances and so on.  I would hate to think that this was true.  Senator O'Connell surely cannot ignore the fact that the Minister for Defence is enormously unpopular with the Army and with the spouses of the Army.  There have been events like&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is very easy for us to say that they have died in a noble cause but that does not bring them back, that does not ease the heartbreak of those relatives but it may be a consolation to them to know that we feel that if it is never right to kill for a cause and if it is always regrettable that one should have to die for a cause you could not die for a more noble cause than bringing peace to mankind at an international level.

      <P>It is with great pleasure that I address this motion commending the award of the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations Peacekeeping Forces.  As Senators are aware the congratulations of the Government have been conveyed to the Defence Forces by <Col N="1555" /> the Taoiseach in a message to the Chief of Staff and also by the Tánaiste in his address to the United Nations General Assembly.</P>
      <P>The Nobel committee, when announcing the award in Oslo on 29 September last, said the prize was awarded because the Peacekeepers:</P>
      <P>Represent the manifest will of the community of nations to achieve peace through negotiations, and the Forces have through their presence made a decisive contribution towards the initiation of actual peace negotiations.</P>
      <P>The same day the UN Secretary General Mr. Perez de Cuellar told the General Assembly.</P>
      <P>The prize is a tribute to the idealism of all those who have served the organisation, and in particular to the courage and sacrifices of all those who have contributed and continue to contribute, to the peacekeeping operations.</P>
      <P>These quotations I believe set out clearly and concisely why the award of the prize was such an inspired and well merited choice.</P>
      <P>Although not directly provided for in the UN charter, peacekeeping has become one of the principal instruments available to the Security Council in discharging its responsibility under the charter to safeguard international peace and security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be useful to set out here the definition of a peacekeeping operation followed by the Secretary General in this reports to the Security Council.  It is an operation involving military personnel, but without enforcement powers, established by the UN to help maintain or restore peace in areas of conflict.  Such operations are normally established by the Security Council and directed by the Secretary General.  Military personnel are provided on a voluntary basis by member states.  If deployed as observers such personnel are unarmed; if deployed as a peacekeeping force, they are lightly armed for defensive purposes only.  May <Col N="1556" /> I say here that the equipment they are provided with and which they have in Lebanon is first class and enables them to fully carry out the duties they have been assigned.  A key principle is that they are deployed with the agreement of the host Government.  Their task clearly is both sensitive and difficult.</P>
    <P>In the past year in particular the UN has been called upon to assist in the resolution of a number of grave regional crises &mdash; in Afghanistan, Iran/Iraq and Namibia, and all of which peacekeeping and observer forces are key elements. The UN continues its involvement in long-standing peacekeeping operations in the Middle East, with the UN truce supervision organisation and UNIFIL, and in other areas such as Cyprus and IndiáPakistan.  These missions have the crucial task of preventing international conflicts and providing a framework for the negotiated settlement of disputes.  At great personal risk-and almost 740 peacekeepers have died while serving the UN-those involved further the cause of peace.</P>
    <P>Ireland has always considered the United Nations to be the principal forum for the resolution of inter-nation conflict. We are a small, neutral country and therefore have a particular interest in the establishment of an international order based on the observance of international law, rather than on force of arms.  We have consistently acknowledged that the UN peacekeeping apparatus is a key mechanism in establishing international stability, and our commitment to UN peacekeeping is reflected in our long and proud record of involvement in a dozen different peacekeeping operations.  Irish troops have served almost 32,000 tours of duty with peacekeeping missions.  The men and women of the Defence Forces, and more recently of the Garda Síochána, have made important and selfless contributions over the last 31 years; some have tragically been called on to make the ultimate sacrifice, and it is this group who are particularly in our minds as we reflect on the Nobel Peace Prize award today.  As Senator Loughrey has stated, Irish troops have lost their lives in four missions.  Twenty-six died in the Congo, <Col N="1557" /> of whom 16 were killed in action; nine died in Cyprus; two were killed in action with the Truce Supervision Organisation in Palestine; and 30 have died in the Lebanon, some 12 killed in action.</P>

      <P>The roll of honour of our Defence Forces serving with UN peacekeeping forces thus lists some 67 fatalities; we honour their memory this evening with pride.  In addition, some 85 Defence Forces personnel have been awarded medals by the Government to honour acts of gallantry and distinguished service with UN missions.</P>
      <P>It is entirely fitting that we should seize this opportunity to comment on the ways these peacekeeping missions seek to achieve their aims, and on the obstacles that they face in doing so.  Peacekeeping missions need the full support of all United Nations member states, including the five permanent members of the Security Council.  Peacekeeping operations are not an end in themselves.  They are temporary arrangements intended to provide a framework for the negotiated settlement of disputes.  The aim of a peacekeeper is to make himself redundant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Successful peacekeeping operations need the appropriate financial as well as political commitment of the UN member states.  The failure of individual States to pay assessed contributions threatens the <Col N="1558" /> ability of an operation to function.  Failure to discharge financial obligations under the UN Charter may also have political implications.  Such failure may be interpreted by parties to a conflict as implying a lack of support for the mandate of a particular operation.  If some member states pick and choose those observer and peacekeeping missions to which they will make or withhold their mandatory financial contributions, individual operations may be undermined; worse, the whole concept of UN peacekeeping, on which so many hopes are now hanging, could be emptied of credibility.</P>
    <P>The greatest strength of the Blue Helmets, as UN peacekeepers are sometimes referred to, is undoubtedly their commitment to peaceful solutions while retaining the confidence of all parties and the support of the international community as expressed in the UN.  Their effectiveness depends not on the strength of their weaponry but on the risks they are willing to undergo in a clearly identified and worthwhile cause.  Unarmed military observers and units armed only minimally can be more important to the success of the operation than an assertive military presence.</P>
    <P>Lt. General Gustav Hagglund, a former commander of UNIFIL, has accurately said that a UN &ldquo;peace soldier&rdquo; must be above all &ldquo;calm, patient, loyal and courageous&rdquo;.  I may say that Irish soldiers have shown all of these qualities in ample measure.  Much of the success of peacekeeping operations depends on the good sense of the individual soldier. He may find himself on duty, for example, at a busy checkpoint under trying conditions.  As General Bill Callaghan, himself a distinguished former UN force commander, has said, &ldquo;There are no generals or diplomats at check points&rdquo;.  Well, perhaps there are no generals, but the individual soldier who maintains a sense of humour and carries out his task in a humane way and with a lightness of touch frequently finds himself cast in the role of diplomat, not only diplomat but friend.  By all accounts, Irish soldiers display considerable social skills and diplomacy in their contact with the <Col N="1559" /> local populations.  It is this skill which makes their contribution so valuable in difficult circumstances and to which I should like to pay a special tribute in this House tonight.</P>
    <P>Some 890 Irish personnel are at present involved in seven peacekeeping missions. They do an important, and, as we have regretfully seen recently, an often dangerous job.  The largest Irish contingent in a peacekeeping mission at present is that serving with UNIFIL, numbering some 748 personnel.  UNIFIL was set up in 1978 with the mandate of confirming the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Southern Lebanon, restoring international peace and security and restoring the effective authority of the Government of Lebanon.  The Force was set up on an interim basis, as are all UN peacekeeping operations.  Sadly, it has not been possible to achieve its aims thus far.</P>
    <P>The bravery and effectiveness of the Irish contingent has been evident on many occasions, and no doubt played a part in securing the award of the Nobel Peace Prize for the UN peacekeeping forces.  However, we cannot overlook the unsatisfactory political background against which they are operating and which makes their task all the more difficult and dangerous.  Israel refuses to withdraw from Southern Lebanon and to dismantle the co-called &ldquo;security-zone&rdquo;, which overlaps with the Irish battalion's area of operations.  This has created an inherently unstable situation which seriously undermines UNIFIL's efforts to ease tension and restore peace to the area.</P>
    <P>Tragically, on 24 February last, Private Michael McNeela became the eighth Irish soldier to die in Lebanon as a result of hostile fire.  The Israeli-backed &ldquo;South Lebanon Army&rdquo; was responsible.  Ireland and the UN made strong protests to the Israeli authorities.  We stressed again that we wish to see the full implementation of the UNIFIL mandate, which includes the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanese territory.</P>
    <P>On 21 March last, Corporal Fintan <Col N="1560" /> Heneghan, Private Mannix Armstrong and Private Thomas Walsh were killed by a landmine near Brashit village.  Investigations are continuing in order to establish responsibility for this latest outrage.</P>
    <P>These tragic losses and the continuing high risks to the security of UNIFIL personnel are a direct consequence of the unsatisfactory political situation in the area.  It is worth repeating, however, that the UN Secretary-General has reported that UNIFIL plays a valuable role in controlling the level of violence in Southern Lebanon.  To withdraw it, in his view, would risk an unpredictable conflagration in a most volatile region, and would make the search for national reconciliation even more difficult.</P>
    <P>His observations go to the heart of the function of UN peacekeeping.  Without it, many areas of the world would become breeding grounds of ever-widening international armed conflict, at an incalculable cost to mankind as a whole. Where peacekeeping missions have been set up, as in the recent past in Afghanistan, Iran/Iraq and Namibia, a potential conflagration can be tackled and the path towards lasting international peace can be opened.  For this reason, more than any other, the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the UN peacekeeping forces was fully merited and is to be sincerely welcomed.</P>
    <P>I have great pleasure in being fully associated with the motion before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that Senator Hogan and Senator Doyle have to come to some arrangement about dividing their time, so there are 15 minutes between the two of you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the motion so ably proposed by my colleague, Senator Loughrey, congratulating the UNIFIL Forces on receiving the Nobel Peace Prize and acknowledging the contribution that Irish Defence Forces have made to peacekeeping over 30 years.  I was glad Colin McGrath from Carlow was one of the 15 members chosen to represent the <Col N="1561" /> UNIFIL Forces at the ceremony in Oslo last December.  It is fitting that we in this House should seek to support at all times the people who strengthen the institutions of our State and as Senator Murphy quite rightly pointed out, the last line of defence that any Government have in relation to upholding order in the State is the Army.</P>
      <P>The peacekeeping activities that have gone on and in which Irish Defence Forces have been very much involved go back to 1960 in the Congo where the manadate was to maintain the peace. This was probably the toughest mandate of all given to a United Nations Force. Between 1964 and 1973 our involvement in Cyprus is well recognised and there is still a small presence of 12 soldiers from Ireland in that area.  In the Sinai Desert in 1973 we had a limited peacekeeping role because of the outbreak of violence in Northern Ireland.  Many of the soldiers who had been despatched to the Middle East at the time were brought home for peacekeeping duty in Ireland.</P>
      <P>In 1978 Irish Defence Forces became involved in UNIFIL in Lebanon and they rotate every six months.  The Irish have built up a tremendous reputation in peacekeeping, particularly in the Middle East.  This was best exemplified in recent times by even the Arab community acknowledging the tremendous contribution that the Irish delegation have made.  When they came under fire in recent times and when there was a threat to the involvement of the Irish Defence Forces in UNIFIL in the future, the Arab Community made representations to the Irish Government and to the commanders of UNIFIL in the area to ensure that the Irish presence continued.  In fact the contribution to international peace is the strongest motivating factor that any defence force could have in its contribution to the United Nations in various parts of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Government have agreed to continue our involvement even in the light of serious loss of life and in the light of serious pressure being put on the Irish Government because of indiscriminate action by a number of groups in the <Col N="1562" /> Middle East.  It places the country in a good international light in the international community, but also the Irish Defence Forces in particular under UNIFIL have helped to reconstruct communities and they have a tremendous stabilising effect on the local area.  It is not just peacekeeping that they are involved in but in the dispensing of medical aid; in assisting the community there to protect their schools and to protect their community from being shot at by the South Lebanese army; and they have forfeited many of the schools and protected the children admirably in recent times in particular.  The local community there recognise this and have come to accept that the protection of their children from the threat of guerrilla activity has become part of the way of life in that particular region at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to support the motion congratulating the UN Peace-keeping Forces on receiving the Nobel Prize and the contribution made by the Irish Defence Forces in the cause of peace over the last 30 years.</P>
      <P>The peacekeeping forces of the United Nations have under extremely difficult conditions contributed to the cause of peace.  It was the considered opinion of the Norwegian Nobel Committee that the peacekeeping forces through their efforts have made an important contribution towards the realisation of one of the fundamental tenets of the United Nations, thus the world organisations has come to play a central part in world affairs and has been invested with increasing trust. The peacekeeping forces are recruited from among the young people of many nations who in keeping with their ideals voluntarily take on demanding and hazardous services in the cause of peace.  In the opinion of the Nobel Prize Committee their efforts contributed in a particular appropriate way towards the realisation of the goals of the United Nations.  The UN peacekeeping forces may only be employed when both parties to a conflict accept their presence. Accordingly they may also be used by the warring parties to avoid having a conflict escalate and in the event also to have a struggle called off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two types of peacekeeping <Col N="1566" /> operations, unarmed observer groups and lightly armed forces.  The latter are only allowed to employ their weapons for self-defence.  Altogether, 14 UN operations have been carried out.  They are equally divided between observer groups and military forces.  The observer groups are concerned with gathering information for the United Nations about actual conditions prevailing in the area. The military forces are entrusted with more extended tasks such as keeping parties to a conflict apart and maintaining law and order.</P>
    <P>Our nation has played an important role in assisting the UN peacekeeping force.  The Irish Army have had the distinction of providing three commanders of the UN forces, Lieutenant-General Seán McKeown in the Congo in 1961, the late Major General James Quinn in Cyprus in 1972, and Lieutenant General Bill Callaghan in the Lebanon between 1981 and 1986.  We have also suffered our share of casualties.  In the Congo between 1961 and 1964, 26 members of the Defence Forces were killed in action. In assisting the UNIFIL Forces in the Lebanon to date, 11 members of the Defence Forces have been killed in action.</P>
    <P>Since we first sent Army personnel to the UN peacekeeping forces in 1958, over 35,000 members of the Irish Defence Forces have participated in this peace-keeping activity.  This is a great credit to a small nation.  The function of the UN is to keep peace.  Peace is a word that evokes the simplest and most cherished dream of humanity.  Peace is, and has always been, the ultimate human aspiration. Yet our history overwhelmingly shows that while we speak continually of peace, our actions tell a different story. Peace is a very easy word in any language. The Secretary General, delivering the Nobel lecture in Oslo on 9 January 1989, stated:</P>
    <P>I hear so frequently from many different mouths and different sources that it sometimes seems to me to be a general incantation more or less deprived of practical meaning.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1567" /> Then he asked the question; what do we mean by peace?  Human nature being what it is, peace must inevitably be a relative condition.  The essence of life is struggle and competition and to that extent perfect peace is also a meaningless abstraction.  The essence of peacekeeping is the use of soldiers as a catalyst for peace rather than an instrument of war. It is to that ideal that the United Nations have before its office in New York the inscription which is taken from the prophet Isaiah, Chapter 2:</P>
    <P>They shall beat their swords into plough shares and their spears into pruning forks.  Nation shall not lift sword against nation, neither shall they war ever again.</P>
    <P>It is the bravery of young men and women who have given their services to this ideal that we salute here tonight by the passing of this motion.  It is also the memory of those who have made a great sacrifice, the greatest sacrifice that mankind can make, the giving of one's life in peace, that we commemorate here tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with other Senators in offering congratulations to the UNIFIL Forces serving with the United Nations.  The reputation and respect the Irish troops have gained in that force is largely due to the training they received at home.  I would like on this occasion to compliment the men who have trained to such a very high standard here in Ireland.  Our soldiers are trained second to none.  That automatically earns them the respect they so rightly have received within the UNIFIL Forces.  We recognise that we are safe with a good soldier.  There is a very old cliché that there is nothing as dangerous as a bad soldier.  I believe we have the best professional soldiers in the world.  On this occasion, when we refer to them in the Seanad, we should commend the highly professional training of our Army.  It is right to recognise their low accident rate at home and abroad.  The <Col N="1568" /> answer to that is high professional training. The Seanad should be complimenting the standard the Army attain at home which earns them respect when they serve abroad.  That point has to be recognised.</P>
      <P>I am not much different from any other person in Ireland let him be a public representative or a private citizen.  When our Army are serving abroad and we lose some of our troops we have to question the wisdom of maintaining relations with Israel.  Their explanations are not satisfactory. I accept that the Minister and the Government are pursuing inquiries and that those inquiries are not complete but there is one incident after another to the point when most Irish people do not accept that they are accidents.  It is tragic that the Israeli people who have suffered so much now have so little concern for life, especially those men from other countries who are serving in a dangerous area and helping to keep the peace.  I would urge that we examine the value of having diplomatic relations with Israel. The time has come when we must look at this matter, I urge the Minister and the Government to closely examine continuing relations with Israel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senators who put down the motion, which I totally support, used the motion to refer to pay and disquiet in the Army.  It would have been more prudent to put down another motion for another day if they want to be really constructive and helpful to the Army and discuss pay and conditions because we might have a positive contribution to make.  I have one little recommendation which I ask the Minister to take on board.  Most of our troops abroad serve over six months.  Any person who lives in another country more than six months is entitled to bring back a car free of duty or VAT to this country. Our Army personnel are not allowed to do this.  I ask the Minister to examine the possibility of Army personnel who serve abroad for periods longer than six months being treated like other citizens of this State, namely, to purchase a car abroad and import it in the normal way.  That would be a perk for them.  I believe other countries who have troops serving with <Col N="1569" /> UNIFIL give those perks to their Army personnel serving abroad.  It would be a small token of appreciation.  I ask the Minister to examine the situation.  I have information to support my statement. The Minister should sympathetically examine the possibility of extending those facilities to our troops serving abroad.  The motion has been useful.  It has given us an opportunity to express our support for our Army and for the gallant work they are doing on behalf of the nation.</P>

      <P>My thanks to Senator McGowan: I rise because I have had the honour of addressing a senior officers course at the Curragh on three occasions now.  I believe I have some feeling for what the Army are striving to do.  I certainly would like to be associated with the congratulations which have been given in this House tonight and I would like to emphasise that, as I see it, peacemaking is part of a whole philosophy of positive neutrality.</P>
      <P>It is very rapidly apparent when you go to the Curragh that the Army is no longer just a matter of bearing weapons. It involves very high powered education, an understanding of politics, an understanding of the history of the region you are going to police as a peacemaker, an understanding of United Nations law and of the law of the local community, of the customs and even the religious feelings of the local people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As another Senator said, it is the question of being a diplomat with a high emphasis on the humanitarian function. If we are to achieve this we must have high morale.  It is remarkable how high the morale is in the Irish Army considering the difficulties it has had to face. It relies on equipment, recruitment, training and education, and all these things require funding from the State.  If I may make one positive suggestion in relation to a tribute we might pay our Army for the way it has been associated <Col N="1570" /> with this Nobel Prize?  We should look at the shortfall in recruitment and ask ourselves if it is possible to use the capital revenue saved because of that shortfall and put it back into the Army to give them the things they need to keep up morale and to encourage recruitment so that we will fulfil what I see as Ireland's role in the world, which is a peacemaking, positively neutral role.  In my opinion what does not include joining such organisations as NATO or even the Eastern European Union but continuing to play a distinctively independent role in the affairs of the world.  With the relationships we have with North America, the Third World and the European Community. I think that so far we have achieved that function with honour and no doubt we will continue to do so.  I hope and trust that I or if not my children, will live to see an Ulster regiment in the peacemaking Army of Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Minister in strong language about the conflict in the Middle-East, which is stronger than anything I have ever heard from a Minister of this Government or the other Government, lays the blame for the tragic death of Private Michael Neela squarely at the foot of Israel.

      <Col N="1571" /> Ireland and the UN made strong protests to the Israeli authorities.</P>
    <P>I have little quarrel with that but it is very dangerous for the Government and for Members of the Government here tonight to take what are very obvious sides in the Middle East and in the conflict in the Middle East when this Government and Governments before have refused point blank to open formal diplomatic relations with Israel.  There has been a constant refusal by the Government to allow the Isreali Government to set up an embassy here.  It would be far more convincing for the Government to make protests about what is happening&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It would be far more helpful if the Government had allowed the Israeli Government to establish a diplomatic presence here and not refused it.  Instead of making protests to what the Minister calls the authorities, which is very nonspecific, first, it would have been possible presumably to call in the ambassador and secondly, presumably, it would have facilitated communication with the Israeli Government before this tragedy happened. I see in this speech the sort of humbug that we are used of getting from our Department of Foreign Affairs here. Maybe the Minister could have said, when he chastised the State of Israel who are doing many things which are wrong in the Middle East, why the Government will not open diplomatic relations with <Col N="1572" /> them and why they will not allow a presence here.  That would be a move towards peace, it would be a move towards dialogue and it would be a help in that conflict.</P>
      <P>In saying that I do not want to take away anything from the magnificant work which the UNIFIL Forces are doing in the Lebanon, nor from the great work they have done in Cyprus, in the Congo and in other countries in the past.  That should not be in doubt.  Indeed, this motion will obviously be passed by the House.  This motion has turned out strangely having being a soft motion which had all party support.  It has been a quite controversial motion because of things which were said in this debate, not just by the Minister, but by Senator Ryan, who feels diplomatic relations with Israel would be re-examined.  If that is to be taken up we should also say: &ldquo;Let us reexamine diplomatic relations with Iran with Libya and with terrorist States of that sort&rdquo;.  Let us not just take a once off target, let us take the other targets which we are refusing for some reason to face up to.  There is an Iranian Embassy here. We have diplomatic relations with Libya, and yet we refuse to allow a Israeli Embassy.</P>

      <P>I will reply to the Minister's speech.  I do not wish to take away from the unanimity of support for the great work being done by our Army in keeping the peace throughout the world.  Senator Bromell &mdash; I presume a reference to him will not be interrupted by the Chair &mdash; referred to the Army as being the successors of 1916 without interruption.  It is not a statement which should be allowed to go through this House uncontradicted. I believe it is a poor reflection on our Army in the 1980s, which is the arm of a democratically elected Government, that they should be referred to as the descendants of those who rebelled without any democratic mandate at all.  It is the Provisional IRA who claim to be the descendants of the 1916 people.  The Provisional IRA have more justification for it than do our Army, many of whom have died keeping the peace throughout the world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing that strikes me is the series of ironies in the debate, first of all, the award of a Nobel prize for peace in honour of the Swedish industrial magnate who made a colossal fortune from the production of dynamite, but considering some of the recipients of that award, who have been less than totally committed to peace, perhaps that is not entirely surprising.  However, I would like to join with the positive sentiments of other Senators in expressing my congratulations to the Irish Army and to say in, of course a totally non political way, <Col N="1574" /> that I hope that members of the Irish Army actually see some of the money or at least the United Nations use it to sustain an operation which limps from budgetary crisis to budgetary crisis despite the chorus of unanimous approval from all over the world about their efforts.  This approval seems to weaken slightly when countries are asked to pay for it and I would like to say that this country has a proud record in that respect although many of the larger countries do not.</P>
      <P>In mentioning the question of money I am in the tradition of a late Senator of this House who actually won the Nobel prize, Senator Raith Yeats, who when he was telephoned by the editor of <i>The Irish Times</i> to be told that he had won the Nobel prize, asked the remarkably realistic and non poetic question, &ldquo;how much is it?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>However, there is a really serious side to this debate, in addition to these partly light hearted comments, that is that we have witnessed what I consider an exceedingly serious development here tonight.  It is about time that we realised what is happening.  There is a curious development of foreign policy going on outsides the confines of this Chamber, with no accountability to this Chamber, apparently outside the confines of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>Early today I drew the attention of the House to the misuse of the word &ldquo;Palestine&rdquo;.  I drew the attention of the House to the fact that we did have, <i>pace</i> my distinguished colleague on my right, Senator Ross &mdash; the Minister is probably right here &mdash; diplomatic relations with Israel.  Senator Ross is perfectly correct when he says that they are not full.  It is disingenuous of the Minister to say that we are just simply waiting for them to be confirmed.  My information &mdash; perhaps the Department of Foreign Affairs, who are pullings the strings behind the scenes here will confirm this &mdash; is that that arrangement has been terminated on the Israeli side.  Before anybody suggests that this is not relevant to the debate, because it certainly is, I would like to point out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am doing precisely that.  I am commenting directly on the Minister's speech.  I would like to make it perfectly clear where this is relevant.  I refer to the Minister's speech where he says, having said previously, inaccurately, that we lost two soldiers in Palestine:</P>
      <P>We have recognised the State of Israel</P>
      <P>I am referring directly to the substance of the Minister's speech.  I understand I am entitled to do so.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>However, we cannot overlook the unsatisfactory political background against which they are operating and which makes their task all the more difficult and dangerous.</P>
      <P>It is clear, when one is discussing the peacekeeping role of UNIFIL, as we are in this motion &mdash; I doubt if anybody could challenge that &mdash; that it is relevant to discuss the political machinery by which conflict is avoided.  When we have soldiers from UNIFIL in the Middle East, is that not precisely the time, when we need diplomatic representation, to be able to intervene directly?  It seems to me to be perfectly clear that this is what is needed.</P>

      <P>Yes, without interruption would be a very good idea.  The most substantial points I wished to make have been made.  I would like, however, simply to end on a note of congratulations because I have had the opportunity to be in Beirut, not in any hostile sense but merely lecturing on the works of James Joyce, and I have had the opportunity to meet some of the men of the UNIFIL forces.  I am aware from my Lebanese friends and also from my contacts with members of the Irish contingent of UNIFIL, how very highly valued indeed their services are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank at this stage Senators Ross and Norris for giving me part of their time.  Essentially much of what is to be said on this motion has already been said.  The Minister has said a lot of the things I intended saying. Basically, the area I would like to home in on briefly is the 67 fatalities that have occurred to members of our Defence Forces who were involved in peace-keeping missions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An aspect of the whole distinguished peacekeeping record that this country has is one that has not got, in my view, sufficient recognition in this debate, that is the role that families play, the people who stay at home, in terms of their support for the people who serve overseas, the wives and children, the fathers and <Col N="1577" /> mothers of serving soldiers.  We have all seen at close hand the worry and concern that these people are affected by at various times.  Indeed during that terrible four week period before Easter this year when four Irish soldiers lost their lives in action in Lebanon, the suffering and pain that wives, children, parents and close relatives went through is something that we must recognise.  I believe that the very honoured record that the Irish Army have in peacekeeping over a 30-year period now has been successful in as much as it depended a good deal on home support.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon earlier referred to appropriate compensation for widows and orphans of serving members who die when they are on peacekeeping missions. I thoroughly agree with him on this and, not wanting to be anyway contentious, I think that, in the spirit of the across-the-board support that there is for this motion, we need again as a nation to look at the rates of pay for Defence Forces personnel.</P>
    <P>I have great pleasure in supporting this motion.  I was also very pleased with the unreserved support of the Minister for the motion. The fact that the Government and the people of South Lebanon want the UNIFIL Force to stay there is a great compliment to the UNIFIL Force and indeed to Irish people.  At the end of the day, when we look at the number of people who have died while serving on peacekeeping missions it should bring back to all of us that we have a serious problem with peace in this country.  The greatest monument we can have as a nation to those people who died is to reaffirm our commitment to peace in the most unequivocal way.  Any residual support for violence as a way of sorting out our problems must be rejected.  Like Senator Robb, I, too, would welcome the day when there is an Ulster contingent going on an UNIFIL peacekeeping mission.</P>

      <P>I thank the Members for their contributions throughout this <Col N="1578" /> debate which by and large stuck to messages of congratulations.  I also thank the Minister for attending.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I note it was left on.  I have tried during my contribution at the outset of this debate to confine my remarks to a congratulatory tone, to outline to this House the contribution the Irish soldiers have made in the peace-keeping forces abroad, that the Nobel Prize was won by those combined forces, the number of personnel who gave their lives in the cause of peace, the methods by which the United Nations observed bravery in the forces and the various medals that were given and how they differed in the ribbons attached to those medals.  I have outlined the congratulatory messages from the Minister for Defence and referred to the new medal being ordered to try to mark the service of our troops abroad.  I have outlined the message of congratulations from the Taoiseach to the Chief of Staff and his soldiers on receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize.  I have mentioned the persons from the 12th and 28th infantry battalion in my own area who gave their lives &mdash; Philip Grogan, Hugh Doherty, Dermot McLoughlin, Private Armstrong and Private Walsh.  I mentioned the numbers who have given their lives.  In general I have confined my remarks to congratulatory remarks.</P>
      <P>I was somewhat taken aback that the Cathaoirleach today should talk of my absence from this Chamber particularly when I was in my office listening to the debates.  It is while I was listening&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>Nor was it in order for the Chair to make reference to me but I accept your ruling.  During the time I was <Col N="1579" /> listening attentively to the debate outside this House I noted the remarks of Senator Bromell about 1916 and I disagreed with him.  I also noted the remarks of Senator John O'Connell when he suggested that rather than increasing the pay of the Army personnel we might offer them some cheap subsidies in picture houses, grocery and drapery shops and so on.  Is that the way Senator O'Connell wishes us to mark the way our troops have made their contribution?</P>
      <P>Senator Murphy talked about the morale of the Army, which is particularly low at this time.  The Minister spoke of picking up the legacy but it looks as if the legacy of low morale will be passed on. Senator McGowan talked about offering some sort of perk with regard to duties on cars on the return home from service abroad.  I also noted the remarks of Senator Robb with regard to the positively neutral contribution which is the one I hoped he would make.  Nothing can deflect from the fact that there is low morale in our Army today.  That was borne out when our troops were loyal to the oath they took when they first joined by not taking to the roads and not organising meetings However, their spouses had to do just that in order to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have read over my own contribution, I stuck strictly to the motion but one small venture outside it was pulled up immediately by the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  When the Minister looks for confrontation it is difficult not to retaliate though the motion is about non-confrontation.  It is also difficult to ignore the heading in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> that says &ldquo;Garda pay tops Army pay&rdquo;.  A garda after 14 years receives £13,328 but a three star private gets only £9,000.</P>

      <P>I must reiterate the remarks of my colleague, Senator McMahon, that if I were not provoked by the Minister and the Leader of the House I would not provoke them.  We have on this side of the House and indeed almost throughout the House endeavoured to pay our respects, tributes and congratulations to the Defence Forces for the way they have made a contribution worldwide to peace-keeping efforts. There is a certain irony that we should have people from this country going abroad when there is so much torment going on within our country.  Maybe that in itself, says something, that we can move from our own troubles to try to help others in the knowledge that our troubles came in similar circumstances as those of the countries to which our forces are going.  Many troubles stem from independence or an aspiration to independence.</P>
      <P>Our forces are seen to be part of that coming from a young country and their neutrality is totally respected.  As Senator McGowan said their expertise, training, high degree of intelligence and their deep knowledge of the troubles in the various countries to which they are assigned is acknowledged.  I offer congratulations personally and on behalf of the Fine Gael group.  When &mdash; I hope &mdash; this motion has the unanimous support of the House it should offer its congratulations to the forces and ask the Government to address the morale of the Army in the not to distant future.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom t-ábhar seo leanas a phlé sar a scoireann an Teach: &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann notes with concern the alleged involvement of the South African Government in the importation of arms by a Loyalist organisation.&rdquo; The salient facts are well known to Members of the House.  Just to recall them very briefly, members of a Loyalist organisation, Ulster Resistance, with American businessmen and a South African diplomat, were apprehended in a hotel in Paris.  It is said that negotiations were in progress between these people with regard to the selling of secrets in relation to very sophisticated armoury made in Shorts in Belfast in return for the importation of what is euphemistically called ordinary armaments to Loyalist groups in the Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The news tonight at six o'clock informed us that over 700 people are being laid off in Shorts in Belfast.  It gives no pleasure to Seanad Éireann, no more than it will to the Loyalist population in east Belfast, that this should happen.  It is conceivable that as a result of what is happening in Shorts, people taking secrets from the factory, visiting South Africa and taking jobs in armament factories in South Africa and the whole business in Shorts in Belfast, their reputation is being undermined.  This is another corollary to what has happened and what has been happening over the years with regard to the involvement between South Africa and certain Loyalist organisations in the North with regard to the whole question of the importation of arms. Indeed the media honed in on this as if it were something new.  However, anybody who has been to the North or in consultation with people who are living there will know that everybody knows &mdash; or everybody up there says &mdash; there is a well founded and well formed train of importation of arms, particularly from South Africa, and especially in transit <Col N="1584" /> through Scotland, coming into the Loyalist organisations for the last 20 years, if not more, because over the last number of years the propaganda put out by Westminister and by the Northern Ireland Government, aided and abetted by certain elements here is very simplistic.  It says that all you have to do is to get rid of the Provos and the whole question of Northern Ireland is solved, cause and effect.</P>
    <P>I am not going into that but it is very easy for anybody with eyes in his head or with ears to listen to realise that there are illegal Loyalist organisations, North and South, importing arms, much of those arms from South Africa.  One would imagine that the whole Loyalist approach has been one of reconciliation and peace. Of course that is not the case.  The whole Loyalist approach has been one of threatening confrontation.  It is unfortunate that the cause on one side has the opposite effect on the other side.  Therefore, the tit for tat goes on.  It is important to note that the South African Government are prepared to sell their armaments to organisations, in this case the Loyalist organisations, in the same way that other countries are prepared to sell armaments, guns and ammunitions to the Provos for the killing and maiming of people, the destruction of property and so forth like that in Northern Ireland. Unfortunately some of the Loyalist armaments and guns have been used here in Dublin and other parts of the South as well.  It has to be brought home to the South African Government that we will not tolerate that and that we are not at all satisfied with the conduct of the South African Government in this regard.  We have no diplomatic relations with South Africa.  We abhor the régime although it is very easy for us to talk about a régime of repression and discrimination and to criticise it when it is so many thousand miles away.  It is probably more difficult to criticise régimes of discrimination and intolerance when they are nearer home.</P>
    <P>Indeed it is rather surprising that a person should mention Arbour Hill in the Seanad and be criticised for it by speakers <Col N="1585" /> on the opposite side.  However, questions arise with regard to the position of the South African Government, and their dealings with the Loyalist organisations. Questions arise particularly with regard to the personnel on the Loyalist side who were members &mdash; or had been members &mdash; of the security forces in the North.  The question arises in regard to how much collusion there is between the security forces in the North and the various organisations for destruction on the Loyalist side.</P>
    <P>I note that questions have been raised in the House of Commons with regard to what knowledge the British security forces, Westminister and the Tory Government under Mrs. Thatcher, had of these dealings, not just in Paris two or three weeks ago but over a considerable number of years in the importation of arms to the North, especially through Scotland.  Under the Anglo-Irish Agreement we should bring to the attention of the British that we are very concerned about the importation of arms.  We have demonstrated that we are very concerned with the importation of arms by the Provos, the Government have been zealous in trying to stop that activity.  We should demand from the British Government through the Anglo-Irish Agreement and through our Ambassador in London that Mrs. Thatcher, one of the few friends that the South African Government have in the western world, takes this up very seriously with the South African authorities and brings to their notice that all they are doing is adding to the destruction, the death list, loss of life and property and the casualties of the North by their dealings.</P>
    <P>It is disturbing as well when we see the close involvement of so-called democratic politicians of the Unionist side with the beginning of this Ulster Resistance Movement and their close involvement up to quite recently with it.  It again begs the question: what does democracy mean in the North?  Why do people who sit in a Parliament and profess loyalty to that Parliament and their Queen, at the same time have not only very strong links with <Col N="1586" /> but are involved in setting up these Loyalist organisations?</P>
    <P>The South have a very solid democratic record.  We have given no quarter and it is only our right to ask that our record here be part and parcel of the record of the British authorities in dealing with all illegal and subversive organisations and indeed all organisations importing arms for the destruction of life and property and the maiming of people.  The conflagration has gone on for much too long. The importation of arms on the Loyalist side went on, of course, naturally before the setting up of the State: you can go back to the Larne importation and right through the thirties, forties and fifties. We will not go into history.  We had enough history a while ago from people on the revisionist side.</P>
    <P>Another facet that worries me is that the diplomat from South Africa was set free due to diplomatic immunity.  If a person is involved in a criminal act, should that person &mdash; and this applies to all countries &mdash; have diplomatic immunity? It is now said that the Loyalist people and the American businessman will get off with just a very light indictment in regard to theft.  If they do get off in the French courts will these people be extradited to the North and will they face the courts in the North?  It will be an interesting development and I hope our Government will insist, through the Anglo-Irish Agreement and through our ambassador in London, that serious consideration is given by the British Government to this development.</P>
    <P>This is the first conclusive and concrete evidence we have of the association of Loyalist organisations with South Africa. It is important that we look upon it very seriously and take whatever measures we can to bring it to an end.  It is very important to impress this on the British authorities, particularly on Mrs. Thatcher who is perhaps the only friend the South African regime have in the western world.  Therefore, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, I propose this motion, that we note with concern what has taken place between a South African diplomat and this Loyalist organisation.  I hope the Government will <Col N="1587" /> take up the matter directly with the British Government and again through the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>In his statement of 25 April, the Tánaiste informed Dáil Éireann that our ambassador in Paris had conveyed our congratulations to the French authorities on the success of their security measures against an operation which, apart from its possible grave implications for security in Northern Ireland, could have resulted in the breaking of the arms embargo on South Africa imposed by United Nations Security Council Resolution 418 of 1977.</P>
      <P>I would like to take the opportunity afforded by this debate to repeat in the Seanad our appreciation of the effective action of the French authorities in foiling an apparent attempt to obtain sophisticated military technology for South Africa.  We do not know yet what may have been on offer to the Loyalists in return, but it is safe to assume that any assistance or weapons, or cash for weapons, could only have resulted in further loss of life in Northern Ireland.  Our appreciation of the action taken by the French authorities is all the greater for this reason.</P>
      <P>At the first indication of the developments in Paris, the Tánaiste instructed our embassy there to make inquiries and report back urgently.  The embassy subsequently reported that three persons from Northern Ireland, Mr. Noel Little, Mr. James King and Mr. Samuel Quinn, had been arrested, together with an American citizen, Mr. Douglas Bernhart and an official of the South African embassy in Paris, Mr. Daniel Storm, who was released because of his official status. The embassy have continued to remain closely in contact with the French authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of this very grave development, the Tánaiste instructed, on 24 April, that a protest be made in the strongest possible terms to the South African Government.  As Ireland does not maintain diplomatic relations with <Col N="1588" /> South Africa, this protest was delivered by our ambassador in London to the South African ambassador there.  The ambassador told the South African ambassador that the Government strongly condemn the provision of weapons, or funds for the purchase of weapons, to any group in Northern Ireland and that they wished to have the assurance of the South African Government that South Africa will not supply any such weapons or funds.</P>
    <P>In the course of the protest, the ambassador also informed the South African ambassador that the Irish Government rejected the use of violence as a means of promoting political objectives in Northern Ireland and were making every effort to achieve peace, stability and political progress.  The ambassador reminded the South African ambassador that sectarian attacks by Loyalists in Northern Ireland had killed to date almost 700 persons and, this year alone, had resulted in the deaths of 11 people.</P>
    <P>In reply, the South African ambassador said he would transmit the Government's message to his Government.  He informed the ambassador that the South African Minister for Foreign Affairs had said that the South African Government were investigating the matter; that he had given the assurance that the South African Government are not supplying weapons to any terrorist organisation; he had stated that should any organisation or individual in South Africa have transgressed in this sphere, action would be taken against those concerned and an assurance would be given that this would not happen again.  Subsequently, on 3 May, the South African Minister for Defence, General Malan, was reported to have told the South African Parliament that Daniel Storm was acting on behalf of the South African arms agency, Armscor, but that his involvement with the Loyalists did not have the approval of the South African Government.  In the course of his statement, General Malan said that South Africa did attempt to obtain weapons on the black market to counter the United Nations arms embargo and that, as he put it, &ldquo;anyone <Col N="1589" /> subjected to an arms embargo cannot pick and choose with whom they fulfil these requirements&rdquo;.  He added that the international arms trade followed its own rules and moral code and did not always follow diplomatic and legal standards.</P>
    <P>The United Nations arms embargo was decided by the UN Security Council for very good reasons and has the force of binding international law.  It goes without saying that we reject completely these remarks by General Malan.</P>
    <P>On 28 April the French Government summoned the South African ambassador and informed him of the expulsion of three members of the South African embassy for activities contrary to their status.  One of these officials was Mr. Storm.</P>
    <P>In a statement on 5 May, the British Government said that they had considered carefully the South African Government's response, in particular General Malan's statement to the South African Parliament on 3 May and that, because of the gravity of the matter, they had decided that three members of the South African embassy in London should leave Britain within seven days.  In the convention of international relations, expulsion is a most severe expression of disapproval by Governments.</P>
    <P>The Government have maintained close contact with the British Government on this matter and they have, of course, conveyed through the embassy in London and the Secretariat in Belfast their great concern about the deeply worrying security implications of this affair.  In particular, the ability of Loyalist organisations to steal military equipment from establishments in Northern Ireland is a very grave matter.</P>
    <P>In this general regard, our discussions with the British authorities covered the recent breaches of security at Shorts and at a Territorial Army base at Newtownards. In response, we have been informed that, following the theft from the Shorts factory at the end of October 1988, a thorough review of security had been carried out which had resulted in improvements to security arrangements both in relation to the security of the <Col N="1590" /> premises and to the screening of staff employed at the factory.  Similarly, since the theft last month from the Territorial Army base in Newtownards, a full security review is being carried out into security at the base and other such bases in Northern Ireland.  We have also been informed that the equipment stolen from Shorts in the theft of October 1988 was an aiming unit of the Javelin missile system and the equipment stolen from the Territorial Army base at Newtownards last month was a training model of the Blowpipe missile system.  It was, in fact, a cut-away section of this training model of the Blowpipe system which was found in the possession of the three Loyalists in Paris.  It has been stressed by the British authorities that none of this equipment was capable of operational use.</P>
    <P>The three Loyalists are now in custody. They have been charged with arms trafficking, receipt of stolen goods and conspiracy of a criminal nature; and their case is under judicial investigation.  This is a dimension that we should all be conscious of this evening.  Two of the loyalists, Mr. Little and Mr. King, are known to have links with the organisation known as &ldquo;Ulster Resistance&rdquo;.  Senators will, I know, be aware of the history of this organisation, which was founded in 1986.  What is known about this affair, and this organisation, illustrates the absolute necessity for politicians engaged in the democratic process to clearly reject the use of violence in the promotion of political objectives.  The third Northern Ireland person arrested, Samuel Quinn, was a member of the Territorial Army at Newtownards.  As I have said, the Government have been informed that a full review of security at Territorial Army bases in the North is in progress.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to reiterate, on behalf of the Government, our deep concern at any attempt to provide weapons or funds to organisations or persons who are engaged in the promotion of political objectives by violent means.  The Government will maintain contact with the British and French Governments in regard to all relevant aspects of this <Col N="1591" /> matter.  The South African Government have publicly indicated that the activities of their agent in Paris, Mr. Storm, did not have their approval in so far as they concerned contacts with Loyalist organisations. Nonetheless, the fact remains that an agent of the South African <Col N="1592" /> Government did engage in such contacts with possible grave implications for security in Northern Ireland.  Such behaviour is completely unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 11 May 1989.</P>
