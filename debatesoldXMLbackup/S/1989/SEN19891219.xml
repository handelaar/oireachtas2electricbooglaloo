      <P>I have notice from Senator Joe Costello that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to fulfil her commitment to the development of a new school in north Clondalkin for the students of St. Kevin's Community College who are in temporary accommodation.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator David Norris of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health in the light of the recent resignation of the chairman of the Health Research Board due to unexpected arbitrary budgetary constraints imposed in the estimates to look urgently at the possibility of providing future and adequate funding so that this important body can carry out its work in the national interest.</P>
      <P>Tá fógra agam ón Seanadóir Pól Ó Foighil:</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1562" /> I regard the matters raised by Senators Costello, Norris, and Ó Foighil as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matter raised by Senator Costello and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Norris and Ó Foighil may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the very obvious agreement on all sides of the House last week on the need for meaningful reform of the House of the Oireachtas &mdash; and we cannot go much further than that &mdash; will the Leader of the House give us an assurance that this will be a priority with him in the coming session?  Secondly, will he give us some indication as to when the House will resume for the next session after Christmas?</P>
      <P>On a different note, on behalf of my colleagues, I convey our congratulations to Senator Haughey on his engagement announced today.  As someone who has some experience in these matters, I would like on my own behalf and that of the party, to wish him every happiness.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I note Senator O'Toole has absolved himself from the category of reject in a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday and I wonder if he would extend that same absolution to the other 59 Members of the House so we will know where we stand before the session comes to an end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>We are totally in agreement with the spirit of Item No. 1 as it is a very sensible arrangement but we are worried about the problems in county councils at the moment.  It is quite serious as some of them could be dissolved.  Three of our Members would like to talk but we do not want to break up the half-hour limit. I ask the Leader of the House if it would be possible to break that half-hour up into three ten minute periods.  We would <Col N="1563" /> ensure that it would not go beyond the half-hour limit.  Did the Leader of the House list five items?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Video Recordings Bill urgent?  It might be better if people spoke for ten minutes rather than 30 minutes, even if it meant considering dropping the Video Recordings Bill until after the Christmas period.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to challenge the Order of Business but since the other House is not sitting it is appropriate that the Seanad should note with concern the disastrous situation obtaining along the south coast as a result of last weekend's flooding.  I am calling on the Minister for the Environment to address the problem as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the fact that there are still very long waiting lists for hospital admissions for hip operations, cataract operations, dental, treatment, etc., when does the Leader of the House propose to have a comprehensive debate on the health services and specifically on the recently published report of the Commission on the Health Services so that we can ensure there is an adequate delivery of health services to our people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House be able to give us an update on the question of the translation services which Senator Ó Foighil has repeatedly brought before the House?  If not, will he tell us if it is the intention of the Government to proscribe the Irish language and to introduce legislation outlawing its use and providing for the seizure of printing presses using the Irish language, because this appears to be the only alternative way of encouraging people to learn the language?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to join in the congratulations to Senator Haughey although I am less experienced in this matter than Senator Manning appears to be.  I have been told it is a very happy <Col N="1564" /> state and I am sure we all congratulate him.</P>
    <P>I am not seeking a change in the Order of Business but I would like between now and the opening of the new session if the Leader of the House would take Item No. 15, the Irish Nationality and Citizenship (Amendment) Bill to the Government to see what their response would be because it was framed in response to a specific difficulty of an Irish citizen who is a constituent of mine and I would be very grateful for advice as to how best to proceed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of the New Year resolutions of the Leader of the House to show his commitment to reform I would like to ask him to take Item No. 24 which states:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann welcomes the conferring of University status on the Universities of Limerick and Dublin City University and calls on the Government to extend Seanad voting rights to the graduates of the new Universities</P>
      <P>in the light of the new wave and spirit of reform running through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We did discuss two items and agreed that on Item No. 3 we would have 15 minutes of contribution from each group.  If the groups want to break that up into five minutes each it does not make any difference but each group would have 15 minutes.  On Item No. 1, it was agreed last week that we would introduce that item.  So that there would be a full debate we agreed we would give each of the groups a chance to have a 30-minute intervention in the debate on that Bill this week and that we would have adequate time when we come back after Christmas.  Item No. 5 states:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the supply services and purposes to which sums have been appropriated in the Appropriation Bill, 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that day or days we could also discuss the Estimates.  It would be a more appropriate time to do that rather than <Col N="1565" /> go along the lines suggested today by Senator Harte.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly asked a question about the health services.  It is up to him or his group to put down a motion in that regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy mentioned that there is grave concern about the flooding around the coast.  This is a matter of deep concern to everybody in the House, particularly those who are living in the east, south-east and south-west areas.  It is a matter that could be taken under Standing Order 29.  Apart from that, however, I do not see that it could be taken today.  As the Senator knows, the Government are making every possible effort to alleviate the problems associated with that matter and there are insurance and governmental implications all along the line.  Ministers are meeting at local level with representatives of farming and fisheries, with the general public and with tourism interests.</P>
    <P>With regard to translation service which was raised by Senator Norris, we will continue to press that it be introduced into this House as early as possible.  The Government have given every indication that Members will get whatever services are needed to run their own business in the House.  Secretarial services to a reasonable standard will also be provided. I am certain that the translation service will be included in that revision.</P>
    <P>It is not intended that we take Item No. 15 today.  I will speak to Senator Norris about that again.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman mentioned Item No. 23.  We had a major debate on the setting up of the universities in the House.  As far as the extension of Seanad voting rights to graduates is concerned, if the Fine Gael group want to put that down as a Private Members' motion there is nothing to stop them.</P>
    <P>The Video Recordings Bill is before us today and we are taking Report Stage. Even though it might seem to be an innocuous Bill to certain people it needs to be put in place.  Because of the concern of everybody who spoke on the Bill about the type of material that is going into homes around this country due to lack of <Col N="1566" /> legislation in this area, it is essential that we take that matter today.  We will be meeting early in January and we will discuss the Appropriation Bill, the Bord Glas Bill, continuation of the Maritime Institute Bill and the completion of the Derelict Sites Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a proposal from the Leader of the House on the question of restricting the debate on the Ombudsman? That did not arise on the presentation of the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a proposal I discussed with various people beforehand and it was generally accepted that 15 minutes from each group would be enough.  However, if Senators want to break it up into five three minute contributions or three five minute contributions. I do not think it matters.</P>
      <P>With regard to another question raised, I do not want to set a specific time limit because we have the Report Stage of the Video Recordings Bill and I do not think it would be appropriate to set a time limit.</P>
      <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <P>The Appropriation Bill is an annual piece of legislation which formally appropriates the departmental Estimates for the supply services, both capital and non-capital, and all Supplementary Estimates which have been approved by the Dáil since the previous year's Appropriation Act.  The appropriations for the various services in the Bill this year, as set out in the Schedule to the Bill, amount to £6,452,474,000.  This comprises net Estimates totalling £6,376,111,000 as set out in the revised 1989 Book of Estimates, published after the 1989 Budget and Supplementary Estimates, totalling £76,363,000 as passed by the Dáil this year.  The Bill also authorises £619,444,000 in departmental receipts to be used as appropriations-in-aid.</P>
      <P>Another very important function of the Bill is its use in providing a statutory basis in 1990 for the &ldquo;four-fifths&rdquo; issues procedure.  This procedure, which is authorised by the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act, 1965, permits the Minister for Finance to make issues from the Exchequer towards the cost of services in 1990 prior to the adoption by the Dáil of the individual Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also affords Seanad Éireann an opportunity of discussing economic developments of the past 12 months.  I am happy to report that we have had yet another very successful year in which we sustained, and in many cases bettered, the very positive performance of 1988. The outcome has been increased employment, the continuation of the downward trend in the live register, major growth in investment and a current account surplus on the balance of payments for the third year in succession.  Following on an <Col N="1568" /> annual average growth rate of 3½ per cent in 1987 and 1988, the economy is forecast to continue with a similar strong rate of growth this year.</P>
    <P>Manufacturing output growth this year is expected to reach 12½ per cent, similar to that experienced in 1988.  A most encouraging feature of the recovery in manufacturing output is the fact that it is broadly based, with contributions to growth coming from the traditional sectors as well as the high technology ones.</P>
    <P>After a long period of stagnation and decline, the construction industry has entered a strong recovery phase with growth in the sector forecast at about 7 per cent in 1989.  This, I might add, bears out what the Government have consistently been saying; that recovery in the building industry would follow closely on a general economic recovery.</P>
    <P>Exports of goods and services, which grew in volume terms at an average annual rate of over 11 per cent in 1987 and 1988, are expected to increase by a similar amount this year.  Overall we expect a trade surplus of about £2 billion in 1989, much the same as last year's performance.</P>
    <P>For the third year in a row, the current account of the balance of payments will be in surplus, something that has not happened since the Emergency when abnormal conditions prevailed in international trade.  The significance of this achievement is best demonstrated by the fact that from the beginning of the 1980's up to 1986, the annual deficit on the current account of the balance of payments averaged over 8 per cent of GNP, whereas over the past three years we will have experienced an average surplus of about 1½ per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>The recovery we are witnessing is not confined to the manufacturing and exporting sectors alone.  Growth in consumption and investment are also contributing. The volume of investment is expected to rise by over 8 per cent this year.  As already mentioned the building industry is recovering strongly.  Machinery and equipment investment, the engine of industrial expansion, is forecast <Col N="1569" /> to rise by about 10 per cent in 1989 following on a 3 per cent volume increase last year.  Consumer spending growth is expected to accelerate from 3 per cent in 1988 to 4¾ per cent this year.  This compares with stagnant personal consumer spending in the first half of this decade.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, because of international factors, inflation this year will average about 4 per cent compared with just over 2 per cent in 1988, which itself was the lowest level since 1960.  At 4 per cent nonetheless our inflation rate is still below the European Community average and will be well below that of the UK, our main trading partner.  Inflation will moderate next year and by the end of 1990 it should be down to about 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>This low rate of inflation coupled with moderate wage increases, has made us much more competitive.  Competitiveness of course is essential for growth and the maintenance and expansion of employment.</P>
    <P>One of the most encouraging features of the economic recovery has been the improvement in the employment situation. The most recent labour force survey indicates that the recovery in private non-farm employment continued through 1988.  In the 12 months to April 1989, there was a nett gain of 6,000 jobs in manufacturing.  In 1989, non-agricultural employment is projected to be up to 13,000 higher, on average, than in 1988, reflecting strong job growth in the private sector.  Over the two years, 1988 and 1989, private sector non-agricultural employment is forecast to increase by well over 30,000.  The developments are a direct result of the policies the Government have been adhering to.</P>
    <P>Registered unemployment fell on average by 6,000 in 1988.  This downward trend is expected to accelerate to an average fall of 10,000 this year.  Unemployment remains, however, at an unacceptably high level.  It is the Government's vowed intention to bring it down as rapidly as possible by increasing employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>In this regard I would remind Members <Col N="1570" /> of the House of the package of measures announced last September designed to stimulate employment and help the disadvantaged. These measures will work in two ways to help the unemployed.  The PRSI exemption scheme, increased employment incentive scheme allowances, and increased enterprise allowances will encourage the creation of permanent private sector employment. The number of places on training schemes and on direct employment programmes have been increased by over 1,300 places and the attractiveness of these schemes has also been enhanced.</P>
    <P>European interest rates have increased sharply this year and Irish interest rates had to move up in line with them. Recently the weakness of sterling has put further upward pressure on Irish interest rates.  Despite the interest rate increases this year we should not forget that Irish rates have fallen dramatically, relative to rates abroad since March 1987.  The differential between key Irish and UK interest rates has improved by up to 6.5 percentage points since 31 March 1987. During this period the differential with German rates has also improved, by about 5.5 percentage points.  This dramatic improvement in our competitive position is a reflection of the better management of the Irish economy during the period.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest problems facing the Government since 1987 has been the size and rate of growth of the national debt. In the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> we set ourselves the target of stabilising the national debt-GNP ratio by 1990. This we achieved in 1988 when the debt-GNP ratio fell marginally from 131.4 per cent of GNP to 131 per cent of GNP.  The medium-term target, as outlined in the <i>National Development Plan</i>, is to reduce the national debt to 120 per cent of GNP by 1993.  This target, too, looks like being comfortably met ahead of schedule.  The emerging end-1989 national debt-GNP ratio is set to produce a very substantial reduction on the end-1988 ratio of 131 per cent.  Continuing the downward trend in the debt ratio remains central to Government policy as it is one of the keys <Col N="1571" /> to releasing scarce resources from debt servicing to more productive purposes. To further minimise the cost of servicing debt, the Taoiseach has recently announced that a national debt office is to be established and legislation setting up the office will be introduced in the next Dáil session.</P>
    <P>This year has seen a continued improvement in the public finances.  It is now very apparent that the budgetary outturn for 1989 will be much better than was envisaged at budget time.  The trends reflected in the end-September Exchequer returns indicated that the level of borrowing by the Exchequer this year would probably be of the order of 3.5 per cent of GNP, as against the budget estimate of 5.3 per cent.  Developments since then suggest that borrowing could be even lower than this, possibly around 3 per cent of GNP.  This will mean that the underlying Exchequer borrowing will have been reduced to less than one-quarter of its 1986 level in the course of three years.  This ranks as a truly major turnaround in the public finances.</P>
    <P>The continued disciplined control of public expenditure is ensuring that non-capital supply services expenditure this year will be broadly in line with the budget target.  There will in fact be significant savings in the major area of current spending &mdash; debt-servicing costs borne by the central fund.  On the capital side, Exchequer borrowing for capital purposes will be lower than anticipated because of higher capital receipts.</P>
    <P>However, the main contribution to the strong budgetary performance this year is clearly coming from the buoyancy of tax revenue.  This reflects in particular the much stronger upturn in the economy, in both investment and consumption, than had been predicted.  Consumer expenditure has boosted indirect tax receipts. Other tax headings have also performed well.  Apart from the impact of stronger economic growth, revenue receipts are continuing to benefit from the much improved régime of tax collection and enforcement now in place following the <Col N="1572" /> measures taken over the past couple of years.</P>
    <P>As Senators are aware, the 1990 Abridged Estimates and public capital programme were published a month ago. The expenditure allocations contained in these documents, of course, deal only with part of the Government's overall budget strategy for 1990.</P>
    <P>We must await the Minister for Finance's Financial Statement early in the new year before we see the full budgetary picture.  The Government's initiative in publishing spending Estimates some months before the beginning of the financial year ensures that there will be informed public debate both in the Houses of the Oireachtas and elsewhere on the general thrust of spending policy. The procedure followed in settling the 1990 Estimates was the same as that used in the 1988 and 1989 Estimates.  The expenditure review process was used successfully once again in the early summer. This was followed up by an in-depth consideration by the Government of the Estimate for each Government Department during October.</P>
    <P>What the published allocations show is that the Government have set expenditure at a level consistent with continuing downward pressure on the 1990 Exchequer borrowing requirement while, at the same time, making additional resources available in selected priority areas.</P>
    <P>Exchequer funded net non-capital supply services show an increase of just 0.4 per cent on the 1989 post-budget Estimate, while overall Exchequer funded non-capital and capital spending is up just 1 per cent on the corresponding 1989 figures.  This level of increase is considerably below the projected inflation rate for 1990 of about 4 per cent.  Within this low level of overall increase we have directed additional resources to the health sector and to the security sector and have modestly boosted the Exchequer-funded public capital programme.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made of the fact that the amount made available for social welfare next year is some £100 million less than the 1989 budget provision.  I <Col N="1573" /> want to emphasise to the House that in settling the 1990 Estimate for Social Welfare no measures were adopted which would affect entitlement to or levels of payment in social welfare schemes.  The reduction in the Estimate simply reflects the fact that PRSI income is expected to be much more buoyant next year and the Government's decision to amalgamate the occupational injuries and redundancy and employers' insolvency funds with the social insurance fund.  I might add that the 1990 published figures for social welfare do not include anything for budget day improvements which the Minister for Finance will make next year.</P>
    <P>The expenditure allocations for 1990 also reflect the impact of the Community Structural Funds.  As Senators know, the Community has made a commitment of £2,860 million to Ireland over the 1989-1993 period.  Aid from Community initiatives yet to be announced should bring the overall assistance total to over £3 billion.</P>
    <P>The Community commitment is set out in the recently published Community Support Framework.  It sets out both the levels of assistance to be provided and the sectors to which it will be channelled. The Community Support Framework will be followed up by a series of operational programmes.  These will set out in more detail the particular measures which will be implemented in each sector.  They are currently under discussion with the Commission and some of them will be finalised shortly, with the remainder being agreed early in 1990.  Like the Community Support Framework, the operational programmes will also be published when they have been adopted.</P>
    <P>Ireland's assistance from the Structural Funds in 1990 will be £539 million.  In addition, some £18 million of commitments from the Social Fund in 1989 will be carried forward to 1990, giving total assistance of £557 million.  This represents an increase of over 20 per cent on 1989 which itself showed a significant increase over 1988, when commitments were £361 million.  The 1990 figure therefore shows an increase, in nominal terms, of 54 per cent on the pre-1989 position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1574" /> The turnaround in our economic fortunes over the last few years has been remarkable.  We have restored confidence in the Irish economy both at home and abroad.  We have endeavoured to reduce the constraint on economic progress imposed by high debt and its associated debt-service costs through strict control of the public finances and that is continuing into 1990.  We have achieved and maintained a low rate of domestic inflation to the benefit of our international competitiveness and we have commenced a significant reform of the taxation system so as to stimulate growth and so to promote employment and equity.</P>
    <P>This economic strategy was first set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> in 1987.  It was reiterated in the National Development Plan and indeed has been further articulated in the <i>Programme for Government in the National Interest 1989-1993.</i> The strategy we have pursued since 1987 is evidently the right one and that is the reason it has been adhered to consistently. It is the only way in which sustained growth and increased employment can be achieved.</P>
    <P>I commend the Appropriation Bill to the Seanad.</P>

      <P>The greatest tragedy of the debate here this morning relates to the huge numbers and categories of people to whom this Bill is totally irrelevant. These people come from all sectors of the community, all the various constituencies.  Perhaps the only word the Minister did not use in terms of economic jargon and economic buzz-words is the word &ldquo;poverty&rdquo;.  I stand to be corrected but I did not hear or see it anywhere in the script.  It is still the biggest tragedy in this country that while so many <Col N="1575" /> of us are enjoying increased living standards &mdash; we do not deny that there are great sectors of the population enjoying increased living standards &mdash; there are still shamefully large numbers of people who would be classified as poor.</P>
      <P>Poverty is caused by lots of different reasons but we all know the type of poverty we are talking about.  We are talking about the poverty that Sr. Stanislaus referred to this morning on the media which is adverted to in the Focus Point report, the poverty of the young and those without homes in Dublin and the bigger urban areas over Christmas, those who have no future and no path in life, those who have been failed by the education system over the decades, the old and those with drink problems, social problems and other family and marital problems, the people who have been failed by legislators over the years.  We have all contributed to that in some way because at different times many of us have been on different sides of this House and indeed the other House.  I would like to know what is the Minister's concern for the poor.</P>
      <P>I accept fully that the economy is well positioned.  I take the Minister's point and I do not argue too much with the macro-economic indicators he has given us this morning.  We can all quote balance of payments figures, export figures, interest rates, inflation figures and all the other macro-economic indicators which have come round in the last three years and we will all, when it suits us, claim our share of the credit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has recognised, in various points which he made in his speech, that the turnaround started in the mid-eighties.  Certainly the increase in personal consumer spending began in 1986 and it has increased apace. This year it is up again and that is perhaps the single most important indicator of our material standard of living.  Apart from personal consumer spending, there has been a boom in real estate.  Certainly there has been a buzz in that area for the last year in particular and it seems to be on the up and up.  That is a fairly firm indicator of confidence in the economy.</P>
      <P>The single factor that has led to the confidence that has thankfully come back in our economy was the extremely responsible role taken by the main Opposition party, the Fine Gael Party, during the last Government.  We have had only six months of the present Government and they are continuing pretty much in the vein of the last Government, notwithstanding their uncomfortable bed-fellows.  Perhaps they are no harm in curbing the excesses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps they are no longer curbing the excesses in certain areas but they are continuing the general thrust of the economic policies of the previous Fianna Fáil Government who were in office for two and a half years.  Even with the consensus of the social partners, Fianna Fáil alone would not have achieved what they have achieved without the role played by the main Opposition party.  The expression the &ldquo;Tallaght Strategy&rdquo; is bandied around by people <Col N="1577" /> when it suits them and used as a derogatory remark and insult.  People have used the expression in different ways but I want to put it to the Minister that without the support of the main Opposition party in ensuring that there is a secure and united way forward from the Houses of the Oireachtas, Fianna Fáil would not have got the consent they got from the different unions and social partners.  We were not providing a fall back for them to run to when they were perhaps unhappy with some of the difficult measures which had to be taken.  The cutbacks all across the various public services and different Departments hurt, and some of them are still hurting, but it would not have been possible to achieve these were it not for the role played by Fine Gael, as outlined in what became known as the Tallaght Strategy.</P>
      <P>I must put on the record of this House the wisdom, foresight and political bravery shown by Deputy Alan Dukes in sticking both his and the party's neck out, just after he was elected leader of our party, in supporting what were a very unpopular Government.  We decided to support them for the good of this country. Times have moved on and we are facing the first budget since the general election. As I have said, after having teed up the economy with the support of the Tallaght Strategy over the last two years, the indicators are not good.  On paper, the figures look good to the economists and business correspondents but I want to ask the Minister what plans he has in relation to the poor.  What is the Government's attitude to tackling the problems of the poor? The Minister dealt with the social welfare figures for next year.  I sincerely hope the Minister is right and that he will not need the £100 million he has deducted from the Social Welfare Estimate but what are the true plans of this Government when it comes to removing the causes of poverty? It is not enough to just throw a few bob at the poor to keep the problem down and hope it will go away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economy has been teed up with the support of the Fine Gael Party for many years and now thankfully the business sector, the commercial sector and <Col N="1578" /> the industrial sector are reaping the rewards.  The Minister quoted the word &ldquo;manufacturing&rdquo; about four times in his speech, for example, manufacturing growth, manufacturing output, the manufacturing and export sectors.  What does the Minister for Finance mean by the word &ldquo;manufacturing&rdquo;?  Perhaps the Minister of State can tell us here.  According to recent media reports, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, is not happy with the present definition of manufacturing.  If the Minister is going to redefine the word &ldquo;manufacturing&rdquo; in the budget, particularly as it applies to corporation tax, where will we end up? Will we slash these figures?  Will the FII, Fyffes and all the other companies who come under the definition of manufacturing at present be excluded?  The Minister has weighted many of the points in support of this argument on the success of the manufacturing sector.  Will all those companies who are now defined as manufacturing companies continue to be defined as such?  This is a most important point as all of us look to the manufacturing sector to contribute much to GNP and the economy generally.  If there is to be a radical change in the definition of &ldquo;manufacturing&rdquo; from a taxation point of view the figures we will be looking at next year will be totally different and we will no longer be able to look to this sector for the support and contribution they have thankfully made in increasing amounts during the past few years.</P>
    <P>I mentioned urban poverty and the Focus Point report.  We could all mention different aspects of urban poverty but what can we say to the farmers and the agricultural sector who are looking for disadvantaged area classification under the less favoured areas directive?  Will there be an appeals system for those who are left out?  When will the Government submission go to Brussels?  Will our case be accepted in Brussels?  Are the Government committed to increasing the headage payments and the various subsidies to all those who will be classified and all those who will be re-classified.  If not, there will be major social problems for <Col N="1579" /> 80 per cent of our farmers as we face into the nineties, particularly post-1992.</P>
    <P>Farming is not just about commercial farming and development; it is a way of life for people in this country.  The vast majority of our farmers are small family farmers to whom the Minister's speech would be quite unintelligible.  These farmers do not know where they stand in relation to GNP, export figures, the Structural Funds and so on.  The Structural Funds might be of some assistance to them but they do not understand them. What is the commitment of this Government to the future of the family farm in Ireland?  There are very few people in the Houses of the Oireachtas who are more than one generation removed from a small farm in rural Ireland.  Thankfully some small farmers became big farmers and their attitude towards farming as a way of life changed to economic and industrial farming but not enough farmers were able to do that.  Many farmers are living in poverty on small holdings of below 50 acres.</P>
    <P>Rural poverty is spelt out in the document which was recently launched by the IFA in Wexford with the help of Teagasc and Dr. Brendan Kearney.  The document deals with incomes and living standards on small farms in County Wexford. I put it to the Minister that when it comes to agriculture the impression is that Wexford is a model county, that we have no problems and that dole for farmers is unknown there.  This is not the case and while we all boasted about the improvements in the economy and the various economic indicators during the past two years, farmers' dole became a reality in County Wexford for the first time.  This report published in the past month by the IFA and Teagasc says that of the 200 farms sampled in County Wexford, the model county, 50 per cent returned incomes of below £5,000 and only 20 per cent returned incomes above £10,000, including the off-farm incomes of sons, daughters and wives in some cases who were working.  Fifty per cent of the farmers in County Wexford whose farms are under 75 acres received less than <Col N="1580" /> £5,000 in a year.  If, tragically, farmers' dole is a reality in County Wexford on the east coast, what must be the position of farmers in other counties which traditionally were not assumed to be favourable for farming?  If we do not get our act together on the future of the family farm there will be a tragedy in this area.  If the Government are telling small farmers to get off the land and on to the dole queues, that they will get a few bob more in next year's budget, then the Government should be honest about that.  This is not Fine Gael's attitude and it does not behove any of us to support that type of attitude towards the roots of this country if I may so refer to them.</P>
    <P>What will the fishermen say about the Minister's speech when they read it in the business supplement of <i>The Irish Times</i> or some such publication?  I know that the poor Minister for the Marine, Deputy Wilson, was up all night but he has precious little to show for being out of bed all night.  Will the fishermen in Counties Wexford, Waterford and Wicklow whose fleets and trawlers were ravaged by storms get licences to replace their tonnage? On a strict interpretation of the present rules and the necessity to reduce the GRT, which is what Brussels and the Department of the Marine are at, they will not.  Their quotas are being reduced in Brussels.  Will any of them need licences?  Is there a future for the fishing industry in this country, an island nation surrounded by water?</P>
    <P>In the past two years much play has been made of our natural resources.  The Taoiseach and others who have gone on TV and opened conferences, such as the IMI Conference, have referred to our natural resources.  Our Minister for the Marine is out in Brussels at present battling to prevent a reduction in the quotas. Our GRT has to be reduced because of some mix up in the original figures which were submitted.  This sounds a familiar story but it is effectively the truth.  Our system is only being computerised now and we do not know what our actual registered tonnage is.  None of the good and productive industrial fishermen can trade up.  They cannot increase the size <Col N="1581" /> of their boats unless they scrap the ones they have.  What kind of future have they in what should be a major natural resource?  The Minister of State can send the Minister for the Marine all our support in Brussels, even if he has to stay there until Christmas, but he must not come home with a reduction in any of the quotas.  We started off with a handicap because of the way the quota was negotiated by the then Minister for the Marine, Deputy Brendan Daly, but we should not now be put at a greater disadvantage <i>via-à-vis</i> other countries in the Community.  As an island nation we have a special claim to be allowed to fish the various species of fish off our coast.  The Minister needs all-party support to deal with the impossible job he is facing.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned health once in his speech, just a brief mention in passing. No other topic dominated the general election this summer like health.  In fact, any other portfolio was superfluous. Health was the only issue raised on the doorsteps and in the media and it continues to be the single major issue in this country among the ordinary people.  They are afraid that if they get sick they will not get treatment.  Dental treatment has got to the stage of being a joke.  We do not have the dentists to provide the treatment, even if the Minister was willing to provide the funds.  What about the general health of the nation and the panic among the old, the infirm, the unemployed? When and if they need it, the State will not be there to help them.  What causes most anguish in all sectors is the fear about health care.  Without our health we do not have anything.  Without our health we do not need education or industry.  Nothing is relevant unless we look after the health of the nation, unless we look after the old, the children and the sick.  I was disappointed that the Minister made only one brief mention of health in his speech.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell us what 1990 will bring in terms of the Government's commitment to improve our health services, of increasing the number of beds in the greater Dublin area and other major urban areas?  Will he ensure that the <Col N="1582" /> health boards have sufficient funds?  I do not mean they should have luxury budgets; we are not talking about providing for extras.  Health boards should have budgets that will enable them to provide a basic health service, thereby ensuring that everybody has access to the service they require.  Those who want to pay for private care can do so but they should not be allowed to step ahead in the queue for those who genuinely deserve the service but cannot afford to pay for it.  A good private sector relieves the public sector.  We must ensure that the public sector is not disadvantaged and that we do not have a two-tier health system under which those who cannot afford to pay must wait in pain while those who can afford to pay are treated on request. The private sector helps but at present it is being brought into disrepute because of the waiting lists for elective surgery and other procedures in the public sector. That should not be tolerated and it is not acceptable in a Christian democracy.  The Government should look at that immediately and resolve the enormous problems that exist in the health services.</P>
    <P>There are many ways we could increase employment.  We have all heard about the targets but if we take emigration, the number of school leavers joining the labour force and the number who are unemployed, we are talking about well in excess of 200,000 people our of work for many years to come.  We must do more to create jobs.  Fishing and agriculture could help if we got our act together.  The position in regard to those industries is a disgrace.  We have an enormous problem in regard to agriculture in that we have the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and the &ldquo;have-nots.&rdquo; At last, the dairy farmer with a reasonably viable quota having worked seven days per week for 52 weeks of the year, has a good income.  The sheep farmer who is a specialist and knows what he is doing also has a reasonable income but the tillage farmers, the dry stock farmers and those with small enterprises, are living at subsistence level.</P>
    <P>I have quoted the figures in regard to Wexford and the Minister should bear them in mind.  Wexford farmers got into <Col N="1583" /> dairy farming late and we have very few large quota holders.  We are a dry stock and tillage county and that is why most of the farmers in that county are on the economic borderline.  Other Senators will have examples from their counties but I will refer to what I know best which is the position in my county.</P>
    <P>I should like to put a number of questions to the Minister concerning the off-course betting tax.  I accept that when one takes into consideration health and education it is not a major issue but we are a horse-loving country.  Every person, from those living in the smallest house downtown to those living in the largest house on the outskirts of our towns, loves horses.  One does not have to own a horse to love horses.  People watch horse racing on TV at weekends and often gamble on it.  I should like to ask if it will be possible to reduce the off-course betting tax and make a 2 per levy available to fund the racing industry.  Those proceeds should be used to fund the prize money and help racecourse owners to improve the tracks and accommodation.  Most of our rural racecourses are in imminent danger of closure.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that 50,000 jobs are directly related to the horse industry.  I am referring to those who provide feed, the small farmer breeder, those who work in stud farms, the lads in the yards, the trainers, the jockeys and those employed at racecourses.  There is an enormous hidden employment factor around the Irish thoroughbred.  It should be noted that I have not referred to the half-bred animal.  We are the Mecca of the horse racing industry.  The Taoiseach, some years past, took a wise decision in exempting stallion fees.  We have attracted investment in the horse industry. I have no doubt we could increase the number of people employed in the horse industry to 100,000 in three years if we stimulated the racing industry by changing the off-course betting tax and substituting a levy to be paid to the racing board.  I asked the Minister to consider such a move last year and I am extremely disappointed that Deputy Reynolds, the <Col N="1584" /> Minister for Finance, did not do so.  I accept that that industry is close to his heart.  I am not very worried about the level of the betting tax but I am concerned about creating jobs.  I have no doubt that we could create jobs if we targeted some money directly to the horse industry rather than to the coffers of the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to stress that I am disappointed the Minister for Finance did not take my suggestion on board for which he would have had all-party support.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Jim Mitchell, highlighted a problem some weeks ago that is worth referring to today.  He asked if a person on social welfare should consider taking on a job if offered it.  We must address that problem immediately. Let us consider the case of a married couple with four children on unemployment assistance.  I do not think it would be worth their while working if they took a job at the average industrial wage because they would lose their medical card and if they were on differential rent their rent would increase, We must remember that school transport, the free fuel scheme and so on are hitched to medical cards and if such a couple lost their medical card they would suffer badly.  The net loss would be far more than appears from a first reading of the figures.  Will the Minister outline the Government's plans in terms of next year's budget to rectify that enormous problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1585" /> If there is no incentive for couples with more than three children to work, how can we hope to achieve the targets referred to by the Minister and the Government?  We cannot expect an overnight doubling of the average industrial wage because the manufacturing sector which is contributing so much to the other indicators could not afford it.  They would have to shed half of their jobs if they had to give a sizeable increase in pay to the other workers.</P>
    <P>We should look at this area immediately. The medical card has become a most valuable tool, particularly to those less well-off in our economy.  There is security in having a medical card &mdash; at least there was when one could get treatment instantly &mdash; and that security will continue.  Will the Minister consider basing eligibility for a medical card on net income for those on low incomes rather than on gross income?  There is a lot of money involved in such a move and I do not have time to go into the figures now.</P>
    <P>There is a major problem in regard to this in that the person who brings home £130 net pay does not have a medical card while the person in receipt of £130 net from social welfare has a medical card.  The reason is that the gross pay of the person at work may be £160 per week and that figure precludes him from entitlement to a medical card.  Eligibility for a medical card is assessed on gross pay.  That is one of the greatest anomalies and inequalities in the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>I accept that if we were to change it we would bring many more people into the medical card category.  However, if those on social welfare, which is a net take-home payment, are given a medical card on the basis of their benefit, surely those with the same amount of disposable income should be assessed in the same way.  Their living standards are similar. In fact, the man or woman working would perhaps have a lower living standard if he or she had to do without the medical card and yet have the same amount of money in his or her pocket each week.</P>
    <P>We have been expecting a lot from the <Col N="1586" /> Structural Funds.  I hope the Structural Funds live up to even half their promise.  I am afraid we may be using them as a massive pain killer to dull the senses to the real problems we face.  No money is being made available from the Structural Funds for coastal works.  There have been calls for major capital schemes under the Coast Protection Act, but as far as I can ascertain, nothing has been mentioned about spending money on coast protection over the next four to five years when we will get large amounts of money from the Structural Funds.  This needs to be clarified.  There have been major problems along the east coast, particularly in the last few days, and there have been ongoing problems at Greystones and Rosslare Strand for over two decades. Maintenance moneys are being spent each year.  If they were capitalised we would be able to fund a capital scheme under the Coast Protection Act if the commitment was there for the Government to do so.  The Government should consider providing money for coast protection from the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I hope the Structural Funds will be used to light productive fires in our economy, not just once off spending on capital schemes.  I hope following the three or four years of heavy investment from Europe and Ireland, we will have something to show and there will be ongoing jobs coming from the priming catalyst that, hopefully, the Structural Funds will prove to be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the Government would decribe this as a state of the nation Bill.  For most backbenchers like myself it presents us with an opportunity to touch on most aspects of Government life and on the Estimates as we see them, and to talk about where we are going.  When we talk about what the future holds it is no harm to look back at where we have come from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1987, a minority Government took over a country which, in my opinion, was in very poor shape and did not seem to have a very good future.  At that time 250,000 people were unemployed and the <Col N="1587" /> number was rising.  The economy was static and interest and inflation rates were very high; they are still high.  Generally, the public finances were out of control. As Senator Avril Doyle said, a minority Government came into office and they received the help of their friends on the other side.  The Tallaght Strategy also was a help.  I often think that that strategy was twofold.  Perhaps it was used to give the newly elected leader of the Fine Gael Party a breathing space to build up his party.  He was probably correct in doing so.</P>
    <P>Today we could probably agree with a phrase which was used at that time: we did have an economic miracle.  This phrase has been used by many commentators and it is not inappropriate. Our financial standing has been restored, employment is increasing and unemployment is falling.  We have achieved a rate of economic progress that is among the fastest in the industrialised world.  In spite of our financial difficulties we have improved the position of the less well off and the disadvantaged, who were referred to by Senator Doyle.  The position of the long-term unemployed and low income families has also been improved, not solved.  I intend to deal with this matter at some length later.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to look back at where we have come from.  I think the Government will continue the successful policies implemented by the previous Government. As we know, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>National Development Plan</i> were prepared and implemented by the previous Fianna Fáil Government, and it is the policy of this Government to continue to implement them.  In the discussions on the formation of the Government there was an additional agenda but there is broad agreement on policy.  These policies are compatible with the existing policies and programmes to which both parties aspire.</P>
    <P>Great progress has been made during the past two and a half years in restoring confidence and obtaining growth in the economy.  It is very important that I mention that this was worked for.  The trade <Col N="1588" /> unions, the farmers, the employers, the Government and other interested groups agreed on a programme and worked to implement it.  Our country, on the edge of Europe, far from many of its markets, is still relatively underdeveloped, but we can win for ourselves the material standards and the social and cultural amenities we aspire to if we put all our resources to work with firm, agreed objectives in mind.  We must continue with this approach and negotiate a new agreement to take us well into the next decade.</P>
    <P>What we must do now is translate economic growth into more jobs, as clearly the provision of jobs should be our first priority.  It is, I believe, a priority of the Government.  One way to combat poverty and reduce emigration levels is by providing extra employment.  We must all work for this.  The growth we have achieved should lead to substantial increases in employment in the years ahead.  Most of what is needed is now in place.  For example, the public finances have been put back on a sound footing and confidence has been restored both at home and internationally.</P>
    <P>Despite the recent increases, interest and inflation rates are still at very competitive levels.  However, both must be carefully monitored and kept at low levels.  We are told that inflation to mid-November 1989 stood at 4.7 per cent. This is good by European standards, and is well up on the figure of 2.5 per cent which obtained in 1987 when the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was agreed.  Various economists are saying that it will peak in early 1990 at 5 per cent which is still a relatively low figure. They are also saying that by this time next year it will have been reduced to 3 per cent or 3.5 per cent.  That would be good by any standards.  As we are aware, most of the increase in inflation has been imported.  There can be no domestic control over money and energy costs, the two classic examples, but political action can be taken to minimise the risk of a rise in costs in other areas, such as calling for pay restraint and having a taxation policy. It is going to be hard to convince workers in the public and private sectors that pay <Col N="1589" /> moderation might well be in their best interests.  That is a theory I would agree with, but as I said it is going to be hard to get that message across.  It is vital that the Government keep interest and inflation rates down to allow economic growth to be achieved.</P>
    <P>Interest rate increases are imported. We all know that there have been four increases since April.  High interest rates are part of the inflation package. Increases in interest rates also impinge on the Government finances in that they increase the cost of servicing the national debt.  The bigger the national debt the more difficult it is to provide tax cuts and other improvements.  I would stress that interest rate increases were imported. Many people thought that the July increase would not have come about. Strangely enough, I spoke to many experts in the field at the time and they said that .5 per cent might have been from external forces and that the other .5 per cent came about because we had not formed a Government at the time. We will have to continue to monitor interest rates.  I agree with many people who expressed surprise at the Central Bank decision of two weeks ago to increase interest rates by one per cent. We know that was caused by the massive outflows of money as a result of the fall in sterling.  We can all agree that that was the proper decision because we now find that within a short period much of that money has come back.</P>
    <P>When speaking this morning the Leader of the House said that during this debate we should talk about the Estimates, as indeed did Senator Doyle.  Looking at the Estimates it is obvious that they reflect the determination of the Government to tighten Government spending and to make economic progress.  Examination of some of the spending areas reveals the caring approach of the Government especially in the area of health, despite what Senator Doyle says. The 1990 allocation for health is almost £100 million higher than the budget provision last year.  That will allow health boards to at least continue their services and hopefully to improve their services, <Col N="1590" /> something to which we would all aspire. There should be more money for health and when the economy improves increased contributions should be made towards health.</P>
    <P>The question of social welfare was touched on by the previous speaker.  Here again, spending on social welfare illustrates the Government's commitment to protect and where possible improve the position of the underprivileged.  Over the years, Fianna Fáil Governments have maintained their commitment to social welfare in periods of otherwise severe Government expenditure reductions. The Estimate for Social Welfare this year increased by £135 million for improvements in payments introduced in the 1989 budget.  The Minister, however, did say that the nett sum might be down because of PRSI revenue buoyancy and other once off factors within the Department of Social Welfare.  In the area of social welfare the Fianna Fáil Party in Government have shown themselves to have a deep caring social philosophy.  When resources were available in 1980, 1981 and 1982 we gave 25 per cent increases in social welfare benefits.  Despite the financial difficulties during the past two years, the level of social welfare benefits were not only maintained but improved in a number of ways.</P>
    <P>Recently I read in <i>Topic</i>, a local newspaper in Mullingar, a three page exposé on moneylending, which has caused the breakup of lives, marriages and homes. The article described families and people fleeing the town for fear of the Mafia-type tactics of these illegal moneylenders. The legislation dealing with moneylending goes back to 1900 or 1933 and the fines for offences are nominal today. This legislation needs to be totally updated and I would ask the Minister to examine this area.  More properly it is within the ambit of the Minister for Justice.  I know that the Minister for Social Welfare gave the Society of St. Vincent de Paul an extra £200,000 by way of a loan guarantee fund to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>Moneylending is a fact of life.  From time to time we all borrow money but <Col N="1591" /> most of us tend to borrow from credit unions, banks and so on at reasonable interest rates.  The illegal moneylenders are charging excessive rates and this is something which must be examined.  The reporter who wrote the article in <i>Topic</i> also wrote to me detailing the interest rates they found, ranging from 251 per cent to 3,500 per cent, to 73,000 per cent as verified by a chartered accountant who had been employed to examine the figures when researching the article that was produced.  That is horrific and it should be investigated.  I know the Minister is keenly aware of the problem.  As far as I know the appropriate interest rate should be in the region of 39 per cent, but in this case things have got out of hand.  I urge the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Justice to come together to introduce legislation to stamp out this horrific abuse.</P>
    <P>In relation to the environment I would refer to the question of roads.  In fairness, since this Government came to office they have been more than generous with roads allocations when compared to the previous Coalition Government.  In their last year the figure for county roads was something in the region of £4.5 million. On coming to Government the Minister, Deputy Flynn, gave £10 million immediately and the following year it was £15 million.  This year the Government are providing £415.7 million, current and capital, for roads in 1990 compared with £194 million in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Government are.  This is the highest allocation made by any Government for roads.  It will allow significant progress to be made on the development of our national roads.  This development is long overdue.  In Athlone, for instance, I can see the benefit of the money.  There is a £35 million by-pass, the money being provided by the EC.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but is certainly the majority of it.  The work at present in progress on major projects throughout the country is much needed.  We have work on the Navan Road, the western by-pass and so on.  They are all very important.  In the Minister's constituency there is work on the Cork-Mallow road and on the Glanmire by-pass.  A sum of £51 million will be allocated to county roads.  The Minister for Finance said last year on the budget there was the element of movement and flexibility about.  The Government have acted wisely in regard to this important problem.</P>
      <P>Another area of local government which interests all of us is the natural environment.  When we talk about that we really mean the air we breathe, the water we use, the seas around us, the lakes and rivers that belong to us, not to a Government or any section.  We all have a direct interest in their preservation.  We need a greater, newer, better awareness in the community that our environment is under pressure.  Each and every one of us in his or her own way can contribute to maintaining and improving our heritage.  We should endeavour not to damage our heritage and environment.  The need to protect our natural environment should be given high priority, as indeed it is by the Government.</P>
      <P>Over the years the Government have brought in new measures that were important.  The Air Pollution Bill controlled harmful emissions.  A new Water Pollution Bill provides many heavy penalties. We have controls over CFCs to protect the ozone layer and that is being done in collaboration with our European partners, and there is a tax incentive scheme in regard to lead-free petrol.  I am amazed that the usage of lead-free petrol in this country is only about 11 or 12 per cent because it is much higher in other countries.  Apart from all that, it is much cheaper than leaded petrol.  There should be a greater awareness programme in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Awareness in regard to urban renewal schemes, better planning and better understanding of the problems could <Col N="1593" /> improve our position in the years ahead. Under the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats joint <i>Programme for Government</i> we will have a full independent environmental monitoring agency who will provide the information to enable the Government environment impact assessments to be made.  The Minister with responsibility for this matter, Deputy Mary Harney, has a flair for this type of work, is committed to it and I think she will, in time, get the desired results.</P>
    <P>I will mention something with which most of us agree.  Over the years successive Governments have paid lip-service to reform of local government.  I urge the Government to press ahead as a matter of urgency with reform of the structures and finances of the system before it is too late.</P>
    <P>Education is surely of importance to us and I am sure Senator O'Toole will agree with this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the position we find ourselves in, which it is to be hoped will improve dramatically, we have the best educated generation of young people in most countries of the world.  Our educational standards are better than those in most countries and I think that is accepted.  This year the Education Estimate has been increased.  It reflects high ESF receipts which are expected in 1990 but gross expenditure on second and third level education will increase by 4 per cent and 13 per cent respectively and this will allow for overall increases in the numbers entering the system, particularly at third level.  When we consider what is being done at present in the knowledge that the economy is improving, we can say we are doing fairly well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I like about the Estimates this year is the fact that the educational opportunities scheme is being expanded. I think we will have over 300 places by the end of 1990.  The scheme allows for long term unemployed to return to full time education while retaining their social welfare entitlements.  Other <Col N="1594" /> measures I welcome which are reflected in the provision this year are the appointment of extra remedial teachers and other teachers in disadvantaged schools.</P>
    <P>I think we have succeeded in creating levels of educational standards and educational opportunity which very few countries with greater resources have achieved.  The excellent standards of education achieved by our young people perhaps is not admitted at home but it is often commented upon by many leading businessmen and industrialists who come here.  Indeed, in the past they have been here head-hunting for the very best talent we have available.  Education is the key to social justice and this Government's commitment to education is strong.</P>
    <P>The opening up of third level educational establishments such as the RTCs and the National Institutes of Higher Education which recently have gained university status are important advances in meeting the educational demands of modern society.  The number of our students qualifying for and attending higher education is higher in percentage terms than in most developed economies.</P>
    <P>The question of Structural Funds has been touched on.  They have placed a significant role in helping to finance Government development programmes over the years.  This year the Community have made a commitment of, I believe, almost £3 billion.  That is important in the whole domestic and international development of this country.</P>
    <P>We can say with certainty that the prospects for the Irish economy continue in the main to be favourable.  This has to be contrasted with the economic stagnation of the early part of the decade.  The evidence is clear all round.  Apart from the recent increase in inflationary pressure, the experience of the Irish economy over the past three years had been encouraging. It is highly desirable that the process of fiscal adjustment be continued so the gains made to date can be consolidated and extended in the coming years.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle rightly asked what it all means to people on low incomes, the disadvantaged, the poor, social welfare <Col N="1595" /> recipients.  They could not care less about GNP or past or current deficits.  Unless and until we get our public finances back on a sound basis, until we get full confidence in the economy restored at home and internationally, unless and until we get continued economic growth, we will not create jobs in the public or private sectors, and if we do not succeed, the better way of life we aspire to will not be achieved.</P>
    <P>I do not, for one moment, profess to be an expert in the field of economics, but my gut feeling tells me, and the natural instincts of the Minister &mdash; I am not saying we were comparing notes &mdash; tell him that the Government must put their House in order.  <i>The Programme for National Recovery</i> has shown what can be done when Government, the trade unions, farmers and other groups, reach a consensus on economic and social objectives.  If the position of the poor, the less well off and the disadvantaged is to continue to improve, the momentum of <i>The Programme for National Recovery</i> must continue.  If we want to provide better health, social welfare and education services &mdash; I am not forgetting measures to relieve the heavy burden of personal taxation for those at work &mdash; and achieve those aspirations, it is highly desirable that the process of fiscal adjustment be continued so that the gains to date can be consolidated and extended in the coming year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to reflect on some of the comments made by the previous speaker.  I wish to place firmly on the record the disgraceful fact that the Minister did not see it important enough to make even a passing reference to education in his address.  The Minister of State at the Department of Education would feel this is a disgraceful omission. It is quite difficult to take some of the <Col N="1596" /> views, particularly some of the concluding remarks, and I quote: &ldquo;the turnaround in our economic fortunes over the last few years has been remarkable.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would like somebody to tell the poor, the unemployed and disadvantaged and the emigrants about the remarkable turnaround in our fortunes at a time when unemployment is showing no improvement; the poor are getting poorer and more and more are emigrating.</P>
      <P>Because of the limited time available to me I intend to deal with those aspects of the Appropriation Bill which refer to education at primary level.  I am sure that will not come as a surprise to anybody. We have heard down the years from the parties in Government that the formula for success would be to achieve the equation of control and reduction in inflation, interest rates and the national debt.  Government policy and financial stringency was directed at the control and reduction of inflation, interest rates and the national debt.  The case was made that all would be well if inflation, interest rates and the national debt were brought under control.  It was as if the whole nation was shooting up on heroin &mdash; everything would be great when we controlled inflation, interest rates and the national debt.  We have done it but there have been no improvements for those on the periphery of society.</P>
      <P>At present the options for the poor are fairly restricted: a living death, death itself or leaving the country.  It seems to me that the problems of the under-privileged, the marginalised and those who are discriminated against in our society are well reflected in the cavalier and irresponsible attitude of this Government to primary education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In primary education no group are getting the necessary resources to do the job.  Primary education is under-financed and under-resourced at every level.  It is important to put some of Senator Fallon's comments in their proper context.  The cynicism and hypocrisy of the Government are well reflected in the manner in which new jobs are brought to the attention of the board of management of primary schools.  The Minister referred <Col N="1597" /> to the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> I want to give an example of how the taxpayer is being blinded by the whole situation.  Following the process of negotiation of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> the Government gave a commitment to the disadvantaged that a certain number of extra jobs would be available in primary schools in various parts of the country &mdash; schools that were entitled to extra staff and which had been identified as under-privileged, disadvantaged and not having the appropriate staffing level to deliver the service.</P>
    <P>Earlier in the summer the Minister gave a commitment that the jobs would take effect from September, but this did not happen in September, October or November, and only now are they in the process of being filled.  The cynicism of the operation to which I want to refer is that in each of the 100 extra jobs, the board of management received a notification of the appointment of an extra teacher from their local Fianna Fáil TD. Not content that the taxpayer is bearing the burden of cutbacks and economic stringency, the Government are also making them suffer delays while the local Fianna Fáil TD, by the good grace of the Minister, informs the local school of the appointment of an extra teacher and gets credit for doing so.  This has nothing to do with the local Fianna Fáil TD and is the result of negotiations by others.</P>
    <P>It is a disgraceful reflection on our society that it now becomes the norm for every administrative and executive decision of Departments to be conveyed to the local interested parties by their local Fianna Fáil TD.  I would like the Minister to explain why that should be the case and why the normal day to day decisions have to be conveyed via the local politicians.  I make this point very firmly.  I spoke strong words in this Chamber last week, with which a great many people took umbrage, on the extent to which clientelism is rampant in our democracy.  People have been tempted to take me to task over the past week on various aspects of what I had to say. Everything I read on the Estimates and the Appropriations-in-Aid shows that <Col N="1598" /> they are designed to allow the development and support of the system of clientelism, which has now been brought to a fine art.  Just this week, a teacher in a south side school telephoned me to say that the school had just received a letter from their local Fianna Fáil TD telling them they were getting a part-time clerk-typist under the auspices of FÁS.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is bad enough to see Departments operating in this way, but now it has been extended to FÁS.  Where does it go from here?  When I point out how our whole system is being manoeuvered in order to supplement this level of clientelism it is considered an inappropriate comment.  Were it not for the time constraints I could go on at some length in this area.  Everything I see in the Estimates supports what I say.  I want to make some comments on the Education Estimates, aspects of which were very discriminately neglected in Senator Fallon's comprehensive contribution.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out some of the difficulties in primary education and go through them very quickly.  We have a huge involvement and commitment to the level of investment in preparing young teachers, probably at a cost to the State of about £30,000 each.  There are now many unemployed primary teachers propping up the infrastructure of the UK, the US, Canada, Australia and many other places, representing an investment of the order of £60 million by the Irish taxpayer.  This £60 million was invested by the Irish taxpayer to improve the Irish primary education system.  As soon as the teachers come on stream, the Minister closes down the job availability and the teachers are doing anything and everything except what they were educated and trained to do, which is to reduce the class sizes in primary education and to deliver a quality service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The substitute teachers in primary schools are paid so little that they are better off working in a burger joint or in a lounge bar.  While that might be hearsay, I can give conclusive evidence that a <Col N="1599" /> substitute teacher working every day of the school year would be paid £10 less per week than a cleaner in the public service &mdash; that is no reflection on those workers in the public service; I merely want to put in context how we are treating these young professionals.</P>
    <P>We now come to the class teacher who copes, without support, with indiscipline, litigation threats, stress and other difficulties that come from the home and the community into the classroom every Monday morning.</P>
    <P>Remedial teachers are in very short supply.  I can give national, international or any other kind of statistics to support that statement but I do not think anybody would disagree with me.  On the Government benches today there are people representing many small local communities. The system of appointment of remedial teachers is weighted against minorities and small schools.  It is very difficult for the small school to have access to the remedial teacher for the simple reason that they work on the basis of one per a certain number of pupils.  In most cases they have to be shared over a number of primary schools and because the area is too wide these small schools do not have access to these teachers.  The child in the small rural school or in the small minority religion school in need of remedial teaching does not have access to it.  As a rule of thumb remedial teaching is required by 10 per cent of the school-going population.  We do not even have 50 per cent of the number of remedial teachers we need to provide even the basics for these children.</P>
    <P>Special class teachers are being told to integrate.  I met a parent last week who has a Down's syndrome child who tried to find a place for her child in the local area.  She has been told by the Department of Education that the School Attendance Act does not apply to her child.  That is incorrect.  It shows how these people are being treated and the attitude in the Department is to bring them to their local school and to integrate them into the normal community.  That <Col N="1600" /> is an acceptable and commendable aspiration, except that the resources are not there to do it.  One cannot bring a child in a wheelchair into a school without ramps; one cannot bring a spina bifida child into a school where there are no changing facilities and so on.  This is how we treat our minority groups.</P>
    <P>Almost 3,000 primary schools have a teaching principal, in other words, a teacher who, in addition to opening the school, checking the heat, making the system operate, trying to maintain and administering the school, and trying to enforce discipline and looking after the special needs of the pupils, has to teach a class.  He is asked to do the impossible.</P>
    <P>The administrative principal in the larger school, when the appointment of such is allowed, has to deal with increased indiscipline problems, increased parental involvement and pressure, which is recognisable and acceptable, and increased social problems; he also has to be the caretaker, typist, secretary, receptionist and educationalist.  He too is expected to do the impossible.  This is how we work.  I will refer in a few moments to the lack of caretakers and clerk typists and I will ask the Minister to explain how he or she can justify the huge investment on buildings and then leave them without proper maintenance.</P>
    <P>In relation to back up services, there is no school psychological service at primary level.  The Minister has been promising to set up one for the past two years. She said this service will be advertised next month, and a pilot scheme will be put in operation next year, but it still has not happened.  Even if it does, we are talking only about a pilot scheme of two, three or four psychologists.</P>
    <P>What does one say to the mother who comes to the school and has to go through the trauma of hearing from the teacher or principal that her child needs some sort of special attention and needs to be assessed, but that it could take two years before the child will be assessed?  We are not talking about a replacement hip but two of the most formative years of a child's life which can never be replaced. Yet we tell them they have to wait, unless <Col N="1601" /> they go to Fitzwilliam Square and buy the services of a psychologist.  That is what is happening in the two-tier system.</P>
    <P>School inspectors are being told to restrict their school visits because they have used up the money devoted to expenses for this year.  This is how our system is operating; not even on a shoestring. I invite anybody to walk into the Department of Education and see what the officials are trying to do.  In my experience over the past ten years the number of officials has halved and the amount of work has doubled.  It is as well to put that on the record because very often it is the civil servants and the public service who are blamed when the service is not efficient.  They too are trying to do the impossible.</P>
    <P>I have discussed the unemployed teacher who does not have a future at work, the substitute teacher who is wondering when he or she will be paid, the class teacher coping with the impossible, the remedial teachers in short supply, the special class teachers who are told to integrate pupils without support, the teaching principals doing all the jobs necessary to keep the school in operation &mdash; including teaching, the administrative principals barely able to cope because of the pressure of work, and the inspectors being restrained and restricted in their work, the Department officials who are under-staffed and overworked and not getting the support they need.  What is the Minister's response?  In this year's Estimates &mdash; with all the improvements referred to by Senator Fallon, the Minister's response is to increase by 77 per cent her international activities for next year.  I should like to put that in context.</P>
    <P>While the whole teaching and education service is trying to cope with an under-resourced, and underfinanced system &mdash; the worst financed educational system in western Europe &mdash; the Minister's only response is to increase her overseas activities by 77 per cent for the coming year.  I am not going to throw out simple percentages which do not mean anything.  This brings me back to the matter of funding.  The Minister is spending more on international activities &mdash;<Col N="1602" /> which means foreign travel &mdash; in the next year than the total amount paid to the pupils in the Minister's constituency, in the constituency of the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport, Deputy Lyons, or in the constituency of the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Fahey &mdash; both of whom were here a few minutes ago.  More money will be spent on foreign travel out of the Department of Education's budget next year than the total capitation grant for running the schools in any constituency in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I will put that in context, the amount allocated for foreign travel next year is £500,000, the total grant available to schools which have 20,000 pupils.  Is there a constitutency in Ireland with 20,000 primary school pupils?  It does not exist. I will explain what that means.  The Minister for Education in each year will decide on a certain amount of money to operate primary schools based on a grant per pupil.</P>
    <P>At present the State grant is £25 per pupil per year to run a primary school but they cannot operate on that kind of money because it is not enough.  In every case of which I know the total State grant is not enough to pay the insurance and heating bills in a school and it will not go anywhere towards financing all the rest of the functions a school management board are supposed to carry out &mdash; heating, cleaning, lighting, dusting, washing and all that goes with it, as well as the provision of school equipment and minor grants for school requisites.  This means that all schools operate an interminable round of fund raising from a sponsored spell to a sponsored walk, sweepstakes, draw, raffles and race nights.  You can be sure that anything you mention has been ingeniously adopted by a board of management as a means of raising money.  It is no more than a further educational tax that local people are being asked to pay in order to keep their primary schools operational.  Why is this necessary?  It is necessary because of the Government's attitude.  It is necessary because, for instance, there are only about 200 caretakers in primary schools, despite the fact <Col N="1603" /> that there are 3,500 primary schools in the country.</P>
    <P>What does that mean?  It means that we spent the necessary couple of hundred thousand pounds to build a primary school, give it to the local community to look after but we do not give them the funds to do so.  Then they set about their fund raising to provide whatever they need, and for which they do not have a grant.  Whatever the principal objection that many of us might have to this compulsion to raise a further education tax in order to run the primary school, can I ask the Minister what he says to the communities when they do not have any extra discretionary money to provide extra funds for the local primary school?  Let me tell the House what happens in that situation; they do without.  Consequently, when you go into the disadvantaged or under-privileged area you will see a drab, shabbily presented school with no money for paint, cleaning or extras.  Worse than that, if you look closely and if you discuss it with the teachers you will find a restricted level of educational activity, a less comprehensive school tour, a shorter book list and fewer extra subjects or activities being offered because they do not have any money.  In the well off areas if they want to provide any kind of extra sporting activity they simply collect from the parents who can afford to pay the bill.</P>
    <P>What happens in the area where there is 70 per cent or 80 per cent unemployment? They do without.  That is what happens, even though the turnaround in our economic fortunes over the last few years has been remarkable.  If the turnaround has been remarkable who is gaining the benefits?  The poor have become poorer, the disadvantaged have become more disadvantaged and the under-privileged have become more under-privileged.</P>
    <P>As Senator Fallon said, we have a level and quality of primary education of which we can be proud and which compares with any place in Europe.  This is because of the extraordinary investment that this country has made in terms of <Col N="1604" /> talent, energy and commitment to primary education, the Irish primary teacher is, without doubt, the cream of Europe's teaching talent.  That is not in any sense a nationalistic or a narrow chauvinistic view.  It is the perception of educationalists in the community.</P>
    <P>In this country we get the best quality young people, train and educate them to be primary teachers and then put them into the job with little or no resources so that we have all this talent invested in the primary school&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and all the energy and all the commitment of those people which makes the system work.  The Irish primary teacher with the largest classes in Europe, the fewest resources in Europe, the lowest level of finance in Europe, is far and away the most productive teacher in Western Europe.  That is how we manage to have a quality service in this country at primary level.  That is the investment and nobody will doubt that. Now I will tell the House about the cost. The cost is career burn out and teachers leaving the system because they are unable to cope with the levels of stress and demands on their time.  The Irish primary teacher is now at the top of divison one of the stress related illnesses. That is a fact, I am not making it up. We are bringing the primary education system along on the backs of a burned out, stressed teaching force and it is time that we recognised that.</P>

I did not carry out that study.  A teachers' union did not carry out that study.  It was not carried out by teachers.  It was published by the European Economic <Col N="1605" /> Community in June 1988 and was widely covered in the newspaper at that time. Those are facts which you may not like but they are facts.</P>

      <P>Try telling that to boards of management who try to run schools without funds; try to tell that to teachers who try to deliver a quality of education service without resources.  It is inexcusable and unacceptable.  We are all aware of it and the best thing to do is to go down to the local schools and get the information there.  We have a system now where primary schools are wide open to a litigation conscious community and where teachers have developing and increasing discipline problems.  In many parts of the country, teachers are spending up to 50 per cent of their time coping with discipline problems with no support whatsoever from the Department of Education.  No resources are available to deal with discipline problems in primary schools; no resources whatsoever are being made available so that children with discipline problems can be helped. I want to make it clear that children, whether they have discipline problems or <Col N="1606" /> otherwise, are still entitled to the best quality of education that is available. School building grants have been cut back.  The whole level of investment is not even keeping pace with inflation.  The only significant increase in the Department of Education's budget for the forthcoming year is for foreign travel.  I will finish with that single item.  I went through the problems in education; I will not re-iterate them.  They go through every level of teaching, from the pupil right up to the Department of Education. The Minister's response is to spend more on foreign travel next year than in capitation grants for primary schools in the whole countries of Donegal or Sligo.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I should start promoting boxing.  We seem to have some keen contestants on the premises.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech is, in many ways, significant for what it does not stress.  We are now developing a two-tier society with the wealthy getting wealthier and the poor getting poorer.  The latest figures indicate fairly clearly &mdash; and they have not been effectively contradicted as far as I can see &mdash; that there are now about one million people, out of a total population of 3.5 million, living below the poverty line, that is almost 50 per cent of the population.  It is really a shocking and frightening statistic.  There is about 250,000 people unemployed and emigration is running at the rate of 40,000 to 50,000 per year.</P>
      <P>These are facts which have not received very much emphasis in the Minister's contribution.  They contrast sharply with the reality of the profits of the multinational companies which are increasing and, of course, being repatriated. The profits of the major banking institutions were never better.  These are in sharp contast with what I have outlined. The multinational companies are creating jobs in their home countries&mdash; America, Japan and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the appalling problem of emigration. We have marched our way back <Col N="1607" /> to the fifties.  The young are now emigrating as they went then, and they are coming back at Christmas time in their droves, as they did then.  We do not seem to be doing very much about emigration beyond denouncing it; some of the other elements tell us that after fashion, it is somehow good and somehow desirable. I, for one, reject the notion that emigration on the present scale is to be anything other than deplored.  There are two broad categories of people going from the country at present.  One is the highly educated, the greatest resource this country could possibly have and that must be a matter of great regret as well as a serious drain on our resources.  The other is the poor, the uneducated and those who are very poorly equipped to cope with life in foreign countries.  These are the people who will be written about in the London newspapers.  As the song by Ralph McTell says, &ldquo;It's a Long Long Way from Clare to Here&rdquo;.  Some of these people go away and are never officially spoken about again.  What are we doing for these people?  There has not been any mention in the Minister's contribution of providing resources to make life easier for them, to better equip them to meet the challenges which face them when they go off to foreign countries.</P>
    <P>Our health services continue to remain in crisis.  That is the reality from which there is no escape.  In 1985, around 7 per cent of national wealth was spent on the health services.  That has declined steadily and it is projected that in 1991 it will be less than 6 per cent.  We have a large elderly population.  We have a large young population.  Then we have this group in the middle, the most capable and the most productive who are mining, who have emigrated.  We see the problems of stress arising from unemployment. They manifest themselves in people taking drugs or alcohol and getting involved in anti-social behaviour.</P>
    <P>In the health area there is the appalling problem of the mentally handicapped. The lack of resources for these people puts a terrible strain on their parents. During the last general election, this was <Col N="1608" /> one of the problems which kept surfacing as I canvassed through Crumlin, Terenure and Walkinstown.  There is a major problem here.  In the Eastern Health Board area alone, 328 residential places are needed now as a matter of urgency and it is expected there will be need for over 500 extra places after 1990. What are the Government going to do about that?  It is dreadful problem.  The resources which are made available for these people are grossly inadequate.  I have had representations from people who have the greatest difficulty coping with their handicapped children who are now moving into middle age.  As people these parents grow old and become less capable, they worry about what will become of their now almost middle-aged child.</P>
    <P>In Dublin the accident and emergency services are used as a back-door to hospitalisation. It seems that elective procedures can no longer be performed. There is a great crisis in Dublin and throughout the country.  In Country Clare, the Ennis Hospital and its future continues to dominate the political scene.  It has been a key issue since before the last election, and I believe it was still being debated on Clare radio as late as Monday morning.</P>
    <P>There is the problem of the Health Research Board with a cutback of £1 million in a total budget of something like £2½ million or £3 million.  That means that, effectively, no new research can be carried out; effectively, our contribution and involvement with European research in the area of health would have to be very seriously diminished; our capacity to attract resources for research in health from Europe will be seriously diminished; and the capacity of our research workers to make contacts among their European counterparts will be seriously curtailed and that will be a particular problem in those areas of health research which are as it were, not very appetising from a financial point of view.  Certainly money will be pumped in by the big drug companies in areas where one can see an immediate return.</P>
    <P>The big potential in health for help for <Col N="1609" /> the public seems to be in the area of preventive medicine.  We are doing very little there.  It is in that area that the Health Research Board were particularly strong defining the causes of diseases, looking at the trends etc.  It is not very trendy stuff, not an immediate money spinner, but a slow, tiresome process which will, in the longterm pay dividends. It is a matter of great regret that that Health Research Board should have been cut back to the extent it was.  It is shocking that some of the leading members of the research board are threatening to resign and, one of them, the provost of Trinity College, has resigned as a result of those cutbacks.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to be as comprehensive as Senator Joe O'Toole was on education.  However, I want to echo some of the things he said.  For example, in the primary sector I believe there is a planned cutback of the order of 1 per cent in real terms.  Also in the primary sector class sizes remain unacceptably large.  There are classes with 40 pupils presenting teachers with an unacceptable challenge/problem.  There are constant demands from schools for funds.  Hardly a week goes past without beleaguered teachers and parents' associations trying to devise some new fund-raising idea, ranging from quiz nights to race nights, voluntary contributions and so on.</P>
    <P>I understand there is a freeze on the amount of money being provided for second level education resulting in teachers being lost.  For example, in the Holy Faith Convent in The Coombe in my constituency of Dublin South-Central they are experiencing a very serious problem in that there are insufficient teachers, presenting a very serious crisis for the whole school.</P>
    <P>There are also problems being experienced in third level education.  The overall scene in third level raises serious questions in regard to equality in our society.  Education was seen as a way of equalising, as it were, some of the social differences in society; it was regarded as a way up for people who happened to be born into under-privileged families. <Col N="1610" /> Anybody who has read Patrick Clancy's book &ldquo;Who goes to College&rdquo;&mdash; which perhaps should have been entitled &ldquo;Who does not go to College&rdquo; will realise that the under-privileged have a very poor or no chance at all of getting into college. Any society which fancies itself as being just and fair must begin to address such problems.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the points system and how people can make their way into college.  People take more and more courses in order to gain extra points.  I have no great objection to that, but I do object to the fact that those resources and facilities are available in a disproportionate manner.  The poor simply are not at the races when it comes to having those types of facilities available. In a recent debate in this House &mdash; on the Trustee Savings Banks Bill &mdash; a Minister continuously used the term &ldquo;a level playing field&rdquo;.  I should like to see somebody take a bulldozer to Irish education, particularly at third level, levelling the field to the extent that the poor and under-privileged would have a level and equal chance of getting into college.  That is a problem which should be addressed but it would appear that there has been no attempt to do so from the figures available.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of social welfare. I have already alluded to the fact that there are of the order of one million people, almost one-third of the entire population, below the poverty level.  We seem to be able to take this for granted. This is appalling; it is shocking that of the order of £100 million less will be spent on social welfare in the coming year.  I cannot understand why those £100 million available could not be put to developing some comprehensive social welfare facilities for the poorest, the most under-privileged elements in our society.  For example, there are the problems of the allowances available to unemployed people for children between the ages of, say, ten and 14 years.  If one calculates the relevant figures in regard to those allowances one discovers that the amount of money provided quite simply is not sufficient to provide those people with <Col N="1611" /> sufficient nutrients; they simply would not have sufficient to buy adequate food to supply children at that stage of development with their nutritional requirements.  These are not my calculations; they are the figures of some of our top nutritionists.</P>
    <P>I might give the House by way of an anecdote one example.  Last evening at approximately 8.30 p.m., in the freezing cold, two youngsters of around seven or eight years came to my door begging.  It is appalling that children of that age should be out on a night like that in those circumstances, unaccompanied by any adult.  It is a terrible commentary on society that that type of thing takes place as we approach the year 2000.</P>
    <P>There is also a growing crisis in housing, with something of the order of 1,500 houses being predicted to be built in 1990, in sharp contrast with the 7,500 built in 1985.  For those in the private housing sector mortgage interest rates are rising, presenting a serious problem for people with limited means.  Quite a number of people now experience great difficulty in meeting their mortgage repayments.  It appears that that trend will continue and that mortgagers will continue to experience the same serious problems in the year ahead.</P>
    <P>Also in crisis are the local authorities; for example, Waterford Corporation hit the headlines over the past weekend. Their whole system appears to have broken down.  There appears to be an inability to resolve the problems politically. I believe, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, in your town of Nenagh a similar crisis is manifesting itself, another example of the manner in which local authorities are starved of funds and are now unable to meet the basic requirements of the communities they serve.</P>
    <P>I might make a brief comment on agriculture. Senator Doyle spoke about agriculture, the problems being experienced by small farmers and so on.  Funds for Teagasc, the agricultural training and research authority, have been cut back by an amount of the order of seven per cent.  I understand that top class Irish <Col N="1612" /> farmers have attained a technological competence comparable to the best anywhere. That technological competence was brought into this country by the staff of Teagasc.  Teagasc have experienced a very difficult time over the past four or five years.  In many ways they have been demoralised or denigrated by people who should be ashamed of the way they have behaved.  They have been treated in a disgraceful manner.  We should remember that it was the people in Teagasc who built up our farmers enabling them to adapt to current technology.  It is disgraceful that that organisation is being subjected to another ferocious cutback on top of a series of others.  What will become of small farmers who can no longer afford the fees being charged by Teagasc?  The most awful aspect of all has been the chairman of that organisation describing the people working there as&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I really do think that comment was truly appalling.  I want to briefly mention overseas development aid.  I might describe it as one of the tracks of my LP which I intend to keep playing.  Senator Farrell will recognise the tune already.  Our overseas development aid to the Third World now stands at 0.13 per cent of GNP whereas the United Nations target is of the order of 0.7 per cent of GNP.  We are able to look at the awful problems in Ethiopia and the Government appear to be able to restrain themselves from responding.  That is an appalling commentary on our values and the way in which we view our fellow men who are under-privileged.</P>
      <P>It is also very foolish and short-sighted not to increase this aid because money spent on overseas development will repay itself many times over in the fullness of time.  There is a great level of good will towards us, and our clerical and lay workers have a tremendous history in helping to develop Third World and under-developed countries.  Even if we cannot, out of a sense of morality, reach the targets which have been agreed by the United Nations, then we should try to bring ourselves to meet them out of a sense of self-interest.</P>
      <P>Seán Lemass made the famous statement that &ldquo;a rising tide lifts all boats&rdquo;. Senator Doyle referred to the Tallaght Strategy and took a certain amount of credit for it.  That is fair enough but there is a down side to the Tallaght Strategy which Senator Doyle did not mention. Perhaps it is for people like me to mention this down side.</P>

They are coming home <Col N="1614" /> now and taking out their paint brush and sizing up the joint.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I thank the House for enabling the Government to get the Appropriation Bill through before the Christmas Recess.  I also thank those Senators who contributed to the debate and I look forward to the resumption of the discussion in more detail in the New Year.  Some of the points which have been raised here today will be addressed at that stage.</P>
      <P>In closing the debate today I shall make a few general points and on behalf of the Minister for Finance strike a note of caution about next year's budget.</P>
      <P>An examination of the various economic indicators over the past few years clearly shows that the economy is improving and tremendous progress has already been made.  In his introductory remarks the Minister of State, Deputy Lyons, pointed to some of these achievements: economic growth has resumed, investment has taken off, employment is growing and unemployment is falling, albeit at a slower pace than the Government would wish to see.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding all of the excellent advancement we have made over the last few years further progress must however be made.  To put this in perspective despite the improvement in the public finances new borrowing will still amount to some £600 million this year.  This will add to our debt-servicing costs in 1990 and subsequent years.  This will continue to be the case as long as the absolute level of our debt continues to grow.  Similarly, while the debt/GNP ratio has been stabilised and is now beginning to move downwards, it is still exceptionally high by EC standards.  This underlines the burden and constraint still imposed on the economy by the overhang of borrowing and debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must continue the downward pressure on borrowing and debt and debt-servicing costs.  In this regard the Government will be reviewing the latest budgetary developments as well as economic <Col N="1616" /> prospects both at home and abroad with a view to setting a new, more ambitious medium-term target as soon as possible. It is against this background that the Government are approaching the preparation of the 1990 budget.</P>
    <P>Even with the disciplined approach taken in the Estimates for 1990 the room for manoeuvre next year will again be narrow.  There will be heavy carry-over costs of about £160 million from the tax and social welfare concessions given in this year's budget.  The recent increases in interest rates will impact significantly on the cost of debt-servicing and the extra costs involved will have to be allowed for in the budgetary arithmetic.  Provision has also to be made for recently agreed special public service pay increases.  This is all before we consider income tax and social welfare concessions or any moves towards EC tax harmonisation.</P>
    <P>The various factors involved will have to be weighed carefully so as to arrive at a balanced package which will ensure further budgetary progress and stable development of demand in the economy next year.  I am fully confident that the Minister for Finance will achieve this balanced approach and that the economy will continue its recovery next year.</P>
    <P>Finally on behalf of the Government and on my own behalf I wish all members of the House, the staff and the press a happy and peaceful Christmas and a prosperous New Year.</P>

The Minister should perhaps have prefixed his remarks by apologising for the non-attendance of the Minister for Finance or the Minister of State at the Department of Finance during this debate today.  Is this another example of the cavalier disregard shown by the Government for Seanad Éireann. There is no point in talking about reform <Col N="1617" /> of the Seanad unless we operate it as it should be operated.  There may be good reasons &mdash; and perhaps we might be told &mdash; why neither the Minister nor the Minister of State at the Department of Finance felt it was worthwhile addressing this House today.</P>

      <P>I request Adjournment of the Seanad under Standing Order 29 on a specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration, namely, the emergency now obtaining in numerous places along the south coast caused by last weekend's disastrous floods, the need for Seanad Éireann to debate the matter urgently, especially as Dáil Éireann is not sitting, and the need for the Minister for the Environment to indicate how the Government propose to respond to the emergency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is straightforward <Col N="1619" /> because the Opposition raised the point that the Government by sleight-of-hand were trying to ensure that both Houses had risen for the Christmas recess before it would be noticed that Michael Mills in the position of the Ombudsman had not been ratified following his six years in office in accordance with section 2 of the Act establishing that office.  May I take it that we will be addressing Item No. 7 on the Order Paper?  Long before Item No. 3 appeared Senator Manning and I asked our motion to be taken.  It reads:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, pursuant to the provisions of section 2(2) and (4) of the Ombudsman Act, 1980, recommends to the President the reappointment of Mr. Michael Mills to the office of Ombudsman.</P>
      <P>Before the matter was debated in Dáil Éireann that motion was on the Seanad Order Paper.  I shall be referring to it in the course of my contribution.</P>

      <P>I am making the point, for the record, that before Item No. 3 appeared on the Order Paper Senator Manning and I requested in our motion the reappointment of Mr. Mills.  That was before the matter was taken in the Dáil. Thankfully we are discussing it today. The point I am trying to make is that the Taoiseach's efforts to get rid of Michael Mills were in vain, thank God.  There was all party agreement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling but I have made my point.  The rest of what I have said is on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was agreed in the early eighties by all parties that there was a necessity for <Col N="1620" /> an Ombudsman notwithstanding the fact that after a change of Government a Labour Party Minister for Labour, if I am correct, tried to thwart this even though there had been agreement prior to the election and the money was provided in the Estimates of that year.  Therefore there was a two year delay in appointing the man once the matter had been dealt with.  There was all party agreement on the appointment of the individual concerned. I suppose it is a bit much to claim precedent when it has only happened once before but given the importance and independence of the office we as legislators hoped that that system would operate in all future appointments.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman's resounding success in investigating individual grievances arising from public administration is testified by the huge number of cases he has successfully dealt with.  He has made a major impact on behalf of citizens generally, dealing with bureaucracy, helping them to redress grievances and so on. The volume of complaints has been well documented in reports of the Ombudsman. Indeed, matters got so bad because of cutbacks in the Estimate that last year he had to issue an individual report which caused major grievance for the Taoiseach and the Government.  This presumably, plus the chequered personal relationship between the two gentlemen, may be the reasons behind the Government trying to slip by beyond Christmas without reappointing Michael Mills.</P>
    <P>It gives me great pleasure, knowing the importance of his office and how important his commitment to his office is to the ordinary citizen to support the motion this afternoon.</P>
    <P>On the Order of Business, it was agreed that each side would have 15 minutes.  With your permission, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, I would like to split my time with my colleagues, Senator Cosgrave and Senator Jackman.  I am only taking five minutes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion which recommends the reappointment of Michael Mills as Ombudsman.  Unfortunately, it seems that some personality <Col N="1621" /> problem has arisen in connection with this appointment.  Prior to this appointment being made six years ago there were all party discussions and soundings between the Leaders of the political parties in the interest of ensuring that the person to be appointed would have the confidence of the political parties and would be a person fairly well known to the public.  It is a position to which one could not appoint someone with no experience of either the political system or the administration of public affairs.</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman acts as a sort of devil's advocate, as a public prosecutor and defender of the public's rights.  We have seen the success of the Ombudsman's office during the past few years and it is important that this office continues to function successfully.  It was disturbing to read some time ago that the Ombudsman had to go cap in hand to look for extra funds to employ an extra few people.  If the many queries the office has received are to be investigated expeditiously and thoroughly the Ombudsman needs staff at his disposal. It is important that we ensure that his office, above all others, has adequate staff to investigate complaints.</P>
      <P>There are two things we could say about the Office of the Ombudsman.  The first is that in investigating individual complaints that a person's rights have been infringed the office perhaps is that person's final court.  If the rights of the Ombudsman are being interfered with it is important that they be restored. Second, I hope the reports published by the Ombudsman will encourage the Government and the Department to change systems by way of changes in legislation to ensure that as far as possible delays are not repeated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies are criticised for dealing with queries but if a proper system was in place and if people felt they were not just a number when dealing with a Department we would not have them down at our clinics.  To a certain extent, each of us has been an unpaid ombudsman.  I hope also that no Department is issuing <Col N="1622" /> directives to officials that certain information is to be kept from the Ombudsman when he looks for files.  It is important that complete files are handed over to the Ombudsman to enable him adjudicate.  I do not think too many heads have rolled in Departments as a result of a person's rights being interfered with, but it is important that each person receives a full hearing and has his rights upheld.  Obviously, vexatious claims are made and these have to be dealt with.  It may be that a departmental official has been maligned in a certain way.</P>
    <P>I support my colleague, Senator Avril Doyle.  It is unfortunate that an individual's name has been mentioned in this debate.  It is important that the Office, irrespective of who holds the position, be respected and that its full powers be restored.  I hope in the coming years that the reports of the office of the Ombudsman will be reflected in changes in legislation enacted by this House and the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the recommendation that Mr. Michael Mills be reappointed by the President as Ombudsman.  It is both fortunate and unfortunate that the Government had to be forced to table a special resolution to defuse what would have been a controversial issue for a second time in the life of this individual.  I am happy that his position, as public watchdog, is being restored and I hope, like everyone else, that the resources necessary to enable him carry out that onerous job will be given to him.  He was reappointed under duress but that should not take from the ability or independence of the man.  He has worked like a Trojan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the devolution of powers, it amazes me that Departments value and treasure their independence so much that any independent voice raised on the inefficiencies of Departments can be resisted so vehemently.  Surely, this relieves Ministers of such onerous tasks as dealing with complaints about the inefficiency of the system.  Unfortunately, Michael Mills finds himself under pressure again for the second time in 18 months.  When he was first appointed for <Col N="1623" /> a term of six years there was total agreement between all the parties.  I would like to stress the importance of there being a unanimous voice from these Houses in regard to this appointment.  The ordinary citizen, in an age of intense consumer pushing, if he is to have his rights protected, needs someone who is independent. I welcome very much the reappointment of Mr. Mills.  I, and the Fine Gael Party, will be watching with interest to see if he will be given the necessary resources and funding to enable him do a good job on behalf of those who do not have the resources to fight their own case.  In fairness to Mr. Mills he did not engage in any lobbying for the position.  I consider that it was a well-thought-out oversight not to reappoint him without pressure from the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting the motion I would point out that public representatives in their own way were ombudsmen particularly in the area of local Government.  They highlighted many injustices and made representations on behalf of constituents in relation to planning, housing, telephone accounts and other areas.  That is part and parcel of the life of the public representative.  In many cases people feel that injustices are occuring and that bureaucracy has run riot. Apart from the public representatives there are two other ways of having problems resolved.  One is through the Ombudsman and the other through the civil courts.  But for the Ombudsman, court lists would be further clogged with all sorts of actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Michael Mills, the present occupant of the post of Ombudsman has given very fine service.  He is independent and has spoken out regularly in defence of his office when circumstances demanded it. When it was suggested that the Ombudsman should be a solicitor or a barrister, <Col N="1624" /> that did not appeal to me and Deputy FitzGerald in picking a person like Mr. Mills picked a practical man with experience and integrity.  Mr. Mills was a good choice who has proved himself in the interim.</P>
    <P>People come to me at local authority level about problems.  People bring their problems to the county manager, sometimes without success, and it is good that people have another recourse in the person of the Ombudsman.  The Ombudsman is seen as a higher independent authority than the county manager or the public representative.  It is important that people feel there is an independent watch dog and Mr. Mills has been a fair and independent watch dog who has given a competent performance during his term of office.  I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier this morning one of my colleagues expressed the view that this debate would not take long because it was yesterday's news.  So far as I am concerned it is very much today's news and the implications carry far beyond today, because the circumstances surrounding this proposed reappointment are, to say the least, disturbing.</P>
      <P>Ideally, there should not be any controversy about the Office of the Ombudsman, because any controversy is potentially damaging.  I know this from limited experience at university level where we have the local counterpart of an ombudsman who finds that his best work is done if he shuns the glare of publicity.  The same is true at national level.  Any suggestion or implication that the person is <i>persona non grata</i> with the Government or <i>vice versa</i> could affect his credibility in dealing with his business. Fortunately, the present Ombudsman is held in such universal high regard that he and his Office will weather this storm and will remain unruffled.  He would wish that the controversy should now cease and that he should get on with his second term, but he would also be the first to appreciate that we have to discuss what is at issue here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1625" /> I spoke about disturbing circumstances. Obviously we do not know the full story but the full story at worst reveals conspiracy and skulduggery and even at best it reveals incompetence and discourtesy.  It is quite extraordinary that in the lead-up to last week's controversy as Mr. Michael Mills was coming to the close of his six year term, no word at all was conveyed to him about what would happen, contrary to a report in one of last Sunday's newspapers.  Mr. Mills was not approached by anybody as to his future.  To leave a man in that kind of suspense indicates discourtesy and incompetence.  He was left to watch in the dark, as it were, while the storm raged over his head.</P>
    <P>What I found particularly unconvincing &mdash; this was something that was put forward as one of the reasons for an alleged difficulty &mdash; was the matter of an age stipulation in the Act.  I read the Act quite carefully, and even a child could understand it, which is a change, because the Act says at section 2 (7) simply that a person shall not be more than 61 years on first appointment and section 2 (3) says that a person shall vacate the office on attaining the age of 67.  There is no difficulty about that.  There are numerous such provisions in various parts of the public and private sector.  The point is that if a man reaches pensionable age before his term expires, he leaves.  To suggest that there was some difficulty here was puerile nonsense.</P>
    <P>The whole story has a moral or two. We might consider whether the Act should not be amended to take it out of the realm of party controversy, to prevent it being a party football, as it was in danger of becoming this week.  As Senator Doyle has pointed out, the initiative for appointment and reappointment lies with the Oireachtas, with Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann, and it is perfectly right that it is the Oireachtas rather than the Executive <i>per se</i> that should be given the authority under this Act.  Indeed, Senators Doyle and Manning were perfectly right, and it was perfectly appropriate that they should have put down a motion conveying the same <Col N="1626" /> sense as the one we are now debating, because it is a prerogative of any Senator or Deputy to propose or recommend the appointment or reappointment of the Ombudsman.  It is not necessary that the initiative should come from the Government yet, in practice, it has to be the Government.</P>
    <P>One of the most important things that happened this week is that a warning bell was sounded about the dangers of a single party Government ruling both Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann, a situation which we have not had for some time now and, with the help of God, we will not have again.  The whole episode points up the importance that there should be another party in Government with Fianna Fáil.  Fianna Fáil may well be, as they have often claimed, the natural governing party of this country, but they cannot be trusted on their own.  Whatever my views about the Progressive Democrats in the Seanad, I am certainly glad that this week and last week they are sitting at the Cabinet table.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly assent to the motion recommending the reappointment of Mr. Mills.  He is a patently good and public-spirited servant of the people.  Only somebody of his wisdom, prudence and ability could have succeeded so magnificently in his first term, despite the difficulties to which my colleagues refer. He has used his considerable powers very discreetly in dealing with Departments of Government.  One can well realise that this novel Office was a whole minefield for the conventional atmosphere of departmental rule, as it were, and he had to walk very carefully indeed.  He has won respect for this Office by so behaving.</P>
    <P>It is a tribute to him, for example, that during those six years he has never been compelled to invoke the special report clause which occurs in section 6 (5) of the Bill.  What is at issue here is that in making his report to the Oireachtas, the Ombudsman must mention if there are special difficulties, if people have been placing obstacles in his path, if in trying to see that justice is done he is met with <Col N="1627" /> obstruction in Government Departments. It is a tribute to him that this has not happened and that he has never had to make a special report.  I know he is very happy in that regard.</P>
    <P>Now that he has gone into smoother waters and has overcome these initial difficulties, his second term should be serene as well as successful.  He is gradually overcoming the law's delay and the problem of the cutbacks and substantial inroads are being made on the back work. His reappointment will be good news for the plain people of Ireland whose champion the Act sets him out to be.  He has effectively refuted the depressing image, which is all too common in this country, of justice as something governed by strokes and pull and power.  He has vindicated the Office of Ombudsman.  If I may indulge in the vanity of quoting what I said myself when Second Stage of the Bill setting up the Office was being debated in this House, I then hoped, and now I am happy, that Mr. Mills has brought to the Office what I called a new dimension of popular rights, a new frontier of democracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to say how relieved I am that the debacle of the controversy surrounding the reappointment of Mr. Mills appears now to have been resolved.  In any community the functions of a man such as Mr. Mills who works on behalf of the community are extremely important.  Here in this country where we have an extremely centralised system of Government, where from the cradle to the grave one cannot escape the State in its many manifestations, and an enormous amount of bureaucracy and red tape, nowadays coupled with modern technology of one kind or another which I must admit in many instances I find baffling, many people are quite bewildered simply when seeking their rights.  Quite clearly, the Ombudsman has given the average citizen some redress against the machinery of State.  When injustice is done or people are denied their rights we know there is always the possibility to go to law, but I <Col N="1628" /> am afraid most of us know how expensive that is and how it is quite beyond the pocket of the ordinary man in the street. Mr. Mills in his role as Ombudsman has given a great deal of confidence to the ordinary people, as other speakers have said here.  I think he has been an outstandingly successful Ombudsman in his extraordinary honesty, his ability and his straightforward approach to problems. My only regret is there is a backlog of complaints in his Department.  I urge today that we look at how he can be given extra resources and extra staff to accomplish his important task.</P>
      <P>Any politician, any political party, any Government who in any way seek to undermine the role of the Ombudsman are suspect.  Politicians complain regularly of being overloaded with work, made into messenger boys, having to hold clinics, trying to get people's rights for them and things sorted out.  The Ombudsman, if his role was extended, could even assist in those matters because he has considerable clout on behalf of the plain people of Ireland.  Not alone do I support this motion, I suggest that in every way possible his role should not only be endorsed but enlarged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to share my time with my colleague Senator Joe Costello.</P>
      <P>I welcome the reappointment of Michael Mills as Ombudsman.  In his term of office over the past six years he has been an outstanding public servant. He has been exceptionally fair-minded. Michael Mills did not become fair-minded when he took up the job of Ombudsman.  He was fair-minded in his days as political correspondent in <i>The Irish Press</i> when he gave as good, assured and sound political advice as anybody I have seen to commentate on political matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, of course, a great necessity for an Ombudsman in this country.  Public representatives of one type or another are constantly dealing with repressentations from constitutents in relation to their difficulties in getting around the bureaucracy.  It is very important that <Col N="1629" /> there be some independent third party to whom the public can appeal so these problems will be resolved.  It might also be of some assistance in diminishing what some people call this whole business of clientelism which has many negative political effects.</P>
    <P>Michael Mills did outstanding work in one area in particular, that was problems relating to telephone accounts and how they might be judged by some third party. On that issue he has made a major contribution in trying to level out and obtain some degree of fairness for a public who, rightly or wrongly, felt they had no comeback once the Post Office, BTE or whoever they were made their judgment.  He provided a very useful and valuable service, particularly in that area.</P>
    <P>The treatment meted out to Michael Mills in the run-up to his reappointment was simply unacceptable either because it was incompetent or negligent or because there were more disturbing reasons behind it.  Basic courtesy should have been extended to him so that he would have been assured somewhat sooner that he would be reappointed.  One begins to be disturbed also by what went on in the context of what Michael Mills had to experience in recent times where funding for his Office was inadequate to the point that he was obliged to complain in public. It is not a characteristic of Michael Mills to start into that type of behaviour unless there were very grave and depressing reasons to do so.</P>
    <P>It is very important that Michael Mills is an independent person.  He has been an independent person, and it is inevitable if you are independent that you are going to annoy people from time to time.  It is right and proper that perhaps he walked on some people's corns over the past six years.  If he did not do that then he would not be doing his job because the whole nature of his business is, as it were, to referee matters relating to public administration and so on.</P>
    <P>Again, I am delighted to see he is reappointed.  The citizens of this country owe him a debt to the extent that he has laid down the precedent and set up a <Col N="1630" /> very valuable and worthwhile Office of Ombudsman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support strongly the motion.  I agree entirely with Senator John A. Murphy that this is not yesterday's news.  This is a very important matter.  It is extremely important that this House puts on the record its concern for the Office of Ombudsman and that proper procedures be adopted in relation to the appointment.</P>
      <P>We must consider the Office itself, the importance of the Office and the role of Ombudsman &mdash; a watchdog for establishing and defending the rights of citizens. He is an intermediary in the bureaucracy who protects, defends and ensures that the rights of the citizen are to the foremost.  We have only lately come to have an Ombudsman in this country.  We could have used this to great advantage years and years ago.  Now that the Office of Ombudsman has been established, and the first term has been completed, it is extremely important that the precedents that have been established and the work that has been done will be built on and that the office of the Ombudsman is above reproach.  I believe that the holder of that office over the past six years is a man above reproach.  He was an excellent journalist during his time in <i>The Irish Press</i> and his qualities of hard work and concern for the citizen are expressed in his latest office.</P>
      <P>The circumstances in which he was reappointed leave a lot to be desired. There was absolute silence up to the very last week, indeed up to the very last day, you might say the very last moment before the appointment was made.  Last week the Labour Party raised the matter in the Dáil as to what was happening, and why there was no indication from the Government on their intention to reappoint Mr. Mills to the office.  For the following three days there was silence from the Government, and the Taoiseach still refused to make any statement in relation to the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two possible explanations; either a total discourtesy and incompetence on the part of the Taoiseach, or <Col N="1631" /> vindictiveness.  It is difficult to accept it was incompetence.  As has been mentioned by Senator Doyle, it has been around for a long time and has been on the Seanad Order Paper for a considerable period of time.  It was brought to the attention of the Taoiseach so, therefore, I think it can only be due to vindictiveness because Mr. Mills in fulfilling his role has criticised in public the lack of resources and staffing to carry out his duties fully on behalf of the public.  I certainly hope that is not what happened, but it seems to be the only possible explanation.  With the backlog of complaints that the Ombudsman had and his inability to deal with them comprehensively and effectively as his Office entitled him and bound him to do, he was acting quite properly in defending the rights of the citizens.  The whole messy manner in which he was reappointed should not have occurred and does not assist the Office of the Ombudsman being perceived as an independent body.</P>
    <P>The reasons that were given subsequently, namely, that his age raised problems is absolutely ludicrous.  That is the most nonsensical excuse that could possibly have been made.  The Act, as Senator Murphy pointed out, does not pose any obstacles to his reappointment and this simply was a lame excuse used to cloud the issue with regard to the manner in which the appointment had taken place &mdash; to try to put a public face on the whole business.</P>
    <P>Mr. Mills has been a champion of the ordinary person in the exercise of his Office.  He has added an extra dimension to democracy.  His work is particularly valuable in counteracting the clientelism and bureaucracy in which Departments operate.  A very worthy man holds this worthwhile Office and I have no hesitation in supporting this motion fully.</P>

      <P>I thank the various Members who have contributed to the debate.  It was not anticipated that we would have had a long debate on what is a straightforward <Col N="1632" /> motion on the reappointment of Mr. Michael Mills to the position of Ombudsman. As Members are aware, this was raised a number of times in the Dáil on a number of different days and the Minister dealt with the matter at that point.</P>
      <P>I am glad there is unanimous support for the motion to reappoint Mr. Michael Mills to the position of Ombudsman.  The contributions clearly indicate that Members appreciate the importance of the role of Ombudsman in our democracy. It goes without saying that people who feel they have had some difficulty with a Department of State or local authority have a system of redress via the Ombudsman Office and this must be consoling to them.</P>
      <P>I regret that some Members have suggested that there was vindictiveness and that the matter has been personalised or politicised in any way.  It is a great pity that that should happen.  I should like to let Members know the figure of the provision that has been made for meeting the staff costs.  In 1988 the figure was £480,000 and in the recently published Book of Estimates for 1990 the provision for staff costs is £655,000.  On the basis of those figures I cannot imagine there was any intention at any time not to continue with the Office of Ombudsman.</P>

I consider it an insult to the Office of Ombudsman and to the man that no Government Minister was prepared to move this motion.  It was also undignified that the Leader of the House had to rush out of breath into this House &mdash; congratulations to him &mdash; half-way through the debate and thrust the response into the Minister's hands so that he could reply.</P>

      <P>We are on the Report Stage of the Video Recordings Bill, 1987.  This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil.  In accordance with Standing Order 82, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question.  &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil and this is looked upon as a report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad.  The only matters, therefore, that may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil.  For the convenience of Senators I have arranged for the printing and circulation to them of these amendments.</P>

      <P>The Video Recordings Bill has been passed by Dáil Éireann with 32 amendments.  I propose to give some details in relation to each of the amendments.  As I go through them it will become clear that some of the amendments are more important than others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1634" /> Amendment No. 1 defines &ldquo;a classification.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 is a drafting amendment to take account of the passage, since the Bill was introduced, of the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1988.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 provides for including incitement to hatred on certain grounds among the grounds for refusing a supply certificate.  In deciding to propose the amendment the Minister was particularly impressed by the desirability of affording appropriate protection to vulnerable minority groups.</P>
    <P>The effect of amendment No. 3 will be to make the Video Recordings Bill correspond exactly to the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, in this respect.  That is to say the amendment adds to the grounds for prohibiting a video work not only that it would be likely to stir up hatred against groups of persons on account of their sexual orientation but also that it would be likely to do so on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins or membership of the travelling community.  The amendment also follows the provisions in the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act in providing expressly that the groups against whom hatred must not be incited are groups either in the State or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 removes the word &ldquo;any&rdquo; from the phrase &ldquo;any obscene or indecent matter&rdquo; in section 3 (1) (a) (ii) relating to the grounds for refusing a supply certificate.  Some anxiety was expressed as to whether the inclusion in a video work of even the smallest piece of possibly obscene or indecent matter would be sufficient to cause the whole work to be banned.  Although I do not think that the word &ldquo;any&rdquo; would have this effect, especially when the censor will in any event have to decide whether the video work is &ldquo;unfit for viewing&rdquo;, I accepted that the word &ldquo;any&rdquo; might convey a misleading impression and therefore should be deleted.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 inserts a new section 4.  The new section 4 provides for the censor, when granting a supply certificate <Col N="1635" /> for a video work, giving the work one of four classifications and indicating in the supply certificate what classification he has given.  The four classes will be those set out in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of subsection (1) of section 4.</P>
    <P>The highest classification will be given to video works fit for viewing by persons generally described in paragraph (a).  The second highest category will be works fit for viewing by persons generally but, in the case of children under 12, only in the company of a responsible adult, paragraph (b).  This classification will serve as a warning to parents, for example, of the possible need to examine the work in question before allowing younger children to view it, especially if a child is particularly sensitive.  Depending on the possible effect of the work on the child, the parent or other responsible adult might decide not to allow the child to view the work at all or might think it necessary to stop the playing of the recording or to give reassurance to the child.</P>
    <P>The next lower classification will be fit for viewing by any person aged 15 or more, paragraph (c), and the lowest will be fit for viewing by persons aged 18 or more, paragraph (d).  There will, of course, be video works which will not be given any classification.  The supply of these will be prohibited.  Provision for that is in the Bill already and the amendments I am dealing with now do not make any change in that area.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of the new section 4 provides that the censor shall not give a lower classification than fit for general viewing without having examined a video recording containing the video work concerned, though he will be able to give a higher classification without necessarily having examined the work.  This provision is in section 3 (1) of the Bill, under which the censor will be able to grant a supply certificate for a video work without necessarily having examined it, because in many cases he will be able to judge from the title or his knowledge of the producer or otherwise that the work is unobjectionable; on the other hand the <Col N="1636" /> censor's power under section 6 to make a prohibition order will depend on his having examined the work.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) will enable the censor to upgrade the classification of a video work if he decides, as a result of representations or of second thoughts of his own, that the classification is too low. In that event he will revoke the supply certificate and grant another supply certificate showing the higher classification. The censor will not be able to substitute a lower classification.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) will enable the Minister for Justice to make regulations altering the classes specified in subsection (1) if experience shows that alterations are desirable.  Any regulations under subsection (4) will have to be approved by resolutions of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I should, however, point out that the Minister will not be empowered to make regulations providing for a classification for viewing by persons aged more than 18 years.  In addition, the general provision, section 31, under which regulations can be annulled by resolution within 21 days does not apply in the case of regulations changing the classification system.  In such cases a positive resolution will be required.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 provide for amendments to section 6 similar to those brought about in section 3 by amendments Nos. 3 and 4.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 relates to section 6 (3) of the Bill.  Section 6 (3) provides that, if the censor revokes a prohibition order, a supply certificate should be deemed to be granted in respect of the video work in question.  That provision would not enable the censor to give a classification in respect of the work, so the amendment provides instead that the censor shall grant a supply certificate, in which he will give the appropriate classification under the new section 4 (1).</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 9, 10 and 11 adapt the provisions of section 9 of the Bill as to appeals to the Censorship of Films Appeal Board against prohibition orders so as to enable persons to appeal against a classification given by the censor.  An appeal will be only for the purpose of <Col N="1637" /> obtaining a higher classification.  The Appeal Board will be able to affirm the censor's classification or to direct that the video work should be given the higher classification sought by the appellant or an intermediate classification.  If the appeal is successful, the censor will grant another supply certificate giving the classification specified by the Appeal Board.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 relates to section 11 of the Bill.  It deals with the categories of people who would be entitled to get labels for video recordings from the official censor.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as passed by this House, provided that anybody could get labels from the Official Censor on payment of the appropriate fee.  An amendment on Committee Stage in the other House provided for a tightening-up as regards who would be entitled to get labels.  Following debate on that amendment the Minister undertook to give further thought to the matter.</P>
    <P>The current amendment enables the Minister to stipulate by regulation who would be entitled to get labels from the Official Censor.  It would be the intention to provide initially, broadly speaking, that only the person who was given a supply certificate or his business successor would be entitled to get labels. Should this prove to be an unsatisfactory arrangement it could be changed by regulation. The Minister is satisfied that this amendment would provide a satisfactory solution.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 13 makes a minor addition to section 11, which relates to labelling of video recordings.  That section enables the Minister for Justice to make regulations providing for the labelling of the spool or other thing on which the video recording is kept.  The section makes it an offence to supply a recording or a spool, etc., that is not in compliance with the requirements in the regulations as to labelling.  Under the section the Minister will be able to include in the regulations a requirement that the label should show the classification of a video work.  Amendment No. 13 ensures that, if for some reason the label indicates a lower classification than the correct one, <Col N="1638" /> this will not amount to non-compliance with the regulations.  For example, if the censor should give a higher classification than the one in force when the label was affixed, it will not be necessary to change the label.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 14, 15 and 16 relate to section 12 of the Bill.  That section makes it an offence to supply a video recording containing a video work which has no supply certificate if the recording or the spool, etc., contains an indication that a supply certificate is in force in respect of it.  Amendment No. 14 extends the offence to supplying a recording with a false indication that the classification of the video work in question is a higher one than it is.  Amendment No. 15 makes it a defence that the supplier believed on reasonable grounds that the classification indicated was the correct classification or a higher one.  Amendment No. 16 is consequential.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 17 and 18 relate to the provisions of sections 13 and 14 which enable the terms of a supply certificate (including the classification given in it) or a prohibition order, as the case may be, to be proved in legal proceedings by a certificate of the Official Censor.  The amendments provide for a copy of the supply certificate or prohibition order in question to be attached to the censor's certificate given under the relevant section mentioned above.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for the granting of licences by the Official Censor.  Under the section as passed by this House a wholesale licence would authorise the holder to sell video recordings by wholesale; a retail licence would authorise him to sell recordings by retail or let them on hire. Amendment No. 19 provides that a wholesale licence will authorise the holder to sell video recordings by wholesale or &mdash; like a retail licence &mdash; to let them on hire.  Amendments Nos. 21 and 22 are consequential.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 23 is also consequential on amendment No. 19 to section 17 (1).  Section 18 (1) and (2) as passed by this House provide separately for prohibiting sales by wholesale, otherwise than in accordance with wholesale <Col N="1639" /> licences and sales by retail or lettings, otherwise than in accordance with retail licences.  Now that as a result of amendment No. 19 to section 17 (1) a wholesale licence will authorise letting on hire, there is no need to have separate prohibitions in subsections (1) and (2) of section 18, so amendment No. 23 makes the necessary provision in one subsection covering both kinds of licence.</P>
    <P>The reason for the amendments is that wholesalers do let video recordings on hire.  Accordingly, the previous wording of the section was too restrictive as under it the holders of a wholesale licence were confined to selling video recordings.  The amendment will enable them to let recordings on hire and it is in keeping with existing trading practices in the video business.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 24 is also consequential on amendment No. 17. Amendment No. 20 is a drafting amendment to assimilate the language of the provision in section 17 (2) relating to the grant of retail licences to the language of subsection (1) relating to wholesale licences.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 25 to section 19 is a drafting amendment to assimilate the language of section 19 (2) to that of similar provisions of the Bill.  All the provisions in question provide that it shall be a defence to a charge of committing a relevant offence to prove that the accused believed on reasonable grounds in the existence of some fact that would prevent the conduct in question, e.g. selling a video recording or possessing it for the purpose of sale contrary to the Act, from being an offence.  All the provisions, except section 19 (2), say that it shall be a defence &ldquo;to prove that the accused believed&rdquo; etc.  Section 19 (2) says that it shall be a defence &ldquo;for the accused to prove&rdquo; etc.  The amendment brings section 19 (2) into line with the other provisions. There is no difference in substance.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 26 amends section 22 in line with the amendments to sections 13 and 14 brought about by amendments <Col N="1640" /> Nos. 17 and 18.  Amendment No. 27 substitutes a new subsection (1) in section 23.  The main purpose of the new subsection (1) is to relax the strictness of the subsection as regards disqualification for holding a licence to sell or let video recordings. The subsection as passed by this House provides that, if the holder of a wholesale or retail licence is convicted of any of a number of offences, such as selling a video recording containing an uncertificated video work, and he has previously been convicted of any other such offence committed not earlier than five years before the commission of the first mentioned offence, the court shall order that his licence should be forfeited and that he should be disqualified for five years for holding a licence.</P>
    <P>One effect of this would be that if the owner of several shops was convicted of selling a recording of an uncertificated video work in one of his shops, and he had a relevant previous conviction, he would be disqualified for five years for holding a licence to sell at any of his shops.</P>
    <P>I think this would be too severe and the amendment provides, therefore, that the offender should be disqualified from holding a licence only in relation to the premises where the offences were committed or in relation to any other premises for which he had no licence at the time when the order of disqualification takes effect.  Therefore, he would still keep his licence in respect of shops other than those where any of the relevant offences were committed within the five years but he would not be able to get a new licence for any other shop until five years from the date when the disqualification takes effect.</P>
    <P>The amendment also makes two smaller changes.  First, it adds to the offences giving rise to disqualification an offence referred to in section 15 (2), i.e. an offence of importing a video recording of a prohibited video work.  This is also an offence which can give rise under section 27 to forfeiture of the illegally imported video recording.  Second, the amendment provides that offences of illegal importation or breach of copyright <Col N="1641" /> which will give rise to disqualification for holding a licence will be limited to offences committed after the commencement of section 23.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 28 provides that a member of the Garda Síochána seeking entry to a place in accordance with a search warrant under section 24 must produce the warrant if so requested.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 29 applies to section 27, which relates to forfeitured video recordings.  Apart from a small verbal change at the beginning of subsection (1) the only change entailed by amendment No. 29 is to remove the requirement in the subsection &mdash; in paragraph (a) &mdash; that before the court may order the forfeiture of a video recording the recording must be &ldquo;produced to the court&rdquo;.  The reason for the amendment is that there may be a large stock of video recordings involved in the offence and it would be an unnecessary inconvenience to require their production in court.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 30 and 31 provide that the first calendar year for which the Official Censor of Films and the Censorship of Films Appeal Board are to make reports to the Minister for Justice under section 28 on their activities under the Bill and under the Censorship of Films Acts shall be 1990 instead of 1989. The change is necessary because of the lapse of time since the year 1989 was proposed by the Bill originally.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 32 is consequential on subsection (4) (b) of the new section 4 to be inserted by amendment No. 6.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is long overdue.  I concur with the Leader of the House today who said it was an important Bill.  We will be happy to facilitate its speedy passage into legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On amendment No. 5, I welcome the classification system.  It certainly enhances the Bill and adds to its value.  I <Col N="1642" /> am glad to see as well, despite the statement in this House previously by a former Minister for Justice, that the inclusion of this amendment does not add to the cost of the Bill.  The amendment is a guide to parents.  The classification and its use is voluntary, so its effectiveness should be reviewed in future.  However, is guidance enough or is there need for a more effective legal means of protecting our young people?  It is important that a review of the value and effect of such classification take place after two years and that any loopholes that may arise be plugged by way of amending legislation, especially as, in this area, we are going into uncharted waters.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 3, it is unfortunate that pornographic videos are not included.  This is a defect in the Bill and it does the legislation an injustice.  It is a glaring omission because it is accepted now that pornographic material causes a reaction in people who are addicted to such material, resulting in violence towards women in particular and the degrading of women and indeed of men who get involved in such activity.  Senator Jackman will deal with this in greater detail later.</P>
    <P>There is a defect in amendment No. 27 in that the inclusion of the activity of the pirate video is not catered for.  It is now accepted that 50 per cent of the market is in the pirate video area.  These people do not pay VAT or PRSI and undercut the legitimate video industry and therefore command more of the market.  These people do not conform to legislation and it is a pity the Bill does not cater for it.</P>
    <P>We will facilitate the passing of the Bill.  It will help to bring control into the whole area of video supply and uphold Irish society norms and values in regard to decent behaviour, without unnecessarily restricting freedom of choice in the viewing of such material.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot freely welcome the Bill.  I cannot freely welcome the amendments because I know precisely what the amendments are calculated to do.  I will address myself directly to one or two of them which people might <Col N="1643" /> imagine I would be likely to welcome, but I do not because I recognise their purpose.</P>
      <P>Specifically I draw attention to the amendments contained in section 3. What an extraordinary conversion.  It would be rather interesting to read into the record the statements of the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, when he went into battle on a very sticky wicket with inadequate understanding of the motivation behind the attempt to insert these amendments, and produced a farrago of nonsense.  Now we have the Minister proposing the same amendment.</P>
      <P>There seems to be a not quite inexplicable but an explicable contradiction here.  This amendment does nothing more than to provide a figleaf for moral respectability for a Bill which everybody knows perfectly well is introduced at the behest of one of the most persistent, the costliest and the widest-ranging lobbies I have ever encountered from a commercial section of the community &mdash; the video industry.  Let us be quite honest.  These apparent little excursions into morality are figleaves, and when they are picked off you will find a kind of naked commercial intent behind the Bill.  I just wish that the framers of the Bill had been more realistic and had just catered for this market without pretending that they were dealing with morality.  It is astonishing that such a complete somersault could be maintained.  Of course I welcome the fact that a sexual orientation clause is included in anything.  It is very welcome to me, but it does not mean that I welcome the principle behind the Bill which is one of censorship &mdash; and we have had great difficulties in this country with censorship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thinking behind this amendment revealed perfectly clearly when the Minister says &ldquo;that the effect of amendment No. 3 will be to make the Video Recordings Bill correspond exactly to the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, in this respect&rdquo; where, I may say, there was also a very strong action <Col N="1644" /> mounted against precisely these amendments, that is to say, the amendments as to the grounds for prohibiting a video work not only that it would be likely to stir up hatred against groups of persons on account of their sexual orientation but also that it would be likely to do so on account of their race, colour, nationality etc.  How honest is that?  I know, having studied the classics, and I have no doubt the Minister and his advisers know precisely the force of &ldquo;not only&rdquo; but &ldquo;also&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is an attempt here to suggest that, of course, we were going to include sexual orientation all the time but we are now adding in race, nationality, religion, whereas in fact the Minister, I am sure, in this season when we all renew ourselves at the crib and come out with pious assertions of our religion, will feel compelled to be honest and say quite the reverse was the case.  To an extent we always had race, colour, nationality, religion, and so on, but they certainly did not want to have sexual orientation in it. Yet we have the Minister now coming in and saying that this amendment is to guarantee not only sexual orientation &mdash; as if this was the most natural thing in the world, something I was trying to persuade another Minister to include first a few months ago &mdash; but also the other matters.</P>
    <P>I am in great difficulties because of the calculated and cynical political dishonesty of this legislation.  In addition I am against censorship and I am not at all convinced by the rake of amendments that are here; they are all technical, they all deal with classification and so on.  I would like to ask the Minister who is going to classify the censor?  If we accept the arguments for grades, classification and so on made by Senator Neville &mdash; I understand Senator Jackman will follow up on it &mdash; that there is a direct &ldquo;causal&rdquo; relationship between watching erotic material on the one hand and committing horrible crimes on the other, who will classify the Official Censor when he has consumed enormous masses of this material?  Or is the Official Censor some super mortal, some <i>Ubermensch,</i> whose complete impermeability to filth places him in a class of his own?  I just do not <Col N="1645" /> believe it stands up.  I will listen with the greatest interest to what Senator Jackman has to say.  The material I have read from the United States of America is (a) very complex in its interpretation and (b) a lot of it is so clearly motivated, was so frequently interfered with &mdash; particularly during the Presidency of Mr. Reagan; I almost said the late Mr. Reagan &mdash; it is very difficult to be clear about it.  I do not want to be tedious.  I realise it would not be appropriate for me to range too widely.  I understand we will have an opportunity to talk briefly again when specific amendments are going through. Is that right?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  With regard to all this high-minded stuff, not one word of which I believe, about the need to protect the kiddy-winkies and how extraordinary it always is that the kiddy-winkies are always trotted into the front-line in these pseudo-moral arguments &mdash; how extraordinary it is that this legislation which has had the benefit of the wisdom of the Dáil, which has been bounced backwards and forwards between the two Houses, has not taken any account whatever of the principal difficulty in any legislation such as this, the necessity for which is clear in a number of sections, that is for understanding definitions of &ldquo;obscenity&rdquo; and &ldquo;pornography&rdquo;.  There has been a very considerable debate in this country over recent months in the course of which these definitions have been examined very carefully but it seems to me there has been no real attempt whatever by the Government to take on board these very serious problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have been quite anxious to place on the record some of the statements made by the previous Minister with regard to the sexual orientation clauses in particular.  May I recommend to the Minister, as a little light entertainment to brighten the Christmas season, that he roll his eye over them because, if he is interested in athletics, he will certainly find some very spectacular <Col N="1646" /> somersaults between the present Bill, that introduced in the Dáil, and the Minister's very forthright answers, his denials repeatedly under cross-examination that such clauses existed anywhere or could be legitimate.  I should like to leave the Minister, who I know is a very decent man, with a little bit of a conundrum for Christmas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am confining my contribution exclusively to the amendments. The Minister is so decent he does not require to be amended at all in order to be decent.</P>
      <P>Quite seriously I should like to make this point: here we are really basically glowing in self-satisfaction at having introduced sexual orientation clauses &mdash; now, I am glad to say, becoming almost automatic &mdash; even engaging, as I have pointed out, in a considerable degree of grammatical sleight-of-hand intended to persuade people since this little item has apparently proved popular that it was always thus in the Government's mind. Yet the form of behaviour to which we are extending this protection is still a matter for the criminal courts.  This is still a current issue because, as I am sure the Minister is aware, in recent years &mdash; although in the Criminal Courts the operations of specific sections has largely lapsed, in matrimonial courts the introduction of certain forms of evidence, in cases involving judicial separation, quite frequently has been halted because of the fear of criminal prosecution.  We are now in the delicious position that we watch on the screen under the protection of the Minister's Video Recordings Bill, activities which, if carried out between citizens of the country, would actually constitute a criminal activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1647" /> I would like the Minister to spend some time resolving that difficulty because it seems to me that, in a sense, the proliferation of sexual orientation clauses is very largely putting the cart before the horse.  I personally believe that a horse and cart are a very admirable method of transport but they need to go in the right sequence.  They are also very ecologically sound, but it is necessary for them to go in the right sequence.  In squirting out sexual orientation clauses wholesale, all over the place, indiscriminately, the Government are not doing anything other than really presenting a slightly ludicrous case when they do so in advance of reform of the principal law.</P>

      <P>Like Senators Neville and Norris, I have difficulty with amendment No. 3 in that there is not included the word &ldquo;gender&rdquo; for groups of persons in the State against whom hatred would be stirred up on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, membership of the travelling community or sexual orientation.  I should have liked the word &ldquo;gender&rdquo; to be included with regard to the exploitation of women and children on account of the incentive to violence through sexual exploitation and the viewing of videos.</P>
      <P>On reading the Dáil debate and the Seanad debate of November 1987 I was disappointed to note that a definition of the word &ldquo;pornographic&rdquo;&mdash; which appeared to present a major problem in the course of the passage of the Bill through the Dáil &mdash; was not included. There is no doubt that violent and pornographic films depict sex in a totally objectionable and degrading manner. Indeed, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Collins, the then Minister for Justice, mentioned pornography many times in the course of his remarks in this House describing the degrading and sexual type of films we are trying to ban. In the debate in the Seanad of 4 November 1987, at Volume 117, column 1212, he had this to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1648" /> I have no hesitation in including pornography in the Bill and in dealing with it by way of a total prohibition of supply.</P>
    <P>Obviously at that time the then Minister was interested in including that clause. Perhaps the Minister present could inform me why that was not followed through.  It is sad that there was no success in having that definition included in the Bill.  The debate in this House is the last stop for this Bill without outlawing the sale, distribution, supply and the viewing of pornographic videos.  Now that we have observed the powers of the Official Censor I find it difficult to understand why he should not have been given that extra power to tackle the video nasties, the proliferation of pornography and degrading films that can be seen everywhere. They are not on sale legitimately but we know that they are being distributed widely from the backs of vans, cars, in pokey little shops and houses. They are certainly in circulation and are illegal business on a large scale.</P>
    <P>When the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Bill was being debated in this House I asked that violence towards women and children should be included.  I was told it might be more appropriate to include it in the Video Recordings Bill.  I ask the Minister to give me legitimate reasons why this topical and prevalent problem in our society is not included in the Bill.  Research has shown that there is a direct link between violence to women and children and viewing those pornographic videos.  If amendment No. 3 had been carried through, amendments Nos. 6 and 7 would also have been included in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a comment on amendment No. 3.  I want to take issue with my colleague, Senator Norris, who said he is against censorship. I am not against censorship when it is for the common good.  For too long we have had an obsession with the censorship of so-called explicit sexual material.  That is an important area of censorship but in <Col N="1649" /> the midst of all this we have lost sight of the censorship of violent material.  The cult of violence has been allowed to develop far too much and I am convinced that much of the video material portraying violent scenes is extremely harmful to the public and, in particular, to young people.  We have not adequately addressed the issue of violence in the past when dealing with censorship.  I should like to hear the Minister's comments on the extent to which amendment No. 3 will deal with violence in videos.</P>

      <P>I want to thank Senators for their contributions. Senator Neville raised the question of putting a time limit on the review of the Bill.  When this question was raised in the Dáil, I rejected it on the basis that it would be incorrect to put a time limit on the review of any Act and that it would be better and much more appropriate to do so in the normal ongoing review of legislation because we might find it necessary to make adjustments after a much shorter period than two years.  Putting a time scale on the review would be unwise because it will be kept under ongoing review anyway.  If it is found necessary to make changes, they will be introduced.</P>
      <P>Video piracy is mainly a matter for copyright legislation.  My colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, has responsibility for that area.  Legislation on this topic is being considered in that Department at present.  However, the Video Recordings Bill provides protection against video piracy in so far as it is proper.</P>
      <P>We dealt at length in the Dáil with the question of pornography and a number of amendments were proposed to the Bill.  As I said in the other House, it is not correct to say that pornographic video works are not dealt with in the Bill.  Pornography is covered by the word &ldquo;indecent&rdquo; in sections 3 and 6 in the same manner as it is covered by that word in the Censorship of Films Act, 1923.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Senators referred to costs. Amendment No. 5 will add to the costs <Col N="1650" /> under this Bill but it will not give rise to any extra costs to the taxpayers as all costs will be covered by the fees charged under the Bill.</P>
    <P>One has to differentiate between the serious element and the levity in Senator Norris' contribution.  The Minister said many times that he will give careful consideration to all arrangements made in relation to the Bill.  Consideration was given to the views expressed and I have no difficulty whatever in saying that. What is debate all about?  Both Houses have debated the Bill and I accepted some amendments when I was dealing with the latter Stages.  I think it is correct if in the course of debates, Members' views are strongly put that they are accepted.  I have no apology to make to Senator Norris or anyone else.  Senator Norris used words like &ldquo;somersaults&rdquo; and &ldquo;juggling&rdquo;.  He said he had read the classics.  Unfortunately I did not.  I did not have the time because I have a constitutency to look after.  I have no difficulty whatever in considering and accepting the views expressed.  This is why so many changes were made to the Bill.  This is what debate is all about.  The consideration of those suggestions has led to many changes in the Bill.  These include the licensing of outlets, classification, sexual orientation and other matters.  The Minister and I indicated in the Dáil that we were willing to make changes suggested in both Houses. These changes have been made and I do not think anybody could possibly complain &mdash; or have grounds for complaint &mdash; that we did not make changes in the Bill arising from the discussions and debates by Members of both Houses.</P>

      <P>Cuireadh fáilte go forleathan roimh an mBille nuair a pléadh é sa Teach seo don chéad uair, breis is dhá bhliain ó shin. Theastaigh Bille den sórt seo ó formhór na ndaoine sa Teach seo agus san Dáil. Ach ní raibh gach éinne ar aon intinn maidir le gach rud a bhí beartaithe.  Bhí daoine ann freisin a cheap go raibh gá le cumhachtaí breise sa Bhille.  Dúirt an tAire go raibh sé réidh chun éisteacht le gach duine a raibh tuairimí le nochtadh aige agus ar an mbonn sin bhí díospóireachtaí an-mhaith againn.</P>
      <P>Le linn na ndíospóireachtaí sin glacadh le moltaí maidir le ceadúnas a bheith riachtanach chun fístaifid a dhíol nó a ligint ar chíos.  B'shin athrú mór sa Bhille. Glacadh le hathruithe eile freisin a neartaigh an Bille.</P>
      <P>Mar is léir ón méid atá ráite agam cheana féin táim an-sásta leis an gcaoi in ar pléadh an Bille.  Tá an Bille neartaithe go mór de bhárr na moltaí a pléadh sa Teach seo agus san Dáil.  Arís mo bhuíochas do na Seanadóirí.</P>
      <P>Nollaig shona agus athbliain gan bhuairt daoibh uile.</P>
      <P>I would like to thank all the Senators who took part in the debate on this Bill. When the Bill was first introduced in this House just over two years ago there was a general welcome for it.  I think it is fair to say that there was total agreement on the need for a Bill to control the supply of video works.  It was clear during the debates in this House, however, that there was a fair divergence of opinion as to the provisions which should be in the Bill.  Suggestions were made and ideas considered in a very open and constructive way.  As a result of these frank discussions a number of amendments were accepted in this House.  Perhaps the most significant group of amendments that were accepted here were those which provide for licensing of persons who sell or rent out video recordings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill went to Dáil Éireann from here there was also a general welcome for it there.  Again, there were different views as to what the best <Col N="1652" /> approaches were to controlling the supply of video works.  As in this House, a number of amendments were debated and accepted in the Dáil.  One group of amendments accepted there were those which provide for classification.  As Members of this House will be aware that was a topic that was debated here and for which there was a considerable volume of support.  Having regard to the views expressed in both Houses on this point the Minister agreed to bring in amendments which provide for classification. The result of this is that parents and others buying or renting video recordings will know the age groups for whom any particular work is suitable.</P>
    <P>Both Houses also discussed in some detail the criteria for refusing to grant a supply certificate or to make a prohibition order in respect of a video work.  The criteria in question are contained in sections 3 to 6 of the Bill.  Here also the debate on these two sections resulted in amendments which, I am satisfied, strengthen the Bill.  In particular I should mention the amendments which provide that incitement to hatred of groups on a number of grounds are reasons why a supply certificate may be refused or a prohibition order made in respect of a particular video work.</P>
    <P>All in all I think it is fair to say that the debates on this Bill in both Houses are a good example of democracy at work.  The Minister let it be known that he was willing to consider all amendments and to give careful consideration to them before arriving at any decision.  That he did so is evidenced by the fact that the Bill has been changed significantly since it was first introduced and these changes resulted from suggestions put forward both in this House and in Dáil Éireann. These amendments have resulted in a stronger Bill and I think everybody who took part in the debate is to be congratulated on that score.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to mention a theme that has been mentioned on a number of occasions during debates on this Bill.  That is that parents have a very important responsibility as regards vetting the material which their children <Col N="1653" /> watch.  A video film suitable for children over 15 may not be suitable for children under 12.  Similarly, films which are suitable only for those over 18 will be in peoples' homes.  Parents must accept their responsibility to supervise the watching of video films by their children so that they do not see material that could be frightening or upsetting or otherwise unsuitable.  Whereas I am satisfied that the Bill is a very good one it cannot take the place of parents in this matter.  It is imperative that they play their part also. Once again, my thanks to all Senators who took part in the various debates on this Bill.  I extend my best wishes to all for Christmas and the New Year.</P>

      <P>Before I deal with the question of the Adjournment of the Seanad I should like, on my own behalf and on behalf of the Members, to extend thanks to the staff of the House for the excellent work they have done in the last session.  I should like to thank the Official Reporting staff, the Editor of Debates and the Assistant Editors, the ushers, the staff of the Seanad office under the able leadership of the Clerk, Mr. Coughlan, and the press who have come in for some criticism in the last session.  In this the first session of the new Seanad many Members who are also members of county councils or were Members of the Dáil, found that strange things can happen in Seanad Éireann.</P>
      <P>I did not realise until I was questioned by a 12 year old, who was seeking information of what Lady Desart from Kilkenny had said in the first Seanad, how far the House has progressed from the pedestrian nature of that first House. In the last session we addressed ourselves to the need for reforming the Seanad, to update and upgrade the House.  We need to be able to address matters of immediate importance and we must address the House in terms of making it a more adequate House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1654" /> Members have an open mind on how we should run the business of the House and it is my hope that in the next session the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and their sub-committee, will meet to consider the various reforms suggested by Members.  I am not saying that all the suggestions being put forward will be implemented.  Any Opposition will feel frustrated about the need for reforms because it will appear to them that the Government hold the whip hand.  The Government will always hold the whip hand and I do not think any Member could contemplate a Seanad in which the Government did not have that authority. Members seeking reform along those lines will not see their suggestions implemented.  I do not think this House should be able to overturn any Government proposals.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá san chéad teanga go raibh níos mó díospóireachtaí san Teach seo san chéad teanga ná mar a chuala mé ó 1977 go dtí an Seanad seo. Tá a lán Gaeilge ag cuid de na Seanadóirí agus tá beagán Gaeilge ag cuid eile.  Is é an pointe is tábhachtaí ná go bhfuil Seanadóirí ag caint anseo trí Ghaeilge. Ba mhaith liom go leanfaí leis sin.  Bhí caint mhór againn i dtaobh an gléas aistriúcháin a chur isteach san Teach seo. Táimid ag obair go dian chun go gcuirfí é sin i gcrích.  B'fhéidir go mbeidh sé anseo i gceann cúpla mí.  Táimid ag súil go dtógfaidh an obair seo cúpla mí.  Ba mhaith liom fíor-bhuíochas a ghabháil le gach éinne a bhí ag obair sa Seanad san seisiún atá caite.  Guím rath Dé ar gach duine a bheidh páirteach san obair anseo sna seachtainí atá romhainn.</P>

I do not think any of us should accept the Seanad being used as a rubber stamp for legislation that has passed through the Dáil.  We do not, but we should not begin to go down that road.  We have had some interesting debates in this session which has not been a long one but I look forward to returning to the House shortly after New Year's Day.  I will never accept the cloaking of inefficiency, by strange things happening, be it in this House or elsewhere. Given the spirit of the season and the time of the year, I will not develop that any further, but I have a feeling that the Leader of the House knows exactly what I am referring to.</P>
      <P>I have thoroughly enjoyed my first session in Seanad Éireann and I know I speak, too, for other Senators who have just completed their first session.  There are many old hands here who would join with me in wishing one and all a very peaceful and happy Christmas and a prosperous 1990.</P>

In my short experience, although I am almost a senior Member of the House at this stage, this session has been in many ways the best in terms of the material we have dealt with.  I congratulate the Leader of the House for the efficient way in which the House has been run, but having said that there are many things which need to be cleared up.  There were quite a number of unnecessary procedural rows.  From my own point of view, the term has been marred by the fact that I was grossly misrepresented in the House in my absence one day in terms of what was purported to have been decided at a Whips' meeting.  I want to put the House on notice that I will not be attending any further Whips' meeting until that matter has been clarified.  I have already made that clear to the leader of the House.</P>

      <P>I thank the Leader of the House for his commitment to a wide variety of topics.  In particular it should not go without mention that there was a number of wide-ranging debates on foreign policy and international matters. This is quite significant.  Developments in that area, looking at internal structures and so on in the countries concerned, might be useful.  It was also useful to discuss the issues that were dealt with, in terms of the reformation of the Oireachtas, a good a phrase as any.  I look forward in the next session to the report of the committee that has been set up by the Committee on Procedures and Privileges.</P>
      <P>On behalf of those of us on the Independent benches, I wish you, acting Chairman, the Cathaoirleach, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the acting chairmen, the Leader of the House, the Clerk, the Government Chief Whip and the Government Assistant Whip and all those who make the House work, including Members on both sides a happy Christmas.</P>

      <P>I should also say that we in the Labour Party are concerned at the statement of the Leader of the House that Private Members' legislation is really going nowhere.  I would like to see this aspect of the activities of the House developed a lot more.  There is room for substantial development in that area.  I would also like to see an extension of the committee system.  During the last few months I have referred to a number of possible committees.

I also wish to say that I, too, look forward to a positive term after the Christmas break, particularly as the Leader of the House appeared to give some indication in the final weeks of this session that there would be room for Private Members' legislation in the coming session.  I very much hope that this will be the case because it is necessary.  So much of the Government's programme of legislation in recent weeks has been window dressing, particularly in regard to the Derelict Sites Bill.  The intention of that Bill is absolutely laudable and worthy but, unamended, it is contrary to the alleged intention of the Bill.  It is very important that we do not lose sight of the important element of partnership, in democracy. That should mean that the Government are adult enough not to feel threatened by amendments which come from this revising Chamber and are adult and mature enough to allow Bills to be initiated in this chamber, and not just by the Government.

The first is that the Leader of the House should come back after Christmas and say he would welcome legislation from the Opposition and from the Independents and that more Bills, not fewer, will be initiated in the Seanad where they would be done justice and where amendments would be easier to accept.  Having said that and having been critical, this has been a better session in some ways than other sessions in the past three or four years.  There has been a definite will on the part of the Government to improve the workings of the Seanad.  It has not in any way been translated into action. While I do not and never will expect too much of the Government, at least this is a start.</P>

      <P>I am now calling Senator Costello on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I raise this important issue, that St. Kevin's community school be provided with a permanent structure, to highlight the situation in which the parents, staff and students of the school are at present.  That would have been brought home to the Minister last week when the parents, staff and pupils demonstrated outside of the Department of Education.  The week before that, the parents took the long journey to Athlone to the Minister's advice centre to highlight the inadequacy of the service being provided in the school their children are being educated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is scandalous that four years after the decision was taken to set up St. Kevin's community school for the people of north Clondalkin, a permanent structure has not been put in place.  In 1986 the Minister for Education said that the Department had sanctioned the provision of a new school for north Clondalkin to operate from September 1986 and 70 to 90 pupils were to start from that month.  The Minister further stated that the building unit in the Department of Education had been asked to make the necessary arrangements so that a suitable site for the school could be acquired and architectural planning commenced as soon as possible.  In the meantime the school was to be located in the old vocational school <Col N="1661" /> building in Lucan from September 1987 until the new building was complete.</P>
    <P>Four years have passed and the old building is now in a scandalous state of repair.  It is falling apart and is totally inadequate in relation to accommodation, facilities, the size of the classrooms, the condition of the structure and so on.  The parents, staff and pupils have been complaining about that and they are anxious for the Minister to take action.</P>
    <P>To make matters worse, the lease on the site expires on 31 January.  There will be no school available for these 270 pupils on 1 February.  Action has not been taken to provide a permanent structure or to provide alternative accommodation for the pupils.  It is a case of most pressing need.</P>
    <P>The request for the school is totally justified and that is why the Minister confirmed that the permanent structure will be provided.  Figures are available from the two primary schools currently servicing the community college.  St. Bernadette's national school has an intake of 248 at present and will double its intake next year.  The Archbishop Ryan school has approximately 1,100 pupils at the moment.  The prediction for the increase in enrolment capacity required at post-primary level is enormous.  At present these are 270 pupils at post-primary level, which will increase to 386 next year, and that will be the first complete cycle the school will have.  In 1991-92 the figure will increase to 489, in 1992-93 it will increase to 589 and the next year it will increase to 688, the following year to 757, then in 1995 it will increase to 805, the next year to 834 and by 1997-98 it will increase to 874 pupils.  There is an expected three-fold increase in the numbers of post-primary pupils who will be seeking education in the catchment area. There is every justification for the school.</P>
    <P>In certain areas we have heard about a contraction in pupil numbers due to emigration and a drop in the birth rate. In Clondalkin the opposite is true.  An ERDO survey was done in relation to the general area in terms of likely population increase and it showed that in the general <Col N="1662" /> area of Clondalkin/Lucan the population will almost double between now and the year 2001.  It is a fast growing area where there will be a large number of pupils requiring education and that requires a permanent structure which, as yet, has not materialised.</P>
    <P>A further problem relates to the level of disadvantage in the area; it is one of the most disadvantaged areas of the city. A recent survey of the area by FÁS included a survey of the parishes of Rowlagh which includes Quarryvale where the school is to be situated, Balgaddy and Neilstown and showed that the population in that immediate catchment area was almost 16,000, that almost 36 per cent of the population were attending pre-school or primary schools at present, that 12.3 per cent are attending post-primary school and that 0.1 per cent were going for third level education.  The area is extremely disadvantaged in educational terms and according to the survey only 18.8 per cent of the population are actually employed.</P>
    <P>In 1987, the year in which the survey was conducted, 40.4 per cent of the pupils finished school after sitting the group or intermediate examination.  The school leavers at that time, as the original school was being established, had an employment rate of 25.9 per cent &mdash; a little more than a quarter of them were going into gainful employment while the unemployed rate for the school leavers was 55½ per cent; the others were in training or other activities.  In terms of educational attainment of the school leavers, 30.8 per cent had not taken any examination and had left school; 23 per cent had completed primary education, 20 per cent group education, 15 per cent had done the intermediate certificate examination and only 10.5 per cent had gone to full post-primary education.  It can be seen that more than half those unemployed have only primary education and 30 per cent of that number are without qualifications or job training.</P>
    <P>The overall conclusion is that the area has a very young population, a very small percentage are getting full primary education, a much smaller percentage are <Col N="1663" /> getting second level and almost none go on to third level.  There is a very low level of educational achievement particularly among the unemployed and the older age group.  Only a small proportion have sat for the leaving certificate examination.  A significant proportion of job training is in the traditional areas of employment.  Few have professional or technical qualifications. In addition, only a very small proportion of all employed are undergoing apprenticeships.  We all know education affects life's chances significantly. Surveys of those leaving the education system along with the data on overall unemployment suggest the vast majority of the young unemployed, particularly those out of work for long periods, are of low educational achievement and relatively unskilled.</P>
    <P>We have a fairly appalling picture of educational, social and economic deprivation with a really horrendous level of unemployment of 80 per cent in the area. We must remember that many of those families have been relocated from the inner city into public housing and virtually all the housing there is public housing, so there is an onus to ensure that there is a decent level of educational opportunity.</P>
    <P>Let us look for a moment at the document the Government signed with the trade unions, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the commitments to education made therein.  First, the programme recognises the importance of the educational system in the promotion of equity in society and states that the Government will ensure that the burden of any adjustment does not fall on the disadvantaged.  Here we have a most disadvantaged area, as disadvantaged and deprived as could be found anywhere in the country, with the burden falling disproportionately on the disadvantaged. There is no promotion of equity in this area in terms of educational attainment.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the programme provides that special measures will be produced to help disadvantaged groups with special needs to achieve their potential.  Nothing has been done about that.  There is no <Col N="1664" /> adult education in the area.  It would be intended that new schools would provide a focus and centre for adult education and other opportunities in training.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the programme states, that action will be taken to encourage more second level pupils to complete the senior cycle and more working class children to advance to third level education and special measures will be devised to attract priority one pupils to vocational preparation and training courses.  There is no fulfilment whatsoever of that provision of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Nothing has been done to encourage more pupils to complete second level education &mdash; 10.5 per cent are completing second level, 90 per cent are not even sitting for the leaving certificate, and 0.1 per cent are going on to third level.  What is being done for working class children to advance to third level in this situation? Absolutely nothing.</P>
    <P>Finally, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> stated that programmes of community education and adult literacy would continue and would be intensive to the limits that resources permit.  Certainly in relation to north Clondalkin resources have not permitted anything to be done to ensure that courses in literacy and adult education are introduced and implemented.</P>
    <P>That is the situation and the profile of the community we are talking about.  The parents and staff want a site that has been identified and which the corporation are willing to sell or lease to the VEC.  That site is off Fonthill Road where there is sufficient space for the new community school, for new football pitches, tennis courts, a community centre, an educational structure that would be a community structure as well and which would provide créche facilities and a library which would facilitate adult education and provide an oratory.  They want a building to be designed in such a way as to be adaptable to the present and future needs of the community.  That really is what is required.  At present all we have is an old vocational school in Lucan a number of miles away where the children are bussed every day and if they miss the <Col N="1665" /> bus by two or three minutes they do not get education that day.  This is those children's fourth year going to Lucan and we are coming into a fifth year cycle with the numbers increasing dramatically and no permanent site for the school.  It is not too much to ask the Department of Education and the Minister to fulfil a commitment made in 1986 to provide a permanent structure for the school.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the deprived families of north Clondalkin will become even more deprived unless they are provided with the basic entitlement, namely, a post-primary school which would be a focal point for the local community and would provide them with an opportunity to break out of the vicious circle of disadvantage in which they are trapped.  The deprived children of Clondalkin are not seeking a programme of positive discrimination in their favour.  They are simply making a plea to be provided with equality of educational opportunity like every other child in this State.</P>
    <P>It is the Minister's duty to ensure that the Government's commitments given in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to promote equity in society and to ensure that the burden of any adjustment does not fall on the disadvantaged and deprived are honoured, and she can only honour that commitment by ensuring that this long awaited school is constructed without delay.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear the Minister of State who is deputising for the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, state categorically what the position is.  Will the capital funding be made available in the coming budget to enable the school to be constructed so that the parents, staff and pupils can on with the job of education and ensure that steps are taken to alleviate the levels of disadvantage and deprivation in education, that prevail at present in north Clondalkin?</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Costello for his contribution, and I congratulate him on his election to the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Senator is aware, it is the <Col N="1666" /> Department's policy to monitor carefully developments in all areas of Dublin which have been expanding over the past ten to 20 years.  This is especially true in the case of the Clondalkin area generally and the Department are aware of the many problems which can be experienced by primary and post-primary pupils in such developing areas.  In this regard, the Department have a good record in providing educational facilities at primary and post-primary level.</P>
    <P>St. Kevin's community college, the most recent post-primary school established servicing the north Clondalkin areas of Quarryvale and Balgaddy mainly, opened in September 1986 and was housed temporarily in Collinstown Park community college.  The decision to open a new post-primary school in north Clondalkin was taken by the then Minister, Deputy Patrick Cooney, in June 1986.  A major factor involved was the inability of Collinstown Park community college to enrol new entrants from the areas now served by St. Kevin's community college.  As from September 1987, the St. Kevin's pupils have been accommodated in the old &mdash; and recently vacated &mdash; vocational school, Lucan. Current enrolment in St. Kevin's is 270 pupils.  The pupils are transported to Lucan at the Department's expense.</P>
    <P>Arrangements for the acquisition of a site and the commencement of architectural planning were initiated.  It was considered that a school to provide for 400 pupils would be required.</P>
    <P>Two possible sites reserved by the county council were considered.  In January 1987 it was agreed with the VEC that a site on Fonthill Road was the more suitable.</P>
    <P>A number of factors have had to be considered by the Department prior to proceeding with the purchase of the site in question.  These include: (i) the high cost involved, given the strict limitation of funding available to the Department; (ii) as with other major building projects proposed for the Greater Dublin area, the planning section of the Department has carried out a number of reviews of the Clondalkin area to assess the future <Col N="1667" /> demand for post primary education.  The halt in the provision of new housing in the area, the effects of the £5,000 local authority grant and the phenomenon of peaking enrolments followed by a rapid decline in pupil numbers seen in other developing areas &mdash; all these have had to be given careful consideration by the Department; and (iii) in May 1988, a &ldquo;Review of Policy for the Provision of New and Replacement Accommodation for Primary and Second Level Schools&rdquo; was completed by an Interdepartmental Committee consisting of officials of the Departments of Education and Finance. The report was submitted to the Ministers for Education and Finance and its recommendations were endorsed by both Ministers.</P>
    <P>A crucial recommendation contained in the review was that:</P>
    <P>In major urban areas, where there are no defined catchment areas, consideration of an application from any school or area for new, extended or improved accommodation shall have regard to the accommodation situation actual and projected within reasonable access of a particular school or area. In this context and in the light of the school transport provisions, a distance of 3 miles is not considered unreasonable.</P>
    <P>The Department have had to consider the implications of providing another greenfield school building in Clondalkin in the light of the above recommendation.</P>
    <P>The position, therefore, regarding St. Kevin's community college is that, in view of the factors cited, all aspects of the project are subject to a detailed investigation before commitments can be <Col N="1668" /> entered into.  In this regard the planning section of the Department have had a number of meetings this year with representatives of County Dublin VEC and the school's board of management. The Minister for Education has also met representatives of St. Kevin's community college.</P>
    <P>These discussions have centred on: (i) the short term problem &mdash; where and how to accommodate the school for the coming years, given that the old vocational school building in Lucan will be inadequate from 1990 onwards.  The problem has been made more acute by the recent sale of land adjoining the school which the VEC had leased to erect prefabricated accommodation; and (ii) the long term problem &mdash; the difficulties relating to the provision of a new school building for St. Kevin's community college.</P>
    <P>At these meetings a wide range of options have been discussed and County Dublin VEC considered the matter at meetings held on 20 November and 6 December.</P>
    <P>County Dublin VEC's proposals on the matter have just today been received in the planning section of the Department and these are now being carefully examined. I would not wish to comment on these proposals until this examination is completed.  However, I would stress that the Department accept that the present accommodation arrangements are not satisfactory.  The Minister, and the Department, wish to see the best possible facilities made available to the post primary pupils of north Clondalkin.  It is hoped, therefore, that a satisfactory resolution, acceptable to all parties can be arrived at.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.45 p.m. <i>sine die.</i></P>
