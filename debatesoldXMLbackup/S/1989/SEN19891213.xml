      <P>I have notice from Senator Thomas Hussey that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to sanction the Dunmore-Glenamaddy Regional Water Supply, Stage 2, to Dunmore.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Joe Costello on the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to fulfil her commitment to the development of a new school in north Clondalkin for the students of St. <Col N="1194" /> Kevin's Community College who are in temporary accommodation.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Maurice Manning of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to compensate the former employees of Irish Shipping Limited in view of his party's promise made in that regard in June 1985.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator David Norris of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health, in the light of the recent resignation of the Chairman of the Health Research Board due to unexpected arbitrary budgetary constraints imposed in the Estimates, to look urgently at the possibility of providing future and adequate funding so that this important body can carry out its work in the national interest.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Liam Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The delay in publishing the report on pay and conditions in the Defence Forces with the continuing hardship for members and their dependants.</P>
    <P>Tá fógra agam ón Seanadóir Pól Ó Foighil:</P>
    <P>An gá atá ann go méadóidh an tAire Comhshaoil an t-olldeontas bóithre do Ghaillimh ag féachaint do dhrochstaid na mbóithre i gConamara.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Mary Jackman of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The continuing failure to extend the franchise in Seanad elections to graduates of the newly created Universities of Limerick and Dublin city.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Hussey, Costello, Manning, Norris, Cosgrave and Ó Foighil as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have elected the matter raised by Senator Hussey and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Costello, Manning, Norris, Cosgrave and Ó Foighil <Col N="1195" /> may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret I have to rule the matter raised by Senator Jackman is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds that it involves legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is that Items Nos. 1, 2 and 3 be taken and that we take the Marine Institute Bill commencing at 4.30 p.m.  Private Members' business is as arranged last week from 6.30 p.m. to 9.30 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business for today, I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he would consider having some time today &mdash; not more than half an hour &mdash; to allow statements on the situation of the boat people in Hong Kong.  I would like to say a quick word on this.  Over the next few weeks there is going to be enormous pressure on Britain and on the US to change their policy in this regard.  I believe that in some small way the views of this House and this Parliament should be heard on the matter and added to the growing international pressure.  If it is possible at the end of today's sitting, I think it is something that would be well worth doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he would agree to an emergency debate on the absence of vaccine to deal with the flu epidemic that is about to rage in the country.  All of the evidence would suggest that the Department have been caught totally unprepared for this.  In the <i>Irish Independent</i> today in an article by Don Lavery there are some frightening statistics.  I am asking for a special debate on this very serious matter and also on the degree to which hospitals are ready to cope with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Secondly, I would like to ask the Leader of the House when we are going to deal with the debate that was promised in relation to Northern Ireland. In relation to comments made by the Leader of the House last week about the question of Private Members' Bills and motions, and his statement that there was no sense in putting down either new Bills or motions because they would not be taken, I would like him to make a statement in relation to the constitutional powers of this House and, in the context of the reform we will be discussing on Item No. 3 on the Order Paper, would he not like to institute a degree of reform immediately, not to stonewall on the issue but to allow motions and private Bills to be brought before the House and to be debated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I misaddressed Senator Cassidy.  I am simply coping with interruptions.  I would like yet again to ask the Leader of the House to clarify for me, for the Independent group and for all the Members of this <Col N="1197" /> House, whether he proposes to permit Private Members' legislation to be introduced in this House.  I seem to have difficulty in getting through to the Leader of the House what I am talking about.  I am not talking about passing legislation, I am not talking about debating legislation. That is a matter for us in our own time. I want to know does he propose to allow Private Members' legislation to be introduced in a way which can enable it to be debated in the time that is allocated to the Members on this side of the House. Is it a simple answer, yes or no?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the Bills on the Order Paper to which Senator Ryan refers, I would like to support what he has just said.  It is important to establish the principle, even at the risk of being repetitive, that it is the business of legislators to legislate.  With reference to the motion we will be talking about later on &mdash; the proposed reform of the Oireachtas &mdash; surely a central part of any contemplated reform is to make that acknowledgement, that it is parliament's right to legislate and that the Government have the right to propose legislation. In order to clarify that point I am going to continue to support Senator Ryan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support what Senator Manning said about the possibility being provided perhaps for a recording of statements about the situation regarding the Vietnamese boat people.  I hope a provision may be made although it is not actually on the Order of Business as currently scheduled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask either yourself, a Chathaoirligh, or, through you, the Leader of the House whether he can help me to find a motion I put on the Order Paper, which I have searched for but cannot find.  Since I did not receive an Order Paper this morning perhaps this is not entirely surprising.  I put down a motion several days ago, &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann notes its approval and warmly welcomes the fact that Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas come from all four provinces of the island&rdquo;.  I have been <Col N="1198" /> quite unable to find it on the Order Paper so I cannot call the number but I would like to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much. There are three other matters I would like to mention.  They are all on the Order of Business specifically.  I would like to support what has been said by other Senators about the provision of time for a debate on Northern Ireland.  I understand we were promised this and I hope there may be a date set to it.  It is unlikely, I suppose, that it will take place before Christmas.  I would like to draw your attention, a Chathaoirligh, to what I find a rather disturbing though perhaps unintentional situation that materialised this morning.  I have been appointed to represent the Independent group on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights and I came this morning at 11 o'clock&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I point out to you the fact that the House was treated with considerable contempt by the Whips of the parties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to the motion in the name of the Independent Senators, which I think will be taken today, so perhaps it comes up under that. It refers to the need for the &ldquo;establishment of a commitee of the Dáil and Seanad to recommend changes in the <Col N="1199" /> role, structure and function...&rdquo;.  I do not wish to be difficult, a Chathaoirligh, so I will raise this matter during that discussion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case it is my intention to make a strong statement during the debate about the contempt with which this House was treated.</P>
      <P>My final request is that the Leader of the House would consider allowing Item No. 41 to be taken.  It refers to the Dalai Lama.  The reason I specifically would like it taken today, even for a short period, is to allow statements to be made. I moved this last week, which was one of two days closer to the awarding of the Nobel Prize to the Dalai Lama.  This is the second of the two days closest to it. I will not be putting it to a vote because I do not want to waste the time of the House, but I would welcome the opportunity for some short statements of approval for the courage of this man who has led his nation in a situation where his people are being exterminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will reply only to the points that are relevant to the Order of Business.  On the question of the debate on Northern Ireland, I am loath to say there is agreement with the Whips that it should be postponed until after Christmas and that the debate will take place after Christmas.  I am loath to say that, but I did understand that was the agreement that was reached.</P>
      <P>On the first question that was raised by Senator Manning, I feel the Whips could meet regarding that matter and I see no objection to having short statements made on that item, perhaps at the conclusion of business tonight.  However, as we will be sitting reasonably late tonight, it may be more appropriate to discuss that item tomorrow.  I do not think it makes that much difference whether it takes place this evening, tomorrow morning or tomorrow afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1200" /> The matters raised by Senator O'Reilly have absolutely nothing to do with me.  If he wishes to have an emergency debate, there is a method in Standing Orders whereby he can raise that matter but it is a matter for the Chair to decide.  The same applies to Senator Costello on the smog issue.</P>
    <P>On the question of Private Members' Bills raised by various Senators, let the matter arise on the Order of Business and we will deal with it as the matters arise on the Order of Business.  The query has been raised here before.  In the past 14 years there have been 14 Private Members' Bills disposed of whether it be not allowed to appear, allowed to appear and not discussed.  One appeared and was discussed.  That is from the records of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, is it in order for the Leader of the House to give the House incorrect information?  I introduced and had discussed three Bills in the last eight years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to return to <Col N="1201" /> the point I was making at the conclusion of the discussion last week.  I am quite seriously concerned at the arbitrary age limit of 70 to be imposed on trustees and I urge the Minister to reconsider this because I believe there are a number of people, particularly in the world of financial expertise, whose wisdom increases and matures with age and there are many people whose services would be valuable to an organisation like the Trustee Savings Banks well past the age of 70.  Of course, people who are senile or otherwise incapable ought to be removed as a matter of course, whether they are 35 years or 75 years, but I really have to deplore this ageism which would have excluded people of the calibre of Calouste Gulbenkian, for example, as the trustee of the Trustee Savings Bank. I very much hope that this situation will be re-examined by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The general framework in which I wish to place my remarks is that of taking on board the Minister's intention which is, as I see it, to create what he himself described as a level playing field between the different financial institutions, in particular the Trustee Savings Banks and the more orthodox banking institutions such as the Allied Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland and so on &mdash; there is no need to name them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to tease out perhaps some technical points at which, as I see it, there is variance between this intention on the part of the Minister and the Trustee Savings Banks Bill as published.  Again, I may be incorrect in this because of amendments that have been accepted or amendments the Minister intends to accept and I would be very happy to accept that explanation.  For example, I would have some concern at significant changes that could be made to Acts of the Oireachtas by Cabinet ministerial regulations and ministerial orders.  I feel that this kind of legislation should reflect the principle that all such amending regulations, unless restricted to clarification of certain consequential aspects of the principal legislation, require positive approval by the Dáil and the Seanad <Col N="1202" /> rather than the kind of negative rubber-stamping.</P>
    <P>With regard to licensing, section 32 (1) (b) of the Central Bank Act, 1989, clearly specifies that the Central Bank must make its decision with regard to granting a licence within six months from the date of application or, where further information is sought by the Central Bank, within six months after that later date or within 12 months from the initial application, whichever period first expires.  Section 10 (4) of the Trustee Savings Banks Bill, as originally drafted, should be redrafted in a manner consistent with the Central Bank Act provisions.  The reason I say this is because I am taking very seriously what the Minister says with regard to the creation of a level playing field.</P>
    <P>Once again section 12 of the Trustee Savings Banks Bill which specifies the granting of a licence by the Central Bank should be subject to such conditions, if any, as it may impose and specify the time the licence is granted.  The appeals procedures set out in section 12 against those conditions are to the Central Bank itself.  This does seem to me to be an anomaly, because in the parallel situation governed by the Companies Act the appeal is directed to the Minister for Finance himself, or herself as the case may be in the future.  I do not see why there should be this variation.  Again, I appeal to the principle of the level playing field.</P>
    <P>In my next comment I am really seeking information.  I am a little bit confused, both by the contents of the Trustee Savings Banks Bill and also by the briefing document with which I have been provided by the chartered accountants. They expressed some concern about section 13, which specifies that one of the conditions under which the Central Bank may revoke a licence is if any of the trustees of the Trustee Savings Banks are convicted on indictment of an offence under this Act or convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty.</P>
    <P>The chartered accountants consider that this condition is unduly onerous and is at variance with the provisions applied to a director of a licensed bank under the <Col N="1203" /> Central Bank Act.  That, as an ordinary punter to be quite honest, would make me feel a bit more concerned about the situation with regard to the Central Bank Act.  I would not be very happy with somebody convicted of fraud being allowed to remain as director of a bank. It seems to be inappropriate.</P>
    <P>I cannot agree with the parties who have briefed me that this condition is unduly onerous, although I imagine that what they mean is that a director or trustee of a savings bank may be guilty of fraud in the post office, but that this may simply still leave him with a clean slate in the Trustee Savings Banks area.  I do not agree with that at all.  I am quite happy with the legislation, despite my brief, as it is currently drafted.  I would again direct the attention of the House to the fact that this is the Trustee Savings Banks and a cardinal root point of those words is trust.  If you have a person who is convicted of fraud, then I do not see how they are capable of properly discharging the trust that is reposed in them. Instead of requesting the Minister to change this Bill, I suggest that he might look at the Central Bank Act.</P>
    <P>In section 3 (5) it is noted that section 15 requires Central Bank consent for the fixing of interest rates, maximum liabilities and a number of other matters in relation to the Trustee Savings Bank. These requirements appear to draw on the special position of the Minister for Finance in guaranteeing the debts of Trustee Savings Banks.  Such consents are not helpful in achieving the level playing field desired for all financial institutions. However, as I understand it, there is apparently no longer any undertaking or guarantee by the Minister with regard to the debts of Trustee Savings Banks as envisaged in this Bill.  As I see it, he appears to be extracting himself from that situation.</P>
    <P>With regard to trustees, I have already indicated my difficulties with regard to the question of age.  I hope the Minister will take this matter on board.</P>
    <P>As far as supervision is concerned, sections 29, 30 and 31 of the Bill empower the <Col N="1204" /> Central Bank to specify differing conditions for differing Trustee Savings Banks.  It seems to me that we are again in the microcosm looking at another aspect of the level playing field notion.  I do not think it is desirable that different conditions should apply to different Trustee Savings Banks if we are seeking a situation of parity.  Perhaps the Minister would be able to clarify that for me.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 6 &mdash; management and administration &mdash; there are some problems that are serious &mdash; they deal with the situation of auditors and accountants.  Far be it from me to wish to protect the species of auditors and accountants but, at the same time, it seems there are some anomalies contained within the Bill.  For example, unlike the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987, there are no provisions in section 36 of the Bill governing the resignation of auditors, nor does it specify that an auditor or trustee of a Trustee Savings Bank who has been removed is entitled to attend the following annual general meeting of the bank and be heard at that meeting regarding any of its business that concerns him as former auditor of the bank. That seems to me to be a violation of natural justice; because there is no question of doubt that if an auditor is removed, a certain cloud hangs over his or her name and it seems to be a reasonable part of natural justice that that person should be permitted to attend. There should be this provision within the regulations to attend the next annual general meeting and ask or answer such questions as may legitimately clear his or her name.  That, to my mind, would be decent business practice and consonant with what I would describe as natural justice.</P>
    <P>Section 36 (9) empowers the Central Bank to direct a Trustee Savings Bank not to re-appoint a named person as auditor, which direction must be complied with by the Trustee Savings Bank.  It is inequitable that this section contains no provision for appeal procedures against such a direction by the Central Bank. Again, it is a question of a person's reputation. The Central Bank, an anomymous body, may direct the removal of an <Col N="1205" /> auditor engaged in his or her professional business with no explanation, no recourse to seek clarification and the reasons, and it could be that those reasons were specious. Anybody in business life seeking to engage the services of an auditor would hesitate to do so, on the basis that there is no smoke without fire, in the case of an audit or who had been precipitately removed without any recourse to an appeals procedure.  It may be that the Minister is in the process of taking on board this kind of amendment, but it seems to me, out of simple fairness, that this must be done because we are dealing with professional reputations.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister, if he is not prepared to accept these kind of amendments, what calibre of auditiors and accountants does he imagine the Trustee Savings Banks are going to secure.  If I was an accountant, a highly unlikely proposition I can assure the House, I would be most reluctant to be engaged in a situation, where I could be fired without explanation, without recourse to an unfair dismissals tribunal.  I could be excluded from all those meetings at which my character was blackened by implication. This is a very serious flaw in the Bill as at present drafted.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that the auditor is an independent third party whose relationship with the bank consists of providing a professional service.  It is, therefore, urged that section 36 (10) should be revised since the apparent implication of certain provisions therein, as at present drafted, is that the auditor could be an officer or employee of the bank.  Here, again, you have the creeping powers of the Central Bank as opposed to the powers of the Minister.  It seems to me to be very odd that on the one hand the Central Bank can fire someone without explanation and, on the other hand, they can institute and instal inside a Trustee Savings Bank somebody who may be one of their own employees.  Where is the natural justice in that?  There seems to me to be very legitimate scope for worry on this point.</P>
    <P>I have two further points which may <Col N="1206" /> have some substance and I would like to refer to them before concluding.  Section 38 refers to the auditor's reporting duties where he has reason to believe circumstances exist which could affect the bank's ability to fulfil and I quote &ldquo;any other of its financial obligations&rdquo; or inaccuracies or omissions relating to and again I quote &ldquo;any returns made&rdquo; to the Central Bank.  Since this section is obviously based on section 43 of the Insurance Act, 1989, which was passed by this House and section 47 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, it shares their inadequacies in that it fails to specify clearly the precise circumstances in which such additional reporting responsibilities will arise.  By referring to financial obligations and returns in vague general ways and terms, it would appear, which, I imagine is not the Minister's intention, that breaches of &ldquo;any financial obligations or inaccuracies or omissions in any return will give rise to a reporting responsibility under section 38.  This approach is not withstanding that such errors where found may well have no impact upon the bank's ability to fulfil its obligation to its depositors or creditors&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The final point, on which I may reassure the Minister I do not feel strongly &mdash; he, I am sure, will be able to detect those on which I do feel strongly, particularly the question of the accountability of the auditors and their right to have just recourse to machinery whereby they can clear their character &mdash; is one of substance in the world of accounting. Section 37 requires the auditor to make a report annually to the trustees dealing with the various matters outlined in the Bill.  In the past it has been recommended by the accountancy profession that sections such as this in companies and other legislation be revised to provide for situations whereby auditors need only refer to matters in the audit report if they are intended as qualifications of that report. The accountancy profession is concerned that audit reports in the Republic of Ireland had become excessively lengthy by comparison with other member states of the European Community, that the fundamental opinion as to the true and <Col N="1207" /> fair view of the entity's state of affairs and results risks in being overshadowed if not misinterpreted and, accordingly, that it is in the interests of all users of financial statements that the content of the audit report be clarified by referring to matters other than a true and fair view on an exception basis only.  I do not feel very strongly about that but I understand the point that is being made.  In other words, as the Bill is at present phrased we may be placing our Trustee Savings Banks at a disadvantage to comparable institutions within the European Community. That is a fair point to make.</P>
    <P>I would like to express my own worry in a few concluding remarks about what may well be the end result of this Bill.  I believe, in concert with a number of the speakers who took part in the debate in the Dáil, which I read with great interest, that it is quite possible that the Trustee Savings Banks far from being protected and far from being placed on a level playing field are actually being placed on an auctioneer's slab and that the machinery contained in this Bill is principally intended to allow them to be privatised. I hope this is not the case and not the intention and I certainly hope that it is not the end result of this legislation.  The Trustee Savings Banks have an honourable history as the Minister outlined in his opening remarks, thay have been valuable as a community resource, they are now quite a significant, though small, element in the banking services of this country and I for one, would hate to see them ruthlessly absorbed by a larger financial equity.  It seems to me this will be absolutely, totally and completely out of character with the intention for which they were established, with the trust which the people of Ireland have placed in them.  It would be absolutely morally wrong for the Minister to facilitate any such acquisition by a financial conglomerate.</P>
    <P>I look forward very much to hearing the Minister's response, particularly dealing with questions such as interest rates charged on credit cards which I raised last week, the question of the age <Col N="1208" /> of 70 as being a bar which I do not believe it should be.  My two final points are the question of the need for auditors and accountants to be protected against the very anomalous conditions imposed upon them by this Bill and a guarantee from the Minister that, what is being presented here is an intention to place our Trustee Savings Banks on a level playing field and not on the auctioneer's slab.</P>

      <P>As this is the first opportunity I have had to come to this House since I was appointed Minister of State with responsibility for Science and Technology, I would like to warmly congratulate you, a Chathaoirligh on your appointment and I am glad you are all happily installed in the old Seanad.  I hope this beautiful premises will inspire all of you in the future.</P>
      <P>I would like to thank Senators for their contributions to the debate on the Second Stage of this Bill.  While the Trustee Savings Banks are small in terms of the overall financial sector, they provide a very important service for the smaller depositor in particular.  However they are hampered by archaic regulations which have no place in today's financial environment and changes are long overdue. In today's financial environment an institution must grow to survive and I am satisfied the present Bill is necessary to enable the Trustee Savings Banks to grow and prosper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time for them to be brought onto a level playing field and to give them the opportunity to provide a wider range of financial services.  In future they will be under the supervision of the Central Bank which is the proper supervisory authority for banking services.  With the removal of outdated restrictions, the Trustee Savings Banks will be better equipped to grow and cope with intense competition.  There are already plans in train for new branch offices.  For the first time they will be able to do business with companies as well as individuals and they will have much greater flexibility in terms of use of depositors' funds.  The updating of rules and structures which is being provided for in this Bill is in line with <Col N="1209" /> the changes already in operation or now being put in place in respect of savings bank's operations in other European countries.</P>
    <P>The whole financial sector has been going through a period of dramatic change in recent years.  New financial instruments, the increased use of technology and the implementation of European Community directives are having a very big impact and traditional lines of demarcation between the various financial institutions are fading away.  Earlier this year the Oireachtas enacted legislation in respect of the Central Bank and the building societies to provide for these new realities and this Bill is doing likewise for the Trustee Savings Banks.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle referred to four issues outstanding between the Minister and the Central Bank as late as 1987.  She concluded that as three out of the four issues were not dealt with in the Bill, they were still unresolved and accounted for the general nature of some of the sections. The four issues which Senator Doyle identified as relevant in discussions between the Department of Finance and the Central Bank were (i) liability of trustees; (ii) the determination of Trustee Savings Bank interest rates <i>vis-á-vis</i> the public; (iii) the percentage of depositors' funds to be lodged with the Minister and (iv) the rate of interest the Minister would pay the Trustee Savings Banks on the funds lodged with him.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle noted that the liability of trustees is dealt with in the legislation and concluded that the absence of reference to other issues indicated that these questions remained unresolved between the Department and the Central Bank. Discussion on these issues concerns the respective responsibility of the Minister and the Central Bank.  The issues have, in fact, been resolved and the respective responsibilities are clearly set out in the Bill.  Section 15 of the Bill states that Trustee Savings Bank interest rates <i>visá-vis</i> the public will be fixed in such a manner and by reference to such matters as the Central Bank may determine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This arrangement will allow a degree of flexibility to the Central Bank to take into account such matters as prevailing market rates and the wishes of the Trustee Savings Banks on their preferred interest rate structure and the arrangements agreed between the Central Bank and other banks under their supervision. To tie the matter down any further in legislation would only lead to the shackling of the Trustee Savings Banks. Senators will appreciate that the thrust of the present Bill is in the direction of unshackling the Trustee Savings Banks from the over-detailed and inappropriate constraints imposed by existing outmoded legislation.</P>
      <P>The remaining two issues are dealt with in section 32.  The percentage of depositors' funds to be lodged with the Minister will be determined by the Central Bank after consulting the Minister and the Minister will determine the rate of interest he pays on such funds after consulting the Central Bank.  Any reduction in the proportion of depositors' funds lodged with the Minister will clearly have to take place gradually and will depend on a number of things, including the extent to which the Trustee Savings Banks can prudently expand their lending business and the rate at which their deposit business develops.  In determining the rate he pays on funds lodged with him, the Minister will have regard to prevailing market rates.  I believe these issues have been adequately dealt with in the legislation and that it would be inappropriate to elaborate any further in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Doyle also wanted the conditions which the Central Bank might attach to licences to be set out in the Bill. This would be entirely inappropriate and out of keeping with the practice in relation to other banks.  The sections on licences in this Bill reflect similar provisions in the Central Bank Acts and this is how it should be.  Among the areas <Col N="1211" /> which could be covered in the conditions attaching to licences are a requirement to get Central Bank approval for branch expansion, limits on lending to particular sectors, an upper limit on the amount of individual loans, the extent of a bank's exposure in any particular area, conditions on loans to trustees and so on.  I stress that in all of this the Central Bank is guided by what is prudent for the institution under its supervision.  It must retain discretion here and this is exercised in the interests of the prudent and orderly regulation of the banks, an aim to which I am sure we all subscribe.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle asked about the legal advice on the ownership of Trustee Savings Banks.  The advice of the Attorney General on this question was based on a very detailed consideration of the position of the Irish Trustee Savings Banks.  This advice is that the disposal of the assets of Trustee Savings Banks is at the discretion of the Oireachtas.  This, of course, is subject to the rights of depositors to their deposits and any due interest thereon.  One of the issues which arose in the UK was the extent of the rights of depositors and whether they had any claim to ownership of the banks.  My advice is that these rights are confined to what I have already indicated.</P>
    <P>Senators Doyle and O'Toole were anxious that any regulation that might be made under sections 5 and 6 should be by way of affirmative order and subject to prior Oireachtas approval.  They drew attention to the provision for the use&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Therefore, there is <Col N="1212" /> not a simple position that supports the stance taken by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not have a chat about it at this stage but we referred this matter to the Attorney General and he, in turn, took into account decisions of the nature which the Senator has outlined and came to his decision.  The Government and the Minister are naturally advised by the Attorney General in these matters and I have no doubt he has taken the correct course.</P>
      <P>In legislation of this kind the usual procedure is for regulations to be made, laid before the Oireachtas and be subject to annulment within 21 days, if that is the wish of the Oireachtas.  This is the procedure adopted for provisions similar to sections 5 and 6 included in the Building Societies Act and is also the procedure adopted in other precedents for section 5 which I referred to in my opening address on Second Stage of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware of the disquiet in the Dáil about this procedure in relation to those two Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be disquiet in the Dáil over quite a number of issues. These precedents are the Social Welfare Act, 1952, the Farm Tax Act, 1985, the Canals Act, 1986 and the Valuation Act, 1988.  The Building Societies Act, 1989 has a three year limit and a similar limit is appropriate in this case.  Limits on the other precedents cited varied; the Social Welfare Act, one year; the Farm Tax and Valuation Acts, two years; the Canals Act, three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the scope of any amendments, all the precedent legislation referred to limited the scope of amendments under this section to the Act in question, except for the Canals Act which allowed for the possibility of amendment to any other enactment.  In the case of the Trustee Savings Banks Bill, it is envisaged that only relatively minor changes <Col N="1213" /> would be made under section 5.  Indeed, as I have already said, my advice is that despite the apparent breadth of its drafting, the Minister would only be entitled to use this section in an extremely limited way.</P>
    <P>Section 6 will only allow the importation into Trustee Savings Bank legislation of changes made in company, banking and building society legislation after the coming into force of the present Trustee Savings Banks Bill.  This will only be done where sections of the present Bill are modelled on provisions in these other Acts or where a totally new provision might be introduced into the other legislation which would require to be imported into Trustee Savings Bank legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 57 is different.  There is a major choice of direction provided for in this section, namely, whether, on conversion to company status, Trustee Savings Banks would become State companies owned and controlled by the Minister or whether they would become private sector companies.  In contrast to what might be envisaged under sections 5 and 6, this is a matter where the Oireachtas must have the chance to register its view in advance of any action being taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Doyle and O'Toole referred to the question of State guarantee for Trustee Savings Banks funds.  The present position is that there is no formal, legal State guarantee of deposits to depositors.  However, as 80 per cent of deposits are lodged with the Minister for Finance these are, in effect, guaranteed to the Trustee Savings Banks against default.  The remaining 20 per cent of the resources of the banks are invested prudently and profitably and it will be the function of the Central Bank to ensure that this continues.  When this legislation is put into effect the proportion of deposits lodged with the Exchequer will only be reduced to the extent that there are opportunities for prudent and profitable expansion of Trustee Savings Bank business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1214" /> Reference was also made to section 58 which says, in effect, that a Trustee Savings Bank shall not claim in any manner that its deposits are State guaranteed. This is not new.  It is based on the existing section 1 of the Savings Banks Act, 1891 which states that the Trustee Savings Bank may not be designated or described in any manner which imports that the Government are responsible or liable to depositors for any money placed in the safe keeping of the bank.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to assurances given by the Minister for Finance in 1984 when there was an exceptional level of withdrawals of deposits from the Dublin Trustee Savings Banks.  In 1984 the then Minister for Finance was satisfied that the Trustee Savings Banks were entirely solvent and were in a position to repay all their depositors in full.  I am happy to state that this continues to be the case today.  As the proportion of Trustee Savings Banks funds invested with the State gradually reduces, the Trustee Savings Bank will be brought under the deposit protection scheme provided for in the recent Central Bank Act.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole asked what precisely are we handing over to the Central Bank. Basically, we are handing over the present supervisory function which is carried out by the Minister.  The Minister will, however, retain the right to determine the rate of interest he pays on Trustee Savings Banks moneys lodged with him and he will be consulted by the Central Bank on the proportion of depositors' funds to be lodged with him.  At present the Minister determines this proportion but it has always been subject to review in the light of prudent opportunities open to Trustee Savings Banks.  However, these opportunities have been limited to a large extent by the legislative framework under which the Trustee Savings Banks have been operating up to now.  The status of the Trustee Savings Banks regarding ownership and the vesting of the property in the trustees is not changed by this legislation.  However, if and when an order is made under section 57, ownership will change in one way or another. The Trustee Savings Banks would then <Col N="1215" /> be owned either by the Minister or by an individual or body rather than the Minister.  It is because of this that section 57 provides for the affirmative order procedure.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole wondered when the Minister's consent was still required for the revocation of a licence if the Minister was handing over his supervisory functions to the Central Bank.  This arrangement is not peculiar to Trustee Savings Banks legislation.  In the Central Bank Act a refusal by the Central Bank to grant a licence or a decision by the Central Bank to revoke a licence is subject to the consent of the Minister and the same arrangement is adopted in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole was worried, if I understand his remarks correctly, that in the event of a conflict between the present Bill and the Companies Bill currently before the Dáil a Trustee Savings Bank which, under section 57 was set up as a company owned by the Minister, could find itself subject to a reverse takeover by a subsidiary.  Under an amendment to the Companies Bill put forward by the Minister for Industry and Commerce this would not be possible.  A company could acquire shares in its holding company but any such shares would be non-voting and the possibility of such a reverse takeover is, therefore, excluded.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole wonders why it is necessary to have a provision to enable the Trustee Savings Banks to operate abroad.  It is true that under the second EC banking directive a licensed bank will be able to operate throughout the European Community on the basis of its domestic licence and supervision.  This directive will only come into operation in 1993.  Also, it only covers the European Community.  The provision in the current Bill is designed to ensure that Central Bank approval is sought for any overseas operations and also that the legislation is not interpreted in a way that might imply that Trustee Savings Banks are precluded by law for from operating abroad.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole also asked where the requirement for a three-fifths majority <Col N="1216" /> for an amalgamation resolution came from.  The existing legislation requires a three-quarters majority and this Bill has reduced this in a way of facilitating amalgamation. Given, however, that amalgamation is a major structural change for a Trustee Savings Bank, it seemed reasonable to retain something more than a simple majority requirement, hence the three-fifths.  The pressures for amalgamation of the two existing banks into one unit may well increase as competition intensifies and there are advantages to be gained in a pooling of resources.  There are no proposals at present to amalgamate the two existing banks and while they share some facilities and maintain close contacts they are entirely separate and independent organisations.  I do not think it would be desirable, as Senator O'Toole seemed to imply, that I should legislate to force such an amalgamation through, though I have stated I would not stand in the way if both banks were satisfied that this was in their best interests.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton wondered what the responsibilities of the trustees were and how they were to be appointed.  The property of the bank is vested in the trustees and they are responsible for running the bank in conformity with legislation. On the question of appointment we should remember that we are adapting an existing institution here rather than setting out from scratch.  The method of appointment will remain broadly as before, namely that existing trustees coopt new trustees and this will have to be spelled out in the rules to be drawn up under the new Bill.  There will, however, be some differences in the existing legislation. New trustees will now be subject to Central Bank approval and there will be a limit on the number of trustees and the maximum age.  This matter has also been raised here this afternoon and it is only fair to say that a reasonable balance has been struck on the maximum age.</P>
    <P>At present there is no legal limit on the number of trustees but given the new expanded role for the banks under the legislation they will be best served by a smaller team of trustees.  Given such a <Col N="1217" /> limit on numbers, an age limit would also be appropriate to ensure that there was a reasonable turnover of trustees over time.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle raised the question of whether these limits would be phased in. It is the intention to bring all sections of the Bill into operation at the same time but section 2 allows the Minister discretion in this.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan wants more competition in the Irish banking sector.  I would hope that the freeing up of the Trustee Savings Banks under this legislation would introduce such competition.  Regarding the question of privatisation, section 57 allows for the conversion of the Trustee Savings Banks into companies owned by the Minister, that are considered desirable by the Minister and subject to prior approval by the Oireachtas.  The same approval would also be required for any conversion to private sector companies <Col N="1218" /> and there would be provision for the State to claw back appropriate sums if this arose.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris objects to different conditions applying to different Trustee Savings Banks.  This would, hopefully, apply for a transitional period and would depend on the relative strengths and so on of the individual Trustee Savings Banks.  There is nothing to stop the Central Bank differentiating conditions in relation to licensing for licensed banks. Senator Norris also quoted the submission of the accountancy body protesting that the revocation of a licence could follow the conviction of a trustee for fraud.  The point has been taken on board in a ministerial amendment in the Dáil.  Revocation now only follows fraud by the bank itself and not by any individual trustee.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 2 in my name purports to achieve much the same as amendment No. 1.  The Minister responded and I thank him for his full and detailed response on Second Stage, when he took up many of the points we had raised in our contributions.  He dealt with this section and this point.  I ask him to reconsider his response and allow affirmative motions or an affirmative approval in relation to this section.  It comes back really to when we move from making a regulation to a point that needs amending legislation.  There is some point on the scale where regulation is no longer the right way to deal with an issue, and at some point amending legislation is what should be done.  Between laying the motion before the House and an ordinary annulment within 21 days sufficing, there <Col N="1220" /> is the affirmative motion or the affirmative approval which we are requesting here.</P>
      <P>Under this particular section, I am asking the Minister &mdash; indeed others are asking the same &mdash; to reconsider the procedure he has detailed in the section as it now stands.  There is a lot of disquiet, not just in this House but also expressed in the Dáil as well, and among the accountancy and financial institutions generally outside this House.  They are not satisfied that any Minister should take upon himself the powers he is taking upon himself here by changing certain matters, albeit of a technical nature or otherwise, by just laying a motion before the House and having it annulled if necessary within 21 days.  We are asking for an affirmative motion or positive approval of this House, and indeed of the Dáil, in relation to this issue.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to indicate what is a significant change in the Act of the Oireachtas that can happily be dealt with by regulation.  When do we go beyond that point and need amending legislation?  We have to have some clear idea what we are speaking about here because when it comes to changing Acts of the Oireachtas by way of regulation, which is principally what we are talking about now, we are bestowing enormous power on the particular Minister, in this case the Minister for Finance.  I am not satisfied he should take upon himself the responsibility in this case to change this legislation when it becomes an Act of the Oireachtas.  I do not think this Minister for Finance or any one who may succeed him can take upon himself the right by way of regulation to make considerable changes to this measure when it becomes an Act.  I would like the Minister's views and the views of his advisers and indeed the views of the Cabinet, because obviously this has been considered in some detail, why we should even consider allowing this section go through as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a principle here and this principle has been debated in other pieces of legislation recently, the Companies Bill <Col N="1221" /> and the Building Societies Bill.  I stand to be corrected if I am wrong on either of those, but certainly in two recent pieces of legislation there has been considerable debate on this principle.</P>
    <P>There are five amendments to this section. This expresses the concern of the House in relation to what the section when amended, is trying to achieve and our opposition must be quite clearly stated by way of the amendments we have proposed.  I urge the Minister to accept our amendments in this case.  It is a very small step towards what the Minister is proposing.  It is just that this House, and indeed it would follow Dáil also subsequently, would be able to debate and consider the points that may be raised and, by affirmative approval, changes may be made to this legislation when it becomes an Act, not merely by way of an annulment procedure.</P>

      <P>I normally come to this House in a most generous mood but I am afraid the Senators have made the kind of suggestions which just are not possible to incorporate in the context of the present legislative debate on this matter. Senators Upton, Costello and Harte wish to restrict the power to make regulations under this section purely to transitional provisions following repeal of other Acts under section 7.  Section 4 (1), as drafted, is a standard provision allowing the Minister to make regulations to implement the Act.  It is essential to the Act and is, for example, in both the earlier 1976 and later 1989 Building Societies Acts in this very same form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Doyle, Upton, Costello, Ryan and Harte have amendments down to section 4 (2), which would call for prior approval by both Houses of the Oireachtas for any regulations under the Act.  This subsection is standard for this type of legislation and should not require regulations to have prior approval.  If the Senators are concerned about regulations made under sections 5 and 6 coming in under this section, I will be pointing out when we get to these sections, that what <Col N="1222" /> can effectively be done under them is quite limited and that the Bill retains the prior approval mechanism for section 57 where an important choice of direction could be involved.</P>
    <P>As I have said, it is a standard provision and it is necessary to avoid any legal or technical difficulties in putting the Act into effect.  Clearly, Senator Doyle has a certain mistrust of Fianna Fáil Ministers when it comes to items like this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The argument is made many times in these Houses that there has to be a certain degree of flexibility. There is a terrific lot of legislative work and change required and if every iota, every detail and every technical exercise has to be brought to the House before minor adjustments and changes can be made this will not help in expediting the work.  Many of those provisions are adopted in other legislation, some of it passed by our predecessors 12 and 15 years ago and they worked without a hitch.</P>
      <P>I want to say, with all respect to the Senators, who I know are keenly interested in the democratic exercise of the operation of these Houses, that there are limits.  These limits, are not new, they have been tested and tried and they are in other legislation.  I can assure the House they are of an absolute technical and minor nature.  I really feel the Senators will have no difficulty in withdrawing their amendments and allowing the House to proceed in an orderly and expeditious way to deal with the other matters which need to be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister's concluding remark was implying that we were being disorderly in any way in pursuing this amendment, I would ask him to reconsider it.  I will not withdraw this amendment.  The Minister gave a very courteous reply but it has been rehearsed <Col N="1223" /> so many times I could nearly have said it for him to save him the effort.  There are two points to which I want to draw the Minister's attention.  The section, if I am reading it correctly, and I stand to be corrected if not, means that the annulment procedure the Minister is now proposing comes into operation if the &ldquo;resolution annulling the regulation is pased by either such House within 21 days&rdquo;.  Perhaps we could have an explanation as to why both Houses are not necessary? Is there a reason why it might be brought to the Seanad and not to the Dáil, or to the Dáil and not the Seanad, and why in the normal courtesy it is not extended to both Houses?  Just by way of explanation we will be told it is precedent going back to God knows when.  Maybe so, but both Houses deserve the courtesy of consideration on this particular procedure.</P>
      <P>The other point I would like to raise &mdash; the Minister is probably aware of it &mdash; is that there have been recent court judgments relating to this procedure of a mere annulling motion.  The Judiciary now are quite unhappy about where the divide is between a mere annulling motion to change an Act of the Oireachtas by way of regulation, where it begins and ends and where amending legislation is actually necessary to change an act of the Oireachtas.  There is a scale there in terms of what the Minister is trying to achieve and at some point the change is such that it must come in by way of amending legislation to the Act rather than just by regulation.  I am trying to recall as I speak the recent court judgments.  One had to do with some Teagasc regulation or maybe it was a FÁS regulation, whereby the Minister had the power by way of regulation in an annulling motion after 21 days to do whatever. The judges had quite a lot to say on the matter and questioned severely this procedure as a method of amending legislation in these Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can quote precedent but sometimes we have to look at what we have been doing over the years and at what we have been doing in other legislation and <Col N="1224" /> it may not always be right.  We cannot continue behaving in a certain way just because we have always done that.  At a certain stage we have to say: is what we have been doing over the years correct? The Judiciary have now questioned this practice and procedure.  I feel that the amendments proposed for section 4 would allow no doubt to be left in terms of handling any changes the Minister might want by way of regulation.  We are not saying &ldquo;do not change by regulation&rdquo;; we are not saying the Minister needs amending legislation if he wants to change this Act; but we are saying that we want a positive approval rather than just the annulling motion after 21 days.</P>

      <P>I basically agree with the points made by Senator Doyle, that is, the anxiety that legislation should have to go through here in a positive manner and be approved.

We are not really talking about changing the sense, or what is really in it.  If one were to interpret it in that way one would straightaway run into difficulty.</P>

Legislation comes before us here; we have taken quite a lot of the legislation before it went down to the other House &mdash; a new practice by two Governments and which has worked well.  We should take the Bill here and forget about whether the Dáil has passed it or is to pass it.  The Senator keeps referring to the Dáil: she did it again a fortnight ago.  I realise that it may take a while for her to realise she is here and that we are to get the Bill through this House.  By referring to the Dáil, she will sidetrack herself.

      <P>Yes.  The representation that the attitude of people on this side of the House should always be to oppose regulations is incorrect.  There are some of us who take an independent line on such matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to these amendments which are being discussed, we have gone through this discussion time and time again as to whether regulations should be presented to the House by an affirmative process, in other words, that when a Minister has a change to make he or she comes before the Houses and says, &ldquo;I <Col N="1229" /> propose to make the following regulation: here it is&rdquo;, and it is agreed to by the House.  We all understand that &mdash; the positive, the affirmative process of the democratic system.  That is one way.</P>
    <P>The other is the negative process.  That is what is in this Bill.  That is what I have found time after time since I was elected to the Oireachtas.  I honestly believe it is just simply to facilitate those good and able supporters of ours in the public and Civil Service who know that it is a far easier way of doing business because all that it would need in the future would be simply to write the correction, give it to the Minister who passes it on to the Librarian in the House, who presents it to the Clerk of each of the Houses, who puts it on the back of the Order Paper on any given day.  Most people do not even look at such orders because they are written in code.</P>
    <P>To give an example, the Order Paper says, &ldquo;Papers laid before the Seanad today: Fire Services Act, 1981 (Prescribed Premises) Regulations, 1989&rdquo;. How many people in this House could tell me what that is about?  I defy anybody to tell me what it is about.  The second item is, &ldquo;Maintenance Allowances (Increased Payment) Regulations, 1989&rdquo;.  I am merely using these to illustrate my point.  I am not going to go through all four items listed.  There are very few of them there today.  I will give another example: University College, Galway, Statute CXCVIII which my knowledge of Roman numerals would make it out to be Statute 198.  That is the code.  Today we have accepted those four regulations.  I defy any Senator, Minister, or member of Government to explain what those four papers are.  Incidentally, they also appear on today's Dáil Order Paper and there is not one Member who could explain what any one of those is about.  For all we know all our houses today might be prescribed premises under the Fire Services Act, 1981 as being in some way deficient.  I make that point because that is what happens.</P>
    <P>The proposal before the House is that this will be made through the affirmative process but the Minister disagrees with <Col N="1230" /> that and the reason given was that it would delay and make less efficient the implementation of necessary changes in regulations.  That is a fair point in answer to the case that has been made by speakers on this side of the House but there is an in-between position in dealing with regulations and the advisers will be well aware of this.  That position is, that the Minister could make regulations which come into effect immediately but he would be required on the first sitting day afterwards to present them to both Houses, or within a certain number of sitting days afterwards to present them to both Houses.  In those circumstances, if either House rejected the regulations then they immediately become void.  I make the distinction because I want to know the thinking of the Minister on the matter.  This is not an amendment but, if I were to get an indication from the Minister that it would meet his argument and the arguments on this side I would be prepared to table such an amendment on Report Stage.  I ask the Minister to respond to that suggestion.</P>
    <P>If he does not accept the affirmative process as proposed here, would he accept the other little used process which is also there, that the Minister may make the regulations which come into operation immediately but that there is a requirement on him within a certain number of sitting days to present them to both Houses and in the event, and only in the event, of their being rejected by either House do they become void. Otherwise, it does not tie the hands of the Minister; we all get a bite of the cherry; we all know what is happening and the taxpayer and the small investor in a Trustee Savings Bank is even better protected than before.  I am sure the Minister will accept that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  This is very important because it has to do with the whole regulation procedure.  I have been very consistent over the years, dare I say it, in Chambers other than this, in my attitude towards the regulation procedure.  Even as a junior Minister, I had a very strong view in that regard.  The positive process is the most democratic process.  Any amendment of legislation by way of regulation should come by way of the positive process by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Unforeseen technical difficulties may arise, we have been told, and for that reason a regulation will have to be popped in quickly within 21 days and put in some gobbledegook parliamentary language at the back of our Order Paper in the hope that none of us will notice and it will slip through quietly.  Is it possible that the reason these quite extended powers are being requested is that the groundwork was not sufficiently done to head off unforeseen technical difficulties by those who put together this legislation?  Are we trying to protect the Minister if a problem arises and has not been attended to in the Bill and he does not want to come back to the House to amend the legislation?  We are giving him an out, a backdoor as it <Col N="1232" /> were, by way of the process he is now proposing.  Could that be the situation?</P>

      <P>It seems to me that we are talking about something that is a standard provision to allow the Minister to make the regulations.  This is nothing new.  It is there in many Acts.  In the knowledge that this legislation has been around for the past ten years, any Government could have brought it forward and ought to have done so.  The reality is that whatever Government were in power would have the section exactly as outlined in the Bill. It is done very positively and clearly to avoid any possible legal problems or as Senator Doyle said, any technical problems that may arise in the making of the regulations.  It is standard and should not be deleted.</P>

      <P>I am now convinced, on the basis of what Senator Fallon has just said, that we need to make an issue of this matter.  The Senator is right.  It is unfortunately becoming the standard process and no parliamentarian should be proud of that fact.  Not only that, but I saw an item of legislation on the Order Paper of the Dáil recently, an amending Bill to an old Act of 1928.  The amending Bill is for one reason only, is to change the affirmative process to the negative process.  What Senator Fallon says is absolutely right.  The Government now believe it is so important that they are bringing in, as they have put on the Order Paper of the Dáil, a Bill in that case to change the teacher's pensions or superannuation Bill of 1928.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has been brought in for one reason and one reason only, and that is to change the affirmative process which was the standard in the 1920s, to the standard of the 1980s.  This is a vitally important matter.  I know the Minister's and the Department's point of view.  It is awkward.  Do we have to go through all this difficulty?  Democracy was never easy.  The parliamentary system is inefficient and defective in many ways and it is seriously deficient in this regard.  If it is important enough to change the legislation then it should come before the <Col N="1233" /> House clearly, openly and where people understand what it is that they are approving.  I believe the Minister in his heart agrees with me on this point.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan, Limerick West) Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan, Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West):</i> This Bill seeks to address the necessity, in a maritime nation like ours, for coherent co-ordination of Government policy for the development of marine resources.  The promotion of the Marine Institute Bill marks another decisive step in putting in place the structures envisaged in the policy document entitled <i>Roinn na Mara</i>, published in 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the problems currently affecting the development of our maritime economy and marine resources can be attributed to the absence of a clearly defined policy, accompanied by a fragmentation of administrative structures. We want to get the structures right so that the latent marine potential of the <Col N="1235" /> State can be fully realised in everyone's interest.</P>
    <P>The urgent necessity for the right policies was acknowledged by the last Administration.  That Administration attempted to solve a number of the problems in the areas through the establishment of Roinn na Mara.</P>
    <P>In the 30 months since its inception, Roinn na Mara improved the administration of the marine sector and has sought to tackle some of the problems indicated in the seminal document <i>Roinn na Mara</i> to which I have referred.  These included, for example: wasteful utilisation of Government financial and human resources; demarcation overlaps in policy between Government Departments and agencies operating both within and outside the marine field; absence of forward development planning relating to existing established marine resources and those with development potential; lack of cohesion in approach to international maritime developments which impinge on national interests; inadequate investment in research and development.</P>
    <P>That is by way of background.  I would now like to focus on the particular issue at hand, which is the case for the Marine Institute indicated in the Bill now before this House.  The oceans are the last frontier, the least known part of our planet. They cover 70 per cent of its surface area, have been used by man from time immemorial to reach other continents and to supply him with food and other resources.  Yet it is only recently that their multifarious role has been fully comprehended.</P>
    <P>We cannot, however, exploit the tremendous resource potential of the oceans without knowledge of what is out there, without the capacity to measure these resources, having identified them, and without the capacity to develop the necessary related tools and instruments. We must, at the same time, ensure the protection of the environment in all its aspects.  It is in providing this information that marine research plays a vital role.</P>
    <P>The sea and seabed resources, and the technologies related to their exploitation, <Col N="1236" /> represent a new and important trend in economic and industrial development on a global scale.  In future decades, the resources of the sea will account for an increasing share of the world economy. Control of such resources and the ability to explore and exploit them, will play a significant part in the economic growth and development of many nations.  It also means that competition for the use of new resources will be intense.</P>
    <P>In the case of Ireland, the marine area constitutes a major but underdeveloped natural resource and offers significant opportunities in terms of wealth and employment creation for a broad range of industries.</P>
    <P>As an island nation every aspect of our daily lives is in some way influenced by the sea that surrounds us, whether it be the effect of the sea on our climate or the distance from mainland export markets. Yet, as a nation we do not perceive ourselves as a maritime people and worse, the sea continues to be regarded as a barrier to development rather than a natural resource to be utilised and developed for the benefit of the nation.</P>
    <P>Ireland's marine area is very large in comparison to that of other European nations.  In fact, the Irish Continental Shelf is unusually wide by international standards.  It covers an area many times the size of the national land territory.  It is likely that this vast area of the Continental Shelf contains tremendous resources.</P>
    <P>In order to capitalise on our marine and fisheries resources, it is essential that we measure these resources, understand how they behave and devise the most effective exploitation methods.  Only then can we systematically start to exploit these resources commercially.  The successful commercial development of all natural resources, whether they be marine or terrestrial, depends on a well co-ordinated, directed and supportive research and development effort.  Thus, the growing worldwide investment in marine science and technology arises from an awareness that the oceans can be one of mankind's major future sources <Col N="1237" /> of new food, energy, mineral and chemical supplies.</P>
    <P>Marine science and technology has a vital role to play in the understanding, identification, location and mapping of marine resources, with developing and supporting marine-related industries, and providing the fundamental information on which to base development strategies.  The lack of some of the most elementary knowledge of our marine environment and resource base is crucial. The Marine Institute will fill this gap providing the vehicle to promote the development of marine resources across a wide number of sectors, fisheries, aquaculture, non-living resources, marine engineering and electronics, etc.</P>
    <P>Ireland's investment in marine research and technology is small in European terms.  For example, our level of operation of research vessels is only a small fraction of that maintained by comparable small countries, such as the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway. Conversely, many foreign vessels conduct research in Irish waters.  This means that other European countries know more about certain aspects of Irish waters than we do ourselves.</P>
    <P>Our lack of knowledge of our marine environment means we are losing potential benefits and opportunities under a range of headings, which include: fishing, aquaculture, tourism and amenity, seabed resources together with spin-off industries such as marine equipment, offshore engineering, coastal engineering.</P>
    <P>Areas which currently need to be addressed include: the need for a source of economic analysis to assist Irish organisations in the marine area to seek out and optimise economic opportunities, and to assist them when they experience difficulties; the lack of a coherent marine research and development policy puts us at a disadvantage in the EC fora where we have the opportunity to ensure the inclusion of marine research and development in EC research support programmes such as the Fisheries and Aquaculture Research programme and the Marine Science and Technology programme. The scale and the variety of <Col N="1238" /> these needs and the related benefits add up to a convincing case for meeting the requirement for an early, rapid and wide-scale development of structures, mechanisms and programmes for marine and fisheries research and technology leading, in turn, to what could be a spectacular development of related national resources.</P>
    <P>A wide range of organisations is involved in marine research in Ireland. Many of these organisations are small and poorly equipped.  They are physically and institutionally separated from each other.  A fundamental problem is that the work of the various organisations is uncoordinated. There are both gaps and overlaps between Government Departments and agencies operating both in and outside the field.  In some areas, important programmes are not being undertaken at all.  Important research programmes in hydrography and oceanography are not being undertaken.</P>
    <P>The question of the delimitation of the Irish Continental Shelf is unresolved. Only through a co-ordinated administrative structure based on clearly defined policy, can we create the momentum necessary to attract technological and human resources to translate potential into reality.  Furthermore, many activities are sub-functions of Departments or sections of Departments whose main responsibilities are remote from marine or aquatic affairs.  Many of the research personnel involved are either civil servants who are inspectoral and have other duties, or university personnel again with other duties or on short-term contracts.  There is an inadequate professional corps of expertise devoted solely to research and mandated to liaise actively with the industry.</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that the present institutional structures for the conduct of marine research in Ireland are inadequate or inappropriate.  Lack of co-ordination is inhibiting the development of resources.  Furthermore, there is a strong need to clarify the relationships between the roles and responsibilities of the bodies already involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1239" /> Apart from fragmentation, a key consideration is that to be successful, scientific and technological activities have to become intensely discipline-related.  The success or failure of programmes will be dependent to a marked degree on the level of discipline-related communication and co-operation achieved.</P>
    <P>There is general agreement that the information dealing with the economic and social aspects of marine industries needs to be up-graded.  In particular, there is a considerable lack of information available on the stock levels of many species of fish in Irish waters, particularly on the &ldquo;non-traditional&rdquo; species which offer potential for development in the future &mdash; ling, megrim, turbot, brill, dogfish, monkfish and spart. Such information is vital if we are to achieve the objectives set out for the fishing industry in current Government policy.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a Marine Institute is as necessary now as it was in 1985 when the idea was first mooted.  Indeed, the urgency of establishing the Institute is, if anything, even greater now than it was then.  I believe that investigation of single aspects of marine science in isolation from one another is inefficient and ineffective.  Such investigation is also potentially dangerous in the sense that wrong decisions can result from incomplete information.</P>
    <P>If we look at the experience of other countries we see the development of a marked tendency in many of these to integrate previously separate marine and marine-related research operations. There are obvious administrative benefits to be derived from having all marine research and marine-related research co-ordinated by a single Marine Institute.  A centrally controlled approach is justifiable, and indeed desirable, on the grounds of administrative cost-effectiveness. A properly co-ordinated and effective organisational structure will provide authoritative technical input to resource development and, underpinning this, to the formulation of policy and <Col N="1240" /> programmes for marine and marine-related research.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a Marine Institute is, moreover, justifiable on grounds other than those related to administrative cost-effectiveness.  It is justifiable on the basis that the sea represents a national resource with development potential as yet only partially realised.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Marine Institute will result in real synergy and economy. It will seek to end the current disorganised, splintered approach to marine research, and eliminate the fragmentation of the marine research and marine-related research activities currently located in different Government Departments, State agencies, and other bodies.  It will ease the situation in which current research and technology programmes tend to become, of necessity, <i>ad hoc</i> and short-term.  It will work towards the provision of an adequate data base for all organisations and firms working in the marine area.</P>
    <P>In sum, there will be a major improvement in efficiency and technical input resulting from the conduct of all marine and marine-related research under a single direction mechanism which will, at the same time, take account of sectoral concerns and considerations.</P>
    <P>Externally, of course, the establishment of the Marine Institute will enable this country to compete more effectively with other countries by having an effective control of operations.  In particular, it will develop to the optimum the functions of co-ordinating Irish participation in European-related activities. This will not, of course, happen overnight. The Bill is the vehicle to enable a framework to be put in place within which we can seek to achieve the objectives which I have outlined.</P>
    <P>I would now like to address some of the particular issues in which I feel the institute, when established, will involve itself.  Opportunities for development of our main resources exist in: fisheries; aquaculture; non-living seabed resources; amenity/recreation; ocean engineering; marine electronics and instrumentation.  The successful and <Col N="1241" /> economic development of these activities requires the ability to identify and quantify potential resources and to develop the technology necessary to exploit them. In carrying out these developments it is vital to ensure that the marine environment is not damaged or polluted.</P>
    <P>The institute will further research in the areas of: living resources, including fish stocks, aquaculture and salmonid resources; non-living resources, including the delimitation of the Continental Shelf; oceanography and marine environmental studies; ocean engineering and electronics technology and would provide specialist services for marine research including computer facilities, research vessels and equipment.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> a projection was made of 2,000 new full-time and 2,000 new part-time jobs in the seafish industry in the period to 1991. The establishment of a Marine Institute was seen in the programme as an essential element in the development of the seafish industry and in the achievement of the projected targets.</P>
    <P>Our valuable fishing and fish farming resources must be exploited to best satisfy the requirements of the international marketplace.  International markets for seafood are generally buoyant and are likely to remain so.  Ireland, with the right products and marketing strategies, can gain a better foothold in these markets, building on the health image of seafood and the fact that Irish fish is produced in clear unpolluted waters.  To ensure development in this area, research is badly needed and this research will be provided by the Marine Institute.</P>
    <P>We must strengthen the industry supply base through the efficient exploitation of new fishing grounds and stocks and species which are currently under-exploited. An increase in the supply of fish as raw material for processing and greater continuity of supply are essential for further development.  Research is the key here and this research will be provided by the Marine Institute.</P>
    <P>We must improve the supply of our aquaculture products, by promoting the <Col N="1242" /> production of priority species, by encouraging research and development into new species and by achieving self-sufficiency in smolt and seed supplies.  Research into all these areas is vital.  This research will be provided by the Marine Institute.  The identification, quantification and exploitation of non-living marine resources depends on a detailed knowledge of the geological structure and evolution of the seabed.</P>
    <P>Under the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention, Ireland can extend its jurisdiction over an extensive Continental Shelf area.  The limits of the Irish Continental Shelf will require to be delineated. The definition of the Irish Shelf area will require a major investment, both in terms of shiptime and scientific effort.  Already there are a number of conflicting claimants for vast tracts of the shelf which experts consider should rightly belong to Ireland.  The areas under contention could amount to over 40 per cent of our Continental Shelf.  In order to ensure that the Irish claim to this area is vindicated, we will need access to the best scientific and technical data which, in turn, will involve conducting a major survey programme of these remote areas. Following the delineation of the limits and the surveying of the areas within those limits, further exploratory work will be required so as to underpin adequately the economic exploitation of these areas.</P>
    <P>Given our maritime status, we must look to the sea as a resource and develop opportunities in the other areas referred to: coastal engineering, electronics, instrumentation, amenity and environmental protection.  These activities are not only vital to our national development but, given that 71 per cent of the earth's surface is covered by the sea, are very marketable commodities worldwide.</P>
    <P>The Government recognised these problems and realised that the solution lay in the establishment of a Marine Institute. As a first step towards the establishment of such an institute, the Government considered the report of a Marine Science and Technology Task <Col N="1243" /> Force on the options for a Marine Institute. The task force, which consisted of representatives of Government Departments, other State bodies, universities, and private industry, considered the scope, size, structures, location and costing of a Marine Institute appropriate to national requirements.  As a basis for comparison, the task force considered what other maritime nations have achieved and how they have structured their research and technological activities.</P>
    <P>Options which were examined ranged from the simple co-ordination of various elements by means of a central liaising mechanism, through a Marine Institute within a university, to a new single agency.  The arguments emerged strongly in favour of the last of these.  Various models of a single agency were considered, such as an executive office, a limited company, or a State-sponsored agency.  The task force recommended the last of these.</P>
    <P>The Marine Institute will have the general function to undertake, co-ordinate, promote and assist in marine research and development.  The institute will provide services related to marine research and development that will promote economic development and create employment.</P>
    <P>The institute will, in particular provide advice on policy relating to marine research and development; carry out Government policy on marine research and development; undertake, develop, promote and market marine research and and development; undertake, develop, promote and market marine research and development services; promote and assist the improvement, development and application of technical and other processes for the exploitation and development of the marine resource; collect, maintain and disseminate information relating to marine matters; co-ordinate proposals for marine research and development requiring funding from the Exchequer or from any State-owned or controlled body; evaluate proposals for marine research and development requiring funding from the Exchequer or from any State-owned or controlled body; <Col N="1244" /> advise on proposals for marine research and development requiring funding from the Exchequer or from any State-owned or controlled body.</P>
    <P>The institute may in addition represent the State in European Community programmes of marine research and development; commission from other persons work to be carried out under the direction of the institute; enter into joint ventures so as to undertake or further the application of marine research and development; promote and organise seminars, conferences, lectures or demonstrations relating to marine research and development and engage in international activities in relation to marine research and development.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress that the intention is not to set up a new institute in the sense of a physical bricks and mortar structure.  Rather what is in mind is a new institutional arrangement.</P>
    <P>Thus, the Marine Institute &mdash; for the foreseeable future at any rate &mdash; will not be a single campus organisation.  This is not essential in the short- to mediumterm and in the present economic climate the construction of such a campus would be a waste of scarce financial resources.</P>
    <P>The component agencies making up the new institute will, for the most part, continue at their present locations but the overall direction and funding of their research programmes will be under the control of the Marine Institute.  Client Departments and other &ldquo;customers&rdquo; will retain an input to the institute's activities through representation at board level or on advisory committees of the institute.</P>
    <P>The institute will be governed by a board, which will consist of a chairman and eight ordinary members.  The members of the board will be appointed by virtue of their experience in fields of expertise relevant to the functions of the institute.</P>
    <P>Eleven State-funded organisations, with a staff of about 250 persons, are currently involved in marine research or marine-related research within the State. A number of these organisations are under the direct control of Government <Col N="1245" /> Departments.  Following the establishment of the institute, the persons involved may be transferred from their parent Departments to the Department of the Marine and thence to the Marine Institute.</P>
    <P>In the case of the organisations not under the direct control of Government Departments, these will be involved in the work of the institute through work commissioned from them.</P>
    <P>The institute will have a chief executive officer and a support staff to carry on and manage and control generally the administration and business of the institute.</P>
    <P>I consider it important that all funding which was previously allocated to marine research and marine-related research should continue to be so allocated, following the establishment of the institute. I would envisage that this funding will be allocated to the Marine Institute, and, through the institute, to the other State-funded organisations involved in marine research or marine-related research.  This allocation will be made in line with the priorities and work programme decided by the board, and approved by me. Because of the universally agreed priority attaching to marine research I envisage that the funding allocated to the Marine Institute, both from the Exchequer and EC sources, will increase in the future.</P>
    <P>I am in addition anxious that many of the institute's activities can be carried out on a commercial basis.  For example, diagnostic and advisory services provided by the institute could be charged for, if no fee is levied already.  The level of the fees charged would be a matter for the board of the institute to determine.</P>
    <P>The additional costs of establishing the Marine Institute are minimal.  Existing salaries and operational expenses of persons currently involved in marine research or marine-related research, and transferred to the Marine Institute will, as I mentioned before, be transferred to the Institute.</P>
    <P>Extra provision has been made in the Estimates of the Department of the Marine for the emoluments and expenses of the board, the salaries and expenses <Col N="1246" /> of the chief executive of the institute and his support staff, and for other miscellaneous expenses.  In relation to expenditure on marine research programmes proper during 1990, an earnest of the Government's commitment to this area is that the direct allocation to marine development contained in my Departments' Vote has been increased by 13 per cent from £800,000 to £900,000.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm go bhfuil Bille ag teacht ós ar gcomhair inniu. Foras na Mara atá mar ainm air, go hoifigiúil.  Ní thaitníonn an focal &lsquo;Foras&rsquo; liom, áfach.  Tá an &ldquo;Institiúid&rdquo; an-ghar don focal atá ann i mBéarla, agus measaim go gciallódh sé an rud céanna.  Thiocfadh le daoine a thuiscint gur Bille é seo a bhfuil baint aige leo féin, nuair d'fheicfidís &ldquo;Institiúid na Mara&rdquo; in áit &ldquo;Foras na Mara&rdquo;.

D'athdhéarfaidís an sean-nath arís &ldquo;Mair, a chapall, agus gheobhair féar,&rdquo; faoi mar ar caithedh leis an dtionscal an seo anuas tríd na blianta.</P>
    <P>Is nuair a smaoiním ar na hiarrachtaí misniúla a rinne eagraisí Stáit nár bhain le Roinn na Mara ná Roinn na hIascaireachta, a bhí ann roimhe, agus ar an ndeaobair a rinne siad d'fhonn tionscal na hiascaireachta a chur chun cinn, a thagann lear dóchais éigin chugamsa.  Ní de bharr imeachtaí Roinn na Mara nó Roinn <Col N="1248" /> na hIascaireachta roimhe seo atáim dóchasach. Ní foláir dom Údarás na Gaeltachta a lua, sa chéad áit, i gcomhthéacs an Bhille seo; ceannródaí ab ea an tUdarás i bhforbairt acmhainní na mara agus maidir le feirmeoireacht éisc.</P>
    <P>Nuair a thosaigh siad ar an bhfeimeoireacht éisc, breis is deich mbliana ó shin, thiar i gCuan Leitir Mealláin, i gCuan an Chaisín agus i gCuan an Mhuilinn, ní bhfuair siad tacaíocht ó institúid ar bith, ach a mhalairt.  Tá baint agam féin le bord an Údaráis le deich mbliana agus is cuimhin liom gur dúradh linn go minic éirí as an bhfeirmeoireacht éisc, mar go raibh sé ag ídiú iníomarca airgid.  Thuigeamar, áfach, mar bhord gur bhain feirmeoireacht éisc agus forbairt acmhainní nadúrtha na mara, go dlúth le muintir na Gaeltachta, muintir atá scaipthe ó Dhún na nGall, amach go Connamara, ó dheas go Ciarraí, gus timpeall an chósta chomh fada soir leis an Rinn.</P>

      <P>Thug mé Corcaigh isteach nuair a luaigh mé Oileán Chléire agus Caisleán an Bhéara ach ní raibh i gceist agam anseo ach áiteanna sa Ghaeltacht. Ní hé nach raibh baint ag Corcaigh leis an ábhar agus míneoidh mé é seo ar ball.  Sin é an dul chun cinn a dearnadh gan tacaíocht ó Roinn Stáit ar nós Roinn na Gaeltachta ná ó Roinn na Mara.  Dob é Údarás na Gaeltachta a dhein infheistiú sa tionscal seo, a chuir díon ar fáil, gan institúid ná foras a bheith ann, agus a chuaigh amach ag treabhadh an ghoirt, le go bhféadfaí forbairt a dhéanamh ar acmhainní nadúrtha an cheantair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nuair a chaitheadar a raibh acu d'airgead nach mór, le haghaidh forbairt eacnamúil, ar an dtionscnamh seo, tharraingíodar droch-cháil orthu féin, agus fágadh beo bocht iad, agus an rian sin orthu fós.  Is dóigh liom gur chóir do Roinn na hIascaireachta, Bord Iascaigh Mhara agus anois Roinn na Mara, a bheith freagrach as an bhforbairt seo, anuas tríd na blianta.  Ní mór dúinn a <Col N="1249" /> mheabhrú dúinn féin leis, nach infheistiú airgid amháin a bhí ar bun ag Údarás na Gaeltachta i bhfeirmeoireacht éisc ach taighde agus scrúdú chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Rinneadar taighde ar fheirmeoireacht éisc, ar thógáil bhradáin, ar thogáil bhric agus fiú ar shlioigéisc.  Bhunaigh siad comhlacht ar a baisteadh &ldquo;Taighde Mara&rdquo; agus is beag idir an chomhlacht sin agus aidhmeanna an Bhille seo, maidir le Institiúid nó Foras na Mara.  Chuireadar airgead nach beag isteach sa chomhlacht seo chun taighde cumasach inghlachta a chur chun cinn.  Bhunaigh siad comhlacht eile freisin ar a dtugtar &ldquo;Cabhair Eisc&rdquo;, a bhfuil baint mhór aige le slioigéisc bhunaigh siad 15 de fhiontar shlioigéisc bheaga thart faoi chósta Dhún na nGall. Tá siad seo bailithe le chéile in aonad amháin agus feirm shlioigéisc taispeántais acu, ina theannta sin, go bhfeicfeadh an saol a bhfuil ar bun acu agus cé mar atá ag éirí leo.</P>
    <P>Is é Údarás na Gaeltachta a rinne é seo.  Is eol dom gur chuireadar trialacha móra ar bun i gCiarraí agus triail eile in Oileán Chléire; tá obair dá leithéid ar siúl sa Rinn freisin.  Ní feasach domsa go ndearna aon eagraíocht Stáit eile an oiread taighde mara agus a rinne Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Fad a bhí an fhorbairt seo ar bun, ba nós le cláracha teilifíse a bheith ag gearradh na bputóga astu mar eagraíocht. Ní bhfuair siad aitheantas dá laghad ar son na hoibre bunúsaigh seo atá i gceist sa Bhille, ná níl sé luaite sa Bhille féin.  Níl fáil ar ainm an Údaráis ann, fiú.  Dob fhéidir a gcuid iarrachtaí a luadh gan a ainm a thabhairt dá mbeifí ag iarraidh an brat a choimeád ag foluain, go macánta, agus an rud a choimeád beo, rud nach raibh ar chumas Roinn na Mara ná Roinn na hIascaireachta, a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Is é an locht is mó atá agamsa ar an mBille seo ná go bhfuilimíd i mbaol dul ar ais sa sean-trap arís.  Bunófar an institiúd nua ar chomh-dheánamh Roinn na Mara, mar atá sé faoi láthair.  Is ar an ábhar sin a deirim go mbeadh iascairí na tíre ag rá ina thaobh &mdash;&ldquo;mair, a chapaill agus gheobhair féar&rdquo;.  Ag machnamh dúinn ar an infheistiú airgid a rinne Údarás na Gaeltachta i bhFanaid, Contae Dhún na nGall i gcúrsaí fheirmeoireacht éisc, agus <Col N="1250" /> ar an gorlann den scoth a tógadh istigh i measc na sléibhte, ná ligfimis i ndearmad go bhfuil an gorlann sin ag táirgeadh na milliúin éisc bheaga, ar a dtugaimid &ldquo;smolts&rdquo; in aghaidh na bliana.  Is le cúnamh an Údaráis a dearnadh an-chuid den obair agus den taighde seo.</P>
    <P>Ag teacht anuas go Gailleamh agus má bhreathnaíonn muid ar chomhlacht phríobháideach ar a dtugtar Carrolls Industries, agus ar an obair atá déanta acu siúd agus an infheistíocht atá déanta acu, agus go leor obair thaighde déanta acu i gcomhar le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta, tuigimid an iarracht fhánach lag a bhí á déanamh leis an dé a choimeád beo i gcúrsaí iascaireachta na tír é seo.  Ta an-chreidiúint ag dul do mhuintir Carrolls go bhfuil suas le £20 milliún infheistithe acu i gcúrsaí na mara le cúig nó sé de bhlianta anuas, agus go leor den infheistíocht déanta, agus ba obair thaighde é freisin.  Obair thaighde a cuireadh ar bun, mar shampla, leis an Bridgestone cage don chéad lá le haghaidh feirméireacht éisc.  Tháinig Carrolls agus chuir siad cineálacha cageachaí ar an margadh agus thriail siad amach ar go leor leor eile bealaí éagsúla leis an fheirméireacht éisc agus an tionscal seo a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Faoi láthair, mar shampla, tá go leor leor cainte agus go leor leor ráite faoi thruailliú, truailliú na dtránna nó truailliú na farraige de bharr fheirméireacht éisc. Tá rudaí speisialta ar a dtugtar Nulan, a úsáidtear le galair a bhíonn ar chraiceann na n-iasc a leigheas, agus deirtear go bhfuil sé sin contúirteach.  Ach an méid a úsáidtear, uimhir a haon, tá sé anbheag, ach uimhir a dó, tá Carrolls anois ag caitheamh go leor airgid ag déanamh fiosruithe agus ag déanamh taighde faoí seo.</P>
    <P>Sin institiúid nach institiúid Stáit é.  Sin institiúid nach mbaineann go bunúsach le Roinn na Mara.  Sin institiúid, mar shampla, go bhfuil £1.5 mhilliún infheistithe acu cheana féin ar phróiseáil éisc thiar i gConamara.  Tá an mhonarcha phróiseáil éisc is mó, agus is nua-aimseartha sa tír acu.  Arís, le cúnamh Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Agus muidne mar Údarás ag éirí níos boichte in aghaidh an lae de bharr an cúnamh seo a thabhairt.  Ach <Col N="1251" /> níor stop sé muid agus níor stop sé an tÚdarás as ucht an obair sin a dhéanamh. Rinne siad é agus tá siad an-sásta go ndearna siad an infheistíocht sin.  Nach aisteach go bhfuilimid ag caint ó thosaigh mé ar infheistíocht atá déanta ní ag Roinn na Mara, ní ag an Roinn Iascaireachta a bhí ann roimhe ach atá déanta go príomhdha ag Ranna Stáit nó fo-ranna eile.</P>
    <P>Sin an fáth go bhfuil fáitíos orm, agus fáitíos an-mhór, faoin mBille seo mar atá sé curtha os ár gcomhair.  Ba thrua liomsa, agus ba thrua le go leor daoine eile gur spéis leo tionscal na hiascaireachta a choinneáil beo agus fhorbairt, dá gcuirfí Bille tríd an Teach seo nach ndéanfadh leas don eagraíocht, leas do Roinn na Mara nó leas don tionscal.</P>
    <P>Tóg Carrolls féin arís, mar shampla, an comhlacht is nua-aimseartha ar domhan thiar i gConamara.  Níl mé cinnte faoin bhfigiúr airgid atá curtha ag obair ann, ach tá mé ag ceapadh go bhfuil thart ar cheithre mhilliún punt infheistithe ag Carrolls.  Tá ceann againn i bhFanad i nDún na nGall, chomh maith agus ceann a bhfuil an-cháil air freisin sa Daingean, nó taobh den Daingean.  Tá cinn eile bunaithe freisin timpeall an chósta sa Ghaeltacht, le cúnamh Údarás na Gaeltachta. Táimíd ag caint anseo faoi thaighde Fhoras na Mara, Institiúid na Mara, agus is é an príomhchúram a bheidh ar an mBille seo ná obair thaighde a thabhairt i gcrích, obair thaighde ar chuile chineál rud a bhainfeas leis an fharraige; mar atá ráite anseo, ní amháin an t-iasc féin, ach an calafort, turasóireacht, chuile shórt eile.  Ach is é an phríomhchúis atá la haon Bhille Mara ná tionscal na hiascaireachta a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Ar oileán beag amach as cósta na Gaillimhe, Inis Oírr, an t-oileán is lú de thrí Oileán Arann, áit a bhfuil cónaí ar 300 duine, tá comharchumann beag pobail a raibh sé de phribhléid agamsa bheith ag obair dóibh ar feadh ceithre bliana.  De bhunadh na n-oileán chuile dhuine atá ann, céad faoin gcéad Gaeltacht, an fharraige timpeall orthú agus fós féin níl cé acu.  Agus muid ag caint faoi fhoras agus faoi thaighde, is beag an taighde a theastódh le go bhféadfadh muintir Inis <Col N="1252" /> Oírr a chur amach ar an fharraige, ach céibh bheith acu, ó cheann ceann na bliana, Tá sé sa chaoi anois go bhfuil 88 gcuracha canbhais ar an oileán seo. Caithfear chuile cheann acu san a tharraingt aníos ar an chladach agus iad a chur i bhfastó sa gheimhreadh mar leis an stumpa de ché, atá acu níl aon fhoscadh acu da fiú amháin an bád beag ar a dtugtar half-decker.</P>
    <P>Muintir na Mara, nach iadsan, na daoine a ba chóir go mbeadh muid ag déanamh taighde ar a son.  Nach iadsan na daoine go mba chóir dúinn beith ag déanamh infheistíochta iontu.  Ach rinne an comharchumann beag sin, chuaigh siad amach, fuair siad ceadúnas ón Roinn Iascaigh ag an am, agus tá sé luaite istigh anseo freisin, na deacrachtaí uafásacha atá fós ann, ach a bhí ann an t-am sin, nuair a theastaigh ó chomhluadar mar sin ceadúnas a fháil.  Bhí siad ag plé, tá mé ag ceapadh, le cúig cinn de Rannóg Stáit.  Is beag nach raibh an leathar caite de na bróga againn ag traipséail thart ó Roinn go Roinn eile féachaint cén áit go mba chóir dúinn a bheith.</P>
    <P>Ní shin deireadh an scéil.  Thosnaigh siad ag caint faoi thaighde eile, faoi taighde agus theicneolaíochta ar an bhfairrge mhór &mdash; High Seas technology ag dul amach as na cuanta beaga.  Anois tá tionscal amach ó chósta Inis Oírr a bhfuil £2.5 mhilliún infheistithe ann.  Tá seisear de mhuintir an Oileáin ag obair ann, agus tá pleananna á réiteach ag an nóiméad seo faoi mhonarcha deatú a thógáil ar an oileán ag muintir an oileáin íad féin, agus a mbeidh seisear nó seachtar eile ag obair ann.  B'fhéidir go ndéarfadh na Seanadóirí céard is seisear nó seachtar, céard is cúigear ar an bhfairraige agus seisear istigh &mdash; níl ansin ach deichniúr na dhá dhuine dhéag.  Ach nach iontach an méadú é, ó minus go dhá dhuine dhéag lá ar bith?</P>
    <P>Ba oileán é nuair a chuaigh mise ann, nach raibh oiread is duine amháin fostaíthe ann ach mé féin, ag glacadh leis go raibh fear an phoist agus an máistir poist ag fáil iocaíocht.  Ní raibh aon Ghardaí, buíochas le Dia, níor theastaigh síad riamh.  Bhí bunscoil, agus tá meánscoil anois ar an oileán beag &mdash; sin de bharr <Col N="1253" /> na forbartha seo atá ar bun againn &mdash; an mheánscoil is lú sa tír.  Bhí ann pobal beo bríomhar, ach tá mé ag caint faoin taighde, an gníomh creidimh a rinne Údarás na Gaeltachta ag dul i mbun obair thaighde amach ó chósta an oileáin bhig sin ar son an phobail ansin.  Agus thaisteal muid an tír seo, ó Ghaillimh go Corcaigh go Baile Átha Cliath, ag iarraidh infheisteoírí Éireannacha a fháil chun obair a chur ann.</P>
    <P>Bhí an iomarca fiontair ag baint leis le go mbeadh infheistíocht Eireannach le cur ag obair ann, cé's móite de airgead Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Bíonn daoine ag caitheamh anuas agus ag rá: cé'n fáth nach bhfuil na hacmhainní seo á bhforbairt sibh féin?  Cén fáth go bhfuil na Norwegians istigh agaibh.  I gcás Inis Oírr is muidne a chuaigh amach, agus is muidne a thug cuireadh dóibh teacht isteach, mar nach raibh aon duine sa tír seo a bhí sásta infheistíocht a dhéanamh iontu.  Níl aon leithscéal agamsa faoi dhuine ar bith a bhí ag plé leis an oileán sin agus a rinne an obair sin i gcomhar le Údarás na Gaeltachta a mhúin taighde.</P>
    <P>Dream eile a rinne an-obair anseo agus nach mbaineann le Roinn na Mara, an Bord Soláthair Leictreachais.  Ní chóir dúinn dearmad a dhéanamh orthu siúd. Bhíodar san, chomh maith le hUdarás na Gaeltachta ina gceannródaithe ar fheilméireacht éisc, agus go deimhin an chéad tógra fheilméireacht éisc a bhí ann, bhí comhfhiontar ann, ceapaim, idir Údarás na Gaeltachta agus an Bord Soláthair Leictreachais.  Chuaigh siadsan ar aghaidh, agus rinneadar an obair, taighde, infheistíocht agus anois tá siad láidir agus a chónach sin orthu.</P>
    <P>Tá amhras orm faoin Bhille seo, mar anuas tríd na blianta, na daoine a bhí ag déanamh an taighde agus an obair seo go léir, ní fheicim go bhfuil moráin baint acu leis an Bille seo atá molta nó tugtha duínn.  Tá suas le 750 duine fostaithe lán aimseartha sna Gaeltachtaí.  Agus nuair a deirim na Gaeltachtaí nílim ag rá nach bhfuil aíteanna eile ag plé le hiascaireacht, ach tá mé ag caint go mór mhór ar an tionscal nua, áit a bhfuil taighde ag teastáil, sé sin taighde agus institiúid leis an rud a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1254" /> Níl aon áit, dar liomsa, níos mó ná an Ghaeltacht go bhfuil an obair sin tosnaithe, bunaithe agus ag dul ar aghaidh ann.  Má thagann sibh ar na calafoirt timpeall na tíre seo, na 15 is mó, tá seacht gcinn acu sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá Ros a' Mhíl, Alt a' Chorráin, an Daingean, Achill, Helvick agus Carna &mdash; tá siadsan sa Ghaeltacht. Tá Ros a' Mhíl ar cheann den cúig cinn is mó sa tír.</P>
    <P>Má chaithaimíd ár súile ó thuaidh go dtí na Cealla Beaga, go dtí an &ldquo;Atlantic Challenger&rdquo; atá ceangailte suas le cé anocht agus nach bhfuil cead acu dul amach ag iascaireacht.  Feiceann muid an faillí atá déanta ó thaobh taighde, anuas tríd na blianta a fhágann sa chaoi agus sa riocht sin iad tráthnóna.  Níl ceadaithe ag an tír seo faoin Chomhphobal, ach 69,000 tonna ronnach a iascach.  Is é sin beagnach 70,000 tonna.  Má bhreathnaímíd trasna na farraige go dtí an Bhreatain Mhór nó go hAlbain, mar is as Albain atá an t-iascaireacht seo á dhéanamh, tá cead beagnach 200,000 tonna ronnach ceadaithe aca siúd.  Rud atá níos íontaí fós, tá beagnach an oiread céanna bád againne is atá acu in Albain &mdash; 70,000 i gcoibhneas le 200,000, tá trí oiread cuóta ansin.  Tá go leor de na báid ag plé le cóstaí na tíre. Ní mór d'úinéir &ldquo;Atlantic Challenger&rdquo;, mar shampla, láimhdeachas £2 mhilliún in aghaidh na bliana á dhéanamh le go mbeadh sé in ann aisíoc a dhéanamh ar na hiasachtaí móra airgid arbh éigean dó a fháil le dul sa bhfiontar seo agus bíonn air suas le £600,000 a aisióc in aghaidh na bliana.  Rinne sé go mór ar an fharraige, agus dhéanfadh sé, agus daoine mar é, i bhfad Éireann níos fearr dá mbeadh an obair bhaile déanta ag an tír seo anuas tríd na blianta.  Dá mbeadh an taighde déanta acu a bhfuilimid ag caint faoina dhéanamh anois, agus a raibh caint ann faoi deich nó scór de bhlianta ó shin.</P>
    <P>Fiú amháin ón am gur fógraíodh é trí bliana ó shin, go dtí an lá atá inniu ann, tá trí bliana eile caite, agus de réir mar a fheicimse an Bille seo agus an chaoi ina bhfuil sé leagtha amach, beidh scór bliain eile caite agus ní bheidh foras nó institiúid taighde againn ach in ainm.  Mar shampla, bhí mé ag caint faoi thaighde. Rinne lucht an &ldquo;Atlantic Challenger&rdquo;<Col N="1255" /> taighde freisin leis an gcineál báid mhóir atá acu, ach iad féin faoi ndear dul amach agus rud éigin a dhéanamh dóibh.  Ní raibh aon institiúid ga bhféadfaí iarraidh orthu cá raibh a leithéid seo d'iasc, nó an raibh aon rud nua faighte amach acu a chuideodh leo, an mbeadh siad in ann dul ag iascach ina leithéid seo d'áit, an bhfuil sé seo nó siúd ann?</P>
    <P>Sin an cineál eolais agus cúnaimh atá le fáil ag iascairí i dtíortha eile.  Tabharfaidh mé sampla beag leis an taighde atá déanta ag an Atlantic Challenger a thaispeáint. Argentine, cineál éisc, nó cineál nua atá faighte acu iad féin de bharr dul amach agus é a thriail.  Fuair siad £40,000 punt mar dheontas taighde ó FEOGA na hEorpa, £80,000 ar fad leis an taighde seo a dhéanamh.  Amach leo agus rinne siad an taighde agus d'éirigh leo teacht ar an gcineál seo éisc.  Agus iad á dhéanamh, rinne siad dochar don treallamh agus do na heangachaí agus chuile shórt a bhain leis an gcineál sin oibre.  Chosnaigh sé breis agus £70,000 de dhamáiste orthu tar éis an taighde a dhéanamh.  Fós féin, dá mbeadh an cuóta sin le fáil agus é roinnte amach inniu, chuile sheans gur ar an ngannchuid a bheadh muidne fágtha sa tír seo.  Sin obair thaighde atá déanta.</P>
    <P>Tá eacnamaíocht Dhún na nGall beagnach uilig bunaithe ar eacnamaíocht na farraige.  Tá sé bunaithe ar dhul chun cinn na hiascaireachta: an méid monarchana próiseála atá ann, monarchana eile atá ann, agus an calafort agus na báid sna Cealla Beaga.  Tá chuile shórt i gcontúirt acu anois, agus bhí le blianta, ceal taighde. Tá fáitíos orm go bhfuilimid ag iarraidh doras an stábla a dhúnadh tar éis don chapall a bheith imithe.  Tugadh an chluas bhodhar anuas thar na blianta.  Bhí na comharthaí ann.  Bhí an dea-thoil ann. Bhí an spiorad ann.</P>
    <P>Ba cheannródaithe Údarás na Gaeltachta agus Bord Soláthair an Leictreachais, agus dreamanna eile, a raibh an obair déanta acu.  Níor tugadh ar bord an cúnamh sin, agus níor deineadh tada leis an rud seo a chur chun cinn.  Deirtear faoi thionscal na hiascaireachta sa tír seo faoi láthair nach bhfuil sé 20 faoin gcéad éifeachtach. Seachtó go leith a deirtear an <Col N="1256" /> éifeacht atá ag baint le cúrsaí iascaireachta sa tír seo.  Cuir é sin i gcomparáid leis an Ísealtír agus áiteacha a bhfuil na báid acu, tá siadsan 90 faoin gcéad éifeachtach agus chun tosaigh.  Tá báid níos fearr acu, tá seirbhís níos fearr á tabhairt do na báid.  Agus rud amháin, dar liomsa, atá níos tábhachtaí fós ná iad uilig, tá cluas acu sa Bhruiséal.  Sin áit gur theip ar an tír seo le blianta fada anuas, nach raibh cluas againn san áit cheart, nach bhfuil an lobbying system sách laidir againn sa Bhruiséal agus atá ag tíortha eile, agus a chónach sin orainn.  Táimid fágtha dá réir ar an ngannchuid.</P>
    <P>Tóg cúrsaí oideachais: mura bhfuil oideachas ar mhuintir na hÉireann agus muintir na tíre agus iascairí, agus iad ag dul ag plé le forbairt acmhainní nádúrtha na farraige, beidh thiar orthu.  Ag seasamh amach mar lóchrann nó mar chineál réaltógaí beaga sa spéir sna hiarrachtaí seo anuas thar na blianta, tá Ollscoil Chorcaí agus Ollscoil na Gaillimhe.  Sna blianta deireanacha seo, tá na coláistí réigiúnacha i nGaillimh, Trá Lí agus Leitir Ceanann.  Tá iarrachtaí á ndéanamh agus tá an dea-thoil ann.  Agus tá a fhios ag an Rialtas é, agus ag chuile Rialtas riamh, ach arís, an seanscéal, mair, a chapaill, agus gheobhair féar.</P>
    <P>Amárach, an tseachtain seo chugainn, an mhí seo chugainn, an bhliain seo chugainn agus, tá fáitíos orm anois, an céad seo chugainn &mdash; sin é scéal na hiascaireachta. Sin é an chaoi a bhfuil sé ag dul. Murach Ollscoil na Gaillimhe, Ollscoil Chorcaí go fadtéarmach, agus na coláistí réigiúnacha go gearrthéarmach, ní bheadh dé ar bith fágtha ionainn.  Táimid ag caint faoi thaighde.  Anois, céard iad na deiseanna agus céard é an cúnamh atá faighte ag na hollscoileanna sin agus ag na heagraíochtaí Stáit sin thar na blianta &mdash; pingneacha suaracha.  Níl fearas acu, níl deis acu agus ní raibh, agus leis an chaoi a bhfuil an rud seo ag dul anois, ni bheidh ach oiread.</P>
    <P>Níl sé ach cúpla mí ó d'fhógair Ollscoil Chorcaí go raibh post ag dul sa roinn atá acu.  Níl mé róchinnte dén stadas atá ag an roinn ach ar ndóigh beidh an Seanadóir Murphy in ann é a léiriú dúinn ar ball. Chuir siadsan fógra ar an bpáipéar ag <Col N="1257" /> iarraidh duine le dul i mbun taighde i gCorcaigh.  Tá a fhios agam go pearsanta faoí thriúr a tháinig abhaile, duine ó Vancouver, duine ó Atlanta agus duine ón Bhreatain Bheag.  Agus mé ag cainnt leo siúd le linn dóibh bheith sa mbaile caithfidh mé a rá go raibh éadochas orm, agus sin é fáth mo éadochais anseo anocht.</P>
    <P>Luaigh siad, mar shampla, an deis atá sna hollscoileanna atá ag plé le taighde: Corcaigh, Gaillimh, agus na hInstitiúdí eile freisin, ach nuair a chonaic siad céard a bhí le tairiscint dóibh ag an Stát seo nó ag an ollscoil dá bhfaighidís an job ar phláta, ní thógfaidís é.  D'imigh siad leo arís, ar ais go Vancouver ar ais go Atlanta.  Mar a dúirt siad, dá mba thaighde é sin sa tír seo, go raibh an cluiche caillte, agus sin dhá ollscoil as a mbealach féin, atá ag íarraidh an taighde a dhéanamh ar son an tionscail seo.</P>
    <P>Sin an meas atá ag triúr Éireannach dála an scéil a chuaigh trí ollscoil na Gaillimhe agus an bhain amach céim onóracha B.Sc. ag plé léis an cineál seo oibre, agus d'imigh ó seo go Vancouver agus áiteanna eile agus a bhain amach Ph.D agus go raibh fonn orthu teacht abhaile agus a gcuid scileanna a chur ag obair sa tír seo, agus gan tada ann rompu ach an béal bocht agus &ldquo;mair, a chapaill, agus gheobhair féar&rdquo; intinn.</P>
    <P>Níl sé i bhfad ó shin bhí seimineár breá mór fada san ostán Corrib Coast i gConamara, agus is é an idea a bhí ann ag daoine as Ollscoil Atlanta arís, ná go gcuirfí fundúireacht ar fáil ón airgead tras-teorainn agus áiteanna eile, le daoine a chur amach go hAtlanta agus go háiteanna eile mar sin, le céim doctúireachta a dhéanamh, Ph.Ds a dhéanamh amuigh ann, agus é ar intinn go dtiocfadh siad ar ais don tír seo arís.  Níl mé in aghaidh daoine ag dul thar lear dála an scéil, rud maith é, rud íontach, ach níl mé ach ag léiriú díbh cé comh bocht is atá an cheist seo sa tír.</P>
    <P>Ní fheicim an leigheas sa Bhille mar atá sé rianaithe anseo.  Tá scoileanna dara leibhéal i gConamara.  Is mó eolas atá agam ar an áit sin na áit ar bith eile sa Cheathrú Rua, tá Scoil Chuimsitheach. Tá scoil phobail i gCarna, scoil dara leibhéal i Ros Muc, scoil phobail sa Clochán, <Col N="1258" /> scoil phobail in Indreabhán, meánscoil sa Spidéal agus iad uilig ag plé le hoideachais den tarna leibhéal.  Téigh isteach in aon cheann de na scoileanna sin, agus fiafraigh díobh cé mhéid duine atá ag plé le acmhainn nadúrtha na farraige ó thaobh ábhair de chineál ar bith, ar bhealach ar bith.  Tá mé ionann is bheith cinnte gur neamhní a bheadh agat.  Nach léiríonn sin dúinn freisin ár dtreo agus ár nintinn i leith taighde, agus i leith daoine a chur ar an eolas faoin chaoi a bhfuilimid ag dul.</P>
    <P>Tá obair an-mhór déanta ag na hinstitiúidí tríú leibhéal ag Litir Ceanainn, Gaillimh agus Trá Lí, arís ar thada ach an oiread leis an dá ollscoil.  Is féidir dul amach taobh thiar de Charna áit a chuir Ollscoil na Gaillimhe ionad taighde ar bun.  Tá an tOllamh Ó Céidigh ansin &mdash; fear íontach go bhfuil an oiread sin eolais aige, agus obair déanta aige as a bhealach féin &mdash; agus an Dr. Mercier atá anois le blíanta amuigh i gCarna.  B'fhiú do Sheanadóirí, don Aire agus do dhuine ar bith atá bainteach leis an Bhille seo, dul siar go bhfeicfidís an t-ionad taighde atá i gCarna.  Is mór an náire é.  Is mór an náire go bhfuil baint ag an Stát leis.  Mar a deir na lads thiar &ldquo;tá sé starváilte&rdquo;; tá sé ar an n-gannchuid; níl pingin sa kitty le pá seachtainiúil a thabhairt dóibh.  Téann daoine isteach doras amháin agus amach an doras eile.  Níl aon bhuanadas, níl aon seilbh ann, níl aon spiorad ann agus cén chaoi a bhfeadfadh sé bheith ann nuair nach bhfuil tada, curtha ar fáil, nuair nár chuir an Stáit seo airgead cuimsitheach ar fáil leis an acmhainn nadúrtha is mó atá againn sa tír seo a fhorbairt, sé sin acmhainn na farraige.</P>
    <P>Níl mé ag dul ag tosnú ag caint faoin chaoi in a bhfuil na bóithre, ach a rá libh go bhfuil áit amháin thiar i gConamara, an tArd Mhór a tugtar air, Ard na hAirde.  Tá tionscnamh breá mór thíos ansin.  Is cúl-bhóthar é ag dul síos ag an fharraige.  Is ann atá an £1.5 mhilliún caite ag Carrolls le monarcha den scoth a chur ann.  Níl aon leoraí in ann dul síos ann agus sin lom na fírinne.  Níl aon carr in ann dul síos ann.</P>

      <P>Caithfear gach rud a rá istigh anseo.  Táimid á rá anseo agus níl duine ar bith ag tabhairt aird orainn. Mura ndéarfar é, ní thabharfar aird ar bith orainn, ach tá seans ann má deirtear é sách minic, i ndeireadh na fríde go mb'fhéidir go dtarlódh rud éigin.  I gcead duit &mdash; agus tá baint ag céibheanna leis &mdash; cén mhaith taighde farraige mura bhfuil céibh agat?  Cén taighde atá déanta agus atá i gceist a dhéanamh anseo faoi na céibheannaí uilig a bhfuil gá linn iad a thabhairt suas go dtí an caighdeán ceart? Ó thaobh taighde de, caithfimid comparáid a dhéanamh le tíortha eile.</P>
      <P>Tá áiteanna gur thug mé féin cuairt orthu, gar do Vancouver, agus do Seattle agus in Atlanta, agus stáisiún taighde in Albain, agus sa Danmhairg.  Nuair a fheicim an obair atá déanta ansin anuas tríd na blianta agus an obair atá le déanamh nílimid ach ag caint faoi fós.  Níl aon rud déanta.  Mar shampla, tá an Scottish Marine Biologists Association ann, English Marine Biologists Association ann, Ollscoil Aberdeen agus Ollscoil Stirling. Feicimid ansin má táimíd ag íarraidh eolais, agus cúnamh faoi thaighde.  Tá aithne agam ar scoláirí atá imithe as an tír seo, agus atá ag imeacht anois go Aberdeen agus go Stirling ag iarraidh eolais agus taighde a dhéanamh, nuair nach bhfuil an seans acu é a dhéanamh sa mbaile.  Buíochas le Dia ar a laghad ar bith go bhfuil siad in ann é sin a dheánamh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá institiúid sa bhFrainc a bunaíodh, tá mé ag ceapadh, i 1984.  Sé an fáth go bhfuil mé ag luadh seo, ná dá dtabharfaí <Col N="1260" /> aird agud dá ndeánfaí staideár ar an chaoi a bhfuil na h-institiúidí seo bunaithe d'fhéadfaí Bille ceart a bheith againn.  Is eagraíocht phoiblíochta an institiúid seo, by the way, atá curtha le chéile ag lucht trádála agus tionsclaíochta faoi bhrat an Roinn Oideachais agus Roinn na Mara sa bhFrainc.  Cuireadh Seanadóirí an comhdhéanamh atá ansin i gcomparáid leis an méid atá anseo agus feicfidh siad céard faoi a bhfuil mé ag caint agus cén fáth.  Is taighde bunúsach atá anseo ag an eagraíocht seo sa bhFrainc le chuile shórt a bhaineann leis an fharraige.  Is é sin staidéar a dhéanamh, agus níos tábhachtaí fós ná staidéar, gníomhú dá réir. Tá an eite atá istigh ansin leis an lucht tionscail agus trádála bainteach leis.  Fir ghnótha, comhlachtaí gnótha, istigh mar chuid den eagraíocht phoiblí is mó taighde atá sa bhFrainc.  Sin an cineál Bille nó foras nó institiúid a ba chóir bheith á phlé againn anseo, ní an rud atá idir an dá leathanach anseo, mar níl ann, mar a fheicimse é agus mar a bheas mé á mhíniú don Seanad ach píosa de Roinn na Mara caite amach idtraipéisí i leataobh agus gan tada eile i gceist ann.  Le go mbeadh an Bille seo éifeachtach, caithfear an-bhéim go deo a chur ar thaighde, ar thaighde speisialta go mór faoi shloigéisc.</P>
    <P>Tá cuid mhaith taighde déanta ar fheilméireacht eisc ar an bhFarraige Mhór faoin am seo.  Ba chóir dúinn anois, agus ba chóir go mbeadh sé luaite istigh ansin ní go ginearálta ach go speisialta, in aon Bhille céard é atá romhainn, céard iad na spriocanna atá le baint amach againn. Tá mé ag caint faoi chuanta mara an abilónia, diúlicíní, an gliomach, agus go ndéanfaí taighde ar an gcineál sin sliogéisc.</P>
    <P>Tóg cúnta mara mar shampla, ceann den na sóláistí is mó gur féidir a dhíol ar mhargadh éisc na Fraince faoí láthair. Ceárd tá déanta ag Roinn na Mara ag an Roinn Iascaigh, ag an fhorás stáit, Bord Iascaigh Mhara nó éinne eile, anuas trid na blianta, leis an tionscal seo a chur chun cinn.  An té a ghabhfadh amach go dtí na hOileáin Árainn, d'fheicfeadh sé ní na céadta, ná ní na mílte agus ní na milliúin, ach na billiúin de ábhar cúnta mara timpeall <Col N="1261" /> cóstaí na dtrí oileán.  Cén taighde a deineadh len iad a thabhairt uaidh seo, áit nach bhfuil aon bhealach fás acu?</P>
    <P>Inseoidh mé do Sheanadóirí cad a tharla: iascairí bochta Inis Oírr, triúr nó ceathrar acu, nach bhfuair pingin ón Stát ná cúnamh ar bith, nach bhfuil cé ná bád ceart acu, bhain siad na céadta de chúnta mara ar an dtaobh den oileán atá oscailte do na gaoithe móra agus don Fharraige Mhór agus d-athphlandáil siad iad, iad féin.  Seo ceart-bhrí le taighde, agus ní raibh aon ghá le Bille mór institiúide le bheith ann in a aghaidh.  Thógadar féin iad amach as na háiteanna fiáine sin, chuir siad i gceantair ar an dtaobh thoir den oileán, áit a bhfuil foscadh, agus thugadar beatha dóibh.  Nach iontach é beatha, feamainn?  Tá siad fásta anois.  Sin an méid atá acu, agus beidh siad á ndíol idir seo agus an Nollaig ar mhargaí na Fraince.  Tá socrú speisialta déanta acu le Aer Árainn len iad a thabhairt i dtír dóibh, mar nach bhfuil aon tseirbhís acu, níl aon ché acu, níl aon bhád acu, níl aon bhóthar.</P>
    <P>Má deireann an Seanadóir Murphy liomsa nó le haon duine, nach bhfuil siad san tábhachtach i leith an Bhille seo, caithfidh sé dul, dar liomsa, agus scrúdú a dhéanamh air.  Maidir le taighde caithfear gach rud a bheith ann, agus i gceart ann. Sin sampla amháin d'obair.  Cén cúnamh a fuair siad?  Tada.  Údarás na Gaeltachta, ba mhaith leo cinnte, agus thugadar roinnt eolais dóibh agus mar sin de.</P>
    <P>I dtaobh an abilónia, na diúlicíní, na gliomaigh, agus cuile shórt a bhaineann leo, táimid ag caint faoi go leor thaighde a d'fhéadfadh bheith déanta agus nach bhfuil déanta.  Earraí beaga simplí iad agus ní fheicim luaite sa Bhille seo beag ná mór an cineál taighde seo, rud a chuir iontas ar fad orm.  Níl caint ar bith faoi fhás feamainne, mar shampla.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil dul amú orm.  Ní fhaca mise luaite é nó ní fhaca mé é faoi na fó-theidil atá ann.  Fás feamainne nach é beatha na farraige é don éisc cois chladaigh agus timpeall air?  Na heolaithe a chum an Bille seo, níl sé luaite fiú amháin.</P>
    <P>Chuaigh an ceathrar lads céanna ón Iris Oírr an bhliain seo caite ar a gcostas féin go dtí Oileán Mhánainn, the Isle of <Col N="1262" /> Man.  Nuair a bhíonn tusa nó mise ag dul ann bíonn muid ag dul ar saoire, agus bíonn am deas againn cois chladaigh.  Ach chuala siad san faoi bheirt ceimí ollscoile go bhfuil PhD acu, go rabhadar san ag déanamh taighde faoí fhás feamainne ar leith agus fuair siad amach go raibh an fheamainn sin, an cineál céanna ag fás thart ar an oileáin.  Chuaigh siad go bhfaca siad len gcuid súl féin an fheiliméireacht feamainne a bhí ar bun ann. Chualamar faoi fheiliméireacht éisc. Anois tá ceann nua ann, feiliméireacht feamainne, agus gur féidir feamainn a fhás faoi staidéar agus faoi chuile shórt a bheith i gceart ann, agus go bhféadfaí é a bhaint agus é a thriomú agus é a úsáid mar bheatha agus mar rudaí atá níos tábhachtaí freisin don chuid den tréith a bhaineas le heolaíocht.  Arís, níl sé luaite ann, sin feamainn, sin slata mara.</P>
    <P>Dár ndóigh, cad é an taighde a rinne an tír seo anuas thar na blianta nuair a bhí an deis acu, faoi fhás carraigín. Chuaigh mé féin beagnach scór bliain ó shin go Nova Scotia ag breathnú ar an gcaoi a raibh sé á fhás.  Agus bhí siad tosaithe an t-am sin ag feilmiú carraigín. Tháinig mé abhaile le mo chuid smaointe agus d'inis mé do na daoine faoi ach níor deineadh tada faoi riamh.  Chaill muid an bád.  Bhí an dea-intinn ann, bhí an deis ann, bhí an spiorad ann.  Bhí daoine a bhí sásta dul i mbun taighde.  Ní raibh siad ag caint faoi Bhille-thaighde nó institiúid nó tada ach amháin bhí siad ag dul á fhás go nádúrtha, ach maraíodh é.  Tá an Bille an-lochtach.  Is cur i gcéill atá sa mBille mar níor thug an Rialtas aghaidh ar an mBille seo i gceart, agus níor éist siad, agus ní dheachaigh siad i gcomhairle.</P>
    <P>Feicim go raibh comhairle faighte acu ó institiúidí éagsúla.  Cad é an chomhairle a ghlac siad ó mhuintir Inis Oírr, mar shampla, nó aon mhuintir eile ar an talamh a bhí ag saothrú na farraige as allas a gcnámha?  Tá siad ag aistriú sa mBille seo cuid de Roinn na Mara go Foras na Mara.  Tá siad ag dul ag tógáil phíosa bhig de Roinn na Mara agus d'fhostaithe atá cheana féin i Roinn na Mara agus á gcur isteach le dream eile agus ag rá: &ldquo;Anois is sibhse Institiúid na <Col N="1263" /> Mara&rdquo;.  Ainmneoidh an tAire ochtar agus cathaoirleach mar chineál coiste chomhairligh, gan neamhspleáchas ar bith acu. Ní Bille ar bith é sin.  B'fhearr gan aon Bhille ná a leithéid sin a bheith ann.  Ní dhéanfaidh sé aon mhaith.  Comhairle amháin a bheidh ann, in áit foras nó institiúid cheart mhara ann, agus bainteach leis sin go mbeadh iascairí, feilméaraí mara, iadsan atá ag obair amuigh, lá i ndiaidh lae agus geimhreadh i ndiaidh geimhridh, agus ag plé leis seo ar an talamh.</P>
    <P>Sin iad na daoine go mba chóir dúinn a bheith ag glacadh comhairle uathu agus iad a bheith mar chuid d'aon institiúid atá le bunú.  Dár ndóigh, bheadh áit ann, agus ní mór go mbeadh, do gheolaíocht, nó gheolaithe, mar go bhfuil an scil sin ag teastáil.  Ba cheart go mbeadh baint ag na hinstitiúidí, go háirithe béaloideas, Ollscoil Chorcaí, Ollscoil na Gaillimhe agus na trí choláistí réigiúnacha atá luaite agam, Leitir Ceanann, Gaillimh agus Trá Lí.  Thar aon rud eile, ba chóir go mbeadh baint ag eagraíochtaí forbartha atá ag plé leis seo cheana féin.  Mar atá léirithe agam, Údarás na Gaeltachta, BIM, Ionad Taighde Charna, agus na hollscoileanna, sin iad na daoine, sin é an Foras, sin í an Institiúid.</P>
    <P>Ó thaobh ceannárais de, tá sé ráite anseo tagann an chuid is milse ar far den Bhille seo ag an deireadh &mdash; ní bheidh aon, mar a deirtear i mBéarla, single campus ann.  Is ionann sin agus a rá, agus tá sé ráite fiú amháin anseo, níl sé i gceist ag an Rialtas aon phingin a chaitheamh ar cheannáras.  Ag dinnéar Chomharchumann Iascairí Arann dhá bhliain ó shin, thug an tiar-Aire, an Teachta Daly, gealltanas agus tuiscint go mbeadh sé lonnaithe i nGaillimh.  Fiú amháin bunaíodh coiste, ar iarratas an Rialtais, idir Údarás na Gaeltachta, Galway Chamber agus UCG le dul i mbun na hoibre sin. Níl tada cloiste faoi ó shin, agus anois táimid ag cloisteail anseo nach mbeidh aon cheannáras ann.  I Meastacháin na bliana seo níl ann ach £30,000 sa bhreis le h-ais Mheastacháin na bliana seo caite le caitheamh ar an institiúid seo.  Má thaispeáineann sé sin an leibhéal dáiríreachta <Col N="1264" /> atá ann ag an Rialtas, b'fhearr gan é a bheith ann ar chor ar bith.</P>
    <P>Bhí sé neamhspleách agus ní bheidh sé neamhspleách.  D'fhéadfainn leanúint go maidin.  Ní minic a fhaigheann duine deis labhairt ar an ábhar seo ag an leibhéal seo, agus tá díomá orm faoin gcineál Bille atá curtha os ár gcomhair.  Mar níl fiacla ann, níl spiorad ann, níl sé fadradharcach. Tá sé bunaithe ar an sean rud a bhí ann i gcónaí, agus tá sé ar ais arís go dtí an sean syndrome a bhí ann, mair, a chapaill, agus gheobhair féar.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Stáit ar dtús agus mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis toisc gur chuir sé an Bille seo os ár gcomhair sa Seanad.</P>
      <P>I welcome wholeheartedly the establishment of the Marine Institute, to bring together under one authority all the resources of the State involved in marine research and broaden their activities to areas that are possibly neglected at present.  The commitment to establish Foras na Mara was given in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  I am delighted the Minister for the Marine has initiated this Bill in Seanad Éireann and I thank him for that.  I know there are many areas which this Bill could cover and will cover, but my main concern, being a fisherman, is naturally fishing.</P>
      <P>I think I am the only fisherman ever elected to either House of the Oireachtas and as a fisherman I would like to put on record my sincere thanks over the years to all the people involved in lifesaving around our coasts.  I say that on behalf of the fishermen and all the seagoing people in order to thank the lifeboat men, the people in the VHF radio stations, our lighthouse keepers and, of course, the helicopter service.</P>

      <P>The proposer has 30 minutes and 15 minutes to reply at the end of the debate and all other Senators have 15 minutes.  The overall time is three hours.</P>
      <P>Before the debate commences I would remind Senators that it is a long standing ruling of this House that the manner in which the Dáil proceedings are conducted and its business cannot be commented on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That was an innocuous statement of some moment.</P>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to initiate reform of the Oireachtas by the establishment of a Committee of the Dáil and Seanad to recommend changes in the role, structure, function, procedures and operation of the Dáil, the Seanad and the Joint Committees of both Houses. That the report of this Committee including all recommendations on reform be debated in both Houses before 1st June, 1990.  I would like the record to note that this debate and motion has been taken by the Leader of the House and that we are taking it without the Minister.  I want to say that I heartily approve of this development. Whereas other people might be less than satisfied with it, I have long been of the view in terms of the initiation and move towards reform of the Houses that the position of Leader of the House is one whose status has not been recognised over the years and it is important that we recognise the essential qualities of that particular job.  I also hope that in his contribution the Leader of the House will take on board very seriously the proposals being made here tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In preparing for this debate I gave some thought about how it might be developed.  On numerous occasions previously we considered all the faults and it would be easy to trot out all the faults and flaws at this time and make a very impassioned appeal for change. However, what I intend doing in the main is to make a few general comments and <Col N="1266" /> then focus on the workings of this House in particular.</P>
    <P>I would also like a ruling on the question of the Presidency.  The Independent group have long held the view that the role, area and function of the Presidency is something that should be open to much wider discussion and does come under the jurisdiction of the motion.  You have made a ruling, Sir &mdash; at least you have indicated the traditional response in dealing with the other House.  But could I ask that the position of the Presidency be clarified, because I think it would be very one-sided to have a debate without considering all aspects of the Oireactas. Whereas I do not intend to discuss the workings of the other House, I certainly intend to have some comments to make on the relevancy and function of the Presidency and the way the role is seen to operate.  Is that in order?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the office of the President can be referred to in the overall context of Oireachtas reform.  No personal reference, of course, may be made to the President.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I do not intend to make any personal references at all.  I just want to establish the position that the Oireachtas comprises both Houses and the President and that therefore the role of the Presidency, which people may not have adverted to, is encompassed in the understanding of this motion and to say that people look at the first two aspects of legislation, the initiation in the Seanad or Dáil, then the confirmation in the second House and finally, the signing by the President.</P>
      <P>As an opening remark I believe that the legislative and parliamentary process is in disrepute, without question that the legislative and parliamentary process is ineffective and inefficient and that it is longwinded and cumbersome.  I believe that every single day we contribute further and more to the low regard the general public have for politicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe we are the authors of our own misfortune in this area for a number of years.  First, there is our resistance to <Col N="1267" /> change of any type and, secondly, our cowardice when it comes to selling, explaining and developing the role of politicians in a serious way.  It has now reached a stage that the system does not have the confidence of the people, who do not trust politicians any longer.  More importantly, it attracts too many people who have been failures in other walks of life.  I think it would detract greatly from this debate if Senators come back very defensive on this.  I do not want to hear about a string of people who are highly effective, etc.  I include myself in all these references.</P>
    <P>You can go into any sixth year class in any college in this country tomorrow morning and ask the students for their choice of career and find our how many of them would be interested in a political career.  You would be lucky to find one out of 100 who might have an interest in it and that one person would probably have some family connections and know something the others do not.  There is no attraction in it.  It is a job which carries little respect, a specious kind of status, low income and it comprises a group of people who have made themselves dogsbodies and doormats for the community and who have taken less than seriously the core and central function of their role and office, which office never seems to get the attention it deserves.  If people feel a great need to defend themselves on this issue then they are missing the whole point of what I am saying.</P>
    <P>To me the role of politician falls into four parts.  There are the national issues, there are the international issues, there are legislative matters and there are individual case problems.  The good and effective politician, in establishing good practice, will share his or her energy and time over those four areas.  We have, unfortunately, now reached a stage where clientelism has overtaken all else. We have some very talented people in both Houses spinning around like tops at the weekends from one clinic to another, dealing with one set of problems in one area, bringing them on to another, mixing <Col N="1268" /> them all up and hoping they come out at the end.</P>
    <P>People in both Houses instead of spending more time on legislation, on addressing topical problems, on looking at national and international issues, are far more often spending their time looking for medical cards, putting a new light outside the back door or a bit of tar up at the front door for people in their constituencies.  That is the way we elect to operate.  If the first rule of politics is to become re-elected, perhaps it is the system we need to look at.  It cannot be good.</P>
    <P>The other point I want to make as a general nature is that poiticians are a joke, but the real truth is that the electorate are a bigger joke.  The people who keep electing representatives on the basis of clientelism are doing this country less than a service.  The Members of the Houses who encourage and support clientelism are doing nothing to advance the work of politics, the work of the Oireachtas.  All parties, of course, are agreed on the general points.  They might not put them quite like I put them, but all parties would agree and every Member of both Houses that I know would agree that these clinics and this case work is boring, should not be necessary and is only necessary because it is the only way to be re-elected.</P>
    <P>Can we grasp the nettle?  It is not an issue for me in the same way as it is for other Members of the Houses; but it is clearly wrong and everyone agrees it is wrong.  There is the nonsense of three or four TDs being present on Friday night, Saturday, Sunday and Monday in different pubs in the same village and then the people with the problems moving up from one to the other, bringing their problems to the whole lot of them.  Then all four local representatives send a letter to the Minister of the Department, get back a response in triplicate and they all send the same response to the person concerned.  Everybody feels that everybody is working but nothing is really happening except that there are people clogging up the mail system and the clinic system with this business.  It is not good <Col N="1269" /> enough and it should be addressed.  It should be addressed for the sake of the sanity of our politicians.</P>
    <P>I want to look at the Seanad and to examine very deliberately the role of the Seanad.  I want to make points which need to be addressed and I would look for a reasoned response from the Leader of the House on the issue.  I do not want any kind of a defensive response.  I do not need to be told of the time, energy and commitment of the Leader of the House and many other Members on the Government benches.</P>
    <P>The discussion here tonight has got nothing to do with inter-party rivalry or group rivalry or anything else.  I will be offering my views and we should all honestly offer our own views.  There is no threat to the Government in the matter. I am simply asking in my proposal that the Government set up a committee to look at the workings of the Oireachtas and to come back with proposals which we can adopt or throw out.  It is hardly life-threatening or Government-threatening. I see no reason why the Government could not accept that point.</P>
    <P>If I say that undoubtedly the Seanad is to a large extent unrepresentative and that it is certainly undemocratically elected, do we feel threatened by that statement?  Do we accept it as a reality? Have we the honesty to say perhaps we are afraid to change it because it would threaten our position?  But it is undemocratically elected and to a large extent it is unrepresentative.  That is not the fault of anybody in this Chamber.  Nobody sitting in this Chamber should have the great need to address it.  I look forward particularly to hearing the views of our colleagues, the Progressive Democrats, on this matter.  They have raised an issue, but clouded an issue at the same time.</P>
    <P>If I am to develop my argument on the fact of the Seanad being to a large extent unrepresentative and to a large extent undemocratically elected, I immediately get to the stage where it becomes difficult to develop that argument and, at the same time, to defend the retention of the second Chamber.  The fact that this is a difficulty merely illustrates the fact that <Col N="1270" /> the case for reforming the Seanad has long ago got lost in or confused with the call for its abolition.  This is the great problem we face.  An honest discussion on the difficulties gets confused with people who, without any thought-out process on the matter, call for the abolition of the second Chamber.</P>
    <P>The party who would say abolish the Seanad, halve the number of TDs and save the country a packet, are making a very popular cry really for the unthinking. It will go down well in any pub tonight but where does it lead to?  If you go down to a pub tonight and say &ldquo;We will abolish income tax&rdquo; you get a round of applause &mdash; the politicians are going to propose the abolition of income tax. It is about as logical as people who are depending on social welfare having stickers on their car saying &ldquo;Abolish tax&rdquo;. Where does it lead?  The abolition of the Dáil would be the next logical step towards reduced democratic powers on the road to dictatorship.  The proposal for reduced representation and reduced participation in the democratic process is no more than the polished rhetoric and specious argument from the &ldquo;Regressive&rdquo; Democrats.  There can be not the slightest doubt about it.  It is a very popular thing to say &ldquo;Get rid of half the TDs, close the Seanad, save the country a packet&rdquo;.  Why do we need people at all. Let us put one person in to run the country.  Let us put in a dictator and it would save us even more money.</P>
    <P>The cost of the Seanad, for instance, is part of the price we pay for our democratic structures but counting the cost is hardly the way to measure the effectiveness of our Legislature; rather we should demand that it does the business. That is the demand we should make of it.  It is efficient?  Is it effective?  Is it doing the job?</P>
    <P>It is difficult to measure in any precise way the effectiveness of either House. Though in recent years the Seanad has dealt with a greater volume of business than ever before and though it usually sits to a later date and reassembles earlier than the Dáil, nonetheless the Seanad is regularly criticised, for instance, as being <Col N="1271" /> unnecessary and dormant.  Why?  What do we do when the House is not in session? Where do we go to when the House is not sitting?  Are we working?  Do we need to justify the number of days the House sits?  Can we justify the number of days the House sits?  I believe we cannot. We should not attempt to defend it.</P>
    <P>I have been examining recently the number of days we have sat over the past number of years and I know the Seanad now sits and operates far longer hours and a greater number of days than ever it did before.  That goes without saying. I am not making that point and I do not need to hear a response.  All I am saying is that for effective parliamentarians to do the business they should sit on a regular basis with a regular day's work, regular periods of holidays and it should certainly be a lot longer than what it is at the moment.  I am talking about the day's sitting there.</P>
    <P>I want to put a little aguisín with that one.  I want to put it clearly on the record that the level of salary for parliamentarians is disgracefully low.  I have seen a yellow streak in most my parliamentary colleagues who have been afraid to say that they are all suffering from collapsing overdrafts, because of the low level of wages that are paid to the parliamentarians, particularly in this House.  The pay and the conditions of work and the back-up system for parliamentarians is disgraceful.  A research service means pushing in on top of the librarians, the excellent librarians we have here, who are already overworked, and trying to demand more from them. There is no research service here.  There is no access to information technology in this House.  There is no proper communications link-up for any of the people in either of the Houses.  The restricted secretarial service is laughable.  I believe if the people who are expecting the Houses to do their business knew the conditions under which parliamentarians are supposed to work, the low level of resources, of back-up support and of research support, they would be appalled.  It is impossible to do the job <Col N="1272" /> we set out to do with the level of resources now available.  We should say that loudly and clearly and stop beating about the bush.</P>
    <P>The lack of recognition from which the Seanad suffers is due to a combination, I believe, of our own innate introvertedness, our unimaginative ordering of business and, consequently, our low level of media coverage.  It amuses me to hear the criticisms of the media about the coverage of the Seanad.  I leave here some days and I wonder how in the name of God the reporters can dream up a story out of some of the dull activities which I have had to sit through for the day.  That is the truth of the matter.  If we want interesting coverage, we better had deal with interesting topics.  In the past four weeks with the ordering of business we have dealt with probably a wider range of more interesting and more topical issues than we have ever done before.  The different debates on international matters on Thursday mornings and various legislation, have been useful and progressive. We need to look at some of the proposals we have discussed time and time again, such as the idea of an hour for debating topical matters.  It is not a very strong base on which to make a case to look for greater media coverage while refusing to deal with interesting confrontational issues.</P>
    <P>There is also a general lack of understanding about the role and function of the Seanad.  People are unaware that legislation can be initiated in either House and, with the exception of financial Bills, that the Seanad has the same legislative powers as the Dáil.  The Seanad would certainly be the ideal forum to undertake an urgently needed major review and revision of the general body of Irish legislation, much of which has been ignored for well over a century.</P>
    <P>I have started a very interesting process at present of going back over old legislation. Some of the material we have uncovered is frightening.  I have come up recently &mdash; and I have it on the Order Paper at present &mdash; with the fact that education at secondary level is something which may be made available to girls <Col N="1273" /> at the convenience of the Minister for Education.  What kind of sexist language is that in this day and age?  Everybody would disagee with it but it is there in the Statute Book.  I just give it as an example of the kind of legislative revision which needs to be done.  It will never be done in the other Chamber in the sense they will always be dealing with topical issues. I believe that this Chamber in Committee, combing through the old legislation, could point out the anomalies, the anachronisms, the incompatabilities that exist in some legislation that is still on the Statute Book from another century.</P>
    <P>It is the legislative area that the Seanad has the greatest potential.  The Seanad debates tend to be comprehensive, detailed and searching.  Legislation is likely to get far more attention in the Seanad than in the Dáil.  A smaller number of constituency clinics and consequently, less of the drudgery attaching to constituency servicing should allow Senators to give more time to the business of the House, especially legislation. Nevertheless, any objective examination of the structure, operation and procedures of the Seanad will point up the need for reform.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties we have in the Seanad is dealing with problems.  I have an ongoing problem myself at present with being totally misrepresented in this House last week.  I am not going to go into the details of it but where every member of the Government group believed that I agreed to something which was never ever mentioned to me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will go back on that.  I have no way of dealing with my grievance on that issue except to cause a disturbance in the House, which should not be the way.  I have no clear process in which to deal with it.  I am not going to develop that issue.  One of the problems we run into here quite regularly is the fact of a lack of understanding of the problems of different groups.  We on the Independent benches would be perhaps <Col N="1274" /> among the other groups and least popular. In many ways we are seen as troublemakers or people who seem to be destructive or whatever.</P>

      <P>It is grossly misinformed. There is no doubt about it that outside the House there is a completely different perception.  I would just like to say that. It is very important.  The Seanad must be seen as a necessary and integral part of our democratic structure.  How is it put together?  Let us look at the system, the election of the 60 people here.  I will start off with our own group, the Independent group, all of whom are elected by the university franchise.  Let us put the record right about them.  It is the most exclusive, elitist corner that I could find myself in. I know myself and, as far as I know, all of my colleagues find it a very uncomfortable place to be.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I dislike the exclusivity that attaches to such a restrictive franchise but at the same time, I want to put it in the context of democracy and representation.  Approximately one-tenth of people go on to third level education. It would be quite appropriate, if the House was structured in another way, that that one-tenth could elect one-tenth of the second Chamber.  I would see nothing wrong with that in the context of reform.  The fact of the matter is that the electorate of the six people here in these <Col N="1275" /> seats numbers roughly 100,000.  The electorate for all the others numbers less than 1,000.</P>
      <P>We have 100,000 people to elect six Members and we have 900 people to elect 43 Members.  This is hardly the stuff of democracy, hardly the stuff of fair representation.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the 43 Members, made up of a number of panels.  My own claim to fame would be a claim of expertise in the area of education and the education world and in the area of trade unionism and labour.  Therefore, the appropriate places for me to seek election to the Seanad would be either on the Education or Labour panels.  I would say, with all due humility, that I would know as much about either of those as any of the people who have sought election on those panels but the nature of the election process excludes me from ever having a chance of being elected on those two panels, in the subjects of which I have years of experience and expertise.  Would the Leader of the House be prepared to grasp the nettle, stand up and say &ldquo;Well, as it stands, each panel is divided into two sub-panels&rdquo;.  At the moment the people who elect the Members from each sub-panel are the county councillors and urban councillors, local representatives around the country.</P>
      <P>I want to make one comment on that, and perhaps I disagree with some of my colleagues on this.  I have the greatest respect and regard for local representatives throughout the country.  I recognise their commitment, their work and what they put into their job.  I will defend them at any time and I would not have the slightest difficulty about doing that. Neither do I object to them having&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Well the percentage of ineffectual local representatives is no greater than the number of ineffective representatives in the parliamentary system.  I would defend them to that extent.  I would say they have a right to <Col N="1276" /> have a vote but what they do not have a right to do &mdash; and surely it was never envisaged under the Constitution &mdash; is that they should elect all 43 Members. Why not extend the franchise on all the panels?  Why not say, for example, on the agricultural panel, that one of the subpanels would be elected by the local representatives and the other sub-panel would be elected by people involved in the industry or the area denominated by the panel, in other words, representatives of agricultural interests?  Why could we not do the same with the Labour Panel; have one sub-panel elected by the local representatives and the other sub-panel elected by offering the franchise to the different groups under that heading?  In the case of Labour I suppose it would be the employers and the trade union representative groups.  Why could we not do the same with the education panel, extend the franchise on one of the subpanels at least to people involved in education?  The interests are clear.  The client interest would be represented by the parents, the worker interest would be represented by the teachers and the management interest would be represented by management.</P>
      <P>Why cannot these interests have a vote instead of the nonsense that goes on at the moment where certain education interests or labour interests can propose people to stand for Seanad election but, having been proposed, they can only be elected by people who are predominantly party-political members and, no matter how good they are at their job, they can only get elected if they get the nod from the party.  I do not recall when the last Independent was elected on panel apart from the university panels.  I am talking about extending the franchise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also put firmly on the record my view that the franchise at this end should also be extended in case anybody would think I am guarding the corner for myself.  At whatever cost or loss to myself, I see no reason whatsoever why the graduates of any third level college should be excluded from voting for the representatives from what is now called the universities panel which I would like <Col N="1277" /> to have renominated the third level panel if it is going to continue in existence.  I do not see why we should distinguish between one third level college and another.  The mystique that attaches to the type of university needs to be shattered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not get parochial about this.  I will save the other areas I wanted to deal with for my final 15 minutes at the end of the debate.  The Seanad as a Chamber should never be allowed to pervert the will of the people as established by the Lower House.  That may not find favour with some people in the House but I have a very clear view in my mind of the role of a second Chamber and it is not to pervert the role of the first Chamber.  It is there as a supplementary, as an overview, to strengthen the role of democracy, to broaden the level of debate.  Incidentally, if we had had a proper role for the Seanad we would not have had the rod licence cock-up.  Debate on that legislation finished in the Dáil on 17 December 1987.  It came here and was pushed through in one day.  My view is that when debate on a piece of legislation is concluded in one Chamber a précis of the Bill should be published and available for people to study before the debate on it begins in the second Chamber.  There should then be an informed discussion in the second Chamber because, unfortunately, people believe that legislation is too remote from them and are not actually aware of the implications of the legislation as it is going through.  It takes time for people to become aware and it is only then that they can properly address the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I now call on Senator Murphy to second the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I do not propose to take very long.  As I read it, the purpose of the motion is to persuade the House to set up an Oireachtas committee.  I do not believe it is appropriate then at this stage, <Col N="1278" /> to address in great detail the matter of parliamentary reform.  Rather the things to stress are the reasons we should now set up this Oireachtas committee which would report back to both Houses and then the substantive debate could take place at that stage.</P>
      <P>In case Senator O'Toole gave the impression that some of the things he said were not shared by the rest of us, I share his admiration for people in public life generally.  I have always conveyed to my students, whenever I could, that the life of a politician is an honourable one and should be an honourable one.  If we, in this part of the House, enjoy the freedom and flexibility of Independents it is because of the existence of party politics. Independents in their own right would make no sense at all.</P>
      <P>Our task tonight is to agree, if possible, that this Oireachtas committee should be set up.  All of us in this House might not admit it publicly but in private all of us would admit that we do stand in need of reform, and that the Oireachtas does not have a good image and that it is in our own enlightened self-interest to improve that image, not least in an era of street politics and people power.  Let us not think that we are totally immune from that confrontation.  Modern parliaments, not just here but everywhere in western democracies, have been downgraded by the existence and the development of other strong forces in society, extra parliamentary groups of various kinds, and in our own case here the tradition of strong Cabinet Government which, unfortunately, we inherited from the British and which was aggravated by the circumstances of the Civil War and the polarisation of party politics, treating Parliament more or less as a rubber stamp.  Then, of course, there is the existence of the European Parliament and the strong probability that it will grow in power and that power will be at the expense of the State parliaments.  For all these reasons we should try to do the best we can for ourselves and give ourselves the best possible image and reputation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not always the case that the Oireachtas was destined to be in the <Col N="1279" /> second place.  When the State was founded the first Dáil saw itself as superior to and as dominating its Executive and certainly the Constitution of the Free State envisaged a Dáil which would be dominant.  That was not the way things evolved but it is interesting that in the last Oireachtas, Dáil Éireann recovered some of that stature.  Because of the particular disposition of party forces within the Dáil, it began to restore its authority and dignity as against the domination of Cabinet Government.</P>
    <P>In the last Oireachtas we debated in some detail the question of Seanad reform and I had a lot to say about it then.  I am not going into it again.  Senator O'Toole has touched on some of these points.  The whole question of Oireachtas reform hangs together: both Houses must be reformed.  I know there is a certain limitation on talking about Dáil procedures during the course of this debate but surely I cannot be prevented from making the observation that if Dáil Éireann did its work properly in the legislative sphere, if Deputies were primarily legislators, then that would be an enormous step forward.</P>
    <P>It might well, of course, make this House redundant because the one agrument one can make against the existence of Seanad Éireann is that if there was a one Chamber Parliament doing its work properly it is arguable that a second Chamber is not necessary.  What we have at the moment is a multi-seat constituency system where as Senator O'Toole said, the Deputies attend to business other than legislation and who see their existence in terms of constituency service.  All very well as far as it goes but not when it deludes the public into thinking that Deputies are there in order to get them favours.</P>
    <P>What we are talking about here is not simply Oireachtas reform.  We are talking about public education as well.  The public must be educated to know they have rights independent of the intercession of Deputies.  It is not surprising that over the years Deputies have not looked too kindly on the existence of such <Col N="1280" /> offices as the Ombudsman and of such movements as the Combat Poverty Agency because all of these developments seem to muscle in on what Deputies wrongly regard as their area.  I will say no more about that.</P>
    <P>I will come back to our own House and say, as I said on opening day, that in my view, the image of this House has never been worse.  The image of flagrant opportunism being pursued by politicians was very evident to the public in the course of the summer.  I never received the kind of letters I received this time from would-be Senators who asked me, for God's sake, to return them to the Seanad so that they could win a seat for Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour in the Dáil the next time round.  The naked opportunism went that far.</P>
    <P>It was compounded, of course, by the Taoiseach's inactivity in the course of the summer and by the extraordinary <i>volte face</i> on the part of the Progressive Democrats. I do not mind a <i>volte face</i> but what I do mind is the absence of any explanation by the leader of that party as to why at one period he wanted to abolish Seanad Éireann but now he found it convenient to allow his members to sit here. He left the unconvincing explanation to the junior Minister at the Department of the Environment.  It is a reproach on the Leader of the Progressive Democrats that he never made a policy statement in that connection.</P>
    <P>Of course, what really made the image of Seanad Éireann sink in people's eyes in the past few months was the appointment of the Cathaoirleach.  The Cathaoirleach has had a colourful career, a controversial career.  He is a man of great personal quality but it has to be said that his appointment did bring Seanad Éireann into disrepute.  This was a wide observation one heard everywhere.  It has to be said that the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party made a very grave mistake in allowing his name to go forward.  This has to do with the image of the House and the question of reform.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not casting any aspersions on the person of the office holder.  What I am saying is that the question of reform is certainly bound up with what the public perceive to be the use of the Chair in order to retrieve a political career.  Surely I can say that not even the shadow of suspicion of past irregularities should attach to any would-be holder of high office, not least to one of the high offices of State.  I do not think the Cathaoirleach should have even been considered by his party for promotion to this high office.</P>
      <P>We need to consider all the implications of reform and I was glad to see that on opening day Senator Manning more or less told us that nothing would be excluded from consideration when it came to Seanad reform.  He seemed to suggest, for example, that the Fine Gael Party would consider the question of recommending the holding of Seanad and Dáil elections on the same day which would very definitely cut through that whole area of the cynical misuse of this House as a path back to the Dáil.  I hope Senator Manning meant that and I hope his Fine Gael colleagues will support it.</P>
      <P>However, I have some reservations about that.  I know that a former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, had a strong interest in Seanad reform.  As the only Taoiseach, I think I am correct in saying, who began his career in this House, he had a particular interest in Seanad reform but it never came to anything, perhaps because he was too busy otherwise but I suspect partly because there were strong vested interests in his own party against Seanad reform because such reform would diminish the area of party patronage.  Let us see if Senator Manning will put his money where his mouth is in the course of this debate and in supporting the motion.</P>

    <P>This is a good motion.  It has teeth to it.  It challenges Government and the other parties to set up this Oireachtas joint committee.  Let us do that.  Let us <Col N="1282" /> see what the outcome will be.  It is not the first time this has been tried.  It has been tried before and nothing came of these efforts to initiate parliamentary reform but let us make a fresh start.  As I say, the time is opportune.  We will not forever be allowed to sit in an unreformed condition.  The time is opportune because it is at the outset of what promises to be a longish parliamentary span.  Let the parties show their good faith and their commitment by backing this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>We should read the wording of this motion and see if it has gone too far.  It reads:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to initiate reform of the Oireachtas by the establishment of a Committee of the Dáil and the Seanad to recommend changes in the role...</P>
      <P>I wonder have we that kind of right or power?  I think if we reform &mdash; if reform is needed &mdash; we should do it for this House itself.  That might well be sufficient. I would say to my friends on the Independent benches that if we operate the Seanad well, as it is, with some reform, and leave the Dáil to reform itself, if that is necessary, we would be doing a good day's work.</P>
      <P>I suppose to initiate reform with commonsense would be a good thing but only if it would make the Seanad more relevant to the people of this nation.  I listened with interest to the way Senator O'Toole would like future Seanad elected.  I have no trouble at all in supporting the way the Seanad is elected at the moment and I do not consider we are not representative of the people of this nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole stated that while his electorate were thousands of past graduates of universities, ours were only 900 people.  That, of course, is totally wrong. Many of us who have been elected were Members of the outgoing Seanad or were Deputies and if they are not representative of the Irish people I certainly do not know who is.  They elect us, they reelect us and if we serve well and they are <Col N="1283" /> quite aware of what we are doing we are returned to this House.  I believe we play a more important role in this country than we are given credit for.</P>
    <P>In the past Senator Murphy has put on record my commitment to this House.  I have never gone into another convention even though I had an opportunity to do so.  Without having a big head because that is not my style, if I had decided to go for a seat in another place I would have won it but my commitment to the Seanad is absolute and total.</P>
    <P>It is important to put on record that 50 per cent of all legislation that went through the two Houses of the Oireachtas in the last session commenced here.  As Cathaoirleach I spent quite a considerable time in the Chamber at that time, more time then than I do now, and I saw Ministers prepared to amend legislation here.  I saw Bills go out of here after weeks of debate and common-sense discussion.  The other good thing I see about the Seanad, which might differ from the Dáil, is that we do not have to play party politics here.  I say that with the greatest respect to the Dáil.  You rarely hear in this House &ldquo;party stuff&rdquo; being lashed out.  There is room for change but I fear change just for the sake of change.  We should enhance the role of the Seanad as a legislature in its own right.</P>
    <P>There are a number of proposals which address themselves; for instance, a basic structure underlining revision in the area of detailed consideration of a Bill, where the present Committee Stage would be taken before the consideration of the general principle of the Bill, the present Second Stage.  This would allow for a much broader debate and would give greater scope to amend the measure than would be the case under current procedure. Power to amend is confined to details and not to the principle of the Bill.  We should allow for a broader debate and greater scope for amendments on Committee Stage in all legislation, particularly in non-money Bills coming from the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether a committee as <Col N="1284" /> proposed in this motion, is the answer to what we want in Seanad Éireann.  Is it we here or is it somebody else somewhere else, who would decide on reform or how much reform and what would be good for the House or for future Seanaid?  We saw the Seanad work here today when the Cathaoirleach allowed a motion under Standing Order 29 to be taken on an urgent matter.  We have to decide what we want in this House.</P>
    <P>There was criticism today of Members such as the Leader of the House and myself, of Senator Hederman and Senator Staunton, all people elected to local authorities, of what we do with our time in serving the people who elect us to local government.  It would be a sad day for this nation if we and our colleagues who serve in local government stopped serving the people with commitment and dedication.  This goes back to the people who elect us here on various panels and if Senator O'Toole has worries that some of us are not eligible for the panel or if we are not doing our duty I suggest to him to come on to one of our panels the next time and see if he will make it there.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that it was in the Seanad in 1981 that the broadcasting of the Seanad live on radio was mooted first and at that time there was not so much support for the idea.  I remember quite clearly that I attended the first meeting. That move has been a total success and that was initiatied by a committee of the Seanad.  I can take criticism and I can accept criticism of the Seanad when it is right but I will defend this House while I serve it in and long after I leave it.  We all play our part.  We are representative of the country.  I remember the former Senator Killilea, who is now an MEP, speaking very strongly and quite heatedly one night on how he felt about people elected to the Seanad and the support we have from the people who elect us.  They are the people who go into the ballot boxes at local government elections and they are the people of cities, towns and villages who elect people to local authorities, the Dáil and Seanad.  Who is representative of Ireland if they are not?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1285" /> We are close to the people when we sit on local government bodies, or health boards and VECs.  What is wrong with listening to complaints and doing a certain amount of constituency work?  I suggest that we should use this House as a forum to get close to our electorate.  I would suggest we might consider giving a forum in this House to the MEPs.  Perhaps it is something that might be considered in another place.  It might be desirable for them to come back and report to the people who elect them.  I am not adverse to changing my views on anything that would be good for this House or the people of this country.  I think most of us would not consider this House to be so far removed from the people as was suggested by some Members in the House.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong if we were to give the impression that there is no respect in the country for people who serve in public life.  We should give a lead and encourage people who might serve.  It is not an easy life.  We should be the last to knock each other.  We should unite and try to be seen by the nation that we serve as committed people, which we are, definite about what we are doing, which I hope we are, and try to hold the respect which the people have for us.  We should stop knocking each other and knocking this House.</P>
    <P>The motion gives us a chance to defend the Seanad.  I have done it privately, I have done it publicly and I will continue to do it.  I do not see myself as not playing a role.  While I am glad the motion is before us, because of the wording, I do not think I can support it.  However, that does not mean I do not agree with some of the words that are included in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the oportunity to speak on this motion which I support.  In doing so I would like to thank the Leader of the House for facilitating the motion and for his attitude in agreeing to a system of open debate in the Seanad. I hope this continues and that we can deal with many issues, be they controversial or not, because that will bring credit to this Chamber.  I am also glad there is no Minister present because I do not regard <Col N="1286" /> this issue in any sense as a party political issue.  I do not see it as Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or Progressive Democrats issue in the least.  We should have a common purpose where these issues are concerned and for that reason I am delighted there is no Minister present.</P>
      <P>I spent the best part of ten years as a Member of both Houses, about half of that time in the Dáil and half in the Seanad.  In so far as my involvement in the national Parliament is concerned, there was a very long gap of about ten years and suddenly I find myself back in this House.  I suppose I bring a certain amount of experience and detachment to this debate because I have had experience for a number of years in both Houses and I have been out of the system for ten years looking in.  Maybe it gives me an interesting little window and insight into certain issues.</P>
      <P>I am a reformist.  I am all for reform. One of the reasons I was not contesting elections for a number of years was because of the extent of my dissatisfaction with some of the structures. I am saying it in the most non-political sense.  I believe that outside this House where public opinion is concerned there is some admiration for the Members who serve in both Houses of the Oireachtas. There is a basic healthy fundamental admiration but there is a most appalling regard for the institutions in which we work and for the <i>modus operandi</i> which forces us to work as we do.  To that extent there is huge scope for reform.</P>
      <P>One of the huge paradoxes in the country is that we have been dominated by Britain for about 700 years; we achieved independence in 1921-1922 and having achieved independence we proceeded to base our parliamentary model on the Westminister system and to copy most of their institutions in the bureaucracy. These structures have been virtually unchanged since 1922.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What have we seen happen?  Outside the Houses of the Oireachtas we have seen a massive Civil Service develop; we have seen a huge sector of the public economy in the State-sponsored body <Col N="1287" /> sector; we have seen massive involvement in the European Community with change in the whole legislative basis under which we are operating.  We have seen the development of non-commercial State-sponsored bodies, of which there are 57, spending about £800 million each year.  While all of this is happening there has been virtually no revision of the basic Houses of the Oireachtas which are supposed to run this enormous system and control all of these issues, including the European dimension.  It is a very archaic structure.</P>
    <P>The first issues I have to talk about &mdash; others have mentioned it &mdash; are the facilities for Members.  These have been here through successive Governments.  I am not blaming the present Government. I know the Leader of the House is doing his best to facilitate us and I gather at a more senior level that is going on as well. If we are looking at the Seanad &mdash; and we are supposed to be among the leaders of this country &mdash; we should consider that four Senators must share one secretary and three or four Senators must share a single trunk telephone line.  Yet, when you go to the person working at fifth level in a semi-State body, responsible to a Government Department, who in turn are responsible to a Minister, who, in turn, is supposed to be accountable to the two Houses of this Oireachtas, that person has two or three telephones on the desk, he has his own office and his own secretary while those who are supposed to lead this nation have appalling facilities.  It debases the institutions of this State and it makes a mockery of democracy in a modern State.  There is enormous scope for reform in this country.</P>
    <P>Having been in both of the Houses I hear a great deal of intense criticism of the Seanad.  I must say I would defend this institution and I would defend the vast majority of Members who have been in this institution, which is called a stepping stone.  In other words, there are budding politicians who may spend some time here before they become Dáil <Col N="1288" /> Members.  I have no problem with a stepping stone where younger people have the opportunity to learn what legislation is about.</P>
    <P>The Seanad is supposed to be a haven for political hacks or for defeated Deputies. I have no problem with it being a haven, although I do not know that &ldquo;haven&rdquo; is the word.  I have no problem with the concept of the haven.  If you have a parliamentarian working in our multiple representation system, of which I have very negative views, who through the freaks of PR loses his seat in a Dáil election, who is likely to have a parliamentary future and who may have the most appalling income problems because of losing his Dáil seat, I have no problem whatever relating to that person seeking a seat in Seanad Éireann, being elected to it and holding it down honourably. It serves a useful purpose.</P>
    <P>I hear the criticism that it is a talking shop.  If it is a talking shop, then so is the Dáil.  Of course we are a talking shop, and of course the Dáil is a talking shop. Parliaments are talking shops.  What else could they be?  The only function I think a Senator does not have that a Deputy has is the capacity to ask Parliamentary Questions but in every regard there is a status that should not be diminished.</P>
    <P>In so far as reform is concerned there is, as Senator Honan raised, the European issue.  There is enormous scope for much closer links between the Oireachtas and the European dimension.  This is not happening at present.  The Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities has an extremely limited function.  It is a committee concerned reactively with secondary legislation with very few other functions and it is modelled completely on the identical British committee.  It is not of a positive nature, it does not have a positive function, it does not have general debating functions.  The Seanad is the ideal forum to use as the link with the European dimension.  It is the ideal link, where we can afford access to Members of the European Parliament to come to debate with us in this House and to try to build up a relationship between <Col N="1289" /> Members of the Oireachtas and Members of the European dimension.</P>
    <P>We can also highten the value of the Seanad in other senses as well.  We have had very strong Governments, very strong executives, very weak parliaments, a very weak backbench parliamentary tradition.  There have been issues, for example, recent events in eastern Europe.  We had a visit two weeks ago of the Foreign Minister of Hungary at a reception by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Iveagh House.  Why can we not look at the role of parliament where these issues are concerned and use the Seanad occasionally as a forum to which we could invite, for example, the Foreign Minister from Hungary or United States Senators? It would be particularly enlightening at present, having regard to the eastern European dimension, for Parliament to develop an understanding and dialogue when people of that eminence visit this country.</P>
    <P>I have problems with the institutions here at the most fundamental level.  I have a very strong view, against the majority of my party, that in proportional representation we have one of the worst electoral systems in the free world.  I do not say that lightly.  I say that as a considered opinion and I will repeat it to stress the gravity with which I say it.  We have one of the worst electoral systems in the free world.</P>
    <P>The kind of problems we have with PR as it operates here are in the <i>modus operandi.</i>  The issues I am discussing relate principally to the two major parties. If you take Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, take multi-seat constituencies around the country, you have a base party vote for each of these parties.  There can be swings in constituencies and seats can change but the basic issue to the politician who has a seat or who is aspiring to it, is who gets the base party vote.  There is a core party vote.  In many constituencies there is at least one guaranteed seat for each of the main parties and there are a couple of seats that change.  Since the base issue is the base party vote, the facts, of life are that it is pushing Deputies and aspiring Deputies to compete far more with <Col N="1290" /> members of their own parties than it is with the opposition.  This is an extremely unhealthy type of development.</P>
    <P>We have had good Governments and we have had bad Governments, we have had good Ministers, we have had bad Ministers but where we have had bad Governments or poor Ministers occasionally I submit that this PR electoral system is at the root of some of it. If you have a Minister for Foreign Affairs or a Minister for Agriculture who is the head of a Department and who puts his best into the working of that Department and if he has to look over his shoulder, not at his political opponents in his constituency but at the people in his party in his constituency, that is extremely unhealthy.  It makes for a weak Executive, it makes for an extremely undesirable situation where the Minister can play it two ways.  He can look after his constituency and neglect his Department or he can look after his Department at his peril because he may not be a Deputy for the rest of his life.  That is not a farfetched statement.</P>
    <P>In the PR system the electoral strategy goes wonky, you build up freak results and because of the rumours going around in certain towns and villages, the wrong person in the party is elected instead of the right person.  This type of competition is completely undesirable.  We have problems as well with the number of our Deputies.  We have a tradition of a large number of Deputies relative to our population. I can bear with the tradition and I can live with the number but let me compare our position with the Netherlands.</P>
    <P>Of all of the countries who weathered the economic crisis since 1973-74, it is a considered view that the most successful economy has been the Netherlands.  It is the size of Connacht and it has a population now of about 14 or 15 million people.  That country with that population have fewer public representatives than we have for our 3.5 million to 4 million people.  That implies you could run this country very effectively with, for example, 50 Deputies.  Because of the number of Deputies we have and because <Col N="1291" /> of the amount of flesh pounding we can get into with such a huge number of Deputies and Senators relative to such a small population, it means that our Deputies and aspiring Deputies are forced to compete in all the areas they should not be competing in.  We are on the funeral train, we are into the community council, we are into all of the mundane things at local level to far too great an extent.  I am not blaming the Deputies or the aspiring Deputies.  I was one of them and I played the same game, I had to do that because that is the system.</P>
    <P>There were other issues I wanted to raise I would like to put down a motion in this House to examine electoral systems, to look at the list system on the Continent, the British system and the US system, because I see enormous scope there for the future.  Effectively they are the issues to which I wanted to refer.</P>
    <P>The summer recess is far too long. It should be shortened.  It is an unfair comment that Deputies and Senators are not working during the recess.  They are doing a great deal of work in their constituencies and are very busy people.  I would welcome more formal meetings during that time and more use of the committee system.  I would welcome a committee to deal with the State-sponsored bodies in the non-commercial sector as well as in the commercial sector. I would welcome the committees of this House being televised.  I would welcome more regional parliamentary activity. Cork is the second biggest city in this country: I see nothing wrong with a meeting of the Seanad in Cork sometime. There is a need for a shake-up of this kind.  I am in favour of reform and for that reason I welcome this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Our views in relation to this House have been articulated very well for us since we entered the place on 1 November by some of the people on the benches opposite.  They have sometimes articulated our views accurately, and frequently quite inaccurately.  The fact of <Col N="1292" /> the matter is that we intend, as my colleague Senator Cullen said on the opening day, to participate fully in the workings of this House, its committees and its reform.  I can reassure Senator O'Toole that we subscribe fully to the democratic process, as I am sure do all of the people in this House.</P>
      <P>I do not think that we need prove our credentials in relation to our commitment to the democratic process.  It is the nature of that process and how well it serves all our people that concerns the Progressive Democrats.  We wonder about the place of the Seanad within that process and in some of those respects we have reservations and those reservations have been well aired in public.  We realise that this House is a political institution and, as such, must reflect the political ethos of the country.  Therefore, I reject some of the observations that were made in relation to this House being a refuge or a nursing home for aspiring or retired people from the other place.  The House is part of the political process.  It should be used as part of the political process and I see nothing wrong with that.</P>
      <P>We intend to use the democratic structures provided by the State, provided they are relevant to the wishes of the people.  In relation to abolition of this House, I note that on the opening day when we were discussing the election of the Cathaoirleach, Senators Murphy and O'Toole remarked that they would prefer to see the Seanad abolished than to have it remain in its present denigrated and unreformed state.  As a newcomer to this House I found it quite remarkable that some of the people who purported to defend it most vigorously and some of the people who were most concerned about the fact that it might be discredited in public, said many things which would lead people reading the report of that opening day's proceedings to be quite disturbed about the House and not to hold it in very high regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the motion, we support the general thrust of it in respect of the need for reform.  We go along with its broad perspective, while we might disagree with some of the detail contained <Col N="1293" /> in it.  I would have doubts as to whether the timescale referred to in reporting back before 1 June is realistic given the nature of the reform which would probably be necessary.  I should add, of course, that under the agreed programme for Government which the Progressive Democrats negotiated with Fianna Fáil there is a commitment to bring forward detailed proposals for the reform of the Oireachtas <i>in toto.</i>  While it would be totally inappropriate to refer to matters in the other House, it is the intention to bring forward proposals for reform of the Oireachtas <i>in toto</i> and in that process to examine among other issues the procedure for the passage of legislation through the Dáil and the Seanad, the committee system, Question Time and the <i>sub judice</i> rule.  The Progressive Democrats have already instituted a system to look at these matters and we will be submitting our proposals for consideration with our partners.</P>
    <P>In relation to some of the detail of reform, we suggest that the select committee system would be appropriate for Bills.  I would also, indeed, endorse the point made earlier in relation to television coverage.  I do not see why the people should not be party to the proceedings of their Parliament.  Television is obviously a much more meaningful and a much more invasive medium than radio in that respect and I can see no reason why we should not allow television broadcasting from this House.</P>
    <P>It is important that relevant matters should be brought up when it is in people's interest and when it is a matter of deep public concern.  As someone who is new to this House and does not, as yet, fully understand its procedures and its great tradition, nevertheless it seems remarkable to me that we do not seem to be in a position to respond quickly enough to some of the matters that are of pressing public interest.  I hope we will not be so restrained by procedural dust that we cannot respond to the needs of the people.</P>
    <P>Another matter which certainly surprised me &mdash; and it also surprised my colleagues in the Progressive Democrats <Col N="1294" /> Party &mdash; is the way the Order of Business has been conducted since we entered the House.  Last Wednesday it took one and a half hours to get through the Order of Business.  We found it quite remarkable that it should have been held up for that length of time.  I would say to the people on the benches opposite that I do not contest their right for one moment to raise those matters but I wonder how it squares with trying to present to the people a House which is both responsible, reflective of their needs and is a good place to be.  At times it has appeared to me that it has all the characteristics of a rather poor undergraduate debating society rather than the characteristics of the national Parliament.  In our view, the Order of Business needs dramatic reform.</P>
    <P>I am not an expert in relation to how this could be achieved under procedure. It seems that one of the most telling vehicles for extracting information and one that is used in the other House, is Question Time.  This House should have the right to question Government Ministers and decisions.  The other matter which would be of some concern to use is the use of the <i>sub judice</i> rule which at times may be used to suppress debate.  It can be used, possibly too broadly, to stop matters being raised.</P>
    <P>One of the things, as somebody who comes from a commercial background, I found quite extraordinary on my first day in the House &mdash; it was something that has been referred to earlier indirectly by Senator O'Toole and it is in relation to research and the general facilities which are available &mdash; when I asked my secretary how could I bring in floppy discs from my PC computer, which I have at home, to expedite my mail the lady in question did not really know what I was talking about, so the esteemed typewriter is definitely very much still a feature of this House, apart altogether from the difficulties which were referred to earlier about the phones.  I then asked where was the fax machine and I was told that we had to go to party headquarters if we wanted to fax something.</P>
    <P>It is really extraordinary that in a <Col N="1295" /> modern technological society equipment that is available to every industry and pretty well in every office in the country is not available to the Parliament of the country.  People have legitimate concerns about the workload which they experience, particularly the Deputies.  I imagine that a lot of the workload could be expedited a lot more efficiently if they had the modern technological equipment that is available to pretty well everybody else around the country but not available to us.</P>
    <P>We are bringing our proposals forward, which will be discussed with our partners.  We support the general thrust of the argument and of the motion but we do have certain reservations in relation to timescale.  I also support the view that MEPs should have the right to come here and address this House.  We are part of the Community.  More and more decisions which are of profound relevance to the country are being taken within the Community and it is only right and proper that we be kept fully up to date with what is happening.</P>
    <P>I appeal to some Members on the opposite benches not to treat certain matters which arise in this House as a game and a matter of amusement.  There seemed to be general laughter last week in relation to a vote which was forced.  If we are to be the national Parliament, if we are to have the respect of the people, then we must conduct ourselves in an orderly and dignified manner.  It seems at times that people come in and look to see who is in the press gallery &mdash; I see there is nobody there at the moment &mdash; and that colours what they may have to say. Referring to last Wednesday, had they looked around behind them they would have seen a very large group of schoolchildren and I wondered &mdash; I said this on radio &mdash; what those young people thought of this House and its standing when they left here that afternoon.</P>

      <P>The previous speaker &mdash; I will address my remarks to the Acting <Col N="1297" /> Chairman &mdash; drew attention to the fact that those who have the happy gift of colourful utterance may occasionally be suspected of doing so because the press gallery is full, but this, as he himself pointed out quite clearly, could not possibly be the case at the moment because there is simply nobody there at all.  That does not mean that I do not intend my remarks to sting, I certainly do because it seems most extraordinary to me, constitutionally, that a group that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks are very clearly directed to the motion, the reform of the Seanad.  One of the things I would like to see reformed is the way in which the business of the House is ordered so that it does not appear to be manipulated and directed from the Government Front Benches as if they were, in fact, all the time in the Chair.  We have had a very clear example of that just this minute.</P>
      <P>I will return to the point I was making. It seems odd to me that a group committed to the abolition of this House should infiltrate themselves into it with so little feeling of unease.  It gives me some unease that this situation should be so calmly accepted with so little reservation but although I do accept that by some miracle this House does work extremely well and that through a very grossly defective electoral system, persons of excellence are elected on all sides, that should not blind us to the fact that there are gross defects in the electoral system and in the way in which the business of the House is conducted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1298" /> I would like to turn first to the question of the electoral system.  I am not going to expand too much on it because my colleague Senator O'Toole whom I heard made a number of very telling points. While I did not agree with him entirely in his reservations I knew some of them were right.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that there is a clear separation between, for example, the six Senators who are represented by the method that was originally intended which enfranchises the nominating bodies and this is a crucial point.  The six University Senators had to stand the test of presenting themselves to an electorate that approximates to a real parliamentary constituency, in my case nearly 20,000 votes and in the case of the National University of Ireland system, 75,000, altogether just 100,000 votes.  This is quite different from the notion of what they call delegated universal suffrage where people are elected on local parochial issues to county councils and this is presumed to entitle them to nominate people, to put people through to the Seanad.  If this was a real argument, why do they not go the whole hog and let the county councils nominate the Dáil, the Presidency and the offices of the Supreme Court and the whole lot.  It would be much more economic to do it that way, but, in fact, nobody supports that because the whole notion of delegated universal suffrage is a complete intellectual nonsense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>My vote was enormous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It simply does not wash and if Senator Dardis's vote was so enormous, then it surprises me that he is gracing us with his presence and I think he does so with some considerable reluctance. He reminds me of the Communist Party of Ireland, Marxist-Leninist, who announced an 800 per cent increase, which is from one vote to eight.  There is a very strong case to be made that those bodies which nominate for election should have their membership enfranchised so that there are members of the <Col N="1299" /> medical profession, the labour movement, farming interests and so on enfranchised to vote directly for people.  I have no doubt that a number of the excellent people we have in the House today would succeed in getting to this Seanad by this route.</P>
      <P>The problem is that done in the way it is done at the moment, it is totally vitiated by the party political system.  It is part of a political machine in the upper House but the invasion of a totally party system does operate to the disadvantage of the Seanad.  I accept that there has got to be party politics in this country particularly in the Dáil, but I believe that the Seanad was intended as a vocational Chamber and that it ought to retain that character. I accept what Senator O'Toole says about dividing the panels and having an Oireachtas sub-panels in which there is a political element.  It seems to be a most effective compromise which would meet the problems on both sides.  I would certainly recommend any commission that is set up to examine this.</P>
      <P>I have to say also that, somewhat to my surprise, I was persuaded to an extent by what Senator Staunton said, that there is of course a legitimate role, I suppose, for the Seanad in acquainting people with the rules of parliamentary debate and so on.  It may be that for aspiring politicians to come into the Seanad may very well prove a useful beginning in participating in the parliamentary system.  I accept that there is an argument to be made there and the Senator made it very well.  I do not however, think that it is good to have a system where, in fact, the rejects are promoted into this House by the party political interests.  That is completely wrong.  In a democracy, the right to reject a candidate is as important as the right to select a candidate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the principal officers of the Seanad.  It is most extraordinary.  If you examine what happens here, you have, for example, the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad was rejected at the European election and at the Dáil election; the Leader of the House was rejected at the Seanad election and was nominated by <Col N="1300" /> the Taoiseach, and the Leas-Chathaoirleach was rejected at the Dáil election. How much of a positive public image with regard to the participation in the democratic process does that suggest to the plain people of Ireland?  Not I think, very much.  But, then the plain people of Ireland do not know too much about the way this House works and, perhaps, in some ways it is as well.</P>
    <P>Not all of us are privy to the mysteries of the way this House works, either.  I would very much like to have the Leas-Chathaoirleach confirm for me the existence of a little book known as the <i>&ldquo;Speakers Rules&rdquo;</i> and ask him if he will make it available so that we can penetrate the mysteries of the various rulings to which we are from time to time treated by Cathaoirligh, Leas-Chathaoirligh of various shades of opinion and various political parties.  I am not here making a point against any specific political party.  It often seems that they can be capricious, arbitrary and lacking in logic, lacking at least in consistency.</P>
    <P>I would like to give an example, to show that I am not talking simply in midair. On 18 January a motion from the Fianna Fáil group from Senator Paddy McGowan: &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann notes the upturn of the tourist industry nationally&rdquo; was ruled out of order as being too wide to be included as a matter on the Adjournment.  That is fair enough.  What happened on 5 July of the same year?  A motion from Senator Mick Lanigan, the Leader of the House at that time, and I am glad to say still the Leader of the House, about the improving trends and prospects of the public finances in the Irish economy in general, was regarded as appropriate, having suddenly materialised on the Order Paper that very day and dislodged a series of motions.  Is inconsistency there?  It is not a bad ruling, because I am told the Cathaoirleach has absolute discretion, so that rulings which are nonsense in logic can be supported by the extraordinary wideness allowed to the Cathaoirligh.</P>
    <P>I did some research this afternoon on Standing Order 29 because we had a request for a motion under that Standing <Col N="1301" /> Order.  That is a rather interesting mechanism To be honest, I have to bare my soul here and to confess to you, my brothers and sisters, that I did actually hope I would find an enormous body of flawed rulings both in this and the previous Seanad and I have also to acknowledge that I did not so find and that looking back even at situations where I put forward a request for a motion under Standing Order 29 I have to accept that the rulings given were perfectly reasonable and fair in most cases.  However, there were one or two others and, again, it is impossible for us to discover how or why a ruling is made and I do not think that is good in a democracy.  We ought to be able to understand and participate in the machinery by which these motions are ruled upon.</P>
    <P>For example, there was a situation at the time of the last election where it was apparently impossible to produce a Taoiseach and this was widely described as a constitutional crisis and yet apparently it was ruled on as not having sufficient degree of urgency.  If we cannot cobble a Government together, I do not know, what it says about our attitudes towards political life if that is not regarded as a matter of urgency.  It plainly seems that it is.</P>
    <P>I am also worried about the question of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. I really do hope that that committee as reconstituted gets working and gets working satisfactorily because in my personal experience it has not worked satisfactorily before.  It was supposed to report on the question of urgency.  I am not aware that it did in any extensive way; perhaps it did.  I also recall an occasion on which I believed, and the record of this House appeared clearly to show, that a Minister of the Government has misled the House on a matter of fact with the intention of subverting amendments which I was proposing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask that this be recorded: that that matter was brought before the Committee of Procedure and Privileges of the House and was ruled upon.  I do not think the Senator should <Col N="1302" /> be allowed to come in here again and start the very same facetious arguments he brought before the House.  Anybody who has any sense of fair play will realise that the ruling that was given by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges was a proper ruling and there was no intentional misleading of the House by the Minister.  I ask the Senator to withdraw the remark.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, a clear ruling was not given.  The committee did not get the full information they sought from the Minister; they felt, in fact, that they were powerless to act in the circumstances and that in a situation where it was raised previously in the House, the then Cathaoirleach told Senator Norris that he would be informed.  I certainly had no information to give Senator Norris, as his representative. There was no conclusion reached on the issue.  It is still hanging there.  The point which the Leader of the House has made were made by him also to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. That is not breaking privileges, as he has said that himself, but no conclusion was arrived at.  I felt and it is my view that we did not have the authority or the power to deal with those things. That is the point Senator Norris is making.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that you will agree that I have been interrupted consistently throughout, without very much protection.  I will make a few points in rapid succession.  First, I believe that in order to obviate the problems with regard to the electoral system, the dates of Seanad election and Dáil election should be made to coincide in order to prevent it becoming an intensive-care ward for ailing politicians.</P>
      <P>I welcome the possibility of the broadening of the constituency.  I look to the situation where the two newly created universities whose graduates will be enfranchised and I sincerely hope that a speedy attempt is made to address the situation.</P>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of the Oireachtas Joint Committees.  I wish there was a foreign affairs committee.  I cannot understand why there is not or, should I say, perhaps I can, because once again there is an unwillingness on all parties, not just the present Government parties, to make civil servants in Iveagh House accountable to the Parliament for their actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say with regard to committees I serve on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights.  I am very glad to have been placed on that committee again; it is an excellent committee; the work done by representatives from both Houses and of all shades of political opinion is excellent.  I was very disturbed this morning to find when I came in at 11 o'clock that the meeting of the committee had suddenly, with no notice, not even one minute's notice, been altered to 2.30 p.m. the time at which the Order of Business is taken in Seanad Éireann.  I created quite a row about that because when I asked, I was told the Dáil Whips had decided this.  I would like to ask this House whether Members consider that it is appropriate that the Dáil Whips should decide when an Oireachtas joint committee should meet and that they should have it meeting right at the time when we were taking the Order of Business here.  I think that shows a flagrant contempt by the Dáil for the Seanad.  I absolutely exonerate the <Col N="1304" /> secretary of that committee.  I also exonerate Members of this House.  We should all unite as responsible Senators to resist this kind of challenge to our legitimate authority.</P>
    <P>I would like to say that there are moments at which one does feel that the Seanad, with all its drawbacks, can have some real participation.  I remember getting three and a half pages of amendments into the budget, courtesy of the co-operation of Deputy Reynolds, the Minister for Finance.  We got Adjournment debates here on the Botanic Gardens, the Turner glasshouses, and several million pounds was released.</P>

I am sure you did your best or did you neglect those students?  Yet, those Senators criticise the politicians for not doing their job. We have better success rates than that.

It reminds me very much of the story that was told one time about the old landlord who had a cat very well trained, so well trained that the cat would hold the candle between its paws while the landlord would write the rent receipt for the poor old peasant farmer. He was so proud of its training that he said to this old farmer.  &ldquo;If I could get any man in here who could make that cat let go of that candle without abusing him, I would give him a free receipt&rdquo;.  Said the poor old farmer, &ldquo;Will you give me until <Col N="1306" /> tomorrow night?&rdquo;  The next night he came in with a couple of mice in an old brown paper sugar bag, he sat down at the desk and let the mice rattle in the bag and the cat cocked its ears.  He let go the mouse and of course the cat let go the candle and went under the desk after the mouse.  The landlord said &ldquo;My dear farmer, I will give you a free receipt.  You have proved to me that breeding goes farther than education&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the point is taken. The motion says that Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to initiate reform of the Oireachtas by the establishment of a committee of the Dáil and Seanad.  One of the ways that smart men ensure that nothing will be done in any organisation when asked to do something or play a prominent role is to suggest that a committee be set up.  They would never be on the committee or if they were they would play a minor part and the committee would end up doing nothing.  I would have preferred that those learned friends would have produced a document this evening showing clearly and specifically where changes could be made rather than, as they have done so far, criticise politicians.  One Senator referred to a question being put to students as to how many would like to be politicians. I would like to ask him, what kind of education does he give students or does he teach them democracy?  The word &ldquo;reform&rdquo; always worries me because it is a word that has been bandied around a lot over the past 20 years.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Twenty years ago a lot of your people were advocating the little red book of Chairman Mao.  Where is it today?  If we had been foolish enough to heed all the university boys and their learned friends, where would we be today?  They were the boys who told us to reform agriculture, to reform industry. <Col N="1307" /> What would we have today?  We would have no pollution in our country if the farmers were left to handle farming.  I say to my learned friends that after all their reform and intelligent views and university expertise &mdash; that is the end product after 20 years.</P>
      <P>Have a good look at the country after 20 years of such advice.  It was the university people who told us how to do it. It was not poor technical students like me and now they are trying to get other fellows to come along and tell us how to clean up the mess.  If the motion was sensibly thought out rather than for the purpose of getting headlines, it would have suggested that we should discuss first how we could reform the House that we have some say in and leave out the other House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it was not.  You talked about how students are not interested in politics, about the politicians who are dogsbodies and doormats.  Is that the kind of jargon and language you use with your students?  I would not like to use such language to the humble workers I have. I do not think you would get those words in any dictionary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do look around for knowledge.  I hope that men like the Senator would give us their views in an intelligent and broad way and not use such vile language.  That is what it is, and I am quoting the Senator verbatim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator in his first 20 minutes criticised politicians who were going around to clinics.  Yet he comes in on another occasion and talks about freedom, that people are free to do what they like but he denies them their freedom to go <Col N="1308" /> around the clinics.  That is their business; they are entitled to do it and they do a damn good job.  They would not be back here every time only that they do a good job.  When Senators start criticising politicians they should look at themselves. We are all in this together and it does not suit any of us to criticise other Members. When I get criticism, I give it back.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding between reform and facilities.  Some Senators criticised the facilities.  We could do with better facilities but in all fairness in this Seanad there is a better effort being made at getting facilities than has been the case in the past.  That is in no small way to one man who was criticised unfairly and that is our Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey.  That is a man who will give us a lot more.  We will have these facilities and services and he has offered them before being asked.  It is a pity that Senators should talk about reform and then mix it up with facilities and criticise those who give us those facilities.  Before we go on with reform I would like to see a paper presented in clear and concise language in ordinary countryman's language not highfalutin jargon such as you get on the back of an insurance policy, indicating the specific issues where we want reform.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the electoral system.  I would like to remind the House that not many years ago there was a referendum on single seat constituencies. That was rejected by the people and we must abide by their wish.  You cannot have it both ways.  The people say they want multi-seat constituencies; they want the PR system.  We must abide by the wishes of the people; there is no point in coming here criticising it because that is criticism of the people.  It is the masses who direct us all.  The only thing that can be done in that regard is, perhaps at some future date, to have another referendum to decide on the method of voting or the type of constituency we should have. Talking about that now is a waste of time.</P>
    <P>I could not agree with this motion personally because the debate I have heard so far has confused reform with facilities. <Col N="1309" /> I would be in favour of improved facilities. I know we are getting them and I am delighted.  I do not approve of throwing out everything that has stood the test of time.  The same people would tell us we should keep our heritage, our Georgian buildings, and everything that is old; they want to abolish an old system that has served us well and we have nothing to replace it.  Then, to make sure that we will do nothing other than waffle they suggest that a committee be set up and that it will work wonders.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris spoke about a foreign affairs committee.  I would like to remind him that he set up that committee himself. As far as I know he was a self-appointed secretary and then he said, &ldquo;Come in and join me&rdquo;.  If that is the Senator's idea of reform, it is not mine.</P>

      <P>Having listened to Senator Norris and Senator Farrell one begins to feel it will be very hard to follow that type of show.  I would be in favour of the broad principle embodied in the motion. There is need for reform of the Seanad and the public are now beginning to some degree to demand that.  Specifically, in particular we need to be able to respond quickly to the public concerns of the day and right now we are quite sluggish some of the time in the way we respond to these issues.</P>
      <P>Getting on to some specific points and, as it were, beginning with the beginning, the sittings of the House, I certainly believe there is need for reform in relation to how the Order of Business is conducted.  The Order of Business seems to me sometimes to be the order of show business than anything much to do with business of this House.  I would be in favour of the idea of introducing Question Time, although I would wonder how Question Time here might be integrated with Question Time in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion by Senator Dardis that members of the European Parliament should be given the right of audience <Col N="1310" /> either in this House or in the other House is a worthwhile one and should be introduced as a matter of urgency.  What is happening in this country is more and more dictated by what is coming to it from Europe.  It is very important that both Houses of the Oireachtas should be as involved as possible in the proceedings of the European Parliament and, of course, they should be as well informed as it is possible to be of what is going on in the European Parliament, because what goes on there is of immense importance to the welfare of everybody in this country.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that there does not now seem to be any capacity for the introduction of Private Members' Bills.  When I say &ldquo;any capacity&rdquo; I mean any capacity which can become a reality.  It seems to be a reality that most of the large number of motions on the agenda will never be discussed when, at the same time, some of the most important issues of the time are addressed in those motions.</P>
    <P>In relation to the committees of the House, there are a whole series of vitally important national questions which are not covered by these committees.  There is no committee dealing with unemployment, despite the fact that there are a quarter of a million people unemployed. There is no committee dealing with poverty, despite the fact that we are told that one million people are now impoverished &mdash; in other words, something of the order of one-third of the population of this country are below the poverty line.  Yet, that reality is not worthy of the considerations of a committee of this House. There are 40,000 to 50,000 people emigrating each year, some of them among the best educated of our young people. Again, that is not deemed to be worthy of being considered by a committee of this House.</P>
    <P>Some of the topics which these committees discuss seem to be relatively low grade.  I do not wish to go back over the whole business of the restaurant and so on and I certainly do not wish to exploit it by way of political opportunism &mdash; but I think some of the topics covered represent a rather funny order of what is <Col N="1311" /> important.  For many Irish people the Irish language is something they hold very dearly but, at the same time, when one gets down to brass tack politics, the restoration of the Irish language has never really been an important political issue.</P>
    <P>In relation to the way business is ordered &mdash; and I do accept that there are constraints on how business is ordered &mdash; I think the way it is done is rather haphazard.  It is difficult from day to day to know what is coming up the next day. When I say that I do not want it to be interpreted as a criticism of the Leader of the House.  I accept that the Leader of the House works under difficult circumstances, much of which is outside his control in relation to the constraints imposed on him by way of Ministers being available and a thousand and one other considerations.</P>
    <P>I wonder if some of us who speak in this House need to go on for quite the length we go on?  It would be a worthwhile experience for some of the people who speak here to listen to their speeches in their entirety.  Indeed, I suspect if some people listened to their speeches in their entirely there would be a sudden and loud begging for mercy to be released from some of the later stages of the speech.  Better still, some people might be well advised to read their speeches. There is none of us beyond making mistakes and beyond being boring and repetitive, but surely when you go into your second or third hour you should consider taking a break &mdash; half-time, as it were &mdash; and a rest and perhaps paying a visit to the bar for a bottle of stout.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>You can still get your record.  If you keep your speech to four or five minutes you will be counted because the people who assemble these records would not be able to endure the prospect of working their way, page by page, through those speeches.  Certainly, it would be only the most obscure <Col N="1312" /> journalists who would be interested in that type of thing and it would be only the most wealthy gazettes that would be able to afford the resources that would have to be put into that type of experimentation.</P>
      <P>There have been one of two things said about the University Senators.  I do not believe that anybody now can stand back from the fact that there are fairly serious anomalies.  There are two new universities which do not have any votes &mdash; a vote in Trinity College is three times as powerful as a vote by the graduates of the colleges of the National University. That certainly should be looked at.  Also, we have to bear in mind, when people talk in terms of the University Senators representing real constituencies, that they do and then again that they do not. If real constituencies are constituencies as in the general election, then they do not.  It is very much a selected sample which contains those among the most privileged groups in society.  One would wonder why the most privileged groups in society should have their privilege enhanced by having the capacity to put people in here to represent their views in the Seanad.  What about turning the thing on its head?  Why not the underprivileged? Why not a vote for those who are unemployed?  That is something which we do not hear a lot about.</P>
      <P>The matter of the Seanad being televised is to be encouraged and welcomed and I hope it will happen in the near future.  I also hope that when it does happen it will not be turned into a form of show business, of which there is a certain risk.  I know the constraints and the drives which force people to do that. I am a politician myself and we need the coverage in the papers but, at the same time, there are inconsistencies.  If people are to say, on the one hand, that this place is in need of reform &mdash; and I accept that it is &mdash; then there is an obligation to have some degree of consistency.  Some of the carry-on is irreconcilable with any notion of consistency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two final points which I want to make in relation to facilities which are available for Members.  I know <Col N="1313" /> that there is a very large queue of people who are very anxious to get in here regardless of the fact that the facilities might not be the best.  If we all left and took up some other form of activity, the 60 places would be filled in a time similar to that which it takes to click one's fingers. However, the level of technology which is in operation here is quite primitive. What about word processors, fax machines and so on?  A report was produced during the time of the previous Coalition which dealt with new technology for this House.  I imagine it is a fairly good report and it would be no harm if someone dusted it down and had a quick read of some of the main items mentioned in it.  At least some of them should be introduced.  We could all do with having word processors for the secretaries working here, not to mention some of the other gadgetary which could be introduced for everybody.</P>
    <P>Finally, there has been a suggestion that it is somehow wrong that this House should be political.  Every one of us is a politician and there is no getting away from that.  The reality is that we are really in cloud-cuckoo-land when we are talking about the fact that it should not be a political House because we are here because we are politicians.  It is as simple and as cool as that.  There is this idea also that it is somehow wrong that people are aspiring Dáil candidates.  I do not mind saying it again: I am an aspiring Dáil candidate.  I stood the last time and, in the words of Senator Norris, I was rejected; but there is not that much wrong with being rejected either.  It is a bit like playing football &mdash; some you win and some you lose.  You have no business at all in this trade if you have not got the stomach for being beaten.</P>
    <P>This idea that there is something wrong or ugly about politics is something which has been pushed around this country in a very dangerous manner because the whole place hinges around the political system.  When people begin to look at what the alternatives are to being political, then we would want to look at some of the awful stuff which comes in from other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1314" /> Again, I support the general trend of this motion.  I hope there will be some reforms introduced and we might be well advised to as it were do what we can do rather than to dream things which really are not starters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be able to speak on this motion here this evening. It is a type of motion that is long overdue both in this House and indeed in the Dáil itself.  I contend that the contents of the motion are correct in that I do not think you can discuss the reform or whatever of this House, or indeed any other House, without discussing the reform of the overall Oireachtas at the same time.  Indeed, it would be a huge mistake in my opinion if you try to isolate and just discuss reform of the Seanad without somehow involving the whole Oireachtas system itself.  Both Houses, because of their nature, impinge greatly on each other.  If there is to be meaningful reform that is going to effect permanent changes in the long term, then the whole area of the Oireachtas must be looked at at the same time.</P>
      <P>Indeed, in this country as we stand at the moment we have many levels of public representation, starting at local government level, which unfortunately over the last number of years has lost its teeth, in my view.  It is a view I have always held, long before I came into politics, that the removal of the control over their own finances was the death-knell for the real power of local government. I personally have a lot of belief in the possibilities of local government but, as it is at present constituted, it is in many ways meaningless.  That is a great shame and a great loss to local democracy in this country, for the very reason that they do have control over their own finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Dáil and the Seanad there is an ever-increasing and important level of legislation nowadays that is focused on the European Parliament. Whether we like it or not in this country, the power of that Parliament is going to continue to grow and affect our lives, not only at a very high level but right through the whole system of operation in this country from education to health, social <Col N="1315" /> welfare, rights of workers, as we have seen in the news lately &mdash; to any area of life you can practically think of in the present day.</P>
    <P>I am one of these people who have had great misgivings about the role of the Seanad and have said on many occasions that it should be abolished.  I would like to say at the outset that it is not because I hold people in public life and those in the Seanad and in any other area of public life in low regard; I do not.  Quite the opposite.  Although I myself am a short time in public life, I was reared in a household where public life was the norm, so I have many years experience of that form of life.  It is a fact that the functions of what this House was perceived to be doing &mdash; and in my opinion its operation and independence were very limited &mdash; has led to tremendous frustration on all sides of the House.  If it was to continue to operate as it does to date, I think then its function should be redundant.  Now, if the opportunities coming in the next decade and indeed those already on us are seized upon, I think there is an obvious clear role for the Seanad in relation to the European Parliament.  I believe this has been touched on by Senator Staunton this evening, whom, I must say, I listened to with great interest.  I thought he made an excellent contribution.  He was very cogent in what he had to say and was very cohesive in his arguments.</P>
    <P>I would like to extend beyond Senator Staunton's reference to the European Parliament.  Indeed, this party took the initiative and expressed a recommendation and desire to provide our MEPs with some forum in this country. It is absolutely nonsense to think that we have people in such an important forum in Europe, and having such an influence on this country, and that they are in no way answerable in any forum in this country either to their fellow colleagues at parliamentary level or indeed to the people at all.  This Chamber itself has the potential and the possibility to do something that perhaps no other parliamentary democracies in Europe <Col N="1316" /> have as yet focused on, and that is to constitutionally carve out a role for itself in relation to the issues that are ongoing, and in particular the legislative areas that are ongoing in the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>Because of the effect of legislation at European level on individual countries, and particularly a country like this which is of such a small size and feels the effect of legislative changes perhaps quicker than other countries, some mechanism must be found both at domestic level and indeed perhaps from the European side to give domestic parliamentarians some focus as to how they can handle and indeed discuss issues which may be just at a final stage of completion &mdash; I do not mean that all of the stages of perhaps a legislative Bill or whatever would have to be discussed.  Perhaps there should be some final gap before something is finally passed at European level that could be looked at in the Seanad if a role could be found.  I am not quite sure, how that mechanism might work.</P>
    <P>Having seen what has happened in the context of eastern Europe in the past few months, and indeed having welcomed the great changes, I could never have believed in my lifetime or in anybody's lifetime that such changes could occur. This makes it seem nonsense that we cannot in a very small way get our act together to bring about our own kind of changes.  We keep having to go on about it, to focus on this and that, and &ldquo;reform&rdquo; becomes a dirty word and radicalism is misunderstood.</P>
    <P>There is nothing radical about updating, about being part of the modern world, preparing for the next decade, looking to the next century.  Surely reform on an ongoing basis is the essence, the lifeblood, of any organisation, be it either in parliamentary terms or not, if it is to be relevant to the people.  That is what the Seanad today is not.  It is not simply relevant to this country because of the constraints that were put on it.  I agree with many of my colleagues on the Independent benches, I do not believe that the function of the Seanad today is what it was originally intended to be. It has gone completely in the opposite <Col N="1317" /> direction.  The political rubber-stamping that is necessary because of the way the Seanad has evolved is a bad thing.  A vocational Chamber as was originally intended, perhaps of many different areas of life, be it industry, education or health, to be represented in this Chamber would be a great thing.</P>
    <P>I do not believe you have to remove the political parties from the Seanad itself. There is great scope for removing the obvious numbers game, because that is what we are in.  It is a personal hobbyhorse of mine when we talk about the Seanad.  If there were only 90 Deputies in Dáil Éireann, which I believe would be quite adequate &mdash; I am absolutely convinced of that &mdash; you would have a far more reasonable <i>raison d'etre</i> for the Seanad to be there itself.  But there are 166 people in the Dáil itself, many of whom, the backbenchers, have no function whatsoever except to be a head count in parliamentary legislative terms.  I know they have a function in terms of constituency work which can be a huge burden, and indeed is to all of them there.</P>
    <P>The electoral system itself forces parliamentary life in Ireland completely in the wrong direction.  In that context reform of the Seanad cannot be discussed without reform of the Dáil and the electoral system itself.  This is what the Progressive Democrats have tried to bring forward into Irish life.  We had to talk in terms of abolishing the Seanad, even to be listened to in the first instance.  I am not convinced at this stage that will be the final outcome of a very serious look at the whole question of the Oireachtas and its functions.  It may still be the recommendation of that committee that the Seanad may not be necessary in the future.  I may be wrong in that, but there is nothing wrong in looking at all of the options.  I think we would be foolish if we were to set down the criteria, thus limiting ourselves in our options.</P>
    <P>I do not profess to be an expert on all of these areas but I have some experience of how the Oireachtas actually functions. The facilities have been referred to here this evening.  It goes beyond saying that the facilities of Senators and Deputies in <Col N="1318" /> the Oireachtas are extremely poor.  For instance, I do not understand why we cannot have researchers, people who have been educated in our regional colleges, and our universities and who are emigrating.  They could work permanently in a legislative area and research much better speeches that could be given in both Houses because we would have had more time to prepare.  I think they would have a very forceful impact on parliamentary life in this country and it would be money extremely well spent.  I think it could happen in conjunction with far fewer people being in the other Chamber and major changes in this area.</P>
    <P>The Seanad in the past, and I am sure will in the future, has done things which at the time were probably necessary and well worth while but just because at times it has done good things on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis is not a sufficient basis to keep it there permanently.  It must have much more teeth.  It must have a much greater focus. It must be more relevant to what is going on in Ireland today.  I believe the real test and the real opportunity is to make it far more relevant in a European sense, that the Seanad itself should become an active participant in what is happening in Europe.  I think that would give it a role that would be difficult for the Dáil to take on, because the Dáil in a sense is the primary initiator of legislation.  I do not necessarily feel that everything that is passed in the Dáil level has to come into this House to be rubber-stamped or vice versa.  I do not see why this Chamber should not spend all of its time initiating its own legislative role and not being some form of an addendum to Dáil Éireann.  I believe that in that sense it can certainly be of benefit in a domestic legislative role and most certainly in a European legislative role.  I think that if we widen our horizons and look at the whole role of the Seanad in this area, the possibilities are endless and the contributions will certainly be far more worth while in the future.</P>
    <P>I think that the electoral system to the Seanad is wrong.  It is outdated and, as it is constituted, it is outmoded.  For <Col N="1319" /> instance, there are many people in different bodies of professions in this country who have no choice but to vote for people who do not necessarily represent their professions at all.  I question whether the politicians elected to the Seanad should necessarily be confined to local councillors and Deputies and the outgoing Senators themselves.  I am not sure on that.  I do not possess the final answer but I have grave questions I want to have answered.  This party at present are formulating proposals and I am anxious to see them brought to fruition.  I know there have been questions about the time limit put in this motion, but I welcome that for one reason; if you do not put in a time limit we will be five years from now waiting for the results of this committee.  I want to see time limits set for many things that go on in this House if for no other reason than at least to get an answer and a response to what is going on in many ways behind closed doors.  I want to see my own party's proposals come to fruition very quickly.  I want to see the proposals that I know that are being worked on by our partners in Government brought before this House.  I want to see a proper functioning committee given responsibility to deal with those proposals.</P>
    <P>The committee system in this country as it operates is absolute nonsense. Senator Norris referred to the Committee on Women's Rights on which I had the privilege of serving.  That committee does enormous work but the reality is it has no power or no teeth to give a legislative stamp and authority to many of the worthy issues that it deals with and indeed the many worthy recommendations it makes.  The overall committee system is totally useless in many ways.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would say you cannot do any of this without looking at the whole electoral system nationally to bring about and give effect and meaning to those changes.  I think that must be part and parcel of all of this type of reform. It should not be piecemeal, <i>ad hoc</i> or in isolation.  The whole lot should be put in <Col N="1320" /> and dealt with because each sector affects the other.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very exciting motion this evening and a very important one.  I agree with the general thrust of the motion and with what it proposes.  The debate itself has been very unfocused.  I think a disproportionate amount of time has been spent examining this House without taking into account the overall context of the reform of the Oireachtas.  I think it is unreal for us to think simply in terms of reforming this House.  Indeed, many of the points made this evening were niggling and were unfair about the general operations of <Col N="1321" /> the House.  Perhaps what is left of the historian in me makes me pause in a debate like this just to take account of where we have come in 60-plus years of independence.  I think there is a tremendous sense of fundamental integrity about our Parliament which has been there from the earliest days.  Sometimes this may well reflect itself in perhaps an unthinking conservatism.  We have been slow, too slow, to adapt to change.  I think when we examine change we should also bear in mind the type of values which underlie our parliamentary system.  I think that by comparison with most others it stands fairly rigorous scrutiny.</P>
    <P>In terms of what we are talking about, we are not isolated in this country.  What we are talking about is a general trend in parliaments throughout the world.  The 20th century in particular has seen a tremendous growth in executive power generally.  That has been the case in this country also.  What has happened in most other countries is that parliaments, and especially parliaments with strong backbench influence, have begun to fight back for the rights of parliament.  In many cases they have been very successful and we do see a strong member presence and member influence on the workings of parliament in a number of countries from which we could learn.</P>
    <P>I think what we should be talking about here this evening is not just making more efficient the business of Parliament, not just providing greater accountability, and giving greater access to the public generally, but also the fight back of Parliament for its own central role in the life and legislation of the country.</P>
    <P>I believe Members in every party, but especially in the parties on this side of the House, agree there is a need for overall Oireachtas reform.  Not just is there general agreement, there is also agreement on the main items on the agenda for Oireachtas reform.  Perhaps I could list these out without, unfortunately, having a chance to develop them.  Most of the items at this stage are fairly familiar. We are all agreed, for example, that the timetable which governs the life of <Col N="1322" /> both Houses of the Oireachtas is not adequate, it is outdated and needs to be changed in a way which would convenience Members as well as providing a better service.  I believe we are all agreed on that.</P>
    <P>We are all, perhaps, not agreed on the question of electoral system but I would like to put into proportion some of the remarks made about the electoral system to the Seanad, especially by those from the universities.  I am a university person myself; all my working life has been in the university so I can hardly be accused of being anti-intellectual or anti-university but, in fact, there is a far greater democratic justification for the electoral system for the 43 panel seats to the Seanad than there is for the university system.  The university system, frankly, is elitist, it has no justification in this day and age.</P>
    <P>I said before that the only justification for the university system is that, by and large, it produces good Senators who have made a good contribution over the years and I would stand over that statement. I would judge it on its results, not on its democratic validity.</P>
    <P>The system of election for county councillors has parallels in most European countries.  Virtually every European country has some variation of the list system whereby almost half the Members of Parliament are elected from lists chosen by the party and distributed in proportion to the votes won by the party in the popular election.  There is not a great deal of difference between that system and the system used in electing Members of the Seanad here.  By and large, the result is roughly the same; a slight disproportion in favour of the Government party of the day, but by and large it is a democratic principle and it has widespread acceptance right across Europe.</P>
    <P>I am not saying it is the best system, I am not saying there are not faults.  I personally detest the whole idea of a vocational Chamber.  It was a bad idea brought in by Mr. de Valera at a particular time &mdash; I do not know why.  It was discredited in many other parts of Europe <Col N="1323" /> but it is here now and we have got to make it work.  I certainly am not relucant to look at it but I get a bit tired at times of being lectured on the totally undemocratic basis and nature of the particular system.  I can justify it more strongly than those who come from the university can justify the democratic validity of their particular system.  I am not saying that on the agenda for reform the question of the electoral system should not be right up at the very top.</P>
    <P>We all want to see a proper committee system, but there is confusion here as well.  What type of committees do we want?  We need to think through what we mean by a proper committee system.  We need to look at the whole question of how we can debate questions of topicality.  We need to look at the whole question of greater public access.  I would like to have a situation where major groups including the unemployed, the poor and the most disadvantaged, feel as a right that they have the possibility of putting their case to Members of both or either Houses through properly structured hearings. We should move very strongly in that direction.</P>
    <P>I believe, as Senator Dardis and others have mentioned, the whole question of a European presence, of the members of the European Parliament having a right of audience and access to certain debates in this House should be looked at as a matter of urgency.  There is the whole question of accountability, of financial accountability and of accountability of the State sector.  These are just some of the items on the agenda for reform.</P>
    <P>I will conclude &mdash; I know there are other speakers &mdash; by saying that we all know what are the items on the agenda. All of us who feel deeply about Parliament, all of us are parliamentarians and those of us who have a sense of this House and the other House, who want to make the system work, are in agreement that we should at this stage, early in the life of this Parliament, show a strong sense of commitment to examining in a structured way the questions I have raised and other questions.  We should make it <Col N="1324" /> the dominant work of this Seanad that we address this whole area, that we come back within a fixed time framework with definite specific proposals.  For that reason I feel that the decision of the proposers of the motion to include a deadline &mdash; it is perhaps too short a deadline &mdash; by which the committee should report with definite proposals is a good idea.  For that reason I feel I can support this motion.  I hope the Government can take it in the spirit in which it is meant. It is not meant as a criticism, it is meant as a starting mechanism to a process we all want to see begin.</P>

      <P>The debate has really answered itself but it should be the beginning of reform. I do not intend putting it to a vote at this point and I am waiving my right to reply. I propose that the Leader of the House would speak now and that the remaining speakers get five minutes each.</P>

The <Col N="1325" /> beginning of the reform that is necessary is being seen this evening because it is the first time since I came into the House in 1977 we have had a debate which is confined to Members of the House.  That is something we should look forward to in the future.  There is no Minister present so we are speaking on our own behalf, we are speaking to ourselves and hopefully to others who might feel that there is a necessity to have reform.</P>
      <P>Because of what has happened this evening we should look at the time given to debate in Private Members' time or Government time.  One and a half hours split over two weeks has meant that there is a spread-out debate which is disjointed. If three hours is given there is a better sense of continuity and a better debate and an issue can be addressed in a better way.  That does not mean I am suggesting that the Independent group should come in more often for three hours but I feel that the three hour debate gives better continuity and a better discussion.</P>
      <P>A number of items were raised by various speakers and I do not intend to address every item that was mentioned. However, I feel I should address certain matters.  It was mentioned that the system lacks the confidence of the people.  That is a very broad statement.  I do not think there is any real truth in it but it is very easy to say and, of course, the more often it is said the more true it appears to be. I reject totally the statement that was made that the people who are in this House are failures in other walks of life. Some of the most successful people in Irish business and in the professions are in this House and I do not know of any reject in any other walk of life who is in here. I reject absolutely the statement that was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You can go into colleges or convents around the country and find there an awareness of what goes on in politics. There is also a degree of interest which would amaze people who do not go to speak to groups in colleges and convents. I have addressed young people in colleges and I am sure many other Senators have done the same.  The young people show <Col N="1326" /> an interest and there certainly is not a 100-to-one rejection rate of politicians or politics in schools or colleges around the country.</P>
    <P>There has been a misrepresentation of the role of politicians in the House this evening.  &ldquo;Medical card politicians&rdquo; was a phrase used, or if it was not used it was inferred that there are people in both Houses of the Oireachtas who consider that the only reason they are back is because they are good at getting medical cards.  Irish public life covers a much broader spectrum than getting medical cards.  It was said that clinic work is boring.  One of the most stimulating part of Irish politics is listening to the problems of people.  The people who come with problems can bore you but unfortunately the problems they bring are never boring.  They come because they feel they must go to somebody.  At times it is just to get something off their chest and they are quite satisfied with that.</P>
    <P>The role of the Seanad and the undemocratic nature of elections has been mentioned by various people. Senator Manning in his contribution dealt with that one in a more concise manner than I could and I would go along totally with what he said.</P>
    <P>The number of days the Seanad sits was mentioned.  Certainly problems can be perceived in that area.  If we are expected to sit as full-time politicians, for longer hours and perhaps for more days during the period, we have to be paid.  I would also suggest that just because one is elected on a particular panel that should not preclude one from commenting on one's area of expertise and there are people who are elected to certain panels who have expertise right across the board.</P>
    <P>The committee system has been referred to.  There is no doubt that the committee system in the House needs reform and we can take that on board immediately.  Modern parliaments are downgraded by extra curricular or outside influences and there is no doubt that street politics is playing a major part in what happens in Houses of Parliament. <Col N="1327" /> Reform of parliamentary procedures is primarily the duty or the responsibility of the Houses themselves and it is a responsibility that is shared by all Members.  The Government are, of course, prepared to take a leading role in this, as evidenced by its commitment in the Programme for Government.  This particular programme was mentioned by two Progressive Democrats speakers. The long-established practice in this regard is for the Government to submit their reform proposals to the Dáil, through the Committee on Procedures and Privileges of that House, and the reform of the Seanad procedures is basically a matter for ourselves.</P>
    <P>In response to the debate I suggest that there should be an immediate meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and that a committee of that committee should be set up with a specific duty to address itself to reform of this Chamber.  If that committee is capable of coming forward with a programme that can be implemented by the date in the motion, so be it but I would leave it to the committee to decide on the date.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to make is that the appointment of a joint committee is not the correct way to proceed.  As I said, we set up our own committee.  Under the Constitution each House has the responsibility for making its own rules and Standing Orders.  Standing Orders were referred to in the context of the rulings of the Chair.  The rulings of the Chair have been correct under Standing Orders.  Anybody can read Standing Orders and they will get the precise reasons why the Chair rules.  Under Standing Order 29 (4) anybody can bring up a matter which is of relevance in the national interests at any particular time. It is the Chair who rules whether that matter is one to be taken or not.  The Chair is not influenced by any outside person.  The Chair makes the decision himself.</P>
    <P>Senators are aware that the question of reform of Oireachtas procedures has always been handled separately by each House basically for the reason I have just <Col N="1328" /> outlined.  The bulk of reforms initiated by the Fine Gael-Labour Government of the 24th Dáil related solely to the Dáil and only encroached on procedures of the Seanad in the area of joint committees.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the need for extra committees.  I take on board that when the sub-committee is formed they will consider the needs that are being expressed here for extra committees. This does not mean that the Seanad will be capable of setting up joint committees. The Seanad may be capable of setting up committees for this House alone and ask that joint committees be formed in other areas.  The question of reform of the procedures of the Houses is one which has always in the past been approached separately by the Houses and I feel that more progress can be achieved by continuing to adopt this approach.  We can take on board the very necessary needs that are being expressed here for a total reform of the Oireachtas and the procedures of the Oireachtas as a whole.  I totally concur with the questions that have been raised about the facilities of the House. There is no doubt that people in the business world or the academic world or wherever would not put up with the facilities that we have in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of giving the votes to particular sections of the community such as the unemployed.  I would like to point out that percentagewise there are as many unemployed county councillors as there are in the population as a whole.  The unemployed are very well represented by county councillors who are themselves unemployed.  Just because a county councillor is unemployed does not mean that he should not be allowed to vote for a Member of the Seanad but the unemployed are very well treated in terms of their representation by county councillors who elect us as well.</P>
    <P>It would not be appropriate for me to discuss matters which are under consideration by the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Nevertheless Senators will be aware that the Dáil committee has appointed a working group to <Col N="1329" /> consider the question of reform of the procedures generally.  They have already set up a reform group.  We can set up our own reform group and the sooner that happens the better.  The Dáil committee considered the question of the reform of procedures generally as well as bringing forward a proposal for televising proceedings. The televising of the proceedings of this House is a matter of urgency but it is in hand.  Unfortunately we were not represented on the committee which dealt with the thorny question of how the proceedings of the House should be televised.  In future if any committee is being set up which impinges upon this House I intend that we will have a representative on it.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the proposals referred to in the <i>Programme for Government</i> are likely to be processed through the working group of the Dáil.  The programme for Government undertakes to examine among other matters the <i>sub judice</i> rule, the committee system, Question Time, procedures for the passage of legislation and the question of MEPs qualifying for membership of Oireachtas committees relevant to EC affairs.  I take on board that we should deal more with EC matters in the House but I think that MEPs are quite capable of looking after themselves. They have the facilities, they have the finance to look after themselves electorally but there may be a need for us to look more carefully at what they are doing rather than them coming in and telling us basically what they are doing.</P>
    <P>One area which has been of enormous interest to Senators is the committee system.  All the joint committees which were established in the last Dáil have now been re-established but, as has been said here there is a need possibly for extra committees or to have a look to see whether the committees which have already been set up are relevant at all.</P>
    <P>I would like once again to thank the Senators for their views on the procedures of the Oireachtas.  I have problems with the motion as it is set down but I accept what has been said and perhaps the Senators will take on board the <Col N="1330" /> suggestion I have made that an immediate sub-committee be set up by the Committee on Procedures and Privileges to address itself to the problems that have been aired.  The debate has been a very worth-while one.  I am sorry for going a little over time but I felt I should respond reasonably to the arguments that were made here this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be considered impertinent, being a newcomer, in commenting on this motion.  I listened to the debate here this evening and found it extremely interesting.  I stayed for the whole of it and learned a great deal from what was said.  I have spoken with Senators who have served with great distinction in this House, some of whom are here at present and some who are no longer in this House and it seems to be summed up for me that the Seanad, must either reform or abolish.  I hope, therefore, that the remarks of the Leader of the House outlining what he intends to do will mean that there will be fairly soon an in-depth reform of this House because, like many others here, I feel it has an important role to play in the life of this country.  There is an opportunity here for a balanced, measured, reflective debate which is not always possible in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Honan referred to the fact that she had made a commitment to this House and I admire her for that and the other Senators also who have done that. As against that, we had other Senators who spoke of using this House to get back a political career which seems to me to suggest that there is no political career for a Senator, that one has to be on one's way to somewhere else, trying to get back a seat.  The point was made by Senator Murphy that a number of candidates for the Seanad very blatantly on this occasion, when canvassing votes made it quite clear that that was what they were about and in the case of some of the Senators who were appointed by the Taoiseach the same thing was probably fairly clear, that they were coming in here simply so that they could go to where the real action was which was in the Dáil. <Col N="1331" /> That says something very fundamental about this House, that there are a great number of Senators here who are simply frustrated in this House and they want to get back to where they feel they can make an important contribution.</P>
    <P>I believe that the reform that has been spoken of for the Seanad and the Dáil needs to go even further.  It needs also to involve a whole reform of local government because the same problem applies at local government level.  Councillors are frustrated by the lack of power, the lack of ability to achieve anything meaningful for the area which they represent and because of that they seek to proceed to where they believe the action is &mdash; again, the Dáil.  This creates serious problems because instead of having powerful, influential local councillors doing a good job they are so frustrated by their total lack of power that they want to get into the Dáil and by so doing they are threatening the TDs and they, in turn, feel they have to run around doing all this constituency work and be involved in clientelism.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Senators who said there is nothing wrong with being in touch with your local constituents and knowing their problems.  That is extremely important but that is completely different from what I understand as clientelism which is misleading the public into believing that it is only by going to their local TD that they can achieve what is their right and that I think is something which politicians have brought on themselves.  Politicians have over the years misled the public into believing that if you do not come to the clinic of your local TD or your local councillor you cannot get anything.  If politicians have a tough life now and are bogged down with constituency work it is their own fault and the public representatives should have the guts to stand up and say: &ldquo;You can achieve these things by going to the Department,&rdquo; instead of saying: &ldquo;Thank goodness you came to me; if you had not come to me this would never have been sorted out&rdquo;.  I have never held clinics because I believe that, by and large, people who come to clinics are <Col N="1332" /> under the illusion that they can only get their just rights by coming to a local TD or a councillor and I say that is largely the fault of politicians.  If that is the problem so be it, it is on their heads.</P>
    <P>I believe that if the system is to be reformed it should involve a fundamental reform of the whole local government system.  I would like to make my position clear.  By and large, I agree that the system of election for university Senators is largely elitist but it is a fact of life.  The six Senators who are here did not invent this method of being elected.  We can only live in the real world which is that that is the only way you can get into this Chamber particularly if you want to be in here as an Independent.  Your only way to get in here to this Chamber as an Independent is by standing in the constituency of the NUI or Dublin University. I certainly join with those Senators who have said that the other third level institutions most assuredly should have representation and I would be the first to support that.</P>
    <P>I hope that the reforms which are clearly needed in this House will be forthcoming in the very near future.  Calls for the abolition of this House are widespread because the public generally believes &mdash; and I think the Leader of the House is wrong here &mdash; that this House is irrelevant when there are serious problems of unemployment, of emigration, the North of Ireland and a whole range of problems.  The public simply does not see this House as having a meaningful role to play and in the other Chamber they see to a large extent politicians squabbling and quibbling and scoring party political points while the country continues to have serious problems. That, to a large extent, is why politicians have such a bad image.  The public does not see them as addressing the real problems that are facing people nowadays. The party comes first and the country second.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Someone once said: &ldquo;It is a far, far, better thing that I do...&rdquo; and said very little else and I feel a little in that position.  I believe that the <Col N="1333" /> Seanad can and should and indeed must play a far greater role in the democracy and indeed in the government of this country.  I am very heartened by the increased role that I myself have seen in the Seanad from the previous time I had the privilege of being here.  There are a number of reasons for this.  One is the contribution of the Senators themselves on both sides of the House.  The second has been the establishment of joint committees where by virtue of some of the defaults of our parliamentary system it is the Senators in actual practice who play the major role, who have the time, the opportunity and the interest to read the various papers concerned and to make a meaningful contribution to these joint committees.</P>
      <P>I must congratulate if I may be permitted, the Senators for putting forward this motion and having this debate which has been a very meaningful and worthwhile debate.  One of the aspects of it is all too clearly evident and that is in those empty benches there behind us; something has to be done about this rather trivialising attitude of the media towards this House.  This House has powers, this House plays a major role, this House makes a major contribution to debates and it is high time this was reflected more clearly by the media.</P>
      <P>I would like as well, if I may, to join, without agreement but in congratulation, with our colleagues in the Progressive Democrats in putting forward the question, should or should not this House be abolished?  This has made us face up to the fact to have this type of debate on it. The answers that are coming through, including from our colleagues of the Progressive Democrats, is that what is needed is reform.</P>
      <P>I would like to concur in my final comment with the Leader of the House in suggesting that we have a sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and that we ourselves make some very necessary reforms to this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that the time is very limited and I would like to thank the House for accommodating me.  I wish to <Col N="1334" /> apologise for not being present to second the motion.  In the very few minutes that are left I would like to thank the Leader of the House and Senator Conroy for the far more temperate nature of the contributions in the latter part of the Government's response to this motion.  If we are to get anything constructive out of this debate, the promise that the Leader of the House made that there will be an active committee sitting on the proposals we made will certainly take the sting out of divisiveness which might emerge as a result of this debate.</P>
      <P>While I welcome fully what Senator Martin Cullen said this evening, it is time that the Progressive Democrats made up their minds what they think about this House.  It is all very well to make a statement for electoral gain or popularity, to ride a hobbyhorse and to say abolish the Seanad &mdash; we all know that that is playing to the public &mdash; but then we have Senator Cullen coming into this House this evening and saying that the vocational element could be a great thing.  I agree with him, but let us hear Senator Cullen say that the Seanad has great potential, that the calls that have come from that particular party are now dormant, that they have reversed their policy and have done a U-turn on it.  I welcome the shift in policy which is inevitable because of the fact that they have actually taken their seats, but let them be honest about it and play a full part.  I look forward to them playing a greater part in this House than they have done heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also look forward to them understanding, the role of the Independents in this House, Senator Dardis criticised the Independents for calling for votes, using the procedures of this House and not being used as lobby fodder by the Government but we are using the procedures to make a point of view known which is in the public interest, that it should be known.  Those who say that the university seats or other seats are irrelevant or undemocratic are wrong in their concept of what this House is meant to be.  The Seanad was never meant to be a democratically elected House in the purest form because if it was it would just be an <Col N="1335" /> imitation, or a mirror image of the Dáil. That was not the purpose and that is not the role of the Seanad.  It is wrong to criticise the university seats or any other seats on the basis of their being undemocratic.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Seanad do now adjourn.&rdquo;  I decided to put this motion before the House for a couple of reasons.  First, because I have the honour of being my party's health spokesperson in the Seanad and, secondly, because I believe one of the primary functions of Seanad Éireann must be to debate, on an on-going basis, the welfare of our citizens in terms of health, education and lifestyle, that as well as engaging in important abstract discussions we must never lose sight of our responsibility to improve the quality of life of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion tonight has very real significance and importance at the moment because there is tangible and concrete <Col N="1336" /> evidence that a flu epidemic is on its way to this country.  This evidence is coming from the most conservative of sources. Medical opinion that has traditionally taken a fairly conservative line now claims that on this occasion we will have one of the worst epidemics for 30 years. That is a very serious matter and one that merits discussion in this House.  This flu epidemic will cause particular problems for those with respiratory ailments, asthma sufferers, diabetics, kidney sufferers and, of course, the old and the very young.  The old and the very young, represent a very large section of our population.</P>
    <P>It should be clear to the House that the Government and the health boards were not ready for this emergency and did not anticipate it.  The Department did not anticipate the emergency and the loophole in the 1970 legislation in relation to GMS patients needed to be rectified immediately to allow free vaccination.  I am glad that negotiations are on-going at the moment in relation to that.  I urge the Minister to bring the negotiations to a speedy conclusion so that GMS patients will immediately get free vaccination against the flu.  It is reprehensible that a couple of doctors were charging and that the anomaly in the legislation is there. We hope there will be an immediate rectification of this matter, thus facilitating the vaccination of health card patients.</P>
    <P>It is a very serious matter that we have been caught without a sufficient level of vaccine to provide a national vaccination programme.  Obviously, this has its roots in a lack of planning and, of course, in the general cutbacks to the health boards. It is a very serious matter for two reasons. First, because the vaccine in question, according to most medical opinion, has a fairly high success rate and, therefore it is important that it should be made available and secondly, failure to properly vaccinate our population nationally will result in a greater degree of hospitalisation for already cramped hospitals.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear today on the news bulletin that the Minister was able to announce there are 25,000 more shots <Col N="1337" /> of vaccine being made available.  This is welcome but I would argue it is too little, too late.  I do not believe it will be enough to implement a national vaccination programme of the kind we need.  I contend strongly, that vaccination should be available on demand to all the population.  I accept that the main national drive must be to ensure that the old and the very young are vaccinated but there should be adequate supplies of vaccination for those who feel they need it because it is not always the case that middle aged persons will necessarily be the least vulnerable.</P>
    <P>Having checked a number of places today I am told from a reliable authority that there is a 95 to 96 per cent bed occupancy in the Dublin hospitals.  For seasonal reasons, there is a very high bed occupancy throughout the country at present.  I noticed recently that a lot of the debate has focussed on the Dublin situation.  It would be regrettable if we were to lose sight of the fact that there is a problem outside Dublin as well.  Given that there is a very high level of bed occupancy in our hospitals at the moment, the impending flu epidemic must pose major problems for us.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister, the Department and the health boards must put in place as a matter of urgency, within the next 48 hours, an emergency plan to have extra beds ready in our hospitals in the event of an epidemic and also of staffing. A large number of the hospital staff will themselves become the victims of the flu epidemic.  There is a hospital at the moment very badly affected in this way and if they become the victims of this epidemic they will need staff replacements. There will be need for extra beds in hospitals.</P>
    <P>We need immediately an emergency plan and a set of contingencies to deal with what looks like being a very serious epidemic.  At the moment in a number of counties, particularly Longford, schools are closed because of this flu.  It is affecting industry and it is only beginning to become a problem.  Most of the experts argue that it will become a greater problem in late December and in January.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1338" /> Despite the fact that we may be acting too late, it is important that we act decisively now and that we put in place immediately an emergency programme in making extra beds available and making available relief staff.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of grave urgency.  A lot of the public will look to us in future months and judge us on how we coped with this question.  I believe it is time that action was taken on it.  I propose to rest the matter for the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh Aire Sláinte ar a chéad chúirt don Teach.  It is his first time here since we came back into our new establishment and it is good to see that the Minister is here to reply to an Adjournment debate raised by a Senator from his constituency.  I would like to congratulate Senator O'Reilly for bringing this matter before the House tonight because it is very important that we discuss this situation.</P>
      <P>We must be realistic.  This is the first time we have had an epidemic in 12 years. If we had been stocking up with vaccine over the past number of years, it would have been thrown out and wasted because it would not have been needed. It is impossible to see into the future.  I understand the time for vaccinating people is in late autumn.  I wonder how many people, if we had had supplies in the months of August, September or early October, would have gone to the doctor to get the jab?  I would say very few.  I wonder at this stage if it is too late for the preventive measure to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should also be very careful because during the Carter administration in America, it was feared there would be a big outbreak of swine flu, which I understand is very serious if people get it, and which does happen, and many people were vaccinated.  The flu epidemic did not materialise and the cure ended up worse than the disease because thousands got the flu as a result of the vaccine. We should also issue a word of warning because quite honestly too many people are running for what they think is the easy way out.  I have seen recently that <Col N="1339" /> there are more people sick now from reaction to drugs and tablets.  Side-effects are nearly as big a problem as the original ailment.</P>
    <P>I often warn people at health board meetings about being too fond of always opting for drugs.  When I had a very serious accident myself &mdash; I never take drugs or anything unless it is purely a case of having to &mdash; I was out of hospital in ten days and everything was healed up perfectly.  They told me it was because my system was clean and there was no reaction to anything.  People should remember that if they are trying to prevent every little thing they can have a build-up of drugs in their system that may react if they really have to have a serious operation.  It is something they should consider.</P>
    <P>At this stage if the flu is here and people get it they should consider the old remedy where people took hot drinks and went to bed.  If they did that they would get over it quickly themselves and they would ensure they would not give the flu to anybody else.  A lot of the media hype about this is unnecessary.  I often think if those people were so brilliant as they appear to be when something happens, they would have warned us last July, August or September that this flu was on its way.  I did not see any newspapers report saying there was a dangerous flu on the way until it was here.  Now they are hyping it up.  They have a lot to account for by doing that.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the people, as Chairman of the Association of Health Boards of Ireland, that the health boards are geared to cater for this epidemic if it arrives.  It might not be half as serious as all the talk would lead us to believe.  I can assure the House that the health boards, the doctors and those people in the health services will cope with the flu epidemic if it arrives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Reilly that there is an epidemic of flu on the way but there is no evidence that it will be the worst epidemic in 30 years.  It will certainly be <Col N="1340" /> the worst one in the past 13 or 14 years but there is no evidence that it will be worse than previous epidemics.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Reilly made the point that clearly we were not ready for this emergency. I can tell him that we were not surprised at this particular situation developing because we knew that at some time we would have a flu epidemic again in the winter.</P>
      <P>Flu is a feature of Irish winters.  We have flu every year; 105,000 people approximately get the flu each year and there are 125,000 people vaccinated against flu each year.</P>
      <P>It appears from what Senator O'Reilly said that he knew we would have this major flu epidemic this year.  I agree with Senator Farrell that people who knew this had a duty to tell us.  Even the experts in the various centres around the world did not seem to know or I presume they would have told us in advance.</P>
      <P>On the question of the free vaccination, I have noted reports that medical cardholders have been asked to pay for the vaccine, but when inquiries were made to the two health boards concerned in the reports &mdash; the Eastern Health Board and the Southern Health Board &mdash; we found that no complaints were made to either board that such charges were made.  I would be concerned if medical cardholders who received the vaccine are being charged and I have requested the health boards to ensure that no charges for vaccines are levied on such persons.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator O'Reilly condemning the Government and the health boards for not having a national vaccination campaign, Senator Farrell has dealt well with that.  It would not be appropriate.  First, I do not think people would turn up.  In view of the fact that for the last 12 or 13 years we did not have any influenza in the country I believe the vast majority of people would not present themselves for vaccination.  We do not have compulsory vaccination in this country.  I do not believe, even if we attempted it, that it would be successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also agree with Senator Farrell, on the evidence before us over the last <Col N="1341" /> number of years, that it would be inappropriate to even ask people to come forward for a national vaccination programme against influenza each year.  I take the point he makes that if you do this type of mass vaccination you want to have justifiable reasons for doing it because there is a risk, I know it is minimal but, nevertheless, there can be risk there.</P>
    <P>The question of a national vaccination programme at this stage is one that I believe is questionable because it takes at least two weeks before the first signs of immunity develop and probably another two weeks before you have full immunity through the vaccination.  It is important, in view of the wide publicity, that we recognise that the management of a flu epidemic does not depend on mass vaccination. That is not the answer to a flu epidemic.  We have a history of it.  We have it every winter and indeed we have had major outbreaks of flu at regular intervals throughout our history.  Until somebody finds a cure for it, I presume that will be the position.</P>
    <P>The management of it, when it arrives, is not to go out with a mass vaccination programme.  The management of it is to give good common-sense advice to people because there is not a cure for flu itself. The old remedy is still the best, to take something like aspirin or paracetemol, a hot drink and take to bed, although one would not advise aspirin for small children because of the side-effects.  That is the way it is managed.  It is not a mass vaccination programme.</P>
    <P>The question of the high bed occupancy was raised.  There is a high bed occupancy and always has been.  The history of hospital beds is that you will always have patients to go into hospital beds; you will never have a situation where you have plenty of empty beds. Any of us in the Houses of the Oireachtas would question a situation where the health boards, or indeed the Government, maintained a large number of empty beds at a very high cost of staffing those beds just on the off-chance that we might have a flu epidemic.  I do not think that makes very good sense medically <Col N="1342" /> because I believe the resources should be targeted where they are needed.  They are certainly not needed manning empty beds on the off-chance that we might have a flu epidemic.  I believe nobody in this House would thank anybody who maintained a few wards on the off-chance that there might be an epidemic of one description or another.  I can assure Senator O'Reilly, and indeed the Seanad, that we monitor the situation continuously in relation to particular illnesses and indeed to particular epidemics and whatever contingency arises we have arrangements in place.  We will be able to deal with it.</P>
    <P>On the question of the vaccine itself, the World Health Organisation monitors the prevalence and the strains of influenza worldwide.  On the basis of this they recommend to each member state the likely types of influenza organism that would come during the winter.  The World Health Organisation also recommend the vaccine type most likely to be of value in combating the current year's strains of influenza.  During the 1988-89 northern hemisphere winter the influenza season began earlier than usual in November 1988 and outbreaks were observed in Japan, Europe and North America.  During the period two subtypes of influenza strain have been circulated, sub-type A, hini being more widespread than sub-type B, H3N2 except in the USA where influenza B predominated.  In April 1989 the World Health Organisation recommended that the vaccine for use in 1989-90, the current winter, should be trivalent and should contain the following antigens.  While I appreciate that this is somewhat technical, it is important to have it on the record because of the various strains and because it is one of the reasons why vaccine is not stacked up from year to year. The antigens they recommend were an A Singapore 686 strain hini-like antigen, an A Shanghai/11/87; H3N2-like antigen and a B Yamaga/16/88-like antigen.</P>
    <P>In May 1989 the Department of Health advised each health board of the World Health recommendations following which health boards made arrangements <Col N="1343" /> with the suppliers to purchase their estimated requirements of the vaccine.  Supplies of the vaccine, which would have been more than adequate to deal with a normal situation, had been brought into the country during the late summer and the early autumn, which was the appropriate time for people to have vaccination against influenza.  As I said, 125,000 people are vaccinated against flu each year which is greater than the number who get the flu.  The doses are distributed through the health boards to provide vaccination to priority groups, the priority groups being the elderly, particularly those who suffer from a particular illnesses like chest disease, diabetes, kidney disease.</P>
    <P>The report of an influenza epidemic in the United Kingdom has created a certain level of pain which has resulted in a very high level of demand for vaccine.  This, in turn, has led to a run on stocks of the vaccine and the present stocks have now been used up.  The Department of health have been in touch with suppliers around Europe in an effort to seek further supplies, I am glad to report to the Seanad that despite international competition and shortages a further 20,000 doses will be in the country on Friday, 15 December, and a further 5,000 doses will be delivered early next week.  However, I have to point out that influenza vacine takes approximately six months to manufacture so that it is not possible to simply mass produce further vaccine at a moment's notice.</P>
    <P>The short life of the vaccine has to be considered.  This is related to the fact that it may be a different vaccine for each <Col N="1344" /> season depending on the particular strains of the influenza that will come during the winter.  The World Health Organisation advise on what strains will cause influenza in a coming winter and then the manufacturers produce a vaccine to meet the demand.  For that reason the manufacturers would not produce more vaccine than is necessary or that might be demanded during the coming autumn, which is the usual time for people to be vaccinated.</P>
    <P>The manufacturers would only produce and supply the vacine in accordance with the expected demand.  Having estimated the likely requirement earlier this year prior to any indications of a possible epidemic they have only limited supplies available at the moment.  As I say, we have received confirmation that we will have a further supply at the weekend.  That supply will be made available through the health boards.  It will be targeted at those at risk, the elderly and those suffering from specific illness that I mentioned, chest disease, heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes.  It will be available to them.  I can assure Senator O'Reilly that it will also be available to medical card holders free of charge.  As I said, there is no evidence from the health boards that there has been any complaints about patients being charged.</P>
