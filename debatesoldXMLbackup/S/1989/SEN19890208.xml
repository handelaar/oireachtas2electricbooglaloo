      <P>I have notice from Senator Brian O'Shea that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to clarify if she intends to proceed with the proposals for the privatisation of the school transport scheme in Counties Laois, Sligo, Cavan and Clare.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator John A. Murphy of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The recent large increase in the number of experiments on animals.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Paddy McGowan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the special problems in promoting tourism in the Border areas.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator John Connor of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to intervene to stop the precipitated closure of St. Patrick's Psychiatric Hospital, Castlerea, at any time during the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators O'Shea, Murphy and Connor as suitable <Col N="2026" /> for discussion.  I have selected the matter raised by Senator O'Shea and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m.  Senators Murphy and Connor may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret I have to rule that the matter raised by Senator Paddy McGowan is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the ground of lack of Ministerial responsibility.  I have spoken to the Senator today about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of all the times I have been called upon to speak in this House since my election almost eight years ago this is probably the one that has caused me the greatest astonishment.  I would have thought that the obvious purpose of this Bill was contained in the Title which is to clarify to members of the public the fact that almost all Members of the Oireachtas &mdash; at least that used to be the position &mdash; were far from rich, and in many cases were extremely badly off, and in the process to remove the stench of a suggestion of corruption that goes around this House by clarifying for the public that Oireachtas Members are not lining their pockets by their presence here.</P>
      <P>This is a change in my own position from what I would have articulated eight years ago.  Therefore, it is astonishing to me that anybody would want not to argue about either the principle of the Bill or indeed the detail of the Bill but to suppress publication of the Bill.  Whatever my own views are on the subject, a failure by this House to allow a Bill which would simply state in public what most Members of this House would assert to me in private &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The motion before the House is very narrow.  All I am asking you to do is to move for leave to allow it to be printed.  You cannot make a Second Stage speech.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very grateful for your guidance as to how I can explain <Col N="2029" /> why a Bill should be printed without talking about what is in the Bill.  I have no intention of making a Second Stage speech but I would appreciate your guidance on that matter.  As always, I am subject to your rulings.  May I simply say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think you have made it quite clear why you want the Bill printed in what you have already said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand you had told me that what I had said was out of order.  I am sorry if I misunderstood you. The point I have made, a Chathaoirligh, is that this is a Bill about which I thought there would be little controversy, judging by what I am assured to be the position of most Members of the Oireachtas.  I thought it would be a contribution to something that I value and you value dearly, a Chathaoirligh, which is the restoration of the profession of politics to a very high view in the eyes of public opinion.  I think the failure to print this Bill &mdash; and this is a specific issue to do with printing the Bill &mdash; will lead public opinion to a conclusion that somebody somewhere has something to hide.  I think in the interests of all of us this Bill should be printed and I am astonished, amazed and not a little annoyed at the refusal &mdash; I want to make this clear &mdash; not to pass this Bill, not to discuss it, but to allow it even to be printed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my recollection, the last time the House voted not to allow a Bill to be printed was a considerable number of years ago.  The previous Government never refused me permission to have any Bill published.  I am deeply disappointed, <Col N="2030" /> deeply offended and somewhat annoyed that this Government have taken a much narrower view of their role, of public opinion and of the functions of this House.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to strengthen the controls on water pollution contained in the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977 and the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959.  It forms a key element of a comprehensive programme of measures to combat water pollution which was adopted by the Government in November 1987.  It is appropriate, therefore, that before dealing with the specific provisions of the Bill itself I should discuss briefly some of the wider issues involved.</P>
      <P>Water pollution is not a new phenomenon in Ireland.  Over 150 years ago, for example, commissioners of inquiry into the state of Irish fisheries heard evidence in various parts of the country about discharges to rivers from dye-houses, tanneries and other forms of industry which were having very injurious effects on salmon and other fish.  Growing concern about the effects of water pollution in the 19th century led to the enactment of the Rivers Pollution Prevention Acts in 1876 and 1893.  However, because Ireland was not a highly urbanised and industrialised country, water pollution did not pose a major problem until the sixties when we experienced rapid development of industry, major growth of urban centres, and the development of intensive agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1971 a national survey of water quality revealed that while Ireland's waters were in the main unpolluted, some 7 per cent of them were seriously polluted.  This disturbing finding indicated a need for a more comprehensive approach to water pollution control.  Accordingly, an interdepartmental committee was established to investigate the nature and extent of the problem, the adequacy of the existing legislative controls and the need for fresh legislation.  The committee's recommendations led to the first comprehensive legislative response to the problem in the form of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977.  That Act provided for the introduction of a system of licensing controls for trade effluent discharges as a means of tackling the pollution problems posed by industry.  It also gave local authorities a wide range of <Col N="2033" /> powers to control pollution from diffuse sources &mdash; powers which have been used extensively by local authorities and to great effect.</P>
    <P>In particular, section 12 of the Act, which provides for the issue of notices requiring measures to be taken to prevent water pollution, has proved to be a most useful tool in the hands of the local authorities in their ongoing efforts to eliminate the problem.  However, the high number of serious water pollution incidents which occurred in the summer of 1987 indicated that some strengthening of the law was needed and that the controls on pollution from diffuse sources, in particular, needed to be extended.  I am confident that the House will agree that the present Bill is an appropriate response to this need.</P>
    <P>The fallacious notion that Ireland's waters are now very polluted has gained surprisingly wide currency.  I want to knock this firmly on the head as it could do tremendous damage to our country were it to be believed abroad.  It cannot be restated too often or too strongly that Ireland's waters are amongst the cleanest in Europe.  The most recent survey of national water quality published in 1987 revealed that 74 per cent of Irish waters were unpolluted while a mere 2 per cent were seriously polluted.  The percentage of waters which is seriously polluted has dropped from 7 per cent to 2 per cent since 1971.  The bathing waters monitored for compliance with our stringent national bathing water quality standards have also proved to be of exceptionally high quality.  Our major problems as regards water pollution are the incidence of slight and moderate pollution, and the need to control once-off pollution incidents such as fish kills which can have dramatic effects and which, if not effectively tackled, could distort the overall picture in relation to water quality here, with serious consequences for tourism and our economy generally.</P>
    <P>Another notion that needs to be dealt with is the idea that central and local government are not serious about dealing with water pollution.  This notion crops <Col N="2034" /> up in many different forms.  One reads, for example, that only a handful of people are available to deal with pollution.  The fact is that, excluding the pollution officers employed by the fishery boards, local authorities have 62 engineers, 70 technicians and 15 chemists employed primarily on water pollution control activities, together with 16 technicians engaged on hydrometric work which is essential to the control of pollution.  In addition, 71 local authority administrative staff committed 32 man years to water pollution control activities in 1987. The large number of staff deployed on these activities by local authorities, at a time when there is pressure on financial resources and a decline in overall public service numbers, is a clear reflection of a real commitment to protecting our water resources.</P>
    <P>I want also to deal with the allegation that local authorities themselves are the biggest polluters or that local authorities are above the law.  The facts again tell a different story.  Local authorities can be and are prosecuted by the fisheries boards if they are guilty of pollution.  It is important to note, however, that of the fish kills caused annually only a small fraction are caused by local authority discharges. For instance, of the 44 fish kills recorded in 1988, only one was caused by a sewage discharge.</P>
    <P>I believe that water pollution control functions can be carried out effectively at local level, that local authorities are ideally placed to evaluate the risks to water resources and to plan appropriate response measures and that the authorities have demonstrated in recent times that they have the ability and the determination to carry out these tasks satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>As part of their pollution control functions, local authorities must ensure that the waste disposal systems which they operate and maintain are run to the highest possible standards and, when necessary, that capital investment is undertaken to remedy deficiencies in existing systems.  The need for local authorities to pay particular attention to this matter was specifically brought to their <Col N="2035" /> attention by my Department in 1988 and each authority was issued with guidelines and advice on the key areas of sewage treatment to which they should give regular and detailed attention.  In addition, the local authorities have, at my Department's request, identified the individual sewage discharges which are contributing to pollution and this information is being taken into account in planning the overall sanitary services programme.</P>
    <P>In recent years, considerable amounts of capital have been devoted to providing and upgrading local authority sewage treatment and disposal facilities.  Since 1980, nearly £300 million has been invested by local authorities for this purpose, using finance made available by my Department and, as a result, considerable progress has been made in eliminating pollution black spots.  New sewage treatment plants have been provided in towns such as Portlaoise, Fermoy, Carlow, Malahide, Swords, Killarney, Ardee, Listowel, Cavan, Tullamore, Newcastlewest and Blessington to mention but a few.  This programme of action to tackle pollution from municipal sources has borne results: water quality surveys show a significant reduction in serious pollution of rivers and streams since 1971 and much of this reduction is directly linked to the investment which has been made.</P>
    <P>In 1989, over £62 million is being provided for the sanitary services capital programme. This provision will allow us to fund work in progress, including some important pollution abatement schemes, as well as giving sufficient scope to approve new urgently needed schemes. In deciding on schemes to go to construction in this and the coming years, the House may be assured that due weight will be given to the importance of building on the progress already made and ensuring that local authorities are enabled to play their full part in the drive against water pollution.</P>
    <P>In addition to pursuing national priorities, we are fully committed to the implementation of European Community's water pollution directives.  In <Col N="2036" /> 1988 alone, I made three sets of regulations giving full effect in Irish law to the bathing water, fresh water fish and drinking water directives.  Last year, I increased the number of beaches monitored for compliance with the national bathing water quality standards from seven to 52 and I have recently consulted local authorities on the question of bringing other beaches within the regulations.</P>
    <P>Looked at in the European context, we are one of the few countries lucky enough to have waters which are to a large extent unpolluted.  The Government intend to ensure that this continues to be so.  That is why the present Bill is, as I have already said, but one element of a national programme of measures to combat water pollution.  Already much of the programme, which was formulated as a response to the high number of serious water pollution incidents in the summer of 1987, has been implemented with very satisfactory results.  The programme involved an integrated approach towards the problem of pollution.  It ensured that resources were effectively targetted on the areas in most urgent need of attention.</P>
    <P>In particular, a great deal of effort was devoted to reducing pollution from diffuse agricultural sources which were the source of a large proportion of the 1987 fish kills.  This does not imply that farmers are the only cause of water pollution; on the contrary the programme contained some measures directed at all polluters and some directed solely at industry.  For example, all local authorities were requested to review the licences to discharge trade effluents which have been issued under the Water Pollution Act and to issue revised licences, with stricter conditions, where necessary.  The programme as a whole set out to address all of the areas where existing controls are insufficient but the main area where this was found to be so was that of pollution from agricultural sources.  In this context, it must be remembered that the use of land for agriculture, forestry or horticulture is exempt <Col N="2037" /> from planning control and that quite substantial agricultural structures can be erected without planning permission.</P>
    <P>The success of the integrated approach adopted in dealing with the problem of water pollution from agricultural sources is already apparent.  Measures aimed at the identification of problem farms, measures to assist farmers in making their farms pollution free and activities designed to increase awareness amongst farmers of water pollution were adopted. The farm surveys carried out in each county by multi-disciplinary task forces led by local authorities proved to be a very worthwhile exercise.  In 1988, over 12,000 farms in high pollution risk areas were surveyed.  Of these. 45 per cent were found to pose a medium to high pollution risk and the local authorities concerned will ensure that the farmers involved take all measures necessary to make these farms risk free.  Some local authorities have indicated that they intend to continue with the surveys this year and I have recently asked all local authorities to consider doing so.</P>
    <P>To assist farmers in carrying out necessary pollution control works, the Minister for Agriculture and Food negotiated an extension of the western package scheme to cover such works.  Farmers in all disadvantaged areas, which comprise nearly three-quarters of all farm land, can now qualify for grants of 55 per cent of the cost of slurry and silage effluent storage facilities.  Young farmers can qualify for grants of 69 per cent.  So far, over 7,500 applications have been made for such grants.</P>
    <P>The activities of ACOT &mdash; and now TEAGASC &mdash; have played an important role in heightening awareness among the farming community of agricultural pollution and in assisting individual farmers to design and carry through the necessary measures to avoid or eliminate pollution. The establishment of a specialised environmental advisory service by ACOT was a particularly important development as was the organisation's environmental awareness campaign.  This was one of the most intensive campaigns ever mounted by the advisory service, <Col N="2038" /> involving public seminars and practical demonstrations; open days at agricultural colleges and extensive publicity and media advertising.</P>
    <P>Some 300 seminars and practical demonstrations attracted up to 20,000 farmers. Many of these events were held in conjunction with the local authorities and the farming organisations and it is only proper that I should place on record my appreciation of the full co-operation and support which these organisations gave to the campaign.  Additionally, 30,000 farmers attended national and regional events at which large-scale pollution control exhibits and demonstrations were staged.  A large number of articles and special supplements on environment topics have been published in the national, local and farming press and over 60,000 booklets, leaflets and newsletters were distributed to farmers by the advisory service.  In addition, a booklet on farm pollution prepared for the Department of Agriculture and Food in association with my own Department has been distributed free to 200,000 farmers around the country.</P>
    <P>Coupled with the increased emphasis on education and awareness activities has been a more vigorous use by local authorities of the enforcement provisions of the Water Pollution Act.  The number of prosecutions taken by local authorities under the Act trebled in 1987.  While some of this increase can be attributed to the increase in the number of pollution incidents, it also reflects the tougher line being taken by local authorities with offenders, at my request.</P>
    <P>While it is still too early to say whether the programme of measures will have a lasting effect, all the information to hand to date indicates that it will.  The dramatic drop from 122 to 44 in the number of fish kills recorded in 1988 is a most encouraging result.  It is essential, however, that we do not become complacent.  While the immediate and most serious threat to our waters has abated somewhat, the need remains to ensure that there is a reduction in the still significant proportion of slightly and moderately polluted waters. <Col N="2039" /> This Bill, by providing a more comprehensive and effective legislative basis for action by local authorities and fishery boards will help to meet that need.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself is a complex one and I do not propose to attempt a detailed section by section discussion of it at this stage, particularly as an informative explanatory memorandum has been circulated with the Bill.  There will, no doubt, be much discussion on individual sections of the Bill on Committee Stage and I wish to assure the House that I will be willing to consider very carefully any amendments which are put forward to improve it.  I will confine myself, therefore, to a summary of the main provisions of the Bill.  These can be broadly grouped into three categories, namely, those provisions which strengthen the penalties and sanctions for water pollution offences, those provisions which clarify sections of the 1977 Act which, with experience, have been found to need clarification and those provisions which establish new controls on particular forms of pollution.</P>
    <P>The increased sanctions and penalties form an important part of this Bill.  It is a sad fact of life that research, education and financial assistance on their own will not solve the problem of water pollution. There will always be a hard core of polluters who will only respond to the threat of heavy penalties and sanctions.  The principal idea underlying this Bill is that the polluter will pay.  To this end, the Bill provides for: an increase in the maximum fine on summary conviction to £1,000 (from £250), the increase to apply to both the Water Pollution and Fisheries Acts; a new maximum penalty of £25,000 on conviction on indictment (increased from £5,000) and/or imprisonment for a period of up to five years instead of two years, the provisions to apply to both the Water Pollution and Fisheries Acts; an amendment of the &ldquo;good defence&rdquo; provision in the 1977 Act to put a greater onus on the person charged to prove that he could not reasonably have foreseen that his act or omission would cause pollution of waters and the introduction of a similar <Col N="2040" /> good defence provision for offences under section 171 of the Fisheries Act, 1959; the extension to any person of the right to apply to the courts for an order seeking the mitigation or remedying of the effects of a pollution incident, and making explicit provision for remedial measures such as the replacement of fish stocks and the making good of consequential losses suffered by any person or body as as result of the pollution; a new provision under which polluters will have a civil liability for any damage caused by the pollution; specific provision allowing the courts to grant both costs and expenses to local authorities against convicted pollution offenders.  In sum, these provisions amount to a strong armoury ranged against the would-be polluter.  Where the polluter previously ran the risk of prosecution by local authority and fishery board personnel, he or she will in the future also be liable to be proceeded against for damages by the party concerned.  This reflects the Government's desire to make it possible for the ordinary citizen to become involved in pollution control.</P>
    <P>Many of the provisions of the Bill are designed to clarify or expand existing provisions of the Water Pollution Act.  Principal among these are provisions for: extending the grounds on which a High Court order may be sought to cover situations involving a risk of water pollution; a clarification of a local authority's power to serve notices under section 12 of the 1977 Act regulating practices (such as silage-making and slurry spreading) which, in its opinions, could result in water pollution; a conferring on local and sanitary authorities power to obtain information on water abstractions, discharges to waters and activities or practices which are relevant to their pollution prevention functions.  Most of these provisions are fine-tuning provisions and provisions designed to fill lacunae in the 1977 Act which only experience of its operation could have revealed.</P>
    <P>Another group of provisions which I wish to mention are those which will enable specific sources of pollution to be <Col N="2041" /> controlled more effectively.  Three provisions, in particular, are worthy of note.</P>
    <P>First, local authorities are being empowered under section 21 to make bylaws regulating or prohibiting specified agricultural activities in their functional areas, or any part thereof, where they consider it necessary to do so in order to eliminate or prevent water pollution. There will be a right of appeal to the Minister who may confirm or annul the by-laws, or direct that they be amended in a specified manner.  The Minister may require a local authority to make such by-laws where he believes them to be necessary.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, use of land for horticultural and agricultural activities is exempted from planning control and it would be quite unrealistic to alter this situation on a general basis.  However, the new provision will give the local authority or the Minister power to regulate agricultural activities in a specified area if this is necessary to eliminate or prevent water pollution.  It is not envisaged that this measure will need to be widely used but it may be necessary to use it where the nature and extent of certain agricultural practices and the preservation of the aquatic environment of the locality in which they are carried out are clearly incompatible.</P>
    <P>The second provision I wish to mention is section 22 which will empower local or sanitary authorities to treat each discharge of trade effluent into a private drain as a discharge to a sewer for the purposes of the Act.  Up to now, only the combined effluent from the drain could be licensed under the Act and this has led to difficulties in identifying the origin of the particular effluent responsible for a pollution incident.</P>
    <P>A third provision which is worthy of mention is contained in sections 5 and 13 which will greatly increase the powers of local authorities to carry out reviews of trade effluent discharge licences.  At present, these licences cannot be reviewed within three years of their being granted unless the discharge endangers public health.  The new provision will allow local authorities to review licences <Col N="2042" /> where the discharge could adversely affect any beneficial uses of the water.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to detain the House unduly by dealing with all sections of the Bill individually and this, in any case, would be more appropriate on Committee Stage.  I am confident that the House will agree that the Bill will serve to achieve the objective which we all share, that is, to strengthen and clarify the law and ensure that the nation's waters are well protected from pollution. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It was at an international conference in Cork in November 1987 that the Minister first announced details of the Bill which is before the Seanad today.  It is regrettable that it has taken such a long time for this legislation to come before the House.  Nevertheless, I welcome what the Minister had to say today.</P>
      <P>Despite major improvements in the means available for waste treatment and disposal, water pollution continues to be a major concern in many countries. Increased demand for water for domestic and other purposes, particularly those of agricultural origin and the increasing production of new chemical compounds, are the factors responsible for this continuing concern.  In Ireland, water quality and pollution are matters which have caused us some concern in recent years.  In the fifties Ireland was almost pollution free. The World Health Organisation report of 1954 concluded that in relation to Ireland water pollution was not regarded as a real problem and there was no strong public opinion on this topic.  The situation then could be attributed to a relatively small population density with the bulk of the population located in coastal areas and a poorly developed agricultural and industrial base.  Since the early sixties the situation has changed significantly by a very substantial increase in population, an increase of industrial activity and more recently the intensification of agricultural activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Investigations carried out to date suggest that the main threats to the quality of Irish fresh waters are lutrophication <Col N="2043" /> and short term pollution.  One of the worst problems we had in 1987 was from short term water pollution which caused over 100 instances of fish kills.  We have had sudden and serious incidents of pollution that have very obvious effects.  The long term effect of such incidents is difficult to assess.  Where they are of a once-off nature they seriously affect fish stocks.  These may be slow to recover and, therefore, angling waters are being affected and will require restocking.  A permanent reduction of stocks may result where short term pollution becomes a regular occurrence.  Recent surveys carried out by the Central Fisheries Board suggest that this situation has arisen in a number of our river systems.</P>
    <P>It is clear that waste produced in the agricultural sector has a great potential to cause pollution in inland waters compared to the industrial and domestic sectors. There are three main ways in which this can happen: failure to intercept waste at the point of generation, losses from the storage area and excessive run-offs from land on which waste is spread.</P>
    <P>From a purely technical standpoint there should be no difficulty in avoiding the first two.  Experience has shown, however, that poor planning, faulty construction and negligence in the areas of waste generation and storage on farms are often the source of serious pollution of surface and ground water.  Silage-making operations are perhaps the most often cited pollution sources in this context, mainly through failure to intercept the run-off.  I will come back to that point later.  In most cases, land spreading of agricultural waste is the only practical means of disposal.  While treatment systems may be used in such situations, they do not remove nutrients and the volume of waste for disposal is not much changed. When spreading procedures are carefully managed under favourable conditions, disposal of farm waste on land is a very effective means of water pollution prevention. The best results are likely to be achieved where there is a strong motivation to recover the fertilising value of the waste to promote crop growth.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2044" /> In Ireland, the amount of waste discharge from the agricultural sector is about 12 times greater than that from the combined domestic and industrial sectors. Pig manures which arise mainly in intensive-rearing operations and silage waste are generally regarded as having the greatest potential to cause pollution. Silage waste is a matter of particular concern. Silage-making has increased rapidly in recent years from five million tonnes in 1975 to 13 million tonnes in 1982 and to approximately 20 million tonnes at present.  Wastes from this activity have been associated with many fish kills and other instances of pollution in recent years.</P>
    <P>In doing some research on this Bill, I discovered that slurry can be 100 times and silage 200 times as polluting as untreated domestic sewage.  That is extraordinary: they are very high figures.  The third report of the House of Commons, a very interesting report entitled, &ldquo;Environmental Committee on Pollution of Rivers and Estuaries&rdquo; stated that in 1979 there were roughly 1,500 reports of farm pollution incidents associated with farm waste and by 1985 that had more than doubled to 3,500.  I will quote from paragraph 65 of that report:</P>
    <P>Widespread alarm was expressed to us on the topic of slurry and silage pollution.  For the most part waste pollutes high quality rivers which were previously clean.  This has been a factor in the net downturn in river quality in the past five years.  Water authorities saw spills of slurry and silage into water courses as one of the worst problems they faced and many other authorities expressed a genuine concern.  They also discovered that inadequate physical structures are generally regarded as the root cause of most slurry and silage incidents.</P>
    <P>According to the report, the poor physical structures, insufficient storage space and inadequate or irregular maintenance are the chief features which permit seepage of slurry and silage into clear waters. A similar problem then applied in England as we have in Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2045" /> In the Netherlands, farmers are restricted in the number of animals they are allowed to keep.  In both the Netherlands and West Germany the total volume of animal slurry to be spread over land can also be restricted.  Dutch farmers even pay a levy if they exceed the manure quota.  In Switzerland, slurry storage has to be of a capacity to be of sufficient size to cope with the number of animals kept. In Ireland a farmer can double his holding of, say, pigs without having to demonstrate any increase at all in his ability to handle the extra waste.  It is a weakness in the Bill that there is no regulation in it to deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment is on record as stating that the Government have specific measures to deal with the problem.  He said at a conference which I attended two years ago that there would be a survey of all farms, that county managers would be asked to organise task forces comprising of local authorities, the fishing boards and farm development services and that these task forces would survey farms to identify potential sources of water pollution.  They would start by identifying priority areas for inspection taking account of rivers that had been affected by pollution.  Having listened to the Minister's speech today, I am glad he has fulfilled that promise and that the work has been carried out.</P>
    <P>The Minister also spoke on that occasion of a programme being prepared under three headings: information, awareness and attitude change leading to behavioural change.  Surveys of European attitudes reveal a lower level of environmental awareness in Ireland than in any other European country.  The lack of awareness presents a major obstacle to all environmental protection activities. To change that will require a coherent programme of environmental education, coupled with encouragement of public participation in environmental decision-making and implementation.  The education programme should aim to provide the public with clear and concise information on the relevance of environmental protection.  This will lead to the widespread adoption and practical <Col N="2046" /> implementation of a conservation ethic. This ethic should be based on a respect for nature, a recognition of responsibility for and inter-dependence with other species and the appreciation of the finite limit of natural resources.</P>
    <P>Wide-ranging measures are required if progress is to be made towards this ideal, both within the formal educational system and through informal education aimed at the whole community, especially at community leaders.  Television, radio and newspapers are the major sources of information for most people and I believe the State should play a leading role in keeping the public informed on conservation matters.</P>
    <P>As well as the ability to react to items of conservation interest in the media, it is necessary to ensure that attractively produced educational material is available. The Minister for the Environment on that occasion indicated that the Department of Agriculture and Food were releasing a brochure to provide guidelines on standards for farmers on the collection, storage and disposal of animal slurry and silage effluent.  I am very pleased to hear today in the Minister's speech that that brochure is now in the hands of every farmer.  I must say I am deeply impressed by what the Minister had to say in relation to the response from farmers to the problem of pollution. The fact that 7,500 young farmers applied for grants is very gratifying and the attendance at the seminars of 20,000 people in the farming community also shows that the farming community are interested in dealing with this problem of pollution.</P>
    <P>While I accept that the vast majority of farmers are highly responsible in their approach to preventing water pollution on their farms, effective action is still needed as a matter of urgency to deal with the irresponsible minority causing the problems.  That is one of the reasons I welcome the Bill here today.</P>
    <P>Besides agricultural pollution, there is also industrial waste which causes pollution. Industrial waste pollution is 12 times less than agricultural pollution.  The relative lack of heavy industry in this <Col N="2047" /> country suggests that Irish waters are fairly free from and are uncontaminated by potentially toxic substances such as metals which are present in industrial-based countries.  Nevertheless there are, as the Minister pointed out, emissions from industrial estates which do cause pollution and some of these are, of course, related to agricultural processing as well.</P>
    <P>I would like to come now to the question of domestic waste.  The Minister spoke on that at length in his speech.  The regulatory authority for pollution is the local authorities.  They have been guilty of causing pollution themselves in the past and that is one difficulty I have with the Bill.  I will quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 9 April 1988:</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation may face legal action if it fails to take action after complaints by county councillors in Kildare of pollution of the River Liffey.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation takes between 43 and 45 million gallons of water each day from the Liffey and in doing so discharges aluminium sludge into the river from a water extraction plant. The aluminium is used to remove sludge from the extracted water.</P>
    <P>Anglers claim that the spawning grounds of trout and salmon have been destroyed while a £1.6 million treatment plant, lies idle.  There was a counter-charge from the Dublin Corporation side in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 27 June 1988:</P>
    <P>Kildare County Council was strongly criticised yesterday for allegedly permitting the lower reaches of the River Liffey to become an &ldquo;open sewer&rdquo; as a result of effluent discharges from its overloaded sewage treatment plant at leixlip.</P>
    <P>Mr. Pat O'Molloy, Secretary of the Dublin and District Salmon Anglers' Association, claimed that raw sewage was pouring into the river from the outfall pipe.</P>
    <P>Last year, the fisheries board threatened to prosecute Kildare County Council over the pollution <Col N="2048" /> caused by the Leixlip sewage treatment plant.  But the council said that the problem could only be dealt with effectively if they receive funds to extend and upgrade the treatment plant to cater for its catchment population.</P>
    <P>So there is evidence that local authorities themselves do pollute.  I am glad to see that the Minister said in his speech today that they are not above the law, that local authorities can and will be prosecuted. The Minister might be good when he is replying to indicate to me the number of times that local authorities themselves have been prosecuted by fishery boards for causing this problem.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote now from a speech made by Mr. Paul Toner from the Water Resources Division of An Foras Forbartha.  In a paper he read at a conference in Cork, &ldquo;Fresh Water Pollution in Ireland &mdash; Does it present a problem?,&rdquo; he said:</P>
    <P>The resulting data are mainly intended to detect and reflect the effects of more or less continuous discharges of waste, e.g. from sewage treatment plants.  In the last decade, particularly, there has been considerable pollution of rivers and streams due to short-term release of high strength wastes either due to accidents or through negligence.  The most common effects of these occurrences are fish kills but contamination of abstracted water for public supply has also been reported.</P>
    <P>So local authorities themselves have caused this problem.</P>
    <P>In passing I would like to make a reference to Dublin Bay.  It is said that the bay is seriously polluted.  I do not subscribe to that.  I know we have taken steps recently to stop the continuing discharge of raw sewage into the bay.  While I do not accept that the bay is seriously polluted, I have to say that I am not satisfied with the quality of the water in it.  It leaves a lot to be desired.  It is a wonderful amenity for over one million people in this country.  Dublin Corporation only have a <Col N="2049" /> primary treatment of sewage.  It is stored in tanks and after some time the sludge is disposed of at sea.  This primary treatment is a primitive kind of treatment; it needs secondary and tertiary treatment if we are to have a very clean bay, free from pollution.  That is the kind of bay I would like to see.  I make my point now because, unfortunately, as a member of a local authority I have not seen the plan which the Government are going to send to Europe for extra regional funding.  I hope they will have in that plan an application that Dublin Corporation be provided with funding for secondary and tertiary treatment at the works in Ringsend.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the Bill is complex. I think he is right and I am going to deal briefly with the sections of the Bill. Section 3 amends section 3 of the Principal Act.  First, it takes a more serious stand on the liability of the person involved with water pollution.  The 1977 Act took a more lenient stand and it used terms such as, &ldquo;reasonable care&rdquo; and &ldquo;good defence&rdquo;.  This left open a wide gap for the defendant, but in the 1989 Bill the provision has been worded in a more prosecuting tone.  The defendant will now be held liable if he has reasonably foreseen any signs of emission or previously acknowledged that it might cause pollution.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of section 3 would allow the Minister the power to restrict, attach conditions to or appeal any or all of the previous exemptions.  This is an excellent provision because it leaves room for new knowledge of wastes and their effect on the ecosystem.  It should provide the Minister the power to restrict an exemption which might be found to be hazardous to the environment without having to amend the present legislation.</P>
    <P>The new provision in section 5 of the Bill which amends section 7 of the Principal Act extends grounds on which reviews will be conducted.  It also empowers a local authority not only to amend the licence upon completion of review but also gives powers to the local authority to revoke a licence.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill amends section 10 of the Principal Act.  Under the Principal <Col N="2050" /> Act the Minister for Fisheries, the local authority or a fishery board were entitled to go to court.  Now, under section 7 of this Bill this right has been extended to any person to seek a court order requiring a person responsible for causing water pollution to mitigate or remedy any effects of the pollution in a manner and within the period previously specified by the court.  Under this section the court may order the polluter to pay the costs incurred by the applicant in bringing the investigation in the first instance.  This will have the effect of making the public very conscious of their rights to bring to the attention of the courts an irresponsible action of polluters.  This section also sets down in some detail what a court order may require of someone who has polluted a waterway.  This includes the restocking of a river or a spawning ground and the removal of any pollutant which may have affected the waters and also making good in compensation to a person who has suffered on account of the pollution.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill concerns sanitary authorities and local authorities wider powers to intervene directly to prevent or deal with water pollution instances. Section 21, which I welcome very much, allows the local authorities to make the by-laws regulating or prohibiting specific agricultural or other activities such as silage-making where they consider it necessary to prevent or halt water pollution.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House today certainly strengthens the powers of local authorities in dealing with the problem of pollution.  It also allows them to prohibit certain activities that pose a risk to water pollution, the power to review licences, to discharge effluent, the placing of a greater onus on defendants in pollution cases to prove that he or she could not have foreseen that they would cause pollution. I hope all these measures, as well as other measures in the Bill will have the desired effect in reducing and eliminating pollution.  Of course, there will be some people who will continue to pollute our rivers and lakes but at least when this <Col N="2051" /> legislation is passed they will have to pay for the damage they do.</P>
    <P>Sections 24, 25 and 26 of the Bill provide for substantial increases in the penalties in relation to people who are guilty of polluting our rivers and lakes.  There is an increase in the maximum fine on summary conviction from £250 to £1,000 and the new maximum panalty on conviction on indictment of £25,000 up from £5,000, or five years imprisonment, or both.  Of course, here we are talking about maximum fines.  It will be up to the court to interpret what fine should be imposed but I hope that in imposing fines they will take into account, that all polluters up to now have got off rather lightly and that it is the wish of legislators and of the public as a whole that stiffer fines should be imposed so as to eliminate this problem in our society.  Pollution can only be eliminated when everyone in the community plays an active role in combating it.</P>
    <P>I conclude with a quotation, again from Paul Toner's paper entitled, &ldquo;Fresh Water Pollution in Ireland &mdash; Does it Present a Problem?&rdquo;.  Speaking at a conference in Cork in mid-1987 he said:</P>
    <P>Despite some recent deterioration, Irish freshwaters continue to compare favourably with those in many other European countries.  This is a result, mainly, of a relatively small amount of waste generated and requiring disposal in inland areas.  However, the generally satisfactory condition of these waters and the pollution-sensitive uses which they support, create a need for a relatively stringent level of protection. Recent developments, viz. the occurrence of short-term pollution events, with serious effects, such as fish kills, and the more insidious pollution represented by eutrophication, indicate that the present level of protection is deficient.  Preventing and reversing these developments and ensuring the continuance of the presently good quality of the bulk of the country's freshwaters are likely to present a major challenge to the regulatory authorities in future years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2052" /> I hope that the measures which are before the Seanad today will help the regulatory authorities in protecting our waters from pollution and for that reason I very much welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and there are very few people in the country who would not share that view.  Indeed, Senator Doyle has stated as much also. As the Minister has said, it is a complex Bill and, like the Minister, I believe the proper place to make a contribution on the different sections is on Committee Stage where we will be playing a greater role.  I am particularly pleased that the Bill has been introduced in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I will confine my contribution to a few general comments on different areas within the general heading of water pollution. Before I start, I would like to comment on the criticism of local authorities because to some extent I have great sympathy for them.  I believe that in all cases, without exception, the problems arose because local authorities did not have the finance to provide proper water treatment plants or facilities.  If they had the finance, they would have provided those treatment works.  The same applies to the individual farmers throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier today Senator Brendan Ryan sought to introduce a Bill whereby Members of the Oireachtas would be compelled to declare their interests.  I would like to declare my interest and say that coming from a rural area I would have great sympathy with farmers.  I think that perhaps people from urban areas would not be familiar with the day-to-day problems they must face in order to make a living.  Farmers play a major part in the economy of the country and I would have to say that in instances where pollution has occurred it was never, in my experience, deliberate.  To be critical of local authorities, without at the same time coming to terms with the problem of providing finance, is not very satisfactory.  It is an area that would be outside the terms of this Bill but obviously local authorities have a very important role to play with regard to pollution and I feel that the <Col N="2053" /> only way they can do so is to get the finances that are necessary.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention a few general areas with which I am familiar with regard to this Bill.  I have brought to the attention of the Department of the Environment many instances where representations were made to me with regard to pollution in my own area.  One of these would be typical of many instances and I will relate it very briefly. It is the situation where a bungalow has been built about two miles from a town and the man and his wife who built the bungalow are not engaged on farming. At considerable expense they built their house with their own hands.  They had a well provided which was quite satisfactory but about two years ago the water became contaminated and representations were made to the health board.  I must say that the response by the health board was instantaneous and left nothing to be desired.  It was established that the pollution was caused by slurry from an adjoining farm.</P>
    <P>In such a situation the Minister has a responsibility to steer a middle course.  It is fair to say that the farmer was not entitled to do anything that would cause pollution to his neighbour's well.  On the other hand, and again I think this is typical of what happens on a widespread scale, that house was built in a rural area by people who must have known that some considerable degree of inconvenience would be caused by moving into a farming community, although not perhaps to the extent that the water would be polluted.  It is a fairly widespread problem, as I have said, and looking at it in the general sense it would seem reasonable that in an agricultural country anybody moving into an area where farming is carried out would expect this inconvenience.</P>
    <P>I have noted from a High Court case last year that this does not seem to be the view of the courts.  The health board determined that pollution was caused by slurry.  The person concerned is unable to use the water from his well because it is polluted, the farmer must continue with his farming, and presumably the <Col N="2054" /> farming he is engaged in is not prohibited by legislation so there is an impasse.  A man has paid a considerable sum of money to get water from a well but the water is now polluted and cannot be used and there the situation rests.  I think this Bill would deal specifically with problems of that kind.</P>
    <P>If it is determined that an individual is responsible he must pay in all cases although I see a question mark with regard to pollution on a large scale.  What happens in a situation where somebody who causes pollution is unable to pay?  It seems to me that the problems caused by pollution are always very costly to resolve.  I cannot see any instance where the problem is not a costly one and perhaps that brings us into the general area of industry and commerce.  There is the question of whether farmers or those engaged in areas where pollution is possible should have to take out insurance policies and thus increase their overheads. It is a very complex area.  A similar situation has arisen not far from where I live.  An old man and his wife, both of whom are nearly blind, have had their well polluted and there is no redress. Again, I must say the health board have been very helpful and also Meath County Council and anything they could do was done.  This Bill gives the power that is necessary and I welcome that very sincerely.</P>
    <P>May I refer very briefly to another area where I have particular concern, that is, the provision of dwellings where it is necessary to provide a septic tank.  A couple of years ago Meath County Council carried out a major survey of water pollution in the area contiguous to the Dublin border and it was determined that pollution was caused to the water by septic tanks.  Of course, there is a very heavy concentration of dwellings and septic tanks in the particular area.  Perhaps some considerable revision is necessary with regard to the legislation dealing with septic tanks.  Again, this is a very complex area.</P>
    <P>I know we have the document SRI 1976 which was drawn up by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  It was <Col N="2055" /> a very comprehensive document but I am not sure that everything that is done is done strictly in accordance with that document.  I would simply point out that two experiments are generally necessary in order to determine the suitability of soil for a septic tank and for percolation from a septic tank.  One of them is to determine the level of the watertable which is simply a trial pit one metre square by two metres deep but another far more comprehensive test is also suggested, that is, the percolation test whereby the soakage capacity of the ground is tested.  This will determine the length of percolation drain that is necessary.</P>
    <P>In the past, and I think at the present time in some instances, soak pits were allowed.  A soak pit is simply a large pit filled with stones and covered with soil into which the liquid from the septic tank drains.  In the past the problem with regard to soak pits was that they were dug to a depth of nearly eight or ten feet. Therefore, the liquid passing through the septic tank was returned almost directly to the watertable and could and did cause pollution.  The percolation system is where shallow drains about two feet deep are provided and the water percolates or drains into the soil slowly and at a higher level so that by the time it reaches the watertable it is filtered and should be fairly clean.</P>
    <P>Referring to Senator Doyle and the primary treatment problems with Dublin County Council, their septic tank system is a very primary and crude system and it is time to have considerable research carried out in this area and to have sticker guidelines.  For example the document, SRI of 1976 would allow a septic tank to be situated 23 feet from a dwellinghouse but according to the rules for a new house grant the distance should be 60 feet. There is a difference there; most local authorities would go for the 60 feet. Looking at it realistically, the distance of a septic tank from the house is not of great material value.  It is the distance the percolation area is sited from the house. <Col N="2056" /> There should be uniformity and that should be looked into.</P>
    <P>As I have said on other occasions it is an anomaly that in this day and age we have not succeeded in having something more refined and positive with regard to the treatment of domestic waste in rural areas in particular and I would ask the Minister to look at that.  I understand there are certain reservations with regard to the regulations at present.  I have been given to understand that they may be due to be updated and I would ask him to take that into consideration because it applies to such a large area and, as I have said, in particular to a very extensive portion of County Meath.  I have no doubt that the same would be true of large areas of Kildare.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle spoke about Dublin Bay and it would be wrong if, in passing I did not also make a few comments with regard to the problem there.  I was a member of the Joint Committee on Building Land and this matter of the pollution of Dublin Bay arose on a number of occasions.  I know representations have been made to the Minister and to the Department of the Environment on many occasions and, indeed, these studies have been published with regard to Dublin Bay.</P>
    <P>While I agree with Senator Doyle that perhaps there is no serious problem of pollution, there is at least a very high nuisance value in the particular part of Dublin Bay where there is a concentration of waste.  Local authority representatives have been taken out there to view it at first hand.  I realise that the problem is a financial one, although perhaps with regard to Dublin Bay there may be more than a financial problem because there is the difficulty as regards the provision of sufficient water to get the necessary dilution.  Nevertheless, in the long term if we have money we can solve anything.  The problem is to provide the finances and within present constraints I cannot be too critical of the situation in Dublin Bay other than to say it is not acceptable.  I am thinking of other areas also.  Further north in Bettystown and Laytown, some of the loveliest <Col N="2057" /> strands along that area.  The effects, I am sure, are felt up there.</P>
    <P>On other occasions in the past, at least once when we were dealing with pollution, I referred to a portion of a song which the Members of the House I am sure know very well and perhaps have sung on occasions, that is:</P>
    <P>As red as the rose that in yonder garden grows,</P>
    <P>as fair as the lily of the valley,</P>
    <P>as pure as the water that flows from the Boyne,</P>
    <P>my love is fairer than any.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the waters that flow from the Boyne are not as pure as they could be or as they should be.  I have seen pollution at first hand in the Boyne and in its tributaries.</P>
    <P>In my youth I spent much time fishing in the little streams and rivers around my home where I seldom caught a trout but I enjoyed it just the same.  I know the great problem then was the poachers. The poacher came and waited until it was opportune and then took all the fish out of the little streams and rivers.  I remember seeing a poacher at work and it was somewhat like watching an author at work.  He took all the fish that were worthwhile but that is nothing compared to the problems in recent years.  The poacher left the small fish behind but pollution kills everything. I have seen in Kells on a number of occasions where those engaged in angling after a serious case of pollution brought the fish into the town for a demonstration, to have a photograph taken for the local papers.  These were big fish.</P>
    <P>In the context of tourism, as has been mentioned by Senator Doyle, fishing means a great deal to this country not only angling but fishing in all its forms.  I have mentioned before that whereas the salmon can be sold for £2 or £3 per lb, the coarse fish &mdash; pike, bream, perch, roach &mdash; in tourist terms could be worth £1,000 per lb &mdash; maybe many times more &mdash; because of the number of tourists that come to this country to fish.  As I have said, I have seen the huge salmon taken from the Blackwater and shown there locally.  I suppose in a sense that was the <Col N="2058" /> least part of the damage and the harm that was done.  All life was killed at that time.  Even apart from the tourism potential, the people who live in the area, who fish these streams, the locals have been deprived of the pleasure of fishing.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that many of the small lakes in north County Meath have been more or less pollution-free and I hope this will continue.  One of the lakes I have mentioned many times before is the beautiful lake of Ballyhoe to the north of Drumconrath.  I remember reading a refrain in the local paper a long time back, some local poet spent many hours in trying to speak about and bring to others, the beauty of that lovely little lake, Ballyhoe.  He spoke of: &ldquo;Where perch and troutlets smoothly glide beneath the reeds in Ballyhoe.&rdquo;  I hope all the lakes in the County Meath will remain the same.</P>
    <P>I have travelled most of the Boyne valley in recent years and it is sad to relate that in one particular part of it where no buildings can be seen because they are well hidden from the road, unfortunately, on approaching a certain bend in the road the smell and the nuisance make it oppressive to pass.  I know this applies also to other areas in Cavan and outside the Meath border and I regret that that is so.  In that beautiful area of the Boyne valley &mdash; and it is a beautiful area &mdash; this is totally unacceptable.  While the Minister has stated that farmers have considerable scope with regard to the erection of buildings, they are constrained to a considerable extent where slurry is concerned but I am not too sure that the legislation with regard to slurry is adequate to deal with the problem. There is that inhibition and that constraint, and I do not think farmers can do whatever they feel like doing.  With that kind of development, where there is a concentration of slurry, the laws certainly have not been strict enough.  I make a distinction there between the owners of that type of industry and the small farmer trying to make a living.  The problem is a major one.  The siting of these industries or buildings is most important and the <Col N="2059" /> Minister could very well introduce directives that would help local authorities.  I know he has done so in the past and I know that local authorities have cooperated. In passing, I would like to pay a tribute to the local authorities because in my dealings with them over many years I have never once been disappointed with their reaction.  Never once.  I may not have been in agreement with what they did but I certainly could not carp with the way that the matters were handled and dealt with.  The Minister has paid a tribute to the local authorities and I, too, would like to pay that tribute to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that water pollution is not a new phenomenon in Ireland and of course it is not but we never had a problem of this magnitude before.  In one case of pollution in a stream or tributary of any river there is the capacity to destroy all the fish life in that river for miles.  Obviously the Minister has made his comments from reports but that is not the picture that emerges certainly around the countryside.</P>
    <P>He also referred to once-off pollution and the need to control it.  Of course, it is the once-off pollution that is the serious problem.  I am sure that in a situation where an individual causes pollution, that individual will be watched and the local authority, if it is to fulfil its duty, must pay particular attention to areas where problems have occurred before.  I agree that local authorities are serious about water pollution.  As I have said at the start, there is this problem of finance and that is the only constraint, I believe, that they work under.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned that farmers in all the disadvantaged areas, which comprise nearly three-quarters of all farmland, can now qualify for grants of 55 per cent of the cost of slurry and silage effluent storage facilities.  Young farmers can qualify for grants of 69 per cent., and so far over 7,500 applications have been made for such grants but what about the sectors outside the disadvantaged areas?  Costs are the same and in the disadvantaged areas there are other incentives which farmers can claim. <Col N="2060" /> Grants should be provided where the problem of pollution would make it well worthwhile for the State to spend money of that magnitude.  When the Minister talks about three-quarters of all farmland, what about the other quarter where farmers still have to obey the laws and prevent pollution and they have no grants?  It is unfortunate.  In the past grants have been issued as a means of redistribution of wealth in a way which, I suppose, could not be generally commended. In this particular instance, if we are to be serious about the problem grants should be available nationwide.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated very clearly that the principal purpose of this Bill is that the polluter will pay and Senator Doyle also underlined that.  I simply want to ask the question, what happens if the polluter cannot pay?  I appreciate that in regard to most Bills passing through this House Members ask not alone that the legislation be passed but that the Government provide sufficient funds to implement it but in this case extra finance is not required from the Government.  I would like the Minister in his reply to deal with this particular area, where somebody who has caused pollution is unable to pay.  I do not think it solves the problem to make somebody responsible if that individual has not the capacity to compensate the State or to redress the situation. Does it come to the point where somebody engaged in any activity which might cause pollution would have to take out an insurance policy would have to be indemnified and, therefore, increase their costs?  Again, the cost of insurance in a situation like that would be enormous.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned extending to any person of the right to apply to the courts for an order seeking the mitigation or remedying of the effects of a pollution incident and the explicit provision for remedial measures such as the replacement of fish stocks and the making good of consequential losses suffered by any person or body as a result of the pollution. Then he said:</P>
    <P>In sum, these provisions amount to <Col N="2061" /> a strong armoury ranged against the would-be polluter.  Where the polluter previously ran the risk of prosecution by local authority and fishery board personnel he or she will in the future also be liable to be proceeded against for damages by the party concerned. This reflects the Government's desire to make it possible for the ordinary citizen to become involved in pollution control.</P>
    <P>I appreciate very much that the individual is given this right and this role but, I do not think in any instance that everything is cut and dried, even in situations I have known where the health board have carried out surveys and extensive research on problems.  There is always a hazy area. I know there will be instances where a specific problem arose because an individual or an industry failed to carry out the proper procedure but in other instances it may not be as clear-cut as that.  Therefore, I would like to discuss that area in some detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Finally, I appreciate that local authorities are being empowered under section 21 to make the necessary by-laws regulating or prohibiting specified agricultural activities in their functional areas or any part there of where they consider it necessary to do so in order to eliminate or prevent water pollution.  This arises to a large extent with regard to exemptions from planning control.  As I have said, the exemptions by and large are fairly limited, limited in their scope with regard to siting, where there are dwellings nearby, and <i>vis-á-vis</i> rivers.  So, while in a general sense it is necessary in an agricultural country to do as much as possible to help the farmer, and certainly not make things more difficult for him, this is an area that will need some teasing out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am not sure the problem will be solved totally in this legislation because there are very strict views in some areas with regard to planning controls and there is also the fact that local authorities and other State bodies do not have to apply for planning permissions.  The ESB, for example, do not have to apply <Col N="2062" /> for planning permission and by and large most people would consider this unacceptable. For example, the situation has arisen in the past where people living in an area had no knowledge that a housing scheme was to be erected close by and the first indication they had was when the contractor arrived on the site.  That is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The whole area of planning control, which in itself is a very extensive area, comes into play.  It is important that on the further Stages of this Bill we deal with that.  As I have already stated, I would like the Minister in particular to give some consideration to the situation with regard to septic tanks, to have it re-examined, to look at the surveys that have been carried out, to see clearly what the problems are and to bring forward perhaps a revision of the regulations which would make it mandatory to carry out whatever works are necessary to eliminate pollution and at the least expense to those who are doing the work.</P>
    <P>I believe this is very fine legislation and I know it will be welcomed by all sides of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of comments on the Minister's speech I wish to raise before I go into the body of my speech.  There is an alarming complacency in some of the Minister's statements. It is important to keep a clear view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of great joy to me that serious pollution as defined by An Foras Forbartha &mdash; the Minister probably remembers the name of An Foras Forbartha, even if he does not remember An Foras Forbartha &mdash; is very low.  It would be a national tragedy of the first magnitude if serious pollution as defined in the water quality survey by An Foras Forbartha were to be anything other than minuscule.  I suppose since we are all in politics we will not fight with the Minister for leaving out a couple of things.  I am referring now to the summary Part I, &ldquo;General Assessment of Water Quality in Ireland&rdquo;.  The incidence of pollution of some degree in Irish rivers was identified in 69 per cent of the rivers surveyed about <Col N="2063" /> 11 to 15 years ago.  That figure had increased, &mdash; this is slight or moderate pollution &mdash; to 83 per cent in the most recent survey.  While it is gratifying to notice that the small percentage of serious pollution has been, and I happily acknowledge, significantly reduced, the more serious underlying fact is that the incidence of moderate or slightly polluted waters has increased from about 10 per cent some 15 years ago to close to 24 per cent in the most recent survey.</P>
    <P>That is a dangerously unhealthy trend because you cannot suddenly produce a partition and say, &ldquo;This is all right because it is not seriously polluted&rdquo;. Damage to our environment is not a quantum leap matter; it is a continuity. You build from slight pollution into moderate pollution, into serious pollution. The truth is, the scale of pollution in our rivers appears from the figures to have increased in the past 20 years, if you go back to about 1971 when the first surveys were done.  That is not a cause for complacency. It is not something that should have been left out of the Minister's speech, because it is part of the record of information.  I would have to take issue with the Minister on the issue of staffing. The Minister has said that 62 local authority engineers, 70 local authority technicians and 15 local authority chemists are employed primarily on water pollution control activities.  I want to quote from a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> dated 6 November 1985 from the chief executive of the Central Fisheries Board.  He first of all asserts &mdash; the Minister can dispute this &mdash; that the then Minister:</P>
    <P>has been repeatedly told by the Local Authorities of their inability to fully implement the functions given to them by the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, due to lack of the necessary resources,</P>
    <P>This is what the chief executive of the Central Fisheries Board said.  It is a matter of opinion.  Later, in the same letter he says and I quote:</P>
    <P>... over the past five years staff of <Col N="2064" /> the Fishery Boards have investigated between five and six thousand incidents of pollution each year and have instituted prosecutions in an average of 70 instances per year.  This effort, mainly carried out by 10 pollution officers attached to the seven regional fisheries boards' compared very favourably with that of the combined activities of the local authorities, which have not exceeded two thousand investigations in any year and whose prosecutions for pollution have averaged about thirty per year.</P>
    <P>So what this man seems to be saying is that ten pollution officers attached to the fisheries boards investigated three times as many incidents of pollution as 62 engineers, 70 technicians and 15 chemists and managed to end up with twice as many prosecutions as 62 engineers, 70 technicians and 15 chemists.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister to clarify that for me at some stage in his reply because the figures do not knit together.  He is either being generous in his interpretation of the phrase &ldquo;primarily employed on water pollution&rdquo; or else the chief executive of the Central Fisheries Board who presumably is a competent and able civil servant is wrong.  This letter was written four years ago and the perhaps the whole thing has been transformed in the past four years, but given the incidents in the summer of 1987, I do not think we have any reason to believe that there has been a dramatic transformation.  I have to express scepticism about the reality of the Minister's figures.  I am not saying he is inventing people, but I suspect that he is attributing a workload to them or a work priority that may not conform to the realities of operations on the ground. I will just repeat that three times as many investigations and twice as many prosecutions were carried out by ten people as were carried out by the local authorities whom the Minister says have a staffing of 70 technicians and 60 engineers, giving a total of 130.  I await with interest the Minister's comments on that.</P>
    <P>Before I address the issue of water pollution <i>per se,</i> it is important to say a <Col N="2065" /> few things about our environment and our attitude to it.  Some of these are important philosophically.  They may not make wonderful headlines, but it is no longer enough simply to regulate pollution. It is no longer enough to say we will tolerate a particular level of pollution. The problem facing the entire population of this planet is that no level of pollution beyond that which the environment itself can dispose of is acceptable. We cannot even begin anymore to allow low levels of pollution.  The whole world ecosystem is beginning to move into serious imbalance and this is true because of the damage that is being done to the natural water supplies of much of the developed world.  It is being done because of the devastation to the forests of many of the developing countries.  It is being done because of the increasing incidence of residual pollution, not only in the seas but in the sediment at the bottom of the seas.  All of those things are gradually identifying for us the beginnings of the warning signals of a major ecological crisis, which cannot be dealt with simply by adjustments to slightly better regulations.</P>
    <P>It is important to say that the whole question of the environment has been treated a little too simply as being a little package where as long as we keep below certain standards there will be no problem. However, things are beginning to accumulate in the air, in the water, in the food chain that are going to reside there indefinitely and there are fundamental questions about industrialisation, about intensification of economic growth as an objective in itself, that deserve at some stage to be addressed as much as the issue of one particular form of pollution, water pollution, which we are dealing with today.</P>
    <P>I do not want to appear to be anything other than consistent with my own professional involvements.  It is, of course, perfectly possible to maintain a well developed society with an ecological balance and I do not mean even a slight deterioration in the ecology, I mean a balance, an equilibrium where we do not <Col N="2066" /> do a continuous and gradual job of deterioration. It is not good enough simply to reduce the level of deterioration so that we do not notice it in our lifetime.  We hold this world in trust for future generations and we have no right to offer them a future that is more unpleasant than the lifestyle we have had ourselves.</P>
    <P>A number of things need to be clarified here.  It is perfectly possible to produce almost everything we need for a good enjoyable, healthy, comfortable lifestyle without destroying the environment.  It is perfectly possible to run profitable, modern industries in all areas of activity without destroying our environment.  It is nonsense to tell people that there must be even a slight trade-off between enterprise and environment, or between jobs and pollution.</P>
    <P>First of all it is scientific nonsense and secondly it is economic nonsense in the context of this country.  It is precisely because this country has at least the record of being unpolluted that various areas of economic activity can be successful for us.  The obvious one is tourism. The continuing spectacle of the wilful neglect of the physical and the visual environment of many small towns and rural areas means, I suggest, that we are happily going to get rid of that asset too.</P>
    <P>The second asset is the whole agribusiness in this country.  The single greatest asset which we will have in the future, is that we are going to produce food from a clean environment.  Not only would it be idiotic in terms of damaging our own health, it would also make no economic sense to trade off any of that.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, many of the industries that are coming here, most ironically given the controversy of Merrill Dow in my home county of Cork, are looking for a site that will enhance the image of the product they are producing.  Merrill Dow made it clear at the public hearing in Cork that the reason they chose a rural farming setting was because that was where they wanted their product to be produced because of the image that would give to a health care product on the international market.  Whatever my views on Merrill Dow &mdash; and my own position is fairly <Col N="2067" /> clear: I have no objections to Merrill Dow if I could trust the enforcement procedures and if I could be sure that the local community could get access to adequate information and to continuing independent monitoring etc. &mdash; I have no problems with the chemical industry <i>per se</i>.  It is ironic that if we do not preserve that environment it is not companies like Merrill Dow that we will get, but those who will come to use our polluted environment. We will begin to move on a downward spiral which will cost us all the effort and all the resources and all the money and the enormous ill health that other countries have suffered as a result of incorrect and improper environmental policies.</P>
    <P>My advice to the Government and to the Minister and to all those dealing with environmental issues is &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo;. There is no case for tolerating any deterioration in standards.  There is no case for tolerating any kind of gradual conditioning that we cannot have everything perfect in terms of the quality of our air, water and the food chain etc.  There is no reason that they should not remain as good as they were before this country began to industrialise.  It is one of the regrettable facts of industrialisation that, unlike other countries who have managed their industrialisation both in terms of growth and in terms of their environment far better than we have, we had to wait until things happened before we dealt with water pollution.  We have now to wait until after things happen to deal with air pollution.  We have now the spectacle of being one of the smog capitals of Europe to advertise our tourist industry.</P>
    <P>I think this is a most regrettable fact because the problems could all have been foreseen.  I know enough about science and enough about engineering to know full well that the damage to our waterways and the damage to our air was all perfectly capable of being foreseen.  We put our heads in the sand &mdash; it is not any particular Government or Minister that needs to be blamed for that, but a succession of Governments.  Because there was no immediate loud public demand <Col N="2068" /> for high quality sewage works, for high quality water pollution protection, for high quality air pollution protection, we put it on the long finger and now we are paying the price.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly feasible to plan industrial development, to plan urbanisation, to plan all of those things, and not be stuck with the unpleasant consequences as if nobody could have anticipated them. Once we switched, for instance, our fuel policy from oil to solid fuel in the light of the oil crisis in the seventies, it would have become apparent to anybody that we might have a smog problem, but we did not do anything about it.  Once we decided to develop large scale industries it must have become obvious that unless we planned to protect our waterways then damage would be done.  Once we decided to encourage more intensive farming with more intensive use of silage and high levels of fertiliser, it must have been clear that this was going to produce an environmental hazard.  I notice that one of the more serious environmental hazards and risks of the future identified by An Foras Forbartha is one that is treated only by intent in this Bill, by enabling people to do things but I will come back to that later on.</P>
    <P>The Minister has, albeit belatedly, launched a campaign on waste recycling. I thought he had launched a campaign &mdash; I am not sure whether he is laughing because I am mistaken about his launching the campaign or whether he is laughing because I accused it of being somewhat belated.  We do not have a national policy on waste.  Various studies on waste recycling have identified that unless there is a national collection process developed, and a national policy for dealing with recycling of refuse, for instance, it will be uneconomical.  Most forms of waste recycling are done successfully in countries that have a far better performance both economically and environmentally than us.  We have had an advertising campaign on recycling waste.  If the Minister thinks it is a funny matter, I do not.  I find it astonishing that countries that are four times richer than <Col N="2069" /> us find it well worth their while to persuade people to separate their refuse into different kinds of receptacles so that what is recyclable can be recycled.  If that is a laughing matter, I regret it; but I think it is an indication of our economic inefficiency.</P>
    <P>On the issue of agricultural effluents, I have here a document supplied to me from a particular private company which is involved in the development of silage and other effluent digesters to produce methane.  The interesting thing is that this organisation would suggest that on a large farm of 250 acres it should be possible to provide from the slurry energy in the form of gas, composts of a far less polluting nature and liquid effluents of a far less polluting nature to the value of about £36,000.  I would be slow to argue with the private sector.  Whatever else they might be bad at, they are usually good at the bottom line.  This is a private organisation trying to make a living from this business.  Perhaps as well as regulating and preventing pollution, the Minister might consider talking to his good friend and mine, the Minister for Energy, and suggesting that we should look at the whole idea of not just dealing with large farms but dealing with a scheme for the reuse of farm effluent to produce energy &mdash; or perhaps we are afraid that An Bord Gáis's operation might be undermined by the small farmers of Munster?  I doubt it. I suspect it is a lack of foresight, a lack of vision and the fact that we have not found anybody else that has done it first. We in this country, regrettably, in recent years are less and less inclined to do anything that somebody else has not done first.  Could I just remind the Minister of this since he is on a recycling enthusiasm at present?</P>
    <P>I think there are a number of things that need to be said about dealing with any environmental issue and particularly dealing with environmental issues within this country.  In terms of this country, I would like to suggest a number of things we need to do in order to develop economically and to preserve that most precious of economic assets that we have, which is our clean environment.  It is one <Col N="2070" /> of the most fundamental flaws in the whole of the debate to suggest that those two things are somehow in conflict.  As well as being a human resource and an environmental resource, our clean air, our clean water and our healthy environment are our most precious economic resource &mdash; precious in terms of the industries we can build on it, precious in terms of the sort of people we can get to work here, precious in terms in the sort of way we can advertise and sell this country in the future.</P>
    <P>To achieve that, we must have standards; and the standards must not be some derogation from the standards that apply in western Europe.  Our standards must be higher than those that apply in Western Europe.  We do not have that at present.  We are not prepared to tolerate higher standards, for instance, in the emissions from the Moneypoint power station.  We must also satisfy our people that those standards are and can be enforced.  That means that all emissions which might dilute those standards must be adequately analysed, that the information contained in such analyses would be publicly disseminated and that all such monitoring and analysis would be carried out by agencies and in a manner which guarantees to the satisfaction of Irish public opinion that these things are being done independently.  The nub of a considerable part of the controversy in this country about industrialisation etc. is the complete collapse of public confidence in the independence of many of these agencies.</P>
    <P>The Minister's decision to abolish An Foras Forbartha and substitute it with a hamstrung environmental research unit bound by the full rigours of the Official Secrets Act is not the way to advance public confidence; neither is the unfortunate proposal in this Bill to abolish the Water Pollution Advisory Council.  The &ldquo;trust me, I know what I am doing&rdquo; style of Government is not the way to win public confidence on an issue like this. While I would be dishonest if I were to suggest that the pollution of the environment is an issue on which people will <Col N="2071" /> or will not choose to vote for a Government, it is also true that in terms of industrial development ultimately everything takes place at local level &mdash; building factories, closing down factories, polluting rivers, cleaning up rivers, discharging sewage into rivers, taking sewage out of rivers.  You can talk in global terms as much as you like, but ultimately it happens in one place and it starts in one place.</P>
    <P>Until we have trust restored people will be suspicious.  As is evident from a number of industrial developments in recent years and as is evident from the conflict that has surrounded many developments in recent years, we do not have that kind of trust.  That kind of trust will only come when the monitoring of the standards, which should be set at the highest level, is believed and seen to be independent.  It will only come when, having identified those standards, having clear public knowledge of what those standards are and having clear public knowledge of breaches of those standards, the public can be satisfied that breaches will be dealt with with the full force of the law.  That, of course, means that resources must be available.  I referred to that earlier and I will not go back to it again.  I will simply say there appears to be a conflict between the Minister and the Central Fisheries Board about what resources are available or how they are being used.</P>
    <P>During the Hanrahan case the fact that Merck, Sharp and Dohme were apparently found to have breached the planning regulations in terms of discharges into the river on 100 separate occasions and had never been prosecuted is not the way to persuade the community that there is a real independent enforcement mentality among local authorities.  Notwithstanding perpetual complaints from local residents, Cork County Council have so far failed to locate the source of a particularly offensive odour that has offended many people in Cork Harbour, and this is not the way to persuade people that we have the resources, the independence, the diligence etc. to protect <Col N="2072" /> our environment.  What we need, in my view, and what is lacking from all of our legislation to deal with water pollution is a real environmental protection agency, independent, adequately funded with the staff and skills to set standards, to monitor standards and to enforce standards with whatever rigour is necessary.  This cannot be done by local authorities which are tangled up in the business of employment, in the business of local pressure groups etc., because the short term view can often lead people in the wrong direction. What we need is an independent agency.  While EOLAS is a fine body, the truth is that EOLAS also works for industries, for instance, as well as being the agency which often advises on standards to be met by industries.</P>
    <P>Legislation is not needed to set acceptable standards.  The various bodies that need powers have the power to set standards. It would be necessary, in my view, to set up an independent agency by legislation because one of the unfortunate facts about An Foras Forbartha is that it did not have a legislative base and therefore could be abolished by ministerial fiat.  This is most regrettable but, nevertheless, not an awful lot could be done about it.</P>
    <P>If we are going to begin to win people's trust, then we have to persuade them that something is going to be done.  We need to look at the facts.  The first fact, and the Minister did not advert to, is that the incidence of pollution of our waterways is actually going up.  The incidence of serious pollution is not, but the incidence of pollution is nevertheless increasing. There are not as many rivers that are almost dead, which is what serious pollution means, but there are a considerably increased number that have traces of pollution which did not have it 15 years ago.</P>
    <P>A letter I got from Earthwatch in Bantry suggests the way not to persuade people that we are in earnest about tackling pollution.  For instance, it is impossible to find out the precise details of many of the licences given to agencies that are discharging liquid effluent.  You can find out who has a licence but you cannot find <Col N="2073" /> out what precisely they are discharging, how much heavy metal is in the discharge and how many other substances are in the discharge.  Again it is the &ldquo;trust me, I know what I am doing&rdquo; style of local administration and this will not create public confidence in the way the State protects our environment.  This will not happen until the public know what is being done on their behalf.  The freedom of access to information about monitoring, about standards, about discharges etc. is the only way to make sure that the public are reassured.  As I have been told by Earthwatch, that sort of information is not only not freely available but in many cases it is not available at all.  It is kept secret and this is not the way to win confidence and to persuade people to have trust in what is being done.</P>
    <P>If we are to keep a perspective on where we are going then it is a very good thing to look at how previous good intentions worked out.  Probably the best previous indicator of good intentions is the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977.  I read that Act with some interest shortly after the present Bill was produced.  One of the sections I was interested in was section 15, but rather than go into the legalisms of section 15, I will read briefly from the Explanatory Memorandum which was issued with the Bill when it was first produced in 1976.</P>
    <P>Section 15 deals with the making by local authorities of water quality management plans.  Such plans may cover any waters in or adjoining the functional area of the local authority but may include the sea only to such extent as the Minister may approve following consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. Plans...must contain such objective for the prevention and abatement of pollution and such other provisions as appear to the local authority to be necessary ... Copies of Plans, the making, revision or replacement of which will be a reserved function, must be furnished to the Minister, to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, to local authorities whose functional areas are adjoining and to sanitary <Col N="2074" /> authorities and boards of conservators in the functional area of the local authority.</P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Act states that: &ldquo;(a) local authority may and if so directed by the Minister shall make a water quality management plan.&rdquo;  I inquired &mdash; and this is 12 years after the 1977 Act was passed &mdash; about the present state of the water quality management plans and the information I was given by the Minister's Department was that a water quality management plan has been adopted for the Nore, the Suir, the Barrow and the Moy.  I was told for the Deel, the Cavan catchments, the Blackwater in Munster, Bantry Bay, the Lee, the Suir, the Nore, the Barrow Estuary, the Feale, the Lower Shannon, the Corrib, Galway Bay, Dublin Bay, the Liffey, the Slaney, the Shannon Estuary or for the Upper Shannon that the plans were in preparation. It is 12 years since the 1977 Local Government (Water Pollution) Act was passed and in the vast majority of our rivers and estuaries water pollution management plans are in preparation.</P>
    <P>In political terms &ldquo;in preparation&rdquo; is a bit like &ldquo;being considered&rdquo;, because you never say you are not doing it.  &ldquo;In preparation&rdquo; is a word that means, of course, we are now doing it, but we are not going to tell you when we are going to have it done.  That is precisely the position of water pollution management plans for most of our rivers and many of our estuaries 12 years after the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, was passed.  That is not the way to convince me or Irish public opinion, which is a good deal more important than me &mdash; or at least I am sure the Minister would be of that opinion &mdash; of good intent.  As far as I know, no local authority has been directed to produce a water pollution management plan.  What is quite clear is that only four rivers &mdash; the Nore, the Suir, the Barrow and the Moy &mdash; have had water pollution management plans adopted.</P>
    <P>Another section that is worth referring to in the 1977 Act is section 26, which says <Col N="2075" /> that the Minister may, after consultation with the Minister for Fisheries, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, any other Minister who appears to him to be interested and the water pollution advisory council &mdash;<i>requiescat in pace</i>&mdash; prescribe for the purposes of this Act quality standards for water, trade effluents and sewage effluents and standards in relation to methods of treatment of such effluents. Section 26(3) says that where regulations under this section relate to sewage effluent from a sewer or to waters to which sewage effluent from a sewer discharges, it shall be the duty of the sanitary authority in which the sewer is vested ... to take steps as soon as practicable to ensure that the sewage effluent complies with or does not result in the waters to which the effluent is discharged not complying with any relevant standard prescribed under the section.  The reason for that is that sewers are not actually covered by the provisions of the Water Pollution Act, 1977, because obviously since the local authority was going to be the licensing agent for trade effluents and sewage effluents from other sources it would be somewhat nonsensical to have the local authority licence itself.  The definition of standards for sewers was left to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Twelve years after the 1977 Act was passed no standards have been set for effluent from sewers.  I do not think that is the way to persuade Irish public opinion that we are in earnest about what is going on.  Certain standards have been specified under section 26, but according to the Department of the Environment no regulations in relation to effluent from sewers have been made in 12 years.  I say this not because any of this is the present Minister's fault.  He is not there long enough to be blamed for it all, but it does not convey to Irish public opinion the feeling that water pollution is being taken extremely seriously.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will assure me that local authorities &mdash; and he said this in his speech &mdash; are not a major source of pollution but the Minister did concede on &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo;, when there was a <Col N="2076" /> major controversy about water quality in Dublin Bay, that Dublin Bay was a bit of a mess and he advised the nation of what he was going to do about it.  But he also said that the standards in Dublin Bay were far from acceptable.  That is 12 years after the Act was passed and we do not have defined standards yet for sewage effluent or, if we do, the Minister's Department were not aware of them last week.</P>
    <P>Let me say also that public opinion &mdash; and I have great respect for the ordinary people &mdash; was perfectly well aware of an impending and increasing pollution problem because fish kills were increasing steadily, not just in 1987 but in every year.  They increased in 1981 and in 1982. They went down slightly in 1983 and went back up to 1982 levels in 1984; went down slightly in 1985 and back up in 1986 and took off in that horrific summer of 1987. I think that the average citizen is entitled to be sceptical about what is happening to our waterways, what is happening to our rivers and what is happening to our lakes.  Because he or she will have seen inaction in things that could be done under previous legislation, will have seen letters like the one I quoted from the Central Fisheries Board indicating that the ten pollution officers of the Central Fisheries Board seemed to do far more about pollution than the services of the entire local authorities of the country, will have seen the fact that fish kills were not just suddenly dramatically increasing in 1987 but had been taking off for a number of years, will have seen all of that and will be entitled to be sceptical.  This is where the present Government and Minister are particularly culpable because it is this Minister who has suppressed independent voices on the environment by closing down An Foras Forbartha which has effectively enabled his Department to monopolise information on the quality of our environment by being able to determine what will and will not be published; and so far, two years after the awful summer of 1987 they have not used some of the powers that are available to them under the 1977 Act <Col N="2077" /> to deal with some of the crises that were becoming evident.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is worth looking at the Bill with a slight degree of scepticism. There is, of course, a considerable amount in the Bill that is most welcome. It would be somewhat of a shock if a Bill on water pollution did not contain a good deal that was most welcome and for that the Minister is to be complimented. There is a lot to do with our environment that is not being dealt with under this legislation.  There is nothing really being done about educating public opinion about the false conflict between development and the environment that many people use to justify sloppy standards, the false conflict between agricultural development and the environment that many people use to excuse sloppy standards. If any Members have the good fortune to read the remarks of the President of the IFA, speaking at the Institute of Fisheries Management on 25 April 1988, they will notice that while he was prepared to say all the right things about the environment, it obviously meant that if he did not get substantial grants for his members not much could be done about it.  The fact that his members have profited quite substantially from many of these investments and have been grant-aided to develop them apparently is beside the point.  We have to educate people to the reality that you do not have a conflict between the environment.  You also have to make pollution less economical than the alternatives.  In terms of the eutrophication of waters, the excessive quantity of nutrients that are beginning to be evident in many of our waterways, it is worth thinking about taxation measures which would represent a disincentive to people to use excessive amounts of agricultural nutrients, which are beginning to find their way into the waterways and which are identified again in the An Foras Forbartha report as the single greatest problem, that gradual deterioration of our environment.</P>
    <P>As far as the Bill goes it needs to be dealt with in terms of those forms of water pollution that exist, because it is not a single homogeneous problem. <Col N="2078" /> There are a variety of forms of water pollution.  There is the diffuse pollution that will come as a by-product of agriculture and forestry.  There is sewage effluent, industrial effluent from industrial point sources.  There is the leakages from waste dumps, which is barely addressed in this legislation and which is a serious problem, particularly on the east coast.  There is the question of atmospheric inputs, which is referred to international conventions and which we seem to be somewhat reluctant to deal with ourselves.  There are discharges at sea, which can have a considerable effect on the coastal and the estuary environments. There are the accidents or the cowboy spillages, some of which we saw in that awful summer of 1987, and which do happen from time to time but which are not indeed the core of our underlying environmental water pollution problem. Then there are others, like mining activities, which we may well hear more about but which have manifested themselves in extraordinary high levels of zinc and copper in the Avoca River, for instance.</P>
    <P>As regards each of those areas of concern I would like to make a comment on the Bill.  As far as diffuse rural inputs go, the major proposal there is section 21 of the Bill which enables local authorities to make regulations &mdash;&ldquo;Regulation and prohibition of certain agricultural activities.&rdquo; This has to do with the problem identified by An Foras Forbartha which is a problem of the excessive quantities of nutrients beginning to be found in our rivers and which is causing the gradual loss of oxygen in the rivers.  Eutrophication is the word that is used but we do not want to use technical words here: I am sure the Minister understands them but I might not.  On that issue of eutrophication, section 21 is well intentioned but it will hardly work.  Is any local authority seriously going to make regulations in its area to tell certain people in agriculture that they cannot use certain fertilisers or certain levels of fertiliser because of the damage it would do to the water.  It would be a brave member of a local authority who would do it.  There are brave members of local authorities <Col N="2079" /> but I think it would be a brave member of a local authority who would actually begin to say to people: &ldquo;There is too much of certain products being used in agriculture in this country: you must stop doing it.&rdquo;  The only way to deal with it would be at national level, by setting standards or, as has been suggested to me, in the way the Dutch have done it by introducing a phosphate tax or something like that to reduce that sort of usage.</P>
    <P>On the question of sewage affluent, the complaint has been made to me that there is too much untreated sewage going into our waterways.  The Minister has detailed impressive figures of investment but, given our rapid population increase, the huge numbers of houses built, what we need to know and what the Minister did not offer us &mdash; perhaps he will give it to us in his reply &mdash; is whether our sewage treatment investment is increasing faster than our capacity to produce sewage or whether it is increasing slower.  Are we chasing behind a problem that is rapidly running out of sight or are we actually bringing the problem under control?</P>
    <P>The Minister on the programme &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; ceded that Dublin Bay in particular had a serious problem and he undertook to do something about it. It is difficult to persuade public opinion of good intent on the part of the State if it is almost impossible for people to find out, for instance, where secondary treatment plants are planned and what precisely is in mind because secondary treatment is not a very precise term. There are useful examples.  It has been suggested to me that, for instance, the authorities in County Meath are off-loading large amounts of offensive material in the Laytown-Bettystown area because it is the only point near the sea where they can dispose of excessive quantities of solid residues from their sewage treatment plants inland.  That is not the way to deal with an environmental problem.</P>
    <P>I could not find much in the Bill to deal with the problems of leach gates from waste dumps.  Waste dumps, by and large, are run by local authorities.  How <Col N="2080" /> do we ensure that local authorities monitor whatever is being leached out of waste dumps, whatever is being leached into adjoining rivers or indeed into the sea from waste dumps?  How do we do it? We do not, because first of all, the public has no right of access to the information, has no guarantee of independent monitoring and, therefore, has to go back to the &ldquo;Trust me; I know what I am doing&rdquo; mentality which I do not operate on.  I do not trust most people with my life or with my health.  I prefer to know what is going on.  It is extraordinary that giving somebody a licence to pollute or to make a discharge into a river exempts them from any civil liability.  I think it is perfectly reasonable to suggest that while people might be licensed on the basis of the best knowledge available, if it turns out that what they have done is a serious threat to the environment then they should share a part of the risk with the community.  If we, as a community agree to let people dump certain materials into a river and then it turns out to be far more harmful, we have suffered and those who did the dumping ought to suffer also.  There is no provision for that as far as I can see in the legislation.</P>
    <P>We could have heard more about atmospheric inputs.  Perhaps the Minister might talk about Annex V of the Paris Commission which I am reliably informed has done the rounds of a number of Government Departments and is currently lodged in the Department of Foreign Affairs having been in the Department of the Environment for about a year.  We would like to know what is going on.  Would the Minister perhaps tell us about Annex V on the dumping of litter from ships near the shore.  I gather we have to enforce that now because sufficient countries have ratified it.  Why did we not do it beforehand if we were determined to deal with the problem of water pollution?</P>
    <P>I think the Bill has a lot in it that is worth considering.  It has a lot in it that is a step forward but it suffers from the fact that there has not been a willingness to enforce standards up to now.  There has not been a willingness to do things <Col N="2081" /> like develop water quality management plans and specify standards for sewage effluent that would have indicated a real determination to ensure that this country remained one of the most unpolluted in Europe.  We have been nodding and winking for far too long.  Public outrage at the devastation of our fisheries and of our rivers in 1977 has forced something to be done, but at the end of it all the only way we will be able to deal with the problem of water pollution is if we can create a climate of opinion where standards are accepted, where standards are enforced, where people believe that the standards will be enforced, where those who are interested know what is going on, where those who want to find out more about effluent can get the information from the local authorities, where enforcement will be real.</P>
    <P>I have in my possession a letter from An Taisce to the newspapers in which they allege that only 2 per cent of pollution offences result in prosecution and that there has never been a prosecution by the DPP so that, in fact, the higher penalties which are threatened in this legislation and which were contained in the previous legislation could well be meaningless because they might not be enforced.  I should be glad to have this point clarified: the 1977 Act did make provision for daily penalties on the basis that if an offence is continued people will have to pay a daily fine but I cannot find a reference to daily penalties in the present Bill.  Perhaps the Minister will explain to me why not.  If you take £5,000 as the maximum fine in 1977 and £25,000 now, in real terms that is not an enormous increase, given the rate of inflation in the past 12 years.  If, therefore, the real cost of the large penalty has not increased that much, then in fact it is arguable that the elimination of daily penalties reduces the penalties that are available to enforce high standards of water pollution.</P>
    <P>I hope to put in a considerable number of what I believe will be constructive amendments to the Bill.  The Bill itself is, of course, welcome; we could do with more legislation on many other areas of <Col N="2082" /> our environment, in the areas of recycling, air pollution, and in a lot of areas that are poorly regulated and poorly legislated for.  In particular what we could give, within the issue of public involvement and public trust, is freedom of access to all environmental information that is in the possession of the State which is responsible for protecting our environment. That is the prerequisite for trust &mdash; that people actually know what is being done on their behalf; what is being said on their behalf; that information is being assembled on their behalf.</P>
    <P>One of the amendments I hope to put into this Bill is an amendment to guarantee access by the public to all monitoring data, to all analyses results, to all of the conditions attached to licences, to all the analyses of effluent that is being disposed of because that is the only way that you can persuade the public to believe that the matter is being taken seriously.  If not, public opinion in this country will fluctuate quite a lot between a considerable concern for industrial employment and considerable concern for agricultural development but, in my view, at local level on specific issues it will be increasingly hostile to industrial development and in the process the least guilty may well become the target of most of the opposition, leaving the new industry which, because it is new, will be most suspect, to be the target of most opposition. However, in the process of doing that and in the process of failing to maintain the highest standards in Europe, we will actually have undermined the most important economic assets we have, which are our clean environment, clean air and water and all that goes with that in terms of tourism, food and, indeed, industry in general.</P>

      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister and the Government on presenting us with this Bill which fills many of the gaps which existed in the 1977 Bill.  I know there have been many objections from the farming community in relation to some of the sections in this Bill, but it must be emphasised that the 1977 Bill was weighted heavily on the industrial side and there were serious ommissions in relation to agriculture.  These, for the most part, have now been corrected.</P>
      <P>I would like to support many of the things Senator Ryan has said in relation to standards.  I will not say it amuses me, but it never ceases to puzzle me that we always look to Europe for standards when, in fact, Europe is looking jealously at Ireland because of the situation we enjoy here.  As Senator Ryan said, we should really set our own standards; we should not be looking to Europe to set standards for us.  We can set our own standards here; we can proudly fly the flag and show the rest of Europe what we are capable of doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also agree with Senator Ryan in what he said about having reached this point where we have created a lot of pollution, which should never have happened.  I remember way back in what I would term black and white days in relation to film, when Lough Ennell was first polluted or when the signs were showing and the fishermen were objecting.  Nobody listened to them; nobody paid the slightest bit of attention to them.  They said the lake was going to be polluted and eventually it did become polluted.  If that situation happened today, hopefully it <Col N="2084" /> would not be allowed to continue.  It was a situation which, as Senator Ryan said, should never really have happened.</P>
    <P>This whole question of pollution is something we have only begun to face up to with any real seriousness in recent years despite the fact that both water and air pollution are the most serious environmental problems we face today. Pollution is not about killing a few fish and, therefore, spoiling some unfortunate angler's pastime.  I admire the Minister's optimism.  I love optimists, I am an optimist myself and, to be quite honest, I do not care very much for people who are always on the downward trend.  As I say, I admire his optimism, but there have been fish kills and the situation is really more serious than the Minister actually knows about.  If you are a fisherman, you would understand what the situation is.  Fish are a very good indicator of the condition of a lake or river and many of the small feeder streams which are nursery areas for young fish and provide spawning beds for adult fish are now completely dead.  In other words, the very indicators of healthy waters are not there anymore and if there are any further instances of pollution the signs are not immediately to be seen.</P>
    <P>Waterways are a part of the environment and by treating them carelessly we are putting our own lives in danger. In a certain area along the west coast today the local people are refusing to pay water rates to the county council.  The lake from which their water supply comes has been polluted to such an extent that the local doctor has warned of the dangers of drinking this water.  I know this lake because I fished in it myself.  I have a house in the area and we have used the water coming out of this particular lake. The pollution in this case has not been caused by farming or by industry but by effluent from septic tanks and sewage.  It is an excellent example of bad planning and carelessness and indicates how we can poison ourselves just by ignoring the rules.</P>
    <P>There is no mention in the Bill of transportation, Senator Ryan spoke of section <Col N="2085" /> 21 in connection with another matter. Millions of gallons of slurry are transported around the country.  Most of the time we do not know where it is going or what happens to it and I do think that this should be covered in that section of the Bill.  If anybody wants to know what river pollution costs to a fishery I would suggest they read the lecture given by Dr. Kennedy in 1985 to the Loughrea College of Agriculture and Food Technology.</P>
    <P>I will be speaking at some length and in more detail when the Bill reaches Committee Stage and, therefore, I do not intend delaying the House for much longer.  It is regrettable that the water pollution advisory body is being abolished. This, in my opinion, is probably the only really serious error in the Bill and it should be repealed.  There are many excellent amendments in the Bill, which close many gaps.  It is felt that significant improvements can still be made in the reduction of pollution from the industrial and domestic, that is municipal sewerage, areas.  The legislation for such improvements is in the place and is further strengthened by the current Bill.  It is to be hoped that the local authorities will increase their efforts to clean up their own discharges. It is also essential that they intensify their efforts, through the licence review system, to encourage the industrialists to further improve the quality of effluents.  That is really all I have to say except again to congratulate the Minister on this very important Bill.  Go raibh míle maith agat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  I have been reading the Minister's speech here today and it does appear to me that the Minister mainly dealt with two aspects or two bodies who can be accused or may be accused of causing pollution.  He mentioned local authorities and farmers in the course of his address.  I contend that pollution is a much wider issue than that. Pollution can, in fact, be caused by anybody or everybody.  Anybody who does anything to destroy or damage our environment is a polluter so that if we get down to the individual being aware that <Col N="2086" /> he is a polluter then we will get to the root cause of pollution and perhaps find a solution to it.  Senator Ryan said he welcomed the legislation and that we could do with a lot more legislation.  I dispute that because I think we could do with less legislation and more education and public awareness of the dangers and damage that pollution causes to our country, to our environment, to our lives and to the lives of people who visit the country. Pollution free water and a pollution free country can only be of benefit to us as a nation in selling our country for tourism and other purposes.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to pollution by farmers and the Bill states:</P>
      <P>... to put greater onus on the person charged to prove that he could not reasonably have foreseen that his act or omission might cause pollution of waters....</P>
      <P>Some speakers said that grave concern has been expressed by farmers at the introduction of this Bill.  Perhaps the mention of fines of up to £25,000 and/or five years in jail is enough to scare anybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann congratulates the Minister for the Environment on the urban renewal designation programme and considers that he should extend it to other suitable towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that this is a motion in which many Members have an interest and so I do not intend to take up all my time. However, I am happy to move the motion.  While I am not clear as to what Minister for the Environment should be congratulated, I recall that during the term of the last Government we spent <Col N="2087" /> many hours discussing different aspects of the Bill, as it was then introduced, with Deputy Fergus O'Brien, who, I must say, was most accommodating and forthcoming. At the end of the day we were responsible for legislation which many people felt would do a great deal for urban renewal.  I am not too sure if we have achieved the goal or if we are getting there.  I would like to hear the Minister speak on that and I look forward to his contribution on that aspect.  Clearly, there have been tremendous benefits.  As always there are areas in which many people feel disappointed and feel that much more could be done.  Initially, the problem arose because local authorities did not have enough power.  In trying to solve some problems they may have inadvertently created problems in other respects &mdash; for example, in housing.</P>
    <P>This scheme was introduced originally to cover the cities of Dublin, Waterford, Limerick, Cork and Galway.  As I recall, we spent a lot of time trying to convince the then Minister that there should be more areas involved.  In the city of Dublin, the area was in two parts and extended to 168 acres in all.  There are many people who feel that it would have been more beneficial if a greater area had been included.  For example, one of the areas designated in Dublin extended from near O'Connell Bridge to Henrietta Street and the other extended from the Custom House to Dorset Street and both sides of Gardiner Street.  There is a strong body of opinion that the whole area of Dorset Street should have been included. It has been brought to my notice that people arriving in this country for the first time approach this way and what they see is a rather derelict area.  In fact, when film crews want to portray areas in times past they use that area precisely because there has been so little change there in the last 50 years.  In certain circumstances this might be commendable but not with regard to what has taken place in that area.</P>
    <P>Granby Row should be included.  I specifically mention this with regard to <Col N="2088" /> the waxworks museum.  Even if my colleague Senator Cassidy is involved in that area, I do not think I should be inhibited in making a reference to it because, as Paddy Kavanagh has said on a number of occasions, I do not think I should be prevented from saying something because it is in favour of myself.  In this instance, the waxworks has been a tremendous success.  I understand it cost in excess of £300,000 to get it into its present shape and that it gave work to artisans, artists and skilled people.  I understand that last year a record number of visitors attended the waxworks.  When we look at the reputation Madam Tussaud's has, people like Senator Cassidy and entrepreneurs of that kind should be facilitated.  It is a pity that area was not included.  I suppose it is not too late in the day yet to do something about it.  I realise that in all areas some people will be dissatisfied.  But perhaps the representatives on local authorities, county councillors and urban councillors might be the best people to decide what areas should be included.</P>
    <P>As I have said, because local authorities did not have enough authority in certain areas they may have been responsible for not alone depopulating an area but for creating problems in other areas. I speak with regard to the unfortunate situation in Dublin and other centres where people were torn out of their environment where they had family associations and were housed in high rise flats and unsuitable housing schemes.  Problems were created for society and stresses of all kinds were introduced.  That was all unfortunate and it can be traced back to a large extent to local authorities and to the fact that they did not have sufficient power in certain ways.  As I said on previous occasions, people who were put into these schemes in the long run became criminalised.  They were decent people who were not responsible for the environment in which they lived.  Local authorities, when planning housing schemes should, as they do in different parts of Europe &mdash; in Sweden for example &mdash; consult with the people who are going to live in houses in particular areas.  Their <Col N="2089" /> views should be considered before they are finally housed.  To a large extent this would eliminate many of the problems and many of the crimes that arise because of alcohol abuse, drugs and so on.  The scheme which the last Government introduced was a commendable one.  No Member of the House at that time objected to the scheme.  However, we all at the time thought that it should be extended and that more should be done. More could have been done.  Subsequently the Government introduced a scheme to extend to Athlone, Castlebar, Dundalk, Kilkenny, Letterkenny, Sligo, Tralee, Tullamore and Wexford and I am sure that great strides have been made in those areas.  I look forward to the Minister's reply in that respect.</P>
    <P>There has been a great improvement in the construction industry.  I know it is seasonable at this time of year, but I attribute quite an amount of that success to the urban renewal designation programme. Employment must be a considerable aspect of this scheme.  Senator Doyle has spoken on many occasions with regard to re-population, trying to bring people back to an area which has been depopulated.  I am not sure, no matter how successful a scheme is if we will ever approach the original situation.  We have heard Senator McMahon on many occasions speak with intense feeling with regard to his experiences in this matter. The opinion of someone like that who has lived through the different periods, who has seen the good days and the bad, is worth taking into consideration.  I also realise that at the time the scheme was introduced the case was made that by concentrating on particular areas and not having them too extensive it was hoped to maximise the benefits of the scheme which are enormous.</P>
    <P>The situation, as it developed, meant that areas were depopulated; and I am not too sure if this was because they were no longer attractive or whether it was the other way around.  I am not too clear about that.  No matter what the situation was or whose responsibility it was local authorities did not have the essential power to prevent it.  No matter what they <Col N="2090" /> did they were inhibited and their hands were tied.  They did not have the necessary resources or legislation.  That situation still obtains and in the long term I believe any future scheme will have to take into consideration extending the power of the local authorities.  The local authorities and the elected members must live up to their responsibilities &mdash; not an easy thing to do.  In some instances it is a very difficult thing to do and a very difficult course to follow, but it is necessary.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment has, to some extent, played its part; but it could do more.  I have made the case many times that grant schemes should be organised and overseen by the local authorities.  This was done before by the Department of the Environment.  A Minister from my own county, the former Deputy Tully, introduced that scheme in County Meath.  From all accounts it was a complete success.  I would ask the Minister for the Environment to look at that again perhaps and to see if that could be done.  In the long term it would be cheaper to organise the schemes, they would be more efficient and at the end of the day the country would benefit.  As I said, there were problems with regard to defining the boundaries of those areas and I suppose there would be problems with regard to the selection of further towns.</P>
    <P>By and large, local representatives have the first obligation to their own areas and every public representative would like to see his or her own area getting at least a fair share of whatever finances were available.  In fairness to public representatives, they look for no more than that.  It is only reasonable that public representatives would make a case for their own areas.</P>
    <P>I have always paid tribute where tribute was due, whether it was to my own party or the Opposition.  I try to be objective and public representatives by and large would take that line.  They want the money spent in the best possible way where it would have the greatest impact and create the most employment.  As I have said, the big feature of this scheme <Col N="2091" /> is the employment it created.  There is a turnabout and I have noticed it in my own profession.  Others I have spoken to have told me that there is an improvement in the construction industry and, hopefully, employment will increase considerably in the near future.  Much of the credit must go to schemes of this kind where there is a transfer of resources. The general idea is to get the public interested enough to invest in those areas.  That is the central role the Government must play.</P>
    <P>The towns of my county have a considerable claim to resources &mdash; Navan, Kells and Trim.  The fact that more might not be needed at this time is a tribute to the urban councils and to Meath County Council for what they have done.  Considerable work remains outstanding particularly in relation to roads.  The provision of roads is most important.  One of the biggest problems at present is in relation to transport.  The road between Navan and Dublin is a total bottleneck approaching the city.  We have a first-class road running from the north of Donegal practically into Kells but when we reach Clonee there is a bottleneck. There is part of the road that is not much better than a boreen.  It is hard to understand why over the years this problem was not dealt with.  A scheme of that kind would help in upgrading these towns.</P>
    <P>Navan is a town which has made enormous progress in the past few years.  It is an industrious town.  Tara Mines are sited there and it would have a very good claim to be included in a scheme of this kind. There is not enough time at my disposal in moving a motion of this kind to make a case for a particular town but Navan would have a major claim.  I know the local authority would be anxious to cooperate in every way possible to make such a scheme a success.  Hopefully, if the Minister extends the scheme, the towns I have mentioned will be included.</P>
    <P>Kells is my native town and I would like to make a strong case that it be included as well.  The Zenith factory there gives very good employment but we have a considerable area beside the <Col N="2092" /> factory which is available to other manufacturers. The facilities are there and I hope that in the not too distant future other industries will locate there because Kells, like every other town, has been hit by emigration.  It is a residential town and a very attractive one.  It is an historic town and it attracts tourists.  We have St. Columcille's Oratory, the High Cross and all the Celtic crosses and monastic sites. I also make the same case for Trim.  It is an historic town and has monuments that are renowned the world over.</P>
    <P>It is only proper, in moving this motion, to congratulate the Minister for the Environment, the Government and the previous Government.  It is only fair to give credit where credit is due.  I would like, if I had the time, to speak about community spirit which hopefully will be reintroduced with the success of these schemes.  I hope that conservation of existing buildings will be the essential point of any scheme.  I know that in many ways it would be more beneficial to construct new buildings but I believe in some areas it is essential to retain the existing fabric of the environment.  The Minister may refer to this in his reply.</P>
    <P>It would be interesting to know, with regard to the financial incentives, what has been paid out, the benefits that have accrued and what remains to be paid out. If the scheme is not completed by May of this year will it be extended and for how long?  One of the points we made when the legislation was introduced was that, to some extent, it should be open-ended. The Minister took the opposite view, that to leave it open-ended might perhaps delay the achievement of what was intended.  There is a case to be made for both points of view but I hope that in any area where the final stages are not completed, the Minister would make a case to the Government to consider extending the time limit.  Whatever further expense is involved will be repaid many times over, not alone in the financial sense but in ways that are difficult to measure, for example, with regard to society, the community, the tourist potential and the clearing of derelict <Col N="2093" /> areas.  This was one of the major problems of the local authorities.  I am glad that the Government have taken a stand on this and that now we have legislation whereby local authorities can deal with derelict buildings.  We are doing it in Kells and I have no doubt it is being done elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I should not sit down without paying tribute to the Minister for the last tenant purchase scheme which was introduced.  Everybody is agreed right across the political spectrum that this was a scheme of tremendous importance and great significance. Many people have benefited and it has given those people who have purchased their houses a pride in their locality.  This is essentially what was missing in the areas that have been depleted and depopulised.  The areas were no longer attractive to reside in and therefore there was this effort to get better accommodation.  In the stampede local authorities, with hindsight, did not take advantage of criteria which they might have.</P>
    <P>I mention in particular the high rise flats and the fact that they are condemned. I spoke at length on this particular subject before.  I recall that when I came to Dublin to work in the Office of Public Works in 1958 high rise flats were the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing.  There was an exhibition of the works of Corbusier, where we had the high rise flats.  I suppose the recommendation was that this was the cure for all our housing ills.  In fact, in a very short space of time the people who lived in those flats decided that the easiest way to get rid of the rubbish was to dump it over the sides and another problem was created.  Therefore, when we condemn the high rise flats of Ballymun we should think in terms of the thinking at that particular time and that high rise flats were a feature of architectural development in most of Europe.  Unfortunately, while it did resolve problems, it created major ones as well.  I spoke at considerable length on that particular problem in a previous debate and there is no use in going over the same ground.</P>
    <P>We would all agree to congratulate <Col N="2094" /> where congratulations are due.  By and large, congratulations are due in this case to the Ministers for the Environment who have been involved.  I hope the Minister considers that the scheme has been a success.  I hope the Minister will perhaps extend the scheme, with improvements, because now he is in a position to determine what aspects could be improved.  I hope that in due course with the marked improvement in the construction industry, the Minister will consider extending not alone the designated areas but the number of towns as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally second the motion.  At this moment I would like to stand down and let Senator Joe Doyle speak.  I reserve the right to speak later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Fitzsimons finished his deliberations by mentioning the tenant purchase scheme and congratulating the Minister on it.  The present tenant purchase scheme has been a great advantage to people who have bought under the scheme but there are certain inequalities in relation to other schemes.  You can have people living next door to each other buying the same type of house, one under the old scheme paying twice as much as the other under the new scheme.  That is a debate for another occasion.  It is not an issue here tonight.  But we should discuss that at some future date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons was very honest in his opening remarks when he said that he was not too sure what he was congratulating the Minister about.  Neither am I.  When I saw this motion I felt that the Minister for the Environment and the Government had made some tremendous breakthrough in relation to urban renewal, but when I examined the situation I discovered that it was an extension of the urban renewal scheme that was introduced in 1986.  If we were serious about congratulating a Minister we should be congratulating the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Alan Dukes and the former Minister of State <Col N="2095" /> at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Fergus O'Brien.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I did that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, who introduced the incentives in the Finance Act, 1986, and these were provided for in legislation in the Urban Renewal Act, 1986, which was introduced into both Houses by the then Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Fergus O'Brien.  I want to thank Senator Fitzsimons for his kind remarks. I think they were well deserved, but it was generous of him.  Under the Urban Renewal Act, 1986, financial incentives are available in designated areas in the five borough counties.  These financial incentives are in the form of tax allowances and rate remissions and operate to the benefit of property owners, developers, tenants and owner occupiers.  They have proved to be a great success, especially in relation to Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance in the Finance Act, 1987, was wise enough to see the success of the designated areas and has allowed for additional areas to be designated.  The scheme now has been extended to a number of urban centres &mdash; Athlone, Castlebar, Dundalk, Kilkenny, Letterkenny, Sligo, Tralee, Tullamore and Wexford.  Senator Fitzsimons has made a case for Navan.  I am sure when Senator Mulroy speaks he will make a case for Drogheda.  I would like to know from the Minister, when he is replying, what criteria were used in the selection of these towns.  A very important element in the success of these schemes will be the effort made by local authorities involved to promote them themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The designated areas in Dublin were by definition areas in considerable need of redevelopment and by their nature were prone to dereliction, in some cases for a period of many many years.  Now through intensive promotion and effort by Dublin Corporation, and the upsurge in the property market in Dublin, many sites which hitherto have been derelict <Col N="2096" /> will now house splendid new developments. The area of most striking development is that surrounding Christchurch. Over £2 million worth of development in the area has already been completed in conjunction with the corporation's inner city development section.  A further £8 million worth of construction is under way.  A number of other projects, with a total value of £7.5 million, have been proposed.  These developments will give a complete face-lift to that part of the city which has suffered badly from dereliction in recent decades.  The success of the incentives in the Christchurch area have prompted considerable interest by developers on an adjacent non-incentive site. A primary example of this is the remarkable interest being shown in a corporation site in Christchurch Place recently offered for sale by public tender.  This proves that by developing designated areas you also help to improve the environment of other areas close by and you bring developers into those areas.  The financial incentive for designated areas achieves two purposes: it gives a lift to the areas in dereliction and also helps other areas close by.</P>
    <P>In introducing the extension of this scheme, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Connolly, said that local authorities should make rigorous and sustained efforts to bring landlords and developers together.  He is quite right in that. Senators may be interested to know how successful Dublin Corporation were in doing this.  They have undertaken an intensive campaign to promote development in the incentive areas and a new advertising strategy has been introduced which is already proving to be very effective. The corporation have appointed a development advisory team which includes an architect, a planner, a valuer, and a traffic engineer.  This team is available to offer free advice to developers, estate agents, property owners, owner occupiers, and other interested parties on development potential, tax incentives and planning requirements.  This team can greatly facilitate developers in the planning process.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2097" /> There is considerable interest being shown by developers in properties adjoining the Liffey quays and also in the north inner city areas.  The quays which provide the backbone of the city have over the years suffered varying degrees of decay.  In the period 1975 to 1986 there was no private development along the quays but since the introduction of the incentives 18 developments have been completed and many other significant developments have been proposed. There are plans on the way for a number of major developments mainly on corporation sites, including residential, which will ensure a complete redevelopment of the quays from Sarsfield Quay to the Four Courts at an estimated cost of £15 million.  Proposals for a major development along Bachelor's Walk are also under consideration.  Senator Fitzsimons will be happy to know that the north inner city is also showing renewed interest.  Two major development sites in Mountjoy Square have recently been sold and the corporation are considering developing on a number of its own sites.</P>
    <P>From what I have said it can be easily seen that redevelopment in designated areas can work.  Smaller towns, which now are being included in the scheme, may not have the technical staff which Dublin Corporation enjoys.  I understand that the National Building Agency have developed an important role in the whole area of urban renewal.  The agency are a commercial organisation with long experience of working with local authorities, Government Departments and the private sector.  They have a specialist urban design unit, staffed with highly qualified urban designers.  Senator Fitzsimons asked that the Minister would consider extending the scheme because I understand it expires in 1991.  This is a very valid suggestion and I recommend it to the Minister, seeing that the scheme to date has worked so well.</P>
    <P>The financial incentives in the designated areas in Dublin and the other four county boroughs are creating a real impact.  I have no doubt that the same impact will be created in the other towns which have now been added to the urban <Col N="2098" /> renewal list.  As a result we can look forward to brighter, more beautiful and more alive centres in our main towns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Urban Renewal Programme has already proved itself to be an excellent innovative initiative and has provided the necessary impetus in helping developers in the reconstruction and renovation of inner city and town areas which have been derelict for many years. The programme features a package of financial incentives to developers which I believe guarantees the success of the programme.  The main advantage of urban renewal as I see it is that it gives the necessary incentive to rebuild the fabric of a town and it encourages people to come back from the suburbs.  The wheel has turned the full circle and people are turning against greenfield developments where young couples, particularly young married mothers, are cut off from their families and friends, miles from the areas in which they grew up.  More and more people want to live back in the heart of their towns.  People do not want to travel long distances from home to work.  They want towns to be vibrant, living places and not a series of locked-up shops, stores, warehouses and derelict buildings.  My own town of Drogheda urgently requires inclusion in the urban renewal designation programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I knew the Senator would say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Thanks, Senator Doyle. I echo your sentiments.  Drogheda is situated on the banks of the famous River Boyne.  I believe the scheme is particularly suited to towns and cities which have grown up along river banks and have harbour facilities.  In Drogheda we are taking the necessary action by engaging the National Building Agency who have a special urban design team for this type of planning.  We believe that the correct thing to do is to plan the renewal scheme properly.  We are seeking a master plan which all development can follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past problems have arisen where <Col N="2099" /> developers have run into trouble with bad title to sites and it has held up development in many areas.  In Drogheda we have identified suitable sites with clean titles, and in many cases planning permission already in place.  Traditionally, towns like Drogheda were designed with the buildings backing onto the river. Anyone who has visited the continent will know how interesting and pleasant it is to walk along pedestrian streets with the town developed right to the canal or the river edge.  Unfortunately my own town, like many other Irish towns, was developed in the opposite direction.  The problem is that many of the most pleasant places where the people of the town would like to walk are covered with derelict buildings, factories, old warehouses instead of houses where people would live close to the town and close to their work.</P>
    <P>In recent years with the building of the new dual carriageway which has bypassed the town we have lost a number of historical streets and buildings.  The principal ones were Jones's Street, James's Street and the old Bull Ring Area.  The removal of these streets has opened up to view parts of the inner town which badly need development.  Excellent work is being done in this area by a number of concerned developers.  I would like to compliment one particular company, a company called Workspace, who have developed the old town area and have upgraded and renovated 18th century stone buildings.  They have done this in very difficult financial circumstances. They are providing industrial and commercial workspace right in the heart of the town.  They are providing incubator work units with easy-in, easy-out leases where people with ideas for a small manufacturing process can avail of space and develop the idea and the product until such time as they are ready to move into a larger area and start manufacturing the product.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> certain objectives have been set to increase tourist revenue.  The figure mentioned is £500 million.  Hopefully, we will <Col N="2100" /> do this by doubling the tourist numbers over a five year period.  It is hoped to create 2,500 jobs in this area.  If Drogheda were to be given this designation it would make a major contribution to the creation of jobs in tourist-related industries.  We have a very ancient, historical medieval town.  We are located adjacent to Newgrange and I am sure my colleague, Senator Eogan, will say a few words on Newgrange.  About 120,000 people visit this site each year. There is a definite tourist-related spin-off from urban renewal.  If the town were to be developed along these lines it should be possible to hold at least 10 per cent of these people overnight in the town.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to job creation. In County Louth the numbers of people unemployed since 1981 have doubled.  In 1981 there were over 4,000 unemployed, that is 14.3 per cent of the workforce.  In 1987 this figure had doubled to over 9,000 people, a massive 28 per cent of the workforce. Again, I am pleased to say that in 1988 the situation has stabilised and for the first time in ten years we have had a net increase in manufacturing jobs of 300. It is a small number, but it is encouraging. I believe if we were to get urban renewal status many jobs would be created in light industry and in the construction industry. Drogheda has been particularly hard hit in this area because it relied very much in the past on traditional labour intensive industries such as footwear and the textile industry.  I have outlined the result of the recession in the late seventies and early eighties.  We are lucky to have a very positive industrial base and we have many international companies such as Coca-Cola, Thorsman, IFF, Premier Perryglaze and Cement Roadstone.  They are providing very important jobs in the manufacturing area.  Indeed, many of these companies are at the cutting edge of our export drive.  Our exports for 1987 exceeded £12 billion and that was a trade surplus of £2 billion.  This is encouraging. The important thing is that we badly need to create new jobs.  In County Louth there is in excess of 9,000 unemployed and in Drogheda there are 4,000 people unemployed.  We must do something <Col N="2101" /> about this.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce recognised that this is a disadvantaged area and he gave County Louth maximum grant designation which put us on a par with the neighbouring counties of Monaghan and Cavan where the level of unemployment is much lower.  We are also very lucky that we have the extension of the natural gas line to the North-East region which has provided us with an alternative competitively priced clean source of energy.  I know the Minister is concerned about pollution and this is something that should give our industrialists in the area a competitive edge when competing on the international market.  What I am trying to do is to impress on the Minister the need for new jobs.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of dereliction in the port area.  Already the urban renewal process has started in that area because there are a number of developers renovating old stone buildings and providing necessary space.  Luckily, even though we have dereliction in the port area, we have a thriving port.  Last year we had a throughput of one million tons for the first time.  This is serving Drogheda and the entire region in an exceptional way.  I compliment the harbour commissioners, the port users and in particular the dockers, because I cannot remember ever having a strike in the port.  It is a trouble-free port.</P>
    <P>We have a lot going for us in Drogheda. The people are waiting and hoping that we will get this designation.  The council are fully behind it.  This is why we have initiated moves with the NBA to prepare a programme.  Drogheda is a very historic town.  There are many fine monastic ruins, one of them &mdash; the Old Abbey &mdash; dating back to Saint Patrick's time. Therefore, it is a very old traditional town with tremendous potential.  It is a town that deserves urban renewal.  If we are granted this I can assure the Minister that the best possible use will be made of it and that real jobs will be created in this area.</P>
    <P>I compliment everybody involved in this urban renewal initiative and I compliment the Minister for extending it to other towns in 1987.  It was extended to <Col N="2102" /> Athlone, Castlebar, Dundalk, Kilkenny, Letterkenny, Sligo, Tralee, Tullamore and Wexford.  I believe the time is opportune to extend it and that in the near future my own town will be included.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeEogan" hpid="Professor Eogan Professor Eogan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Eogan</NameTxt>
      <P>From my point of view this designation programme so as to bring about urban renewal is a very exciting one, the reason being that so many of our towns in general have been so long neglected.  I do not think this is the fault of anybody.  It is just the way people have changed; our manners and customs have changed and the market forces have changes.  As we know, until very recently you just went into the centre of a town and there you bought all your groceries or whatever you needed. Now you may buy all your groceries a mile or two outside even a fairly small Irish town.  These are factors that we have to bear in mind.  Having said that, I think that the centre of any town is a very important aspect not only for the town itself but indeed for the immediate hinterland.</P>
      <P>Another point we have to bear in mind when talking about towns and urban areas is that we are talking about people. That is really what towns are all about. Therefore, the improvement in the quality of life of the people is a very important thing.  In many cases this means houses but it also means factories, shops and various other facilities for the people.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, due to historical reasons as much as anything else, some of our towns are not the most attractive places despite their locations in some of the most pleasant parts of the country. How right Senator Mulroy was when he spoke about tenants looking backwards into rivers rather than facing on.  This is one of the difficulties.  However, I am not suggesting that the Minister should turn around all our Irish towns but at least with this renewal programme I believe we can improve the towns architecturally, in design, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This neglect, which has developed, partly as a result of the growth of wealth and the development of supermarkets and so on outside, has left the centres of <Col N="2103" /> so many of our towns and cities in a pretty poor shape.  In fact, in many cases they appear offensive to the eye.  It is for this reason that I am glad to see that we have now got this urban renewal programme. Furthermore, I hope that the Minister will consider extending it to other suitable towns.</P>
    <P>In talking about urban renewal, naturally, from my point of view, I find it very pleasant to see what I consider to be attractive buildings and so on.  Having said that, nobody now is a great Franz Josef or a Louis XIV who can designate grand and ornate buildings here, there and everywhere.  That is not the point. What I would suggest is that care &mdash; which is being shown in so many places and in this city in Clanbrassil Street, for instance, quite considerable care &mdash; plan ning and design have gone into aspects of urban renewal.  I do hope that that can be continued.</P>
    <P>Other Senators, including Senator Mulroy, spoke about using what one has in towns.  In my belief if we talk about urban renewal it does not necessarily mean that we have to clear everything away from a particular area and build from scratch.  That is not necessarily the case.  It is my opinion that in a number of the central parts of towns one can do quite a lot by way of conservation.  Again, in this city some quite valuable work has been done &mdash; I will just mention the Tailor's Hall &mdash; and I am sure that this is the case in various other towns also.  Therefore, while I am not indicating that urban renewal is something solely confined to the core area of a town, nevertheless it happens that in the core areas of towns there are quite a number of buildings which reflect a particular style, a particular age and indeed particular attitudes. I do believe that with sensitive use of these buildings we can use them further to enhance the town.</P>
    <P>It is not my role and indeed I have not got the knowledge or the competence to suggest various tax reliefs and so on. These are outside my competence.  There are very generous tax reliefs for buildings and so on and I believe it is possible to <Col N="2104" /> encourage people to come back and use some of these houses which do often reflect and are very characteristic of a particular streetscape or a particular area.</P>
    <P>In addition to conserving existing buildings I do think, again in the sensitive areas, that some attention should be paid &mdash; and, I have to say, is being paid &mdash; to the design of buildings.  It does seem rather unwise to put a fairly modern building designed to late 20th century standards right in the centre of buildings dating from another period.  I am not at all suggesting that architects should be prevented from displaying their skills and inventive and creative prowess.  That is not the case.  I am talking about the more sensitive areas, particularly the areas that I have just mentioned in this connection. I do believe the situation can be improved quite a lot.  I mention one town, not because I have any connection whatsoever with the place but because it is a place that pleases me every time I go there, and that is Kilkenny.  I believe that the handling of the situation in Kilkenny as far as I know it &mdash; and that is a visual knowledge, I have to admit &mdash; is something which many other towns could follow as an example and indeed it could be used when one considers the wider issues of urban renewal.  To me the Kilkenny situation does reflect a very pleasant quality of life in this particular place.  Incidentally, even in Kilkenny, some of their new structures again reflect that same quality.  I am thinking for instance of the very attractive modern bridge on the bypass just outside the city itself.  Then you have Rothe House and Kytlers Inn and so on.  We can merge both together in order to achieve a fairly pleasant whole.  My reason for saying that is that towns, as I have said earlier, are about people and it is where people live and how they live and work.</P>
    <P>The other point, if I might mention it, is partly related to what I have just said. It is something we tend to forget &mdash; that towns are underground as well as over-ground. There have been very exciting developments arising out of urban development.  One of the first instances <Col N="2105" /> of this took place in the city of Dublin where remarkable archaeological discoveries were made.  Dublin is not unique in this; we have had even this year exciting works going on in Wexford, Waterford and elsewhere.  In this connection I again would like to pay tribute to the local authorities.  I have had some experience of contact with local authorities in connection with some of these problems and they have risen, so to speak, to the occasion in a very good way.  I know a little about what has been going on in Senator Mulroy's town, Drogheda. Again recently I have been involved with some work going on in Waterford and in Wexford.  This is of great encouragement. If one uses the archaeological context properly, not as a hindrance, not as a hold-up, but in a positive way, this adds to the overall quality of life.  For instance, in Waterford they are contemplating preserving some of the wall and a 12th century church site.  As Senator Mulroy has already suggested, this will add in another way to the quality of life in these towns.  For instance, something of that sort, if it is an early church or whatever it may be, can help quite considerably in the local understanding and pride of the town.  It can also help quite a lot with tourism.  It may not be relevant to say this but if you take some of the wealthy towns of Europe &mdash; and I am going to mention, for instance, Lübeck in northern Germany, which has a long history of wealth &mdash; in Lübeck quite considerable work has been carried out recently on the archaeology of Lübeck.  These sensible Lübeckers of the 20th century are therefore merging their modern commerce with the results and the remains of early activities and due to this there is quite a considerable tourist trade emerging out of the utilisation of the earlier archaeological remains.  A place nearer home where this has also been happening is, of course, York.</P>
    <P>Why I am saying this is not in any way to advocate excessive financial expenditure, or indeed any sort of financial extravagance or to hinder development in any way, but because I believe that with some thought and not much more <Col N="2106" /> than what we have been doing, because I have been trying to outline a great deal of this work is going on, we can merge the various resources of cities and towns with the various aspects of cities and towns, such as the creation of factories, new shopping centres and so on, to the benefit of everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would congratulate everybody in connection with the work that has been going on and suggest that we continue considering some of these broader aspects as we have been doing. Incidentally, I may say that only a year ago we had a very lively symposium in Limerick which is an important medieval city where a lot of good work is going on, highlighting some of these problems and suggesting ways of coping with these various issues.</P>
    <P>In summarising the situation I believe that if we use the various resources of the towns and cities this will certainly enhance the living environment.  No longer need we drive into an Irish town or city and find the centre derelict or at least dreary.  By revitalising these centres we certainly can create a local pride in many of these towns which have a long and respectable history.  By utilising some of the archaeological remains for instance, and the historical buildings, we can introduce diversity.  This is quite an important thing because diversity can of course be looked upon as an addition to the amenities of any town or city.  By introducing diversity we are highlighting the variety of the components of any town and these can be integrated into a varied whole.  I have already mentioned that such work can be a considerable stimulus to tourism in that it can give that added attraction to a town.</P>
    <P>This urban renewal programme will benefit not only people who are immediately living in the areas or contemplating moving back into the areas but will benefit all of us because it will add to the creation of wealth and interest.  Therefore I very much look forward to further developments and to an extension of the scheme.  I would like to finish up by saying <Col N="2107" /> to the Minister cóghairdeachas agus beir bua agus beannacht leis an obair.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to share my time with some other Senators if that is the case.  It would be remiss of me if I were not associated with this motion from the Government side of the House because I have a particular interest in the programme referred to.  It is a programme that has implications for the various areas that have been so designated. I am pleased that the budget reflects a continuation of a commitment to several areas which have been identified specifically by the Government as places that need capital injection under this designation, particularly because of the importance for the areas identified but also because of the economic consequence of the designation of the areas.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that from my own constituency several plans have been submitted to him by the various local authorities in the area particularly from Carrick-on-Suir which he has visited himself for other reasons, and from Cashel, the home of the Rock, and itself one of the most important archaeological monuments in the country.  There is a specific proposal before the Minister from Clonmel Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to discuss this kind of motion without referring to particular areas that have been identified as being in need of this designation.  The motion commends extension of the programme ot other suitable towns.  For that reason I suggest that the Minister should not lose sight of the fact that Clonmel town, through the Mayor who is a colleague of the Minister, was given to believe that there would be a positive response from the Department in the not too distant future.  Specific proposals have been submitted to the corporation.  I attended on <Col N="2108" /> a deputation to the Minister's office where he listened attentively, as he always does.  He did accept that it was an excellent scheme but that the programme had been extended in so many ways that it was difficult to meet the demand from all over Ireland.  The point made was that if the scheme is extended to so many places, desirable and all as that might be, the overall effect to which the Government had given their original commitment would be watered down.  That does not take away from specific proposals for specific designated areas within town structures.</P>
    <P>I want to draw attention particularly to the proposals from Clonmel Corporation which have been substantiated by documentation. The recent loss of the traditional bacon industry which has been associated with the town for up to 120 years has been traumatic for the town of Clonmel.  This designation programme of urban development can be used as a stimulus through tax incentives for people to come forward with proposals for developments in the parts of the towns that have been identified.  I understand that is the context in which Clonmel has made the submission to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I want to be associated with the congratulations to the Minister on the programme and to join with Members on the Government side of the House in asking for an extension of the programme to other suitable towns.  I realise that it is not possible to designate every town in Ireland or to do as much as one would like to do but I am saying that there are particular proposals before the Minister and Clonmel is a case which should get urgent attention because it would have a tremendous cultural and economic spinoff. The town of Clonmel deserves that particularly in view of recent events.</P>
    <P>I could mention another three or four towns but that would be unfair.  I do not want to water down the case made by Clonmel Corporation.  I support it fully, knowing that the Minister has already heard the case and that he has listened and I think has made some kind of promise. The Mayor will be holding him to the promise during his term of office.  Perhaps <Col N="2109" /> following my remarks tonight from this side of the House, the Minister may be forthcoming.  With that I will allow the debate to pass to the other side of the House because I understand somebody had offered just before I entered the Chamber.</P>

      <P>I would like to be associated with the motion.  Limerick has been mentioned by Professor Eogan and it is one of the areas where the programme has worked and is working extremely well.  The centre of Limerick city was fairly derelict, dilapidated and run down but today it is a hive of activity.  There is great investment in construction and reconstruction, with the whole centre of the city taking on an air of activity and an air of confidence which was missing for many, many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose environmental planning is probably one of the most difficult types of planning.  In the sixties and seventies the whole effort was towards getting more houses and suitable accommodation for people.  Corporations and councils cannot be faulted for going from the centre of the city out to the virgin lands because it was a question of title, rights and rights-of-way.  It was much easier to build houses on virgin land. Good housing was a feature of the sixties and of the seventies and, unfortunately, that gave rise to further problems, some of which were mentioned by Senator Fitzsimons. Other problems that I see particularly are that you run the population into the suburban areas while all the amenities are in the centre of the cities and there are no amenities in the suburban areas. The Church is probably the only organisation that saw to it that religious amenities would be made available and they were always first in development, leaving <Col N="2110" /> the State services, the corporation services and the council services in second position or maybe not included at all.  The unfortunate thing in relation to education was that schools in the centre of cities such as Limerick and Dublin had no pupils or very few pupils while the State was incurring expenditure in building new schools in suburban areas to cater for the populations moved there.  Planning should develop progressively in a thought-provoking and reasonable fashion.</P>
    <P>Another feature of the decay of urban areas was the fact that traffic, which was always a problem, became more of a problem when we allowed through traffic to go through the centre of our cities.  I am sure the Minister would like, in the context of the Road Fund, that more ring roads would be built around cities. People were afraid when traffic did not go through Naas, for instance, that trade would decline.  The reverse has been the case.  Where the through traffic to Limerick or Cork has by-passed Naas, business has increased in Naas because people can now go to Naas to shop whereas previously they were sitting there for an hour and they felt the quicker they got out of Naas the better it was. That should take place in all cities.  I would mention Limerick where the new bridge has brought great improvement to the centre of the city and is bringing business back into the city.  The development over the years, of shopping centres at the periphery of cities has militated against the development of business within the cities.  I would hope however that with the population being brought back to the cities, with traffic congestion being eased somewhat and with the development in the business community of confidence in city centres, life will return to city centres.  There is nothing worse than a dead centre city.  Decay of city centres is not confined to Ireland.  I have seen cities abroad where after 5 o'clock in the evening there is no life whatsoever.  This has been a feature of Limerick over the years.  With the collapse of the cinemas and theatres in these areas, life after 5.30 p.m. is very dead <Col N="2111" /> and the city is not vital, does not come to life, as it did say, 30 or 40 years ago when people went shopping, even window shopping, at night.  This will be a feature of new developments in cities where confidence is returned, where business is brought back to city centres and where we will have more people on the streets.  This would prevent criminal acts taking place because where there is a reasonable number of people there is very little vandalism and very little crime.</P>
    <P>Could I make one plea to the Minister? I am glad to have his ear here tonight. There are certain areas which were designated in the urban renewal programme and which have thrived.  There may be other areas within cities where designation might mean survival rather than decay.  I am thinking, in particular, of certain amenities, particularly theatres. We all know that theatres are loss-making institutions.  They are not financially viable.  They have always had encouragement either from princes or kings or, in a republic such as ours, from the State.  I have one case in mind, in particular.  In the centre of Limerick there is a very fine theatre, the Savoy Theatre, a 500 seater, a luxurious theatre in its day &mdash; unfortunately sold by the Rank Organisation some years ago and very fortunately bought by a Limerick business person.  Great credit is due to that person for keeping the theatre alive over the last number of years, but it has been allowed to fall into a certain amount of disrepair and decay.  My latest information is that an application is before Limerick City Council &mdash; I am not quite sure whether it has been granted, but my information is that it will be granted &mdash; to knock the Savoy Theatre and to put in its place flats and a number of small cinemas.  At a time when Limerick has been designated a university centre and a university city it would be culturally criminal to knock such a fine building, such an amenity, as the Savoy Theatre in Limerick.  It would be cultural vandalism to do so.  My plea to the Minister is that perhaps he might see that the area in which the Savoy Theatre is situated might <Col N="2112" /> be added to the designated areas in Limerick and perhaps that might save the theatre even at this late stage.  I am not quite sure that it would but I think it would be a possibility.</P>
    <P>In our planning we seem to do things to solve one problem an create another. At present there is no theatre in Limerick capable of taking the huge concerts the young people want.  The Radio Éireann Sympathy Orchestra cannot come to Limerick any more.  Opera companies cannot include Limerick in their itineary. Revenue companies cannot include Limerick in their activity due to the fact that this amenity has now been taken away and will be gone altogether.  From the tourism point of view, we have a ready-made convention centre there, with the theatre itself, with its bars and restaurants in the heart of the city, bringing life an vitality into the centre of the city. At a time when the city council is talking about the demolition of the Savoy Theatre they are at the same time persuading SFADCo to build a convention centre two and a half miles from the centre of the city.  This is absolutely crazy planning. I appeal to the Minister, if it is at all possible, to designate that area in the city or to add it to the designated areas under the urban renewal programme.</P>
    <P>From time to time &mdash; I know the Minister will be doing this &mdash; there should be a review of all programmes to see how successful they have been, whether they have been successful or not and to see what further improvements can be made in whatever programmes and schemes we have.  I was glad that the Minister was able to designate more towns.  I would urge him to consider some of the towns mentioned here tonight and some of the towns that were not mentioned.  Some towns have made great strides over the last number of years, particularly, for example, in connection with the Tidy Towns competition.  It must be frustrating to hard-working committees who strive through painting and decorating to make their towns look well to have one derelict site in the middle that nobody knows who owns it, that rights to it cannot be found and that it stands there as an <Col N="2113" /> eyesore to the community and to tourists. Such towns might be noted by the Minister and he might be favourably disposed to requests made to him in connection with them.</P>
    <P>This urban renewal scheme is really a carrot, an enticement.  We are coaxing people to come back to invest in our city centres, to bring the people back into city centres, to avail of the amenities that are already there; but perhaps there should be a little bit of the stick as well.  I do not see why people should allow their property to fall into disrepair, to fall into decay and to topple down.  In the centre of Limerick city there is a three or four storey Georgian building that was allowed to decay over a period of 20 years.  Everybody realised that it would fall down.  It fell down a year and a half ago.  Luckily, nobody was injured.  The building is being reconstructed, due to the Minister's scheme, but it is unfair that people should be allowed to let their private poverty fall into such disrepair and decay.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that, while extending the scheme and looking at whatever success it has been &mdash; in my experience it has been a great success &mdash; he might also consider where he can, I will not say &ldquo;force&rdquo;, at least persuade people to have respect for their own property and especially for the properties adjacant and contiguous to them, because if one's property falls into disrepair it brings an air of decay to all buildings in the area.</P>

      <P>When I previously raised this matter on the Adjournment on 15 June last year, the proposals for the pilot projects which were to be carried out in Sligo, Clare, Laois and Cavan were very prevalent at that time.  I would like to correct a point in the Minister's response to me and I quote from her speech: the Official Report, column 648, Volume 120:</P>
      <P>I might mention that over 60 per cent of the school transport services already being provided are being provided by private contractors.</P>
      <P>In fact, the figure is 40 per cent; 60 per cent are provided by CIE.</P>
      <P>Prior to my raising that matter here, the Minister had met a high level delegation from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions who were very much opposed to the pilot projects proposed at the time. Indeed, the major teacher unions were so concerned about the matter that they also attended, and by attending they were stating their admiration for the excellent way in which CIE were conducting the scheme.  The Minister for Labour was also present.  The reason the Minister for Labour was at the meeting was that Congress were saying that the 96 redundancy notices which had been issued to part-time drivers in the four countries were in contravention of the terms of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  The Minister for Education gave an undertaking at that meeting to respond to Congress in writing.  I understand that this has not happened, but that she did make contact with Congress by phone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like clarification on what the Minister said recently at a meeting held with PAMBO, that is the private bus operators' organisation, as to whether the business of the privatisation of school <Col N="2115" /> transport has become redundant or whether this is something that is still under active consideration with the Department.</P>
    <P>In July 1988, the Minister announced that the pilot privatisation projects in the four countries were not going ahead but in January of last year she announced that £1.5 million would be taken from the school transport account and this happened in November.  When the Book of Estimates for 1989 was produced in October of last year, it was announced that £5.7 million was being taken from the Estimate for school transport.  This has caused a monumental problem.  This figure was included, but the Minister has made no statement, nor as far as I know has she indicated to either Bus Éireann or to any other interested body how it is intended to effect this particular cutback. I would like again to quote from the Minister's speech of last June:</P>
    <P>This function has been discharged efficiently by Córas Iompair Éireann, as it then was, and by Bus Éireann since the inception of the scheme in 1967-68.  In the intervening 20 years generations of children have benefited from the scheme, many of whom would otherwise have had extreme difficulty in ever getting to a school or getting to it on a regular basis.  Great care is exercised in all aspects of the operation and the expertise and the good work of the company is worthy of appreciation. I have constantly said in public that of first concern is the safety of children.  All other factors come after that.  In this respect Bus Éireann have a record unparalleled in Europe for safe transport of children.</P>
    <P>How does this tie in with a cutback of £5.7 million on the £35.5 million estimate of Bus Éireann?  Bus Éireann got to work on their problems and have in real terms reduced their costs by £3 million since 1986.</P>
    <P>A further major problem, and I feel this is what gave rise to the Government's efforts to introduce pilot projects to privatise the bus scheme, is the business of <Col N="2116" /> replacing the bus fleet.  As I pointed out on that occasion, the Minister for Education had referred to a figure of £80 million being required to replace the fleet; the Minister for Finance had spoken of a figure of £50 million; and Bus Éireann had put forward a figure of £20 million for new buses.  Even taking the middle figure of £50 million, it would work out at an average of £100,000 per bus which is the price of a super coach.</P>
    <P>The figures were way off-line, but the point I would like to stress here is that Bus Éireann, from their own resources, without any cost to the Exchequer, replaced 130 of the older Bedford school buses with 95 former service buses together with 35 secondhand buses purchased specially for school transport.  The board of CIE has recently authorised the acquisition of an additional 32 secondhand buses for school transport purposes and, in addition, a further 20 service buses will be made available for school work during the course of 1989. This means that by next year Bus Éireann will have provided 182 replacement school buses without any extra cost to the Department.  I believe that is a very significant streamlining of their operations on the capital side.  They have streamlined their operations on the revenue side, on the running side, and indeed they have conveyed to the Minister's Department that they cannot possibly keep the service at 1988 levels with a further cutback of £5.7 million.</P>
    <P>We can only speculate as to how the Department intend to effect this £5.7 million cutback.  On one hand, the Department could introduce charges or increase present charges, something that the Labour Party would be totally opposed to and which we would find totally reprehensible.  Too many of our children are emigrating and if this type of measure was introduced for the children who are left, I feel this House and the Oireachtas would be completely breaking faith with the children of our country.</P>
    <P>Let me give you an idea of what is involved.  Primary school children at present travel free if they are beyond the two-mile limit from the school.  In the <Col N="2117" /> secondary sector children in the junior cycle pay £20 per term and children in the senior cycle pay £34 per term, although I should add that there is a maximum charge per family for school transport of £70 per term.  If the charges were doubled at second level and if the £1 charge were introduced at primary school level, this figure would come out at just about the £5.7 million, which is what the Government have cut back from the Estimate of £35.5 million needed to run the service this year.  I sincerely hope that it is not the intention of the Government to move down the road of introducing more charges for a service which is important to our children and which relates so much to their future potential employment prospects.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there could be a very serious cutback in services.  One union representative has said that as many as 800 people could lose their jobs in the school transport service, and that 70,000 children could be severely handicapped in travelling to and from school and could be subjected to severe hardship. The major point here, of course, is that if 800 people were to become redundant this would be in contravention of the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> which states that there are to be no forced redundancies in the public service.  Again I hope that this is not what the Government have in mind.</P>
    <P>Basically what I find most offensive and most annoying is that since the Book of Estimates was introduced, and we are now through the budget, Bus Éireann still do not know their position.  Bus Éireann start putting together their schedules for next year in April and are now in the position where a spokesman from the Minister's Department was quoted on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; as saying that there would be no diminution of the school transport service in the present school year.  The present school year ends on 30 June and my great concern as a public representative, as a former teacher and as someone very involved in and concerned about education is what is going to happen in September?  Is it right and proper that this House, the Dáil, the <Col N="2118" /> parents, the children of this country, the teachers, people involved in school transport at this stage just do not know what is going to happen?</P>
    <P>A figure of £5.7 million is being taken out of the allocation.  There is absolutely no directive as to how this money should be found or whatever cost effective measures are proposed.  Nothing has come from the Minister.  In fact, the major union involved in school transport, the Irish Transport and General Workers Union, have in recent weeks made contact with the Taoiseach's office seeking an urgent meeting with him to discuss the whole matter.  As yet that meeting has not taken place, but it is totally unfair, wrong and unjust that people involved in a service at this time just do not know what is going to happen.</P>
    <P>Bus Éireann have effectively cut back their revenue costs and that is extremely difficult, because in a rural area many of the bus routes go to areas where you have barely more than the number to service.  It is very difficult to get the service cost effective in these areas, but yet since 1986 Bus Éireann have succeeded in bringing down their costs by the figure of £3 million in real terms.  Yet, last year £1.1 million was taken from their budget. They provided the service they were told to provide and there were no cutbacks in the service.</P>
    <P>What is happening?  What kind of planning is going on or is there any planning going on?  My greatest concern is that there does not seem to be any plan in the Department as to the future of the school transport service.  We are fast approaching the end of the school year and soon it will be April.  What is going to happen in September?  That is the question that the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, must answer.  She must tell us what is going to happen.  How is this £5.7 million cutback going to be effected?</P>
    <P>The purpose of my raising this matter tonight is to find out about privatisation of school transport.  Are the pilot schemes over at this stage?  Have they been totally withdrawn or do the Department intend going ahead with the pilot schemes in the four countries?  I asked <Col N="2119" /> earlier to know what was said at that meeting with PAMBO regarding the privatisation of the school transport service.</P>
    <P>Just to give an illustration of the effect I see this privatisation having, I will refer to my own area of Waterford.  Waterford has a garage which services the school buses and the service buses and there are 33 people employed there.  Thirty-nine ordinary buses and 76 school buses are serviced in that garage.  If, for instance, a pilot scheme were introduced in Waterford it would be the end of the garage.  It would also mean that the school transport office in Waterford would close, and this is against a background of regional management of CIE being effectively withdrawn from Waterford over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>There are a number of people involved, for instance, as contractors to CIE as 40 per cent of the work is done by contractors.  These people do not know what is going to happen next September. They have absolutely no idea and cannot plan ahead.  The Department will not let us know what is going to happen.  There is an 18 per cent cutback in the Bus Éireann Estimate for running the scheme and yet the Minister is refusing to tell any source what plans she has, if indeed she has any plans.  Bus Éireann service 6,250 routes, they cater for the 9,000 children who attend special schools, some mentally handicapped, some physically handicapped and in all 168,000 school children are catered for by the school service.  Parents will soon come to realise that there is no certainty about what is happening.</P>
    <P>We are talking about an operation that is run most efficiently, in my view, by Bus Éireann.  There are 15 district school transport offices operating throughout the country.  A total staff of 1,107 are involved in the school transport scheme throughout the country.  One point I would like to make is that charges at present bring in £3.7 million.  That is the estimate for this year.  On the other hand, 43 per cent of those using school transport are the children of medical cardholders and have free school transport.  This is <Col N="2120" /> paid for by the Department.  The Department would have to pay in any event whether it be Bus Éireann or a privatised service.</P>
    <P>There are a number of questions that still remain unanswered.  Have CIE agreed that the school transport scheme can be operated in 1989 on some £5.8 million less than was required in 1988? What was the basis used for arriving at this reduction in the level of funding for the school transport scheme?  It must mean that there will be a major worsening of conditions, service and standards or a large increase in charges.  Will there be a charge introduced for post-primary medical cardholders and for all categories of primary pupils and what will be the amount of these charges?  I have dealt with this point earlier in my speech.</P>
    <P>Let us clear the air on this matter.  Is the proposal to privatise school transport?  Is the proposal for the four pilot areas &mdash; Sligo, Laois, Cavan and Clare &mdash; as announced by the Minister in October 1987, redundant or is that still under active consideration in the Department? I have already asked what was conveyed to PAMBO?  If Bus Éireann have to cut back on maintenance costs, for instance, would not this inevitably result in a worsening in the reliability of the school bus service?  I will conclude on this point. Basically I am seeking clarification on behalf of pupils, parents, teachers and those involved in the school transport service.  Go raibh míle maith agat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I would like to put the issue in prespective by giving a brief background to the school transport service and to the role of Bus Éireann in providing that service.  The Department of Education have a responsibility to ensure the satisfactory delivery of transport service to approximately 160,000 primary and post-primary pupils throughout the length and breadth of the country.  We also have the responsibility to ensure that the State gets the best possible value for the money it expends on the provision of this service. <Col N="2121" /> This is particularly so in the current economic circumstances where all services have to be rigorously examined for cost effectiveness and because of the major expense of the scheme itself, £34.3 million in 1988.  Concern has been expressed over many years and from many quarters at this level of expenditure and I consider it our responsibility to explore all possible means of reducing the drain on our financial resources while continuing to provide a satisfactory level of service to our children.</P>
      <P>As the Senator is aware, the day-to-day operation of the school transport scheme is carried out by Bus Éireann as the agent for the Minister for Education. This function has been discharged efficiently by CIE and by Bus Éireann since the inception of the scheme in 1968. In the intervening 20 years generations of children have benefited by the scheme, many of whom would otherwise have had extreme difficulty in attending school on a regular basis.  Great care is exercised in all aspects of the operation and the expertise and good work of the company is worthy of our appreciation.  None the less, it is essential that we continue to explore all means of reducing expenditure so as to ensure that we get value for money.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann are in the unusual position that as the national bus transport company they act as sole agents for my Department in arranging school transport. The idea of pilot projects was first mooted because of the large cost of replacing the school bus fleet.  In 1987 Bus Éireann estimated that this would cost over £20 million.  However, as the Senator has pointed out, when arrangements were in train for the pilot projects Bus Éireann succeeded in making a deal for the purchase of good second-hand buses in Britain at a cost of £1 million to £1.5 million a year over a five-year period.  In view of this arrangement, it was decided to defer the question of pilot projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to emphasise, however, that the achievement of current cost savings is also a major element in the objective to provide a fully cost effective school bus <Col N="2122" /> transport service.  Indeed, the Senator will be aware that substantial savings are required in the current year, as he has pointed out, and are expected through the entire system of Bus Éireann.  For the present it is the intention to examine all possible avenues for a reduction of expenditure within these existing structures. I consider it a matter for Bus Éireann to come forward with proposals for savings on administrative and other costs which will meet the Government's target without reducing services to schools.</P>
    <P>I would add that I do not accept the Doomsday situation that has been presented to us by the Senator this evening, that we are liable to be left without a service in September.  That simply is not the case and I would say that that is a gross exaggeration of the present position.  It is clear that in the current year, indeed last year also and indeed during the period of the last Coalition Government, we have achieved significant savings with regard to the provision of a school bus transport facility. While there certainly have been cutbacks in many respects, as I only too well know because of the avalanche of representations we have to deal with from Members on all sides of the political divide, at the same time it is fair to say that we now have a highly efficient and very satisfactory school bus service and that despite the fact that we have achieved considerable savings.  That is the continuing intention.</P>
    <P>We must strive for cost efficiency. Without that in the school bus transport system as, indeed in many other areas of administration which are under the control of the Department of Education, we simply could not continue to provide the kind of current expenditure that is required, or that indeed the Senator has claimed would be required in those services. I am quite satisfied that we can achieve a good, satisfactory and efficient service under the present arrangements.</P>

      <P>If the funding to Bus Éireann, which is being paid is at the 1988 level, continues until June, obviously that cannot continue after that time because of the £5.7 million reduction.  The Minister's response that a Doomsday situation will not exist in September is not borne out by what is happening at present.</P>
