      <P>I have notice from Senator John A. Murphy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to ensure effective arrangements in assessing the large numbers of pupils to be examined under the new junior certificate curriculum in respect of aural testing and oral competence in the Irish language.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Katharine Bulbulia of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to clarify the position of Waterford in the Government decentralisation programme by identifying the State agency or agencies to be located there and by giving a firm projection of the stage processing of the relocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Murphy and Bulbulia as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matter raised by Senator Murphy and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. Senator Bulbulia may give <Col N="1994" /> notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Leader of the House could explain why we are not taking item No. 2.</P>
      <P>May I use this occasion to say I have learned with sadness the decision of Senator Robinson not to contest the next election.  May I simply place on record the view of this side of the House that we are losing a very distinguished Senator, a great reforming Senator, one of the most conscientious of people in dealing with legislation and Irish public life will be very much the poorer for her leaving us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>May I add my voice to what the Leader of the Opposition has said because I can assure you that there are very few people, TDs or Senators, more talked about in Northern Ireland especially among the Unionist and Loyalist communities, than Senator Mary Robinson, particularly for her liberal and reasonable views.  I would like to support what Senator Manning has said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join in this expression of sentiment of high regard for my colleague, Senator Mary Robinson, who is an old friend of mine and colleague, post- and under-graduate, and subsequently in the university.  I have cause to be very grateful for her legal expertise, as I think this Chamber has in a number of the debates which I have had the privilege of attending.  I am very happy to join with this expression of regard from the House to a very distinguished Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Order of Business, I would like to ask the Leader of the House if there will be any response today to the strong suggestions made in the judgment of Mr. Liam Hamilton that both Houses of the Oireachtas have failed in their constitutional responsibilities because it <Col N="1995" /> seems to me that this House ought immediately to respond to that.  I hope there will be some statement forthcoming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my appreciation of Senator Robinson's service in this House and to do so from a fraternal university.  It must be nice for her to listen to these laudatory sentiments while she is still alive.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House why Item No. 2 is not being ordered as expected and, in the unlikely eventuality of Dáil Éireann being dissolved would indicate whether this House is likely to sit very long thereafter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday was a very special day for Drogheda with the announcement that Brother Industries are to establish a high tech industry in the town, employing 388 people.  I want to express my disapproval of the RTE coverage last night.  They reported on this wonderful news for the town and it was immediately followed by a report on the failure of 800 jobs to materialise in Sligo. The inference was very clear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reassure the people of Drogheda that these jobs will come on stream quickly.  As a matter of fact, the advertisements are in the newspapers this week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to pay tribute to Senator Robinson who has announced she will not be standing as a candidate in the next Seanad election.  I echo all the tributes which have been justly and correctly paid to her as a very distinguished Member of this House.  I am sure she or indeed nobody else would mind if I drew attention to the fact that she was a distinguished woman Senator&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a sexist remark.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not sexist.  It is accurate and factual.  Senator Robinson has been a champion and a shining example to all people who wish to see increased representation of people who are women in both Houses of the Oireachtas and in every forum.  She has been an exemplar <i>par excellence</i> of that particular very strong feeling in this country.  I would like to put that on record and to express my thanks and appreciation to her on behalf of all women, and liberated and thinking men, for the distinctive contribution she has made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to endorse the sentiments behind what Senator Bulbulia said, if not necessarily the emphasis of what she was saying.  Senator Robinson has been by my side ever since I came into the Seanad and while some will say I had political mixed feelings about the announcement the other day, I regret first of all the lack of stability which she leaves in the constitutency but also those great causes which she has fought for and for which she shall be missed.</P>
      <P>Finally, I should like to ask the Leader of the House &mdash; perhaps he will give me an indication before I launch into a tirade &mdash; whether item No. 2 was overlooked by mistake.  If it was not, I must say I am absolutely amazed at the fact that it is not being ordered today because today is the turn of the Independent Senators to take their motion or Bill in the time allotted to them by agreement with this House for a very long time.  Last Friday I was consulted, I was asked to provide the subject matter the Independents were going to take today, as is the norm when it is our time.  I gave clear notice to the Government that it was the intention of the Independent Members to take item No. 2 on the Order Paper today and it seems to me this has been moved up to item No. 2 on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody has given me any indication at any stage since last Friday that it was not intended to take item No. 2 today.  It is an outrageous breach of the agreement which all parties in this House have if the Government are intending to deprive the Independent Members of their time.  I <Col N="1997" /> am acting in the dark here because the reason for not ordering No. 2 has not been given by the Leader of the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, if necessary.  I move: &ldquo;That item No. 2 be inserted after item No. 1&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to note the announcement by Senator Robinson that she is leaving politics.  It is very regrettable. She will be sadly missed.  I would like to look back a little bit to the courage she showed in years when there were not women politicians.  We know that by and large women's issues and general liberal issues have been taken up in the Dáil and the Seanad by women politicians.  When there were no women politicians, Senator Robinson gave unstintingly of her time to causes related to women and I know from reading the Seanad debates she faced great hostility in this House over issues like divorce and contraception.  I would like to wish her well and to say that for the time she was here she was certainly very effective.  She never compromised on her principles and was an excellent role model for women who came after her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>As a liberated and thinking man, I have no difficulty in paying tribute to Senator Robinson.  She certainly has had a distinguished career. I recall when she was first elected in 1969 and she has certainly brought objectivity, courage and expertise to her work in the Seanad over that period.  She has always set a headline for her commitment and the pride she has taken in the Seanad as a House of the Oireachtas.  I wish her well in the future.  I think she will certainly be missed but she has left her mark here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>May I add my voice to what has already been said about Senator Robinson?  I have always been impressed <Col N="1998" /> by the solid, erudite contributions she made to discussions particularly on points of law.  In my short time here I have seen Ministers quake in front of her questioning and her probing.  As a liberated male also &mdash; I thought we were all liberated in this House &mdash; I certainly would like to put on record our thanks for two decades of commitment to the work of this House.</P>
      <P>On the point that was raised by Senator Ross, it is a clear agreement through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and by agreement of the Whips that the different groups choose as they will the topics for the Private Members' time. Private Members' time this week is in the name of the Independent group and we chose to use that time to take the Second Stage of the Criminal Justice (Abolition of Death Penalty) Bill.  If there has been some change on that from the Government side of the House it certainly has taken place without any consultation or discussion or without anybody being aware of it in any way.  It would constitute an amazing change of precedent.</P>
      <P>I am speaking at the most moderate of terms because I hope the Leader of the House is going to say there was some mistake in his presentation of the Order of Business for today.  I look forward to hearing his correction on that and that Item No. 2 is being taken today.  It has always been the case that the different groups use their time as they wish.</P>
      <P>As it now appears the other House will be dissolved in a short time, I would like to get a clear commitment from the Leader of the House that there will be no idea of closing down the business of this House in order to accommodate or facilitate people who want to get involved in the election to the lower House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, and more importantly, may I make a request to the Cathaoirleach and also to the Leader of the House &mdash; I am not sure where the responsibility lies &mdash; that in the event of an election the nomination date for the Seanad be the same day or prior to the Dáil election so that we do not have failures from one election taking their place in this one, to give this House dignity and status in the <Col N="1999" /> Oireachtas, to make sure that people commit themselves to this House at the appropriate time.  I ask the Cathaoirleach to use her influence to ensure that nominations for this House take place on or before the nominations for the lower House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not arise because it is governed by legislation.  It does not arise on the Order of Business anyway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I be associated with the remarks of my colleagues on all sides of the House in paying tribute to Senator Robinson.  I have been associated with her, albeit in a small way, in one specific area since my election to this House and prior to that.  Senator Robinson has throughout her political career championed many causes which some may perceive as being lost causes.  I refer specifically to one that is not a lost cause but is a very live one.  I hope that despite the ending of her political career in this House she will continue to espouse the cause of the Birmingham Six and the Guilford Four and other Irish prisoners in Britain who have very few voices of the stature of Senator Robinson to shout for them.  I compliment the Senator for her stance in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I join with the other Senators to compliment Senator Robinson because she was indeed a very able Senator.  It is nice that somebody like Senator Robinson can take a decision to voluntarily retire from this House.  I would like to put it on the record that I will not be retiring and that I will be a candidate in the next election.  May I also reiterate the remarks of Senator O'Toole with regard to the nomination date.  It would appear from the Cathaoirleach's remarks when we came back to this Chamber when she tried to influence the <Col N="2000" /> Taoiseach on that day that she did not succeed, judging by what is to happen tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with what previous speakers have said in regard to Senator Mary Robinson.  I rise here to congratulate St. Anthony's College in Clara on winning the All-Ireland School of the Year Award.  Over 350 schools were in this in the Buy Irish Campaign.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleagues I would like to wish the very best to Senator Robinson in her retirement at the end of the term of this Seanad.  Maybe it is coincidental that another very prominent Mayo politician is retiring also and I would like to take the opportunity of wishing him well.  Deputy Denis Gallagher, Minister of State, is a victim of the Fianna Fáil rod licence issue and was one of the people who spoke out very strongly against it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I happened to be at a meeting in Ballinrobe the other night and it was very sad to see him having to leave a meeting of his own supporters over his courage on the rod licence issue. I wish him the best of luck.  He is one man who spoke out against it in the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I call Senator Lanigan and Senator Robinson I would like, just as Tras Honan, to congratulate and wish Senator Robinson well.  It is nice to be able to retire, as she <Col N="2001" /> has decided to do.  She influenced and made an impression on me from early on, even though we did not agree on a lot of things.  Senator Robinson made an extraordinary contribution to legislation and I think that should be put on record.  I want to congratulate her and wish her well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sat here feeling at once embarrassed and very moved and very touched by the contributions of my colleagues and friends.  I did not expect this to happen.  I have taken the step not to seek re-election with the most enormous reluctance because I have an extremely high regard and a great respect for this House and a great belief in the importance of the Seanad.  It has been clear to me, particularly in recent months, that I am finding it difficult to give this House the 100 per cent commitment which I have always given and which I believe every Senator should give.  I have found that the development of the Irish Centre for European Law is taking a great deal of time and preoccupation and it is a major challenge facing this country to prepare for the single market in 1992.  Also, the House is aware that the Joint Committee on EC legislation meets on the same day as the Seanad and that has, to some extent, prevented me from being able to make a full commitment to this House.  Therefore, very regretfully and aware that it will be an enormous wrench, I decided to make public the fact that I would not be going forward.</P>
      <P>I do not know when the election will be and it is my intention between now and then to be a very vigorous and hardworking Member of this House.  It is important that particularly a person who is a representative of the University constituency, an Independent in this House, shall have ample time and commitment to raise and take the various initiatives which this House allows and which I think are a very important part of the legislative process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me away from my personal situation having thanked Members for their kind words, to the business of the <Col N="2002" /> House.  I would like to very strongly support Senator Ross and the other movers of Item No. 2.  I had understood that this item was being taken.  I have it with me and I am prepared to make a contribution on it.  I think it is part of the agreement that there would be Private Members' time and how that would be ordered. Therefore, I support the amendment to the Order of Business and I hope we will be discussing the Criminal Justice (Abolition of Death Penalty) Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been on the Order Paper for a long time.  It is a matter of very real moral importance, of importance to the legislative profile and the ordering of our affairs and, therefore, I will be supporting an amendment and any vote on that amendment which will be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points I want to make.  Congratulatory messages were passed here on the Order of Business which I did not think were appropriate. I would like on the Order of Business to ask the House to pass a vote of sympathy with Senator Willie Farrell on the death of his wife.  Senator Farrell has been an exemplary Member of this House.  His wife was a person who helped him totally in his aspirations in politics. She was an exceptional woman.  I would like the House to pass a vote of sympathy to our much valued colleague, Senator Farrell, on the death of his exceptional wife.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, item No. 1 is ordered for today. Remarks have been passed about various agreements that were being made on various items.  The Order of Business today is item No. 1.  On the issue of the imminent retirement from the Seanad of Senator Mary Robinson, I concur with the remarks of congratulations that have been made.  There are a number of people in this House who will not have the <Col N="2003" /> opportunity of deciding for themselves to retire.  It is important that we remember that through the years we have had exceptional Members of the Seanad who did not get through the electoral process. I totally agree with the sentiments expressed about the role of Senator Mary Robinson in the House but we should not forget the exceptional role that people have played in this House who did not have the choice of retiring.  I do not want to get into any sort of polemics about this. I feel that Senator Robinson deserves the praise she has got but I also feel we should express our thanks to the many Members who did not have the same choice as she had.</P>
      <P>The Order of Business for today is item No. 1.</P>

      <P>This Bill will provide the Garda Síochána with power to take bodily samples such as blood, urine or saliva from persons suspected of serious criminal offences for forensic testing.  The Garda have very limited powers to take such samples at present. In the case of persons detained under the offences against the State Act, 1939, and the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, the Garda may take swabs from the skin or samples of hair for testing for contact with firearms or explosives.  Other than this and limited power under the Road Traffic Acts, they have no power at present to take bodily samples.</P>
      <P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>With the increasing sophistication of forensic testing procedures and particularly with the advent of DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) profiling, or genetic fingerprinting as it is more commonly called, it is vital that the Garda should have the necessary powers to obtain samples from persons suspected of serious crimes for forensic testing.</P>
      <P>The DNA profiling test is considered to be the single biggest advance in the field of forensic investigation since the discovery of fingerprints at the turn of the century.  It involves a technique whereby DNA, which stores and transmits genetic information within the body, is extracted from blood, semen, tissues or other bodily fluids and broken down into distinctive patterns or profiles.</P>
      <P>With the exception of identical twins, every person has a unique genetic code which can be used to identify that person. Since DNA is present in every part of the human body and in the bloodstream, it provides a unique means for the positive identification of tissue and fluids found at the scene of a crime.  Examples of this would be semen deposited during a sex offence and blood spattered and smeared during a wide range of crimes of violence such as rape, assault, murder, house and shop breaking, crashing stolen vehicles, or hit and run accidents.</P>
      <P>Semen is particularly rich in DNA. Blood and tissue is less so.  Urine, hair and saliva are essentially devoid of DNA unless skin cells occur in them, such as hair follicles attached to hair or skin cells from inside the mouth mixed with saliva. Every part of the human body has the same type of DNA so that DNA in semen deposited on a victim of an assault can be compared with the DNA in the blood taken from a suspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should mention that DNA profiling has already been used in this country in three cases involving serious crimes, one of murder and two involving rape.  In the murder case and one of the rape cases pleas of guilty were entered so evidence <Col N="2009" /> resulting from the tests did not come before the courts.  Significantly, in the other rape case the DNA test was able to establish the innocence of the person who had been identified as the rapist by the victim.  The testing in these cases was carried out in Britain under arrangements made by the Forensic Science Laboratory. In Britain, I understand, some few dozen cases involving DNA profiling have come before the courts and the test has been used to obtain convictions.</P>
    <P>DNA is still a very new technique at the forefront of molecular biology with the potential for further refinement and development.  Already work is being done on a process known as &ldquo;replication&rdquo; whereby the DNA in very small samples of human tissue can be grown to form sufficient DNA for the test.  This would mean that very small tissue samples left at the scene of a crime will be identifiable as to their human source.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that 12 Members were not present; House counted and 12 Members being present,</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>This could mean that saliva which contains a few skin cells, now too little for DNA testing, could also be positively identified as to origin.  This is very significant from the point of view of criminal investigation.  Saliva occurs in bite marks, sex offences, on the back of stamps, on gummed envelopes in, say, threatening letters, on cigarette ends left at crime scenes.  Similarly head and pubic hairs transferred during a crime will carry some skin cells with themselves and would be identifiable by this new &ldquo;replication&rdquo; technique.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our Forensic Science Laboratory expects to be in a position to undertake DNA profiling in the autumn and the Minister is fully committed to ensuring that the laboratory is provided with the resources they need therefor.  Staff have already been fully trained in the technique and additional equipment needed is being purchased.  Negotiations are in progress with ICI, Imperial Chemical Industries, the holders of the patent, for a licence to use the vital chemical probes <Col N="2010" /> which form the basis of the technique, and a satisfactory outcome is expected.</P>
    <P>Our Forensic Science Laboratory has been very much on the ball in preparing themselves to undertake DNA testing. When the laboratory embarks on this technique in the autumn it will be one of the first forensic science facilities outside the United Kingdom to be in a position to provide this test.  This is an achievement of note.  Indeed, I would like to take this opportunity to publicly congratulate the Director of the Laboratory, Dr. Jim Donovan, and his staff for the tremendous work they are doing and for what they have achieved in the relatively short time since the laboratory was established.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice visited the laboratory in the course of the preparation of this Bill.  He was struck by the range and sophistication of the testing being done there and the vital role it plays in crime detection.  He was also impressed by the dedication and professionalism of the staff and would recommend a visit to the laboratory to Senators and other public representatives with a particular interest in the crime area.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the Bill itself, its purpose, as I said at the outset, is to provide the Garda with the power to take bodily samples from suspects for forensic testing. Because forensic tests, particularly DNA profiling, can provide almost incontrovertible evidence of guilt and, it should not be forgotten, of innocence, it is essential that the Garda have the extended powers proposed in the Bill.  I fully accept, however, that such power must be measured against the need to avoid any undue or unwarranted interference with the individual's rights to privacy and bodily integrity.  In fact, one of the Minister's major concerns when drafting this Bill was to limit incursion on these rights to the absolute minimum which would be consistent with the provision of an adequate power to take samples.</P>
    <P>This concern is reflected in the format of the Bill.  Section 2 (1) provides the necessary power for the Garda to obtain samples from persons detained in custody on suspicion of having committed offences to which section 30 of the <Col N="2011" /> Offences Against the State Act, 1939, or section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, relates: that is, crimes the serious nature of which has already been recognised by the fact that powers of detention have been provided in relation to them. The rest of the Bill is largely concerned with the provision of conditions and safeguards to ensure that the power being given is used only in appropriate cases and then only in a manner which takes full account of personal rights and human dignity.</P>
    <P>Most importantly in this regard, the Bill provides that the taking of samples which would involve a significant interference with bodily integrity such as blood, urine, saliva, pubic hair or swabs from the mouth or other body orifices or from a genital region or a dental impression will require the written consent of the person from whom they are to be taken.  Also, in the case of persons under 17 years, written parental consent will be a prerequisite to the taking of such samples.</P>
    <P>This does not mean that persons reasonably suspected of involvement in serious crimes will be totally free to refuse to allow such samples to be taken. It is a recognition of the fact that the taking of such samples from a person against his will, perhaps with the need to use force, would be a dehumanising act and something which the Minister certainly would not propose or support.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that 12 Members were not present; House counted and 12 Members being present,</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>However, if the Bill is to be at all effective, it cannot, as I said, leave suspected persons totally free to refuse a sample.  If such were the situation, a person suspected of rape, for example, knowing himself to be guilty, would be most unlikely to provide a sample for DNA profiling knowing that it would almost certainly establish his guilt.  There has to be an adequate sanction to deter the withholding of consent to the taking of a sample.  Accordingly, <Col N="2012" /> the Bill enables an adverse inference to be drawn by a court where consent is refused without good cause.  This means that a court or jury, as the case may be, if it is satisfied that a person had no good reason for refusing consent, may, provided there is other supporting evidence, regard the refusal as indicative of the person's guilt.</P>
      <P>This sanction was included in the Bill only after very careful consideration.  The Minister is satisfied that it is the only form of sanction which is capable of deterring guilty persons from withholding consent. Merely to make it an offence to withhold consent with a monetary, or even a custodial penalty, attaching would not be sufficient.  A person knowing himself to be guilty of an offence carrying maybe a life sentence would not be persuaded by such a sanction.</P>
      <P>The adverse inference provision will not apply where parental consent to the taking of a sample is refused in the case of an under 17-year old.  In the case of intimate or intrusive samples, which I mentioned earlier, I believe it is right that they should only be allowed to be taken from a child or young person under 17 years with the consent of a parent or guardian as the Bill provides.  Given this, it would be wrong to provide that parental refusal should provide a basis for drawing an adverse inference as to the guilt of the child or young person involved.</P>
      <P>I will now outline briefly the other safeguards provided in the Bill which ensure that the power being conferred is used only in appropriate cases and with full regard to human dignity.  They are as follows:</P>
      <P>the taking of a sample must be authorised in writing by a superintendent or officer of higher rank;</P>
      <P>the suspected person must be informed before a sample is taken why it is being taken;</P>
      <P>intimate or intrusive samples may only be taken by a doctor or by a dentist in the case of a dental impression;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>where proceedings are not instituted <Col N="2013" /> within six months from the date the sample is taken or where a person is tried and acquitted or the charges against him are dismissed or withdrawn the samples taken and any records identifying them must be destroyed; and</P>
    <P>the Minister for Justice must make regulations providing for the detailed procedures to be followed in relation to the taking of samples including provision for the recording of necessary authorisations, consents etc.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken a great deal of care in this Bill to provide only those powers which are absolutely necessary if the Garda are to be enabled to take full advantage of the techniques which forensic science can provide in helping them to apprehend and prosecute criminals.  I was, therefore, somewhat surprised at comments, attributed in the press to certain party spokesmen when the Bill was published, suggesting that the scope of the powers proposed in the Bill are too wide and that the safeguards are insufficient. I hope that what I have said about the Bill and its purpose will satisfy Senators that this is not so.</P>
    <P>That being said I will, as always, be pleased to have Senators' views on the measure and I am certainly open to constructive comments and suggestions for improvements.</P>
    <P>As the Bill is short, and I think reasonably clear, I do not propose to comment on the sections individually.  I think this can best be done at Committee Stage discussion.  I will, of course, endeavour in my closing remarks to deal with any questions which Senators may wish answered.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I would like to mention one final matter.  In the Bill, power to take samples is confined to the situation where a person is detained under section 30 of the 1939 Act or section 4 of the 1984 Act.  I have been advised that from time to time cases arise where a person who is in prison becomes the suspect for an offence unrelated to that for which he is imprisoned and where the Garda would like to be able to obtain <Col N="2014" /> samples.  The Bill as drafted at present would not provide a power to take samples in such cases and I am considering this matter with a view to the possible introduction of an amendment on Committee Stage.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Bill, 1989.  It is a view, which I am sure is widely held by all thinking people, that the Garda Síochána should be able to avail of all modern scientific techniques in criminal investigations and in the identification of the perpetrators of serious criminal acts. It is essential that the Garda not only have the necessary back-up facilities but that, in addition, our criminal law reflects and keeps pace with modern scientific developments.  This measure before us this afternoon is an indication that governmental thinking has moved in that area.</P>
      <P>Genetic fingerprinting is about to revolutionise the criminal investigative process. At present the Garda lack both the facilities to utilise this technique and until now the back-up legislation required to apply it.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Notice taken that 12 Members were not present; House counted and 12 Members being present,</i>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying, genetic fingerprinting is the single greatest breakthrough in the fight against crime since fingerprinting which was discovered in 1901.  Samples of tissue, such as blood, skin, hair, semen left at the scene of a crime can be analysed in order to identify the perpetrator of a crime or, as the Minister remarked, to ensure the innocence of somebody being accused of a crime. The technique can result in indisputably accurate evidence of identity being obtained at the scene of a crime in many circumstances in which no ordinary fingerprint provides the means to ascertain the identity of the person who carried out the crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>DNA is the material that makes up genes.  Genes are the units that are <Col N="2015" /> responsible for the resemblances between parents and offspring and which determine the inherited characteristics of each individual.  Ultimately, two-thirds of our genes are the same in almost all individuals but the rest vary from person to person.  There are between 10,000 and 100,000 genes in each human being and about one-third are variable, making the number of possible genetic combinations inconceivably large.  Each individual, apart from identical twins, is genetically unique.  Each individual's genes are composed of DNA.  Modern science has determined that a pattern of chemical signals with the DNA molecule is unique to each person.  Using a laboratory process, this personal pattern can be visualised as a series of bands on an auto-radiography film, somewhat like the bar code found on supermarket items.  Half of the bands in a persons' genetic fingerprint are inherited from the mother and half from the father.  Because there are so many possible combinations the chances of the bar code of two unrelated individuals being identical is less than one in five billion.  The chances of brothers and sisters having the same profile are larger, about one in 100 million.  Thus, the patterns that appear on the film are effectively unique to individuals, except as I have already said, in the case of identical twins.</P>
    <P>Genes are present in virtually all cells of the body.  Consequently, it is possible to identify a person's genetic profile from any sample of organic material from a person's body.  Samples of organic materials, such as blood, skin, hair or semen can be matched and tested to determine whether they come from the same person.  The sample used need not be fresh.  Blood and semen stains up to at least two years old have provided good DNA or genetic fingerprints.  As the Minister said, even the tiniest speck of sample can be grown to determine whether the outcome of the tests reflect the genetic make-up of the individual involved.</P>
    <P>I would alert the Minister to certain concerns that I have doubt about the <Col N="2016" /> legislation.  I note the fact he indicated that he had an open-minded approach to the legislation and that he would take on board constructive suggestions that appear to him to be appropriate.  I am concerned that the regulations regarding the taking of samples are not contained in any detail in the Bill.  These regulations should be both comprehensive and detailed and contain specified protections and safeguards because the Minister stressed in his presentation of the Bill that the degree of safeguards involved is important in that this gives new and additional powers to the Garda.</P>
    <P>The Minister will remember that this Bill was first mooted by a member of the Fine Gael Party in the Dáil, Deputy Shatter.  It is on foot of his introduction of a Private Members' Bill that the Government agreed to bring forward their own legislation.  Under the terms of the Fine Gael Bill the regulations were to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval.  It would appear that under the Bill before us there is to be no possibility of debate on the regulations and I see this as a major weakness in the legislation.  I will listen very carefully to what the Minister has to say at the conclusion of Second Stage on that point which I consider is a valid one.</P>
    <P>People's fears and concerns in relation to this Bill need to be allayed.  Certainly bringing forward the regulations and making them the subject of approval by the Houses of the Oireachtas would go a long way towards meeting legitimate concerns of people who are anxious and who protect civil liberties in this country and who fear a &ldquo;heavy gang&rdquo; style approach coming from the forces of law and order.</P>
    <P>My overriding concern is to point out that we must not allow a situation to develop in which people could get off on technicalities because this Bill had major weaknesses in the area of regulations. The Criminal Justice Act, 1984, laid down regulations on Garda conduct.  The Act was not operative until the regulations were debated and approved in the Dáil and the Seanad.  In fact, the then Opposition Justice spokesman, Deputy <Col N="2017" /> Michael Woods, agreed with the provision that the regulations should be debated and approved by the Oireachtas. That is why it is singularly strange that such a provision is not included in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister would clarify whether the Garda can use force in the taking of samples?  In section 2 there is no reference to this aspect of force.  I know the Minister made some references to it but it is terribly important that this should be clarified unambiguously and unequivocally.  The constitutional right to bodily integrity is surely an issue in this section.  There are very fine lines between what is and what is not permissible.  It is not difficult to envisage a scenario where there could be unjustified allegations of assault and where the accused could get off on technicaliites.</P>
    <P>In the Fine Gael Bill it was an offence to refuse to co-operate with the Garda in the taking of samples.  I am surprised that this provision is not contained in the Bill before the Seanad today.  In this connection I would like to raise the issue of the recording of Garda interviews with suspects.  This is obviously an important element in ensuring the protection of all concerned.  In fact, it was a provision enacted under the Criminal Justice Bill.</P>

      <P>I was talking about the issue of the recording of Garda interviews with suspects which is an element in ensuring the protection of all concerned. This was a provision enacted under the Criminal Justice Bill and I wonder if the Minister in his reply can indicate if the recording mechanisms are in place yet, if this is not the case, when will they be in place and if he sees the additional technology as having an important role <Col N="2018" /> to play in the area of genetic fingerprinting. I think that is something that could be usefully addressed in the context of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I am also keen to be informed what training programmes are in place or are about to be put in place for gardaí who will be using this new concept &mdash; new technology.  What forensic or laboratory facilities are available to the gardaí?  I understand that ICI have a patent on the technique of genetic fingerprinting.  What discussions &mdash; either preliminary or detailed &mdash; have taken place with this group, or indeed any other group, the Department and ICI with a view to establishing the particular models that will be put in place here?</P>
      <P>I have a very interesting illustration here of very dramatic results of genetic fingerprinting.  I think it is very useful to read one short example of how genetic fingerprinting was successfully used and put that on the record of the House.  It is taken from <i>The Times</i> of 23 January 1988. The report says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A teenage girl had been raped and murdered in a Leicestershire village in 1983.  Another teenage girl from a neighbouring village was raped and murdered only half a mile away in 1986.  A 17 year old youth was arrested, charged with the second murder and detained in custody.  He was suspected by the police of having committed both crimes.  However, genetic fingerprint evidence demonstrated that while the same person had been involved in both crimes it was not the accused since the DNA fingerprint obtained from his blood did not match that obtained from the semen found on the bodies of victims. The police, believing a local man to be responsible, took the extraordinary step of asking all male inhabitants in the area between the ages of 13 to 30 to give a blood sample for DNA fingerprinting.  Approximately 5,500 people did so.  Two men refused to give a sample.  One is reported as having a &ldquo;genuine reason&rdquo;, another tried to persuade a work mate to stand <Col N="2019" /> in for him.  This was subsequently discovered by the police and Pitchfork was convicted of the two murders.  If the new scientific technique of DNA fingerprinting had not been used the wrong person could have been convicted of both murders and the perpetrator of both murders would have been left at large to carry out further horrific crimes.</P>
    <P>In the context of the wish of the Independent group to have debated here the issue of capital punishment I think this issue of genetic fingerprinting is of the utmost importance.  It is horrendous to think that in the Irish Republic, which still has on the Statute Book capital punishment, an innocent party could find himself sentenced to death.  I suspect that the Independents who placed this topic for discussion on the Order Paper will avail of the opportunity to speak at length on the consequences, given that they have been denied the opportunity on the Order of Business to debate what they understood they would be allowed to debate.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation.  One of the things I would like to draw to the Minister's attention is that I understand genetic fingerprinting is now in use in Northern Ireland.  I would recommend that direct discussions take place between the Garda authorities and the RUC to coordinate the introduction of this reform in the context of subversive and terrorist crime and that such discussions should take place under the aegis of the Secretariat at Maryfield established under the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  It seems a very obvious thing to do and I hope the Minister can give an assurance that that is what will happen.</P>
    <P>Largely, this is a Committee Stage Bill in that we in Fine Gael believe that we spearheaded the introduction of this legislation, that we would not be debating it here in the Seanad today had Deputy Alan Shatter and the Fine Gael Party not published their legislation.  We see some weaknesses as I have indicated in this legislation and I look forward to a more detailed examination of it and indeed <Col N="2020" /> hearing the contributions of other speakers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which is very important.  It is timely that we now have it introduced in the Seanad. The purpose of the Bill is to provide the Garda Síochána with power to take bodily samples, that is, samples of blood, urine, saliva, hair, etc. from persons suspected of certain offences for the purpose of forensic testing, including the genetic profiling test or, as it is more commonly known, genetic fingerprinting.</P>
      <P>In the past the Garda were prohibited from taking those samples.  Because of the increased sophistication of forensic testing procedures, and particularly with the arrival of DNA profiling or genetic fingerprinting, it is important that the Garda should have greater power to obtain samples from persons suspected of serious crime for forensic testing.  The DNA profiling test is considered to be the single biggest advance in the field of forensic investigation since the discovery of fingerprinting at the turn of the century. It involves a technique, whereby DNA, which stores and transmits the genetic information which is in the body is extracted from the blood, semen, tissue or other bodily fluids and broken down into distinctive patterns and profiles. Since DNA is present in every part of the human body and in the bloodstream, it provides a unique means for the positive identification of tissue and fluid found at the scene of the crime.</P>
      <P>Examples of this would be semen deposited during a sex offence and blood spattered and smeared during a wide range of crimes of violence such as rape, assault, murder, house and shop-breaking, crashing of stolen vehicles and hit-and-run accidents.  DNA profiling is still a new technique and is being developed to make the test more effective.  I am delighted that our Forensic Science Laboratory is adapting itself to the new technique, that the staff have been trained and that additional equipment is being purchased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides that the taking of a sample would require the consent of the <Col N="2021" /> person from whom it is being taken.  It will be an offence to obstruct the taking of a sample.  The offence is punishable by a substantial fine or up to a 12 months jail sentence.  Samples may be taken only by a doctor or, in the case of a sample taken from the teeth or dentures, by a dentist.  A person must be told verbally that it is an offence to refuse a sample.</P>
    <P>I also note it is mentioned in the Bill that the evidence must be destroyed after 21 days if the person is acquitted or discharged. Also, in the case of a person who has a sample taken from him and proceedings taken against him, the sample must be destroyed after six months.  The taking of samples must be authorised by a superintendent or officer of higher rank.</P>

      <P>I am happy to do so as I might not get the opportunity to do so at all, as things are going.  I take note of the presence again of Senator Ross.  If I may go on while there is a thinly spread subquorum, I would like to reiterate the fact that this DNA finger printing or DNA replication of evidence is a magnificent advance in the whole area of crime detection. I have got some worries about what happens when a young person arrives in a Garda station for questioning in the very imposing and quite threatening atmosphere, which I am sure, with the best will in the world the Garda may try to avoid creating, is nevertheless felt by perhaps an inarticulate member of society who is being accused of something, particularly if he feels he is not <Col N="2022" /> guilty.  I would like to feel that there will be reassurance from the Minister that what is actually stated in the Bill will, in effect, be the practice.</P>
      <P>For example, let us take the case of someone either as a matter of principle or as a matter of outrage-because they feel they are not guilty of what they are being accused of &mdash; who refuses samples and that refusal is taken to imply guilt.  If the crime is, say, the murder of a member of the Garda Síochána, a prison officer, or a murder done in the course of the furtherance of an offence under sections 6, 7, 8 or 9 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, or a murder committed in the State for a political motive of the head of a foreign State or of a member of the Government or a diplomatic officer of a foreign State, the implications could be considerable.  That man is guiltless but his refusal to provide a specimen could be used in evidence against him and he could be found guilty of murder.  As all Senators know, the offences which I have just read out are subject to the death penalty.</P>
      <P>With that reservation I will conclude and hope the Minister will give me the necessary reassurances in the course of his reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I think the old system of fingerprinting has gone out of date.  We are living in modern times with modern technology and this is very important.  We know also that criminals are very sophisticated in their way of committing crime so we must be very sophisticated in the manner of detecting crime.  The Bill will bring in genetic fingerprinting.  It will be a much simpler system and much more positive than the old system.</P>
      <P>There are many safeguards for the suspect. No longer can a suspect be brought in and have his hand pushed down on a pad as in the old method of fingerprinting. He had to have his fingerprints taken regardless of whether he wanted to or not.  In this particular case, he cannot be brought in or harassed by the Garda because they must have the authority of a superintendent.  In practice, the superintendent has to put it in writing and there is no way the suspect can be harassed or badgered by the garda forcing him into this test.</P>
      <P>Equally, it is important when people are innocent that there is a scentific way to ensure that they can be either brought before the courts or released.  Everybody should welcome that because often when crime is not detected, everybody in the locality is a suspect until the criminal is brought to justice.</P>

    <P>In particular those provisions of the Constitution which provide for the right to privacy and to bodily integrity are <Col N="2029" /> clearly transgressed by this legislation in intent, if not in actual fact, because whereas I am glad to see that no attempt will be made by the Garda to possess themselves of these samples by force, at the same time, as Senator Robb clearly pointed out, a moral force exists because the right to silence is to a certain extent being withdrawn.  I think it is important to underline this point precisely because this is an area in which our Government have expressed concern with regard to the withdrawal of similar privileges in another jurisdiction across the water in the United Kingdom.  It is an area where we have to tread extremely carefully.</P>
    <P>Of course, the whole question of DNA is a sophisticated scientific problem.  It has been elaborated on with considerable expertise by my colleague, Senator Bulbulia, as well as the Minister and I am not going to go into it in any great detail. It is clear it offers a refinement upon finger-printing techniques and allows for a more exact identification of subject and, in addition, it is also clear that this method will be far more efficient because whereas finger prints erase fairly rapidly from most surfaces with time and are easily blurred, sometimes impossible to remove, this does not hold true to the same extent with regard to DNA samples. One has to welcome any increase in the capacity for achieving convictions of crime or rather one would have to if one was assured that the state of law in this country was all that it ought to be but as Senator Robb has said in his speech, which has anticipated a number of my own ideas, this is not the case.</P>
    <P>It is particularly worrying that we should be speaking on this matter today in a Chamber which has signally refused to discuss a highly important matter, which is directly relevant to this Bill because although I would maintain that these procedures will make the detection of crime and the conviction of criminals far more likely that raises importantly the question of the suitability of those laws. Is it appropriate to have more accurate, more reliable, more rapid methods of securing conviction when many people in this country are concerned about the <Col N="2030" /> continuing existence of the death penalty? Senator Robb spoke at some length and to some point on this and quoted the sections of the law that exist.  We may, by passing this Bill, be facilitating a situation in which persons may, by use of this evidence, be convicted on charges that could lead to the death penalty.</P>
    <P>I have to point out that it is, of course, possible to substitute or to plant these elements, just as it is possible to plant other forms of evidence.  It could quite easily be the case that this kind of organic material could be planted at the scene of the crime.  One has only got to remember the case of Timothy Evans which was detailed in a book by Ludovic Kennedy called <i>10 Rillington Place</i> where an unfortunate man was, in fact, convicted almost certainly in the wrong and was executed.</P>
    <P>It may be that people are beginning to imagine that I am wandering from the point but I am not because this raises further concerns about the detailed provisions of the Bill, in particular section 2 (8) regarding consent.  I notice that the provisions of this legislation state that &ldquo;in this Act appropriate consent means (a) in the case of a person who has attained the age of 17 years, the consent of that person (b) in the case of a person who has not attained the age of 17 years but has attained the age of 14 years the consent of that person and of a parent or guardian of that person and (c) in the case of a person who has not attained the age of 14 years the consent of a parent or guardian of that person.&rdquo;  That addresses the question of consent but it does not really address sufficiently fully the notion of consent because it uses as a rule of thumb simply the notion of age.</P>
    <P>As I am sure the Minister will be aware, there are other considerations to be brought into operation here in order to ensure that valid consent has been given.  It is not simply a question of calendar years, it can be a question of mental capacity or emotional capacity to give consent and that simply is not covered at all in this legislation, although similar matters are covered in analogous pieces of legislation where consent is deemed to be necessary.  It seems to me that it is a <Col N="2031" /> defect of the Bill that the question of the giving of consent by somebody of intellectual or emotional immaturity, even though they may be 14, 17, 21 or 37, is not covered.  We have a special responsibility to be sensitive to the rights of the most vulnerable sections of the community.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned my concern about expediting the criminal process because of the existence of the death penalty.  I think this is a perfectly legitimate concern. I think it is also fair to say that in the sort of area of criminal proceedings where one is dealing with sexual assault cases with the extraction of DNA from saliva and semen and so on and in the light of the fact that we have passed legislation during this term on sexual assault, during the process of which the Minister signally failed to take on board amendments that would knock out the 1861 and 1885 Acts which govern sexual relations between persons of the same sex, and in the context of the fact that the Government have totally failed to pay the slightest attention to the ruling in the European Court at Strasbourg and in the light of the fact that the 1861 and 1885 Acts still continue to operate despite this clear signal from Europe, and precisely this kind of forensic evidence would be used in a&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sure you will agree with me that legislation, particularly in the criminal area, is a very complex matter and that a whole series of issues are seen to be interrelated over a period of time.  If there is not a consistent approach by Government to the moral issues involved and instead of this there is a kind of a hotchpotch of legislation produced from time to time to meet immediate circumstances, then it is important that Members of the House draw the attention of the Minister to those inter-relations, and they are perfectly clear.  I am saying I am worried because we have such a defective legal code retained in operation, a lot of it going back to the time when this was a colony of the British Empire, some of it going back even beyond that.  We have not addressed ourselves to the point of reforming it so we have some totally idiotic laws on the Statute Book.  Yet, what we are doing is we are making more efficient the methodology of securing conviction without addressing ourselves to the fundamental philosophy of justice underlying our laws.  I simply put on the record of the House my conviction that there are a number of areas such as capital punishment, such as the 1861 and 1885 Acts where there is clear concern on the part of the public and I believe that we should address ourselves, as a matter of moral obligation, to these important issues, if not in advance of passing this legislation, at least in tandem with it. Whereas it is important that we have an efficient method of processing criminals through the courts system and securing just convictions, in order for those convictions to be just the law itself must be just.  It must not be perceived to be an ass in the words of Charles Dickens, and it must not be the kind of legislation that clearly brings us into contempt throughout Europe.</P>

      <P>My contribution to this debate is going to be very brief.  It is entirely my fault that I did not realise that Second Stage debate was actually over.  I apologise to the Minister, through the Chair, for causing any confusion.</P>
      <P>Whatever reservations we may have about Committee Stage of this Bill on Second Stage I can do no more that give it my wholehearted support.  I find it hard to understand the concern of some Senators about the possible injustices that may be done under this Bill.  No sooner was the Bill published than there was an alarmist chorus of alleged violations of privacy that might ensue from this Bill.  It seems to me that the Bill gives adequate protections in this area and that the main reaction to it should be simply one of welcome that modern forensic science has provided us with this remarkable mechanism to detect guilt and to narrow the range of suspects.  The odds against convicting the wrong person are so overwhelming that they are virtually non-existent.</P>

I dissociate myself entirely from what I regard as an excessive and perverse concern when it is most inappropriate, weighed against the overall good to society which the passage of this Bill will bring about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to discuss the death penalty under this because any measure which makes more accurate the conviction for a crime which has been committed is welcome.  Despite what Senator Murphy said, I know, and the House knows, that too many cases have existed, where the death penalty has been executed and where a mistake has been made.  I think principally of the case of Timothy Evans.  If this measure makes it less likely that the Government who are in favour of keeping on the Statute Book execution by hanging will use such a measure, then I favour it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest crime that society can commit against anybody is to take their life without any justification whatsoever. If forensic evidence or genetic evidence or the taking of samples of any sort reduces the likelihood of the Government being able to implement the measures which they refuse to discuss, I <Col N="2038" /> welcome it.  I point out, and I especially point it out to the Government benches, that forensic evidence in the case of the Birmingham Six in the United Kingdom is the evidence which is found to be most faulty and is the evidence which is quoted so often as being the reason they were wrongly convicted.  Had this Bill and these measures been in existence in England at the time, it is possible that a more accurate verdict, or a verdict which carried less subsequent doubt, might have been brought to bear.</P>
    <P>I would remind this House of one very telling fact about that case as well.  Had the death penalty been in existence in England at the time, the Birmingham Six would have been executed.  This is something which is sobering for those who continue to want to impose the death penalty.  I assume that this measure which is being introduced has been introduced today with that in mind and as a substitute for Item No. 2.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of pressure brought to bear on States throughout the world, including the Soviet Union, China, Ireland, Turkey and many others, during 1989 to take the death penalty off the statute books.  This is part of an international campaign by Amnesty International.  I should remind the Minister while he is here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This is why I think this Bill should be welcomed here this evening, because I see it as part of a general tightening up on crime where it is less likely and thought to be less necessary for these sorts of particular measures to be taken.  That was the view of this House as along ago as 1981.  I give the Government full marks for consistency.  In 1981 the Government, who were then in Opposition, said that capital punishment should not be taken off the Statute Book because it was the wrong time.</P>

      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister for the concessions he made in the Bill in regard to the right to privacy, the need for consent and the right to bodily integrity.  I hope it represents a turnaround on the position the Government took in 1981 on the death penalty. If it was the wrong time then and apparently, judging by questions in the other House today, it is the wrong time now, perhaps the Minister in his reply could tell us whether this Bill is just the forerunner of a Criminal Justice Bill, which is what my Bill to abolish the death penalty and to be introduced this evening was <Col N="2040" /> called.  It seems to me that this legislation would be consistent with it.  If it is the wrong time now, perhaps the Minister will tell us, in the context of this Bill, when is the right time, because it was the wrong time in 1981, it is the wrong time in 1989 and it has been the wrong time every year since 1981.  Perhaps the Minister could tell us, in the context of this Bill, whether he is creating the conditions in this Bill for the abolition of the death penalty or whether he is not.  I would see this as being entirely consistent with it being the wrong time at the moment but being the right time when this Bill is passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am getting back to it.  Let me welcome the fact that this Bill will probably act as a deterrent to crime.  I think the philosophy behind it is also consistent with the abolition of the death penalty, because the philosophy is that detection is more important than penalty. This Bill is about detection.  It is about producing the forensic evidence which will make the commission of crime less likely.  It is not about penalties.  I have <Col N="2041" /> always been a great believer in the fact that, if you are going to prevent crime, what you do is what is in this Bill, that you stop it being committed at source, but what you do not do is impose strict, barbaric penalties.  That is why I think this is consistent with what I was saying, because if the Government lay less emphasis on penalties and more on detection we will have a far healthier criminal code in this country.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister in his reply to say whether this is actually the Government's philosophy at the moment and, whether in the light of the very healthy attitude in this Bill, they intend to come forward with measures to reform the criminal code on the issue of penalties and whether they have got plans to reform the penalties which are imposed for crimes of all sorts in this country.  I include in those crimes, the crimes of treason and of capital murder.  If the Government are going to have a higher detection rate on that, I presume that the barbaric execution which they apparently seek still to impose or to keep on the Statute Book will be removed from the Statute Book as a balance to the particularly constructive measures in this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In reading through the Bill and considering the various sections and conditions that are outlined in it, a number of things come to mind.  The thing I found most confusing about the Bill was that recently in this House we discussed different legislation.  There was legislation, a Customs and Excise Act, which sought to extend the powers of custom officers in the vicinity of airports, ports etc.  I proposed an amendment to that legislation seeking to allow the taking of samples.  In the case I proposed it was a urine sample and I went to great pains to explain to the Minister at the time what was involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I was seeking to do is being covered in this Bill now.  At that time most of the drugs that were being smuggled into airports were being smuggled <Col N="2042" /> by people who either ingested or in some way kept in the body orifices containers of heroin.  A situation had arisen where customs officers were quite aware that these stuffers and swallowers, as they are called, were literally walking through customs carrying, secreted in some parts of their body, containers &mdash; normally condoms &mdash; full of heroin.  A new test had been developed which by the use of the urine sample could determine whether somebody was carrying any kind of a foreign body inside his or her body; in other words, it would have identified the person as having in his or her stomach a container containing heroin or whatever.</P>
    <P>I put forward this and I explained in detail the way it operated.  I explained how it was in operation in various airports, particularly Heathrow, in the UK, how it was being used in the Continent, how the European customs officials had discussed this through their international body and how the Irish customs officials had asked that the legislation be extended to do precisely what we are talking about here today, the forensic evidence, to allow urine samples to be acquired of people suspected of either having stuffed or ingested containers of hard and illegal drugs.</P>
    <P>Having discussed it at some length &mdash; I recall the day very well because we had a lot of argument about the point &mdash; the main objection which was put forward by the Minister at that stage was that this would in some way be an intrusion of a person's bodily integrity, that it would create some constitutional difficulties and a whole lot of other things, which now appear to be a total rigmarole in the light of what we have here before us today.  I ask the Minister to give a very detailed response on that point.</P>
    <P>I recall well that in my proposition I was also supported by speakers from the Fine Gael Party on that day.  We thought that perhaps this was a very practical way of dealing with this.  All it would have proven was that circumstantially it was probable that the person was carrying <Col N="2043" /> drugs and it would have allowed that person to be retained in custody for a number of days or hours in order to allow either something to come through through normal bodily functions or through medical examination to actually find the container.</P>
    <P>This Bill before us today is giving the power to do all that I was proposing at that time.  I would love to know what happened in the meantime in the Departments of Justice or Finance, or whichever Department put it forward.  I would like to know what was the development in the meantime.  How was it that something which was seen to be absolutely practical a year ago to us on the non-Government side of the House now suddenly appears in other legislation to be totally acceptable? I am not saying that in the sense that I object to what is in the Bill; I welcome most of what is in the Bill &mdash; but I worry in case some other official in another Department is aware of something which we here are not aware of which could eventually give rise to this Bill being found to be unconstitutional.  I look forward to hearing a very detailed response on that and if I do not get a very detailed response I intend to bore you on Committee Stage with it in terms of reading what was said during the previous discussion.</P>
    <P>On that point I think it is also important that people will recognise, as certainly a lot of speakers on the Government side of the House do not seem to recognise, that this is merely circumstantial evidence we are talking about.  This is simply a recognition of the great developments and innovations in forensic medicine and forensic science.  It is critical that that would be taken into consideration.  All it does, of course, is that it provides circumstantial evidence to show that somebody was probably in a certain place at a certain time.  That is all it does.  I would certainly like a clear undertaking from the Minister that this does not prove the guilt or otherwise of a person.  There are <Col N="2044" /> all sorts of circumstances where the person's DNA profile or body excretion might be found in a certain place but that does not necessarily mean that a person is guilty.</P>
    <P>For that reason I have concerns about the Bill.  The &ldquo;Hang-em and Flog-em Brigade&rdquo; really opt in very simply for this kind of legislation; it gives us more power and therefore you sort of cod people into thinking you give us more justice.  More power and more evidence does not mean justice, unfortunately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed and one would welcome more expertise.  It is on that basis that much of what is in the Bill would be recognised.  The subtlety put forward by my colleague, Senator Murphy, is something that should be taken on board by speakers from the other side of the House who simply believe that, standing up with evidence, we can say that up until now we just had a person's fingerprints but now we have got evidence that their semen was there and therefore, they are guilty of rape or whatever.  It is not just that simple.  It is merely circumstantial evidence. If somebody said &ldquo;I saw that guy coming out of that room at that particular hour,&rdquo; that is direct evidence and it should also place a person in a particular time and place if the judgment of the person giving the evidence is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Bill certain forensic evidence which is found can now be identified and used in evidence.  Not only would I not object to that but, as I took pains to point out at the beginning, I would welcome it because any extra evidence, any proper harnessing of modern technology and of developments in modern science are to be welcomed.  The discussion, in many cases reactionary, which has taken place against this type of development is similar to what happened <Col N="2045" /> when fingerprinting was first brought in and people objected to its use.</P>
    <P>There was the same reaction with regard to video interviews where children of a very young age were required to give evidence.  In more developed countries than ours that type of development is allowed to take place &mdash; the use of modern science, the video tape recorder &mdash; to facilitate young people who are required to give evidence to a court of law.  I have no objection to that and I do not think any sensible person could have any objection to it.  Similarly, it has taken years to have photographic evidence accepted.  I am not sure of the precise position about photographic evidence in courts of law at the moment but for years there was a lot of difficulty about its acceptance.  There is still a lot of difficulty about accepting audio recorded evidence.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear from the Minister the reason why all technology was not encompassed in this legislation.  It does not matter that it is the taking of samples. What we are talking about there is the use of modern technology.  We are talking about harnessing the progress that has been made in forensic science.  Let us not confine it to that.  Let us take it a bit further.  Let us look at other ways in which modern science can help us in bringing people to justice and &ldquo;justice&rdquo; is the key word.  One of the things I like most about this piece of legislation is contained in section 2 (4).  Before a member of the Garda takes a sample from a person, the Garda shall inform the person &ldquo;of the nature of the offence in which it is suspected that that person has been involved...&rdquo;.  I welcome that. I think that is a major move forward rather than section 30, which has been abused, because the Garda would say &mdash; and I have discussed it with them &mdash; they have not got the enabling legislation to move in other directions.  I am all in favour of giving the Garda the enabling legislation to move in whatever judicial way they need to in order to compile <Col N="2046" /> evidence to bring to court, but I hate giving a <i>carte blanche</i>.  That is important.</P>
    <P>The other issue on which I am not at all clear is the holding of records and the destruction of records.  I want to know precisely how this evidence is going to be stored and where it is going to be stored. I want to know who is going to have access to that evidence.  I want to know the requirements somebody has to go through in order to have access to that evidence while it is stored.  I want to know precisely how it is going to be destroyed at the end of that time.  I do not believe it is going to be destroyed.  That is a fairly stark statement to make.  If the most stringent regulations are not brought in to clear the operation of this, then it will certainly be misused.  That is what would worry one most.</P>
    <P>There is the other point &mdash; the trillion to one chance of two people having the same DNA profile.  If there is a chance, then it could happen.  Coincidences do happen in real life.  I would like to hear a very detailed description of how this coincidence of DNA can happen.  I would like to know particularly has it been found to be the case &mdash; in other words, is it possible that there are people living on this globe today with identical DNA profiles?</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I was going to ask a question about identical twins.  I was going to ask precisely the question about two people who come from a split cell. Do they have the same DNA?  My understanding is that they can, but I am not sure of this.  I recognise this is a very technical piece of legislation.  The difficulty about identical twins is that if the DNA of identical twins is identical it can lead to all sorts of difficulties in real life. I just want to give one example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the great stories in literature &mdash; I am sure my colleague, Senator Norris, will correct me on this &mdash; depend <Col N="2047" /> on coincidence.  Certainly, the stories of Thomas Hardy depend almost entirely, in terms of development of plot, on natural coincidence.  In the world we live in, the way people try to hide certain things, the possibility of twins living in this world not knowing that they have a twin somewhere else is quite common.  We had a case that went on for six months in Tralee not so long ago.  In that instance the most eminent of the Judiciary were involved, but people still say perhaps there were twins involved.</P>
    <P>There can very often be identical twins, where somebody is trying to conceal a birth or where the children are separated at birth, neither knowing that the other exists, and they may well be living in the same area.  It is not a huge coincidence to find that they might grow up in a similar kind of social milieu.  It is not a huge coincidence to say that perhaps one could be circumstantially tied to the place and time of a crime committed by the identical twin.  I do not know how you are going to deal with all that, but I am looking forward to hearing the answers to it.  I have read a little about this over a period of time and I am not at all convinced that there are clear answers to it.</P>
    <P>This brings us to the point of the use and misuse of forensic evidence and how it is going to be used in the courts.  In looking through the Bill I see how it can be used as evidence.  I see that we can also deal in a certain way with a person who refuses to comply with a request for a sample.</P>

      <P>I think my colleague, Senator Ross, wanted to ensure I had an audience.  May I ask that the Senators on the Government side direct their ire at the person who caused the chaos today. It is not on this side of the House but in the seat which the Senator is now occupying.</P>
      <P>Before we sought the quorum I was dealing with the point about identical twins and the requirement on us all to see that justice is done as well as being seen to be done.  I will not labour that point any further but it is basically this. How does one explain the difficulty which can arise?  Where is the failsafe?  The whole basis of British law, which used to be the same for Irish law until Lord Denning made his famous statement of recent times, is that it is better for 99 guilty people to go free than it is for one innocent person to be incarcerated.  It is on that basis that we have always protected the rights of the individual.  It is on that basis as well that we have all supported the Birmingham Six because we have objected first to the way the forensic evidence was obtained, secondly, how it was stored and, thirdly, how it was presented.  On the basis of the coincidences that would be necessary to make them guilty we said that it was not acceptable, that there was plenty of room for doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is the vital question on this one. Let us take the example of a court case where, through the use of forensic evidence arising from the sample of urine, semen or whatever, this sample having being found at the scene of the crime, that the DNA profile of some suspected person is identical to the profile found at the scene of the crime and that this is the major evidence that the person is guilty. Suppose also at that particular time the lawyer representing the defendant produces out of the blue an identical twin of the defendant whom nobody knew <Col N="2049" /> existed.  I ask the Minister to recognise that the case would collapse, that the DNA would be of no use.  Having said that, we then take it a step further where a lawyer says &ldquo;How do you know that my client, the defendant, does not have an identical twin somewhere?&rdquo;.  The only way to do that is to have the DNA profile of every living human being computerised. I ask the Minister to respond on that one on the question of identical twins.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the regulations which will arise on the implementation of this Bill.  In section 5 we have the regulations regarding the taking of samples. They cover a certain number of areas, how the authorisation can be given, who will give it, the time and manner of taking the sample under this Bill and the protection of young people, etc.  This is precisely the point on which the whole Birmingham Six issue falls apart.  Nobody accepts that the manner in which the samples were taken from the Birmingham Six was acceptable.  They were not taken under laboratory conditions. It seems that the regulations which outline how the sample will be taken will be what is critical.  I ask the Minister how will the sample be taken?</P>
    <P>On a point of order, it was brought to the attention of Members of the house recently that Members should not approach the Chair during debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter totally for the discretion of the Chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fine but I am bringing to the attention of the Chair that we &mdash; the Whips &mdash; were asked to bring this to the notice of the people we represent. The reason I made the point is that I already brought that matter to the attention of a member of our group today who was going to do precisely the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the regulations which cover the taking of samples will be critical.  Senator Lydon asked a question <Col N="2050" /> earlier about certain kinds of samples which might be required.  They are not required in my reading of the Bill but in his reading of the Bill he sees a greater need than the rest of us.  In terms of the taking of samples I want to know how they will be taken, who will take them, where they will be taken and how the regulations will apply.  The Minister at this stage must have had sight of the draft regulations.  Could we have some sight of them?</P>
    <P>The Minister may recall the total farce we had last year with the restaurant regulations. Those regulations were required to be brought before this House and they had to be accepted by way of a positive process.  They actually had to be approved by vote, order or agreement of the House.  However, the regulations governing section 5 of this Bill are dealt with through a negative process.  The section states:</P>
    <P>that every regulation made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as it may be ...</P>
    <P>It further states:</P>
    <P>if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either such House within the next 21 days, the regulation shall be annulled.</P>
    <P>It is laid before the House, as many things are every single day, and unless they are brought up, discussed and rejected, then they become law.</P>
    <P>We already have the problem here today of trying to have something discussed in the House even when we have agreement to get it discussed.  If we have that difficulty getting something discussed on which we already have agreement, can Senators imagine the difficulty we will run into if we seek to have discussed something which the Leader of the House will refuse to put on the Order of Business? For instance today we have had laid before us for the information of the <Col N="2051" /> House, the Health Services (Amendment) Regulation, 1989 and the Statutes CXLVII and CXLVIII from University College, Cork.  For all we know, that might be selling Fota Island, but it is there before us today.  In the same way, in three months' time, we will see a regulation which will be there under section 5 of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Bill, 1989.  It will have outlined in that paper, how, where, when and if and all the conditions and requirements for the taking of evidence under section 5 of this Bill.  It is there by negative process. If we do not reject it, it becomes law.  We do not have to discuss it, we do not have to read it unless we reject it.  The process by which we would reject it is by getting it on the floor of the House for discussion, having had the discussion, taking a vote on it and then having it rejected.</P>
    <P>That is not good enough.  It seems to me that this is too vital an undertaking to have left so vague.  It should not be dealt with by regulations.  The methods should be included in the legislation.  However, I recognise that modern science develops, that there may be new ways of doing the same job next year and it would not be appropriate to have different ways of taking evidence and having it brought in to legislation on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>There is a way around it.  I intend having an amendment on Committee Stage that the regulations under section 5 would be by positive process.  Instead of saying &ldquo;that every regulation made under this section shall be laid before the House and unless it is annulled ...&rdquo; it would be &ldquo;every regulation shall be laid before the House and shall become accepted when it is passed by the House ...&rdquo;.  It has to be presented and passed and agreed to by the House.</P>
    <P>That is the very least we could agree to.  The advantage of that from the Government's point of view is that by not having it enshrined in the Bill, it allows the Government to take advantage of developments in forensic science and if <Col N="2052" /> there are new ways of taking samples or whatever, they can simply bring in the new methods by a new regulation.  The requirement must be that the regulation be laid before the House by a positive process and be accepted by the House.</P>
    <P>I would be prepared to agree that far but I would still be unhappy with it because one of the great problems with the House in dealing with that type of thing is that unfortunately when regulations are laid before this House by positive process they can only be either rejected <i>in toto</i> or accepted, they may not be amended.  I would certainly want to hear the Minister's explanation of that. What happens if a regulation is laid before the House and somebody proposes to amend it?  Can it be amended? How can it be amended?  If people agreed with 95 per cent of it, what would be the procedure that would be followed at that time?</P>
    <P>In section 4 of the Bill which deals with the records there must surely be regulations for the storing of this kind of information.  I do not see them in the Bill. Section 3 refers to refusal of consent to the taking of a sample and section 4 refers to the destruction of records and samples. Everything is in it except the storing of the records.  How will they be stored and where will they be stored?  That surely will have to be a matter of regulation. Will it just lie around with other evidence or will it be distinguishable in any way from other evidence?  Will it just simply lie there in a file, open and available to other officers or anybody involved in a case?  Who will be in charge of it?  At what level will confidentiality be maintained?  I do not understand why that is not contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill, in what it sets out to do, is obviously quite acceptable, but where does its operation take place?  Is that laid down?  Are these regulations written and available?  Have the questions which I have put to the Minister been dealt with already in the Department?  I believe they have not.  I believe there are some serious <Col N="2053" /> questions which will be raised about this Bill and the most serious one is the question of regulation.  There is no regulation in the Bill about storing of information. It does not indicate where information will be stored.  The Bill does not indicate who will have access to the information stored and, as I said earlier it does not indicate how it will be stored or how it will be destroyed if, under the terms of the Bill, it is required to be destroyed.  I certainly want to know that.  I am afraid that this evidence may be open and available to a whole variety of people who may be tempted to abuse it.</P>
    <P>The regulations should be implemented by way of positive process. The regulations should have to be presented and accepted positively by the House and, more importantly that in those situations it would be possible to amend them.  I am worried because the regulations are not available to us in some form at this time.  Regulations, as I understand them, deal with matters that change regularly and which need to be changed. In order to facilitate a Department in operating a Bill, they would use regulations as opposed to amending legislation. That is a far more businesslike way of doing something than simply requiring a new Bill to be brought in every time a change needs to be made.</P>
    <P>There is a basic point of principle here, a basic point of law.  There is a basic point here about freedom of information, about access to information and about confidentiality, all those things together and the tension that must be between them.  I ask the Minister to indicate how that will be done and how the regulations will be brought in.  I want him to deal with the problem of coincidence which I have raised earlier and the question of the indentical twins, how that would stand in a court of law and where it would get us.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the things I have to say about the Bill.  I do not want to go on any longer because it would be misinterpreted if I did.  I believe we should <Col N="2054" /> be in a position to answer those questions. We will get into a legal morass on a number of these issues in a court of law. For that reason it would be well to clear them up now.  It would also be well for the Minister at least to indicate his willingness to accept amendments to this Bill on Committee Stage, I certainly will have a number of amendments along the lines I have indicated on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa thar ceann an Aire Dlí ags Círt buíochas a ghabháil leis na Seanadóirí a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht.  Mar atá a fhios agat, tá an tAire i dTuaisceart na hÉireann inniú ag cruinniú den Chomhdháil Angla-Éireannach i Maryfield.  Gheobhaidh na Seanadóirí a bhfuil ceisteanna acu deis iad a phlé ar Céim an Choiste.  Cuirfidh mise in iúl don Aire na pointí agus na ceisteanna éagsúla a pléadh inniu.  Aontaím le cuid de na pointí ginearálta a ardaíodh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want, first and foremost, to apologise on behalf of the Minister for Justice who, the House will understand, is co-chairing a meeting of the Anglo Irish Conference in Maryfield today.  I would, of course, like to thank all of the Senators who contributed to the debate.  It is a very important piece of legislation and will, I believe, make a significant contribution to the detection and conviction of those who commit a criminal offence.  I know there are issues arising out of the Bill which Senators will wish to discuss further or on which they will require clarification. <Col N="2056" /> I am sure they will appreciate that these are matters which should properly be left to the Minister for Justice who, through no fault of his own, is unable to be here today.  I can assure the House that careful note has been taken of all comments that have been made by Senators in the course of the debate and those comments will be carefully considered by the Minister for Justice before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I will, of course make reference to a number of the general points made by the various Seantors.  With regard to the question raised by Senator Bulbulia about discussions with ICI, negotiations with them to obtain a licence to use the technique are at a very advanced stage and no difficulties are anticipated about getting this licence.</P>
    <P>Senator Robb mentioned the question of an inference to be drawn from refusal to give a sample.  It was also mentioned by other Senators.  It will be a matter for the court to decide in the circumstances of each particular case whether it is appropriate that an inference should be drawn.  An inference will not be drawn if the court is satisfied that there was good cause for refusal.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank in particular Senators McEllistrim, Farrell and Lydon and all the Senators who welcomed the Bill and to thank them for the support they expressed for it.  Senator Lydon referred to the question of samples of semen and how will samples of semen be taken.  The Bill does not provide for the taking of samples of semen and it is not necessary as blood samples will be adequate.</P>
    <P>With the greatest respect to Senator O'Toole, I must pose the question: did the Senator actually go through the Bill with a finecomb because the points he raised are enshrined in the Bill?  He thought forensic evidence should be treated only as circumstantial.  The Bill provides the power to take samples.  It makes no changes in the laws of evidence. <Col N="2057" /> It is a matter for the court or the jury to decide what weight is to be given to any item of evidence, including forensic evidence.</P>
    <P>The Senator asked if every person's DNA is different.  Yes, it is different apart from identical twins.  I do not want Senator O'Toole to make a facetious remark but, in a jovial sense, I think many people including myself would say this evening that, thankfully, Senator O'Toole does not have an identical twin in the House.  The same could be said I am sure for other Senators &mdash; that hopefully, they do not have an identical twin.  In fact, it is a matter for the court and the jury to decide whether there is any real danger of a wrongful conviction and to decide on the possibility of an identical twin existing.  The Bill lays down no rules about how the court or jury should view forensic evidence but, as I say and at the expense of repeating myself, it is a matter for the court and the jury to decide whether there is any real danger.</P>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia referred at the outset to the Bill being prompted by Deputy Shatter's Bill.  I would have to take the opportunity of putting on the record that this Bill was not prompted by Deputy Shatter's Bill, that his Bill contained many defects and would not form the basis for legislation on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Bulbulia also referred to details of the regulations to be made and noted that they are not given in the Bill.  The main safeguards are enshrined in the Bill.  The regulations will deal with detailed matters which need not be covered by it.  This is not abnormal.  It is something which is very normal and the regulations cannot be made until the Bill is enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole asked who should carry out various functions.  I would refer him to some of the safeguards that my colleague outlined briefly, the safeguards provided in the Bill &mdash; the taking of a <Col N="2058" /> sample must be authorised in writing by a superintendent or officer of higher rank; the suspected person must be informed before a sample is taken and why it is being taken; intimate or instrusive samples may only be taken by a doctor, or a dentist in the case of a dental impression.  All of these safeguards are there and the regulations will be made by the Minister when the Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made regarding the storing of records.  How the Garda handle and store evidence is a matter entirely for internal Garda regulations.  This Bill will not introduce any novel features which would require more regulations.  The Garda no doubt treat all evidence as confidential and it would be a breach of discipline for any members to break this confidence.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross was particularly interested in Item No. 2 on today's Order Paper in relation to the motion in his name and that of other Senators.  May I say to him that there is no relationship between that proposal and the death penalty and this Bill and perhaps some of his colleagues would so inform Senator Ross. I will do it myself as he was so interested.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole mentioned the previous Bill.  That Bill was the responsibility of the Minister for Finance and not that of the Minister for Justice and, on behalf of the Minister for Justice, I would have no responsibility over matters and Bills which the Minister for Finance would bring before the House.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matter. - Irish Language Assessment for Junior Certificate.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This will be entirely non-acrimonious.  The Adjournment matter is the need to ensure effective arrangements in assessing the large numbers of pupils to be examined under the new junior certificate curriculum in respect of aural testing and oral competence in the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2061" /> I have raised this matter on behalf of many teachers who are my constituents. The Minister is, of course, aware that there is very general concern among teachers, the ASTI and the TUI, about the new junior certificate in general, and general concern about the likely way in which it will operate.  There are complaints about the unsatisfactory in-service situation and so on.  There is a genuine fear that inadequate resources may frustrate the whole purpose of what is a very exciting curriculum.  Much of the dissatisfaction stems from uncertainty about what will happen.  This is particularly true about the aspect of the matter which I am raising this evening, a particular aspect of a general concern.</P>
    <P>Not only teachers but bodies like Conradh na Gaeilge and Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge are concerned in particular about how the assessment of the Irish language will be provided for.  There are other matters of concern where Irish is concerned such as the long time lack of any suitable textbooks &mdash; a matter in which I was involved long ago &mdash; the lack of suitable reading material for 12 to 15-year-olds, although I understand there is now some progress on that front.  That is not the immediate cause of my raising this matter on the Adjournment.  It is simply that we do not know if there will be aural and oral components in the Irish examination and how unsatisfactory they will be.</P>
    <P>There are over 70,000 junior certificate pupils to be assessed in the course of this examination.  Last year, for example, approximately 56,000 students took the Intermediate Certificate Irish course and something like 11,000 students took the Group Certificate.  That is a total of 66,000 and it is fair to mention a round figure of 70,000 junior certificate pupils. How will they be provided for?  How is their aural understanding &mdash; their claustuiscint &mdash; and their oral competence &mdash; their cumas cainte &mdash; to be assessed?  That is the nub of my question here tonight. Will this assessment be as satisfactory as <Col N="2062" /> that which obtains in modern continental languages?  If the same standards are not going to be applied, the junior certificate will be worse than useless.</P>
    <P>Gan mheasúnú don teanga labhartha is ar éigean go bhfuil aon chiall leis an teastas sóisearach sa Ghaeilge.  Níos mó ná sin, bheadh droch-thionchar ag scrúdú scríofa gan triail chluas-tuisceana ar chleachtas múinteoireachta.  Tá an sain-eolas ann cheana féin, sain-eolas ar mheasúnú den sórt atá i gceist agam anseo ar fáil ón dtaithí ar na nua theangacha, Fraincís, Spáinnis agus Gearmáinis. Tá an sain-eolas seo ag cigirí na Roinne.  Ní cóir go mbeadh aon fhadhbanna riaracháin ag baint le triail chluas-tuisceana má reachtáiltear í lasitigh den scrúdú oifigiúil, is é sin ar aon raon leis na nua-theangancha.</P>
    <P>Tá taithí ag daltaí agus lucht féitheoireachta ar seo cheana.  Cuirim i gcás, anuraidh bhí triail chluas-tuisceana ag na hiarrthóirí go léir a dhein na nua-theangacha, suas le 6,000 sa teastas grúpa agus 48,000 sa mheán-teistiméireacht.  Dá bhrí sin, sa ghné sin den mheasúnú, is é sin sna nua-theangacha, tá gach rud i gceart agus nílimid ach ag iarraidh go mbeidh na caighdeáin chéanna i gceist sa Ghaeilge.  Níl aon tír eile, go bhfios dúinn, in a nglactar le scrúdú scíofa amháin gan triail chluas-tuisceana agus triail chainte a bheith ag gabháil leis. Agus ní heol go mbeidh rud mar seo costasach ach chomh beag.  Is é an t-eolas atá agamsa ná nach mbeadh i gceist ach costas de £10,000 nó mar sin.</P>
    <P>What I am pleading for, essentially, is that we apply the same standards to Irish as we do to continental languages.  I welcome in one way that there is an awareness of Irish as one of the lesser used languages of the Community but the danger of that is that it will be seen as some kind of optional, marginal, freak language that does not have to be taken seriously.  We should demand a major role for Irish so that in the end, perhaps, it will get a reasonable treatment.  I am <Col N="2063" /> speaking here not alone about an educational necessity &mdash; that we should apply the best assessment and expertise to Irish &mdash; but we should also be positive in the context of 1992 about the cultural contribution we can make to our European partners.  What we can give them most distinctively is the Irish language.</P>
    <P>There is another development taking place at the moment which gives my rather narrow question a greater general relevance.  I think there is evidence of a growing popular appreciation of Irish in the lives of our people.  If I may say so, in spite of the efforts of the State over the decades the Irish language will not die.  What has happened in the past ten years or so, as is evidenced in the Gaelscoileanna particularly in the naí-scoileanna is that people are appreciating the language not as a badge of fanatical nationalism, as the terrorists would have us regard it, but as an enrichment of their lives and of their individual and national personality.  I see that development, the European context and the junior certificate all coming together, as it were. That is why it is so important that the Irish language should not be short-changes in the junior certificate curriculum.</P>

      <P>May I first congratulate the Cathaoirleach and the Seantors on their newly refurbished building.  I had not seen it before and it is absolutely magnificient and, indeed, no more than all of you deserve.  In the context of the times in which we are living, I hope all of you will be back in the Seanad again now that you have had the pleasure of returning to this lovely Chamber.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Murphy for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I am pleased he has done so because one of my cribs has been the lack of general debate about the whole issue of the junior certificate and I am very glad it has been brought up here in the Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will, first of all, speak in general <Col N="2064" /> because the debate was started in the general context of the junior certificate. I have met with the unions on several occasions about the matter and I am about to meet with the JMB and with the managerial body of the vocational sector. I addressed all of the conferences at Easter.  I have within the past two weeks been informed by both unions that the arrangement we have now made for the in-service courses, the increased provision by over 200 per cent, the new layout of the in-service courses beginning in September of one day each term, and the type of courses, are entirely acceptable to them and they have accepted now the revised in-service arrangements.  I am very pleased about that.  There are other matters on which they seek advice and seek counsel with me and we are pursuing those.</P>
    <P>Because reference was made to in-service, I would like the House to know we have reached an amicable agreements on that.  There remain other matters of concern which we will have to address in the overall context of the junior certificate.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Senator for the very obvious enthusiasm for changes in the curriculaum which he has expressed here this evening.  I have met with some of the bodies involved in the Irish language, as mentioned by him, and they remain most enthusiastic about the whole junior certificate in Irish.  The teachers of Irish have expressed enthusiasm for it. They say it opens up the course, it makes it more attractive to young children and makes it more attractive for them to teach.  All of that is necessary if we are to change.</P>
    <P>I will address the precise question which has been raised here in the Seanad, the need for the Minister for Education to ensure effective arrangements in assessing the large numbers of pupils to be examined under the new junior certificate curriculum in respect of aural testing and oral competence in the Irish language.  The numbers, I am sure, would be within the range the Senator spoke of, <Col N="2065" /> at least from 65,000 on, who would, le cúnamh Dé, be sitting the exam in June of 1992.</P>
    <P>When I circulated the new junior certificate syllabus in Irish on 20 September 1988 to the schools, I advised the school authorities at that time that the aural and the oral tests in Irish would be introduced on a phased basis.  When I went to Killarney at Easter to meet the ASTI and on to Kilkenny to meet the TUI I indicated that it was my intention to advance the oral components in all languages, including Irish.</P>
    <P>The Senator spoke about how Spanish, German and Italian were all now being enthusiastically taken up and that the Irish should not be left behind in the general competency with which the oral component was being addressed in those languages.  It is still my intention to pursue this objective with regard to junior certificate Irish.</P>
    <P>The provision of aural and oral tests in Irish at this level must be approached carefully because of the consequent implications for the assessment of all other languages in the junior certificate programme and because of the need, of course, to take account of the different dialects.  For those reasons I have now asked the inspectors of Irish in my Department and the officials in the Examinations Branch in Athlone to examine the feasibility of having an aural test in junior certificate Irish from 1992 onwards.  I am now awaiting the result of their investigations and then we will be making the final plans in this regard.</P>
    <P>In making provision for aural and later oral tests in junior certificate Irish, my Department will be able to draw upon the extensive experience which it has now acquired in providing aural and oral tests in modern continental languages at both Intermediate and Leaving Certificate levels since 1985 and in providing oral tests in Irish at Leaving Certificate level since 1960.  I very much take what Senator Murphy has said, if the new junior certificate Irish &mdash; and that is what <Col N="2066" /> we are talking about here &mdash; is to have relevance and meaning, the whole thrust and scope of the new syllabus is to encourage people to like Irish.  I take the Senator's point that there is now a broad feeling that Irish can to a greater extent be taken up by people.  If we are to follow through the thrust of the syllabus in junior Irish it will need the aural and the oral competency; otherwise the thrust of it will be lost because the end result will not be experienced by the students when they do that part of their examination. That is what we want, to make the Irish meaningful.</P>
    <P>Certainly against the backdrop of 1992 and the insistence now &mdash; correctly so &mdash; by the children and parents on the need for more languages, I am very glad that Irish has now been accepted by the European Parliamentary Commission and adopted in the Lingua Programme last Monday as being one of the &ldquo;minority&rdquo; languages.  It is up to us now to build up on that, having got that recognition, acceptance and inclusion under the Lingua Programme.  That was a fair step and we were pleased with it.</P>
    <P>It will be very important when we are committed to the European ideal that we also remain committed to the fact that we are first Irish and then European, and that being European does not take one jot from being Irish as well.  Part of that will be our Irish language.  It sounds simplistic but it will become more important rather than less important, as we become, in every sense of the word, full citizens of Europe.</P>
    <P>It is my intention and the intention of the Department of Education that, as written on the syllabus that went out in September, as taken up by me at the teacher conferences, and now in my later consultations with the unions and other bodies, that the aural and the oral components of Irish will be advances on a phased basis in the new junior certificate. I would expect that commitment would <Col N="2067" /> follow through in whatever changed circumstances might arise within the Department or the Minister in charge.</P>
    <P>I want to thank Senator Murphy for his very obvious concern and for the fact that the only debate on this matter was in this House, despite all the media publicity about the junior certificate.  I was glad to come to the House and to put that <Col N="2068" /> commitment on record.  I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, and Senator Murphy.</P>
