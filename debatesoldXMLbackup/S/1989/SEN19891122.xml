      <P>I have notice from Senator Joe O'Reilly that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to increase funding for roads to Cavan County Council in view of the appalling state of the roads in the county.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Pat Upton of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to provide adequate funding for the Multiple Sclerosis Centre in Bushy Park Road, Rathgar, Dublin 6, to ensure its long term viability.</P>
      <P>Tá fógra agam ón Seanadóir Pól Ó Foighil:</P>
      <P>An gá atá ann go méadóidh an tAire Comhshaoil an t-olldeontas bóithre do Ghaillimh ag féachaint do dhrochstaid na mbóithre i gConamara.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Joe Costello of the following matters:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> 1.  The need for the Minister for Education to fulfil her commitment to the development of a new school in North Clondalkin for the students of <Col N="554" /> St. Kevin's Community College who are in temporary accommodation.</P>
    <P>2.  The need for the Minister for the Environment to ensure that all public housing in the inner city of Dublin is furnished with bathrooms and/or shower facilities.  </P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators O'Reilly, Upton, Ó Foighil and Senator Costello's first matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matter raised by Senator O'Reilly and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Upton, Ó Foighil and Costello may give notice another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret I have to rule the second matter raised by Senator Costello is not suitable for discussion on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>

      <P>In relation to the matter I wished to raise on the Adjournment, namely the need for the Minister for the Environment to ensure that all public housing in the inner city of Dublin is furnished with bathrooms and/or shower facilities, this is a matter of considerable importance.  I wonder if the Cathaoirleach would reconsider it and allow the matter to be raised on the Adjournment and whether ministerial responsibility could be extended.</P>

      <P>It is intended that we take Items Nos. 1, 3, 6 and No. 4 today. Item No. 1 is an order for Second Stage which is a formality.  We will take Item No. 3 until 4.30 p.m., we will take Item No. 6 to conclude at 6.30 p.m. and we will continue the motion on eastern Europe.  A number of Senators have suggested they might like an extension to that motion.  If that is so we can accommodate them but not today.  It is intended that tomorrow morning we will continue <Col N="555" /> with the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Bill and that we list the NESC report.  We will continue with the Committee Stage of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Bill to a conclusion tomorrow and we will take Report Stage next week or at another time.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House on the Order of Business if he could as soon as possible, perhaps tomorrow or next week, give us some indication of the number of committees which the Government intend to set up during the course of this Dáil and Seanad, the number of joint committees and perhaps give us some sort of timetable as to when these committees will come into existence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join my voice with Senator Manning particularly with regard to the women's committee and the foreign affairs committee.  May I ask the Leader of the House if he will consider giving time for the taking of Item No. 59 which relates directly to this and reads:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the fact that an informal Committee of Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas on Foreign Affairs has been formed and that a briefing on human rights in the Philippines will take place by Dr. Edicio de la Tome under the sponsorship of the Committee on Tuesday, 28th November, 1989 &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am inquiring when Item No. 59, to which I have drawn attention, <Col N="556" /> which contains the date of the next meeting, will be taken.  I would like to ask also if the Leader of the House will have information for me, as promised, with regard to Item No. 42.  Even though I may not be able to read out the substance of Item No. 42, to facilitate Members may I ask if the Leader of the House will direct himself to the substance rather than just the numeral indicator of the items.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House tell us why the Criminal Justice Bill is being postponed.  I understood as recently as yesterday that it was on the Order of Business for today.  We were half-way through it last week so the continuity of the discussion has been broken at this stage.  Will the Leader of the House clarify the matter?  Secondly, I would like to ask him if he proposes to note the Estimates for the Public Service, 1990 which were published last week? They are, of course, an extremely important matter, which deserve discussion in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I asked the Leader of the House to respond on the matter of committees which has been raised again to day by the Leader of the Fine Gael Group.  We have a serious problem which I ask would be addressed either through the Cathaoirleach's good offices or the good offices of the Leader of the House.  In setting up of joint committees of both Houses we are the only group who do not have a voice or an input and that is not acceptable.  We are the third largest group in this House and I appeal to the Cathaoirleach to use his good offices.  I am not sure of the precise procedure, whether it is a matter for the Chair or for the Leader of the House.  It is something in which we intend having a voice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a related but different issue, we have a similar problem with the setting up of the parliamentary tier of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  We are the fifth largest group in the Oireachtas.  If we join with the group of Independents in the Dáil we will become the fourth largest group and <Col N="557" /> we are not about to be excluded from the group having a voice in one of the most important developments in this State over the last number of years.  We will have a voice on that committee and we ask the Cathaoirleach to ensure that we have representation on the parliamentary tier of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  At the moment other groups are making these decisions so we demand that we be represented on the parliamentary tier of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús ceist a chur ort faoi rud éigin a d'árdaigh an Seanadóir Ó Foighil faoi chóras aistriúcháin. An féidir leat aon scéal a thabhairt dúinn an mbeidh nó nach mbeidh córas aistriúcháin ar fáil sa Teach seo go luath?  Níl sé ann faoi láthair agus tá ganntanas mór ann toisc nach bhfuil sé ann.</P>
      <P>I support what Senator Manning said on the question of the formation of committees but I wish to pick him up on his choice of words.  It should not be the Government who decide on committees of the House of the Oireachtas.  It should be the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The fact that we have turned from being a parliamentary democracy almost into autocracy should not mean that we use the language of the Government.  It should be the House of the Oireachtas who decide these things and it is a regrettable fact that they do not.  May I ask the Leader of the House, as the spokesman of the Government, if he is prepared to condemn the outrageous abuse of his position by a former Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted with interest the decision of the Taoiseach to set up a Dáil committee to examine the functions, powers and funding of local authorities.  It would seem that excludes the Seanad from participation and having <Col N="558" /> an input into this very important matter. Some 43 Members here out of 60 are elected by councils throughout the Twenty-six Counties and we have a very important role to play in advising on reform and bringing forward recommendations in respect of the functions, powers and funding of local authorities. I would like, therefore, to ask the Leader of the House why this was not a joint Oireachtas committee and, secondly, what he has in mind so that we can have an input into this very important matter?</P>

It is a much needed development.  I would also like to ask the Cathaoirleach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Cathaoirleach about the programme to review the Standing Orders of this House.  There was a committee of five Members in the last Seanad chaired by <Col N="559" /> the Leas-Chathaoirleach and we only had got half-way through the Standing Orders.  The reason I raise this matter &mdash; and it is the Cathaoirleach's responsibility &mdash; is that there is a lot of concern about reform of this House but I understand until that committee or some such body is put in place and concludes the review of the Standing Order of this House we cannot have reform.  We were at a point half-way through, as I am sure Senator Manning remembers, and it is the Cathaoirleach's responsibility to see that it is put in place again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very well aware of my responsibility.  It is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. I would be glad to discuss some of the substance of what the Senator is talking about with her personally outside of the Chamber if that would suit her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of questions have been asked.  Senator Manning has asked about setting up the committees and the timetable for these committees. I will have discussions with the Government on this matter this week and I will have a reply for him, if not tomorrow, then on Wednesday of next week.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris asked about Item No. 59.  That notice of motion is an abuse of the privileges of this House.  That matter should be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges because if that motion is allowed on the Order Paper there is nothing to prevent anybody from bringing to the notice of this House meetings which take place any place in this country and we will have a proliferation of notice of motions from <i>ad hoc</i> committees of every description.  I do not feel that it is appropriate that these should appear on the Order Paper.  An <i>ad hoc</i> committee has no standing in this House and I do not think the matter should be raised in the House.  I specifically refer this matter to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Senator that there was only one reason for this being put on the Order Paper.  It will not happen again, if the Committee on Procedure and Privileges do their job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>They never do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Item No. 42, the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the Norris case is being considered with a view to seeing what changes in the law should be made in the light of that judgment.  In this connection Senators will be aware that the Law Reform Committee recently published a consultation paper on child sexual abuse which referred to the Norris judgment and considered what legisaltive changes should be introduced in this area. Any proposals in the Commission's final report on the matter will be borne in mind in consideration of what changes in the law should be made.</P>
      <P>Another question was asked by Senator Norris in connection with an amendment to the Interpretation Act. Consultation is taking place with the Minister on this matter and I do not see any reason why that Bill should not be circulated.  That is a reasonable answer to what has been requested.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello suggested that there is a break in continuity on the Criminal Justice Bill.  The reason we are not taking that Bill today is that it would be more appropriate if we started it in the morning and discuss it all day tomorrow.  It is necessary that Report Stage of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Bill be taken because of the need to have it signed by the President and come into law so that Ireland can sign the Convention on Human Rights on 10 December. It is not very much of a drawback to change from today to tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a question about Estimates. We are not under the rules of the Seanad permitted to make changes in the Estimates or anything like that but last year we brought a limited time motion before the Seanad which allowed a noting of the Estimates.  There is nothing wrong with that.  If the CPP or the Whips tomorrow <Col N="561" /> make arrangments to have a debate on that and it takes the same form as the debate last year, there is no great problem with it.  We can take a full day on it but I do not want that to develop into anything other than a set time debate on the Estimates.  The motion last year was that &ldquo;Seanad Éireann takes note of the 1988 Estimates for the Public Service (abridged version) and the 1988 summary public capital programme.&rdquo;  There was an amendment in but we limited the debate to a certain time.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole referred to the composition of committees and the seting up of the parliamentary tier of the Ango-Irish Agreement.  This is not a matter for me; I will just presume he has got his point across.</P>
    <P>I dtaobh an chóras aistriúcháin atá iarraithe ón Seanadóir Ó Foighil níl fhios agam cá bhfuil sé ach beidh mé ag caint le daoine éigin i dtaobh an chórais sin.</P>
    <P>In regard to the comments of the former Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs, I note the remarks made.  With regard to the televising of the House raised by Senator Mooney, there is a committee which is at an advanced stage of deliberation on this matter.  The results of those deliberations will be coming before the House in the not too distant future.  The Standing Orders Review Committee is a sub-committee which has been sitting and the matter can come before the CPP.  There is a need to have a continuance of that sub-committee on standing Orders.</P>

    <Title>Trustee Savings Banks Bill, 1989: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill provides for a comprehensive updating of the legislation governing the Trustee Savings Banks. The main governing legislation dates back to the year 1863 and, while there have been a number of amending provisions down through the years, the basic rules have remained largely unchanged. This legislation served its purposes well when the Trustee Savings Banks were simply savings institutions but much of it is now outdated and has no place in today's financial environment.  The Trustee Savings Banks are now subject to some archaic regulations which severely restrict their ability to realise their proper potential and to cope as effectively as they should with intense competition.</P>
      <P>The Trustee Savings Banks have a long tradition of service to the community in this country.  The trustee movement was founded in the early years of the last century to encourage thrift and to provide safe repositories for small savings.  From the beginning the emphasis was on tight regulation to protect these savings.  The movement gradually developed a banking service which became identified with the smaller depositor, and only in very recent years the smaller borrower, and which had a special local character.</P>
      <P>As financial activities became more varied and complex and competition increased, many of the local units did not have the capacity to survive on an independent basis and so the process of amalgamation gathered momentum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="564" /> They are now grouped into two banks, the Cork and Limerick Savings Bank and the Trustee Savings Bank Dublin. Between them these two banks have a total of 64 branches throughout the country and both have plans for further extensions of their branch networks.  At the end of the last financial year the total of balances due to depositors was in excess of £760 million and the number of employees was 800.</P>
    <P>The Trustee Savings Banks are a substantial retail banking operation.  Their retail outlets have strong potential for expansion but it is necessary in the first instance to remove existing restrictions on their activities and to allow them to provide a full retail banking service. While they now provide many of the services of a commercial bank including current accounts, loans and foreign exchange, a full service cannot be provided under the existing legislation.</P>
    <P>The range of Trustee Savings Banks activities is legally restricted at present to deposit taking, making of secured loans and such activities as, in the opinion of the Minister for Finance, contribute to thrift.  They are confined to taking deposits from and making loans to individuals only and not companies and this is a very severe handicap as it excludes them from a large area of the business world.  In addition to the restrictions relating to deposits and loans, they cannot invest in new areas of financial activity such as fund management and corporate finance.</P>
    <P>The scale of activities is also influenced by the proportion of depositors' funds which the Minister for Finance allows the Trustee Savings Banks to retain.  Under present arrangements it is required that after allowing for working balances some 80 per cent of depositors' funds must be lodged with the Exchequer and the Trustee Savings Banks are paid a margin over the cost to them of these funds to meet their overheads.  The balance of 20 per cent is available for lending to individuals.  At the end of the last financial year the total amount on deposit with the Exchequer was in excess of £600 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="565" /> The main purpose of this Bill is to facilitate the Trustee Savings Banks in providing a competitive banking service in equal competition with other banking institutions.  We all accept the principle of the level playing field between the different financial institutions and this Bill is a step in this direction.  While they are not big in banking terms, the Trustee Savings Banks have developed a wide retail network over the years and they have a record of reliability and good service which should enable them to grow significantly once they are given the freedom to do so.  This Bill will allow for an extension of their activities and will allow them to respond more flexibly to the requirements of the market.</P>
    <P>The proportion of total funds invested with the Exchequer will be reduced gradually as they extend their business in new directions.  The provision in this Bill transferring the supervision of the Trustee Savings Banks from the Department of Finance to the Central Bank, the appropriate supervisory authority for a banking operation, will facilitate those changes.</P>
    <P>The new directions for the Trustee Savings Banks envisaged in this Bill reflect changes taking place in relation to the savings banks in other European countries.  The savings banks have a great tradition and a great reputation in Europe of service to local communities. There is a general realisation, however, of the need for some fundamental changes and, in particular, there is great emphasis on amalgamation and on change to company status.</P>
    <P>The amalgamation process in the savings bank sector has been most strongly in evidence in France and Denmark. The Savings banks in France now have a completely new structure and during 1985 and 1986 their number dropped by 70 to 395 institutions as a result of mergers.  Savings banks are up-to-date with regard to the level of new technology they are utilising in their day-to-day banking and have, in fact, pioneered innovative areas such as card technology and data banks.  German savings banks <Col N="566" /> have been particularly active in the technical field with increased computerisation and automation to increase co-operation throughout the savings bank organisation.</P>
    <P>Another direction in which European savings banks are heading is towards changing their system of organisation to that of company status.  Denmark has legislation underway which would allow individual savings banks to become joint stock companies.  In the Netherlands two of the large savings banks are about to set up a limited holding company, thus enabling them to raise funds on the capital market directly.  In Britain the Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1985 enacted the framework for restructuring the Trustee Savings Banks and transferring them into private ownership.</P>
    <P>Before I turn to the individual sections of the Bill, there is one issue in particular which I would like to clarify and this is the question of ownership.  The Trustee Savings Banks have been established and run under trusteeships and, because of the voluntary role of the trustees and the community service aspect of the banks' activities, ownership has never been an issue.  The broad assumption has been that they are voluntary bodies providing a community service.  The question of ownership must be considered, however, if the Trustee Savings Banks are to provide a much wider banking service and if there is a likelihood that they may be reconstituted as companies.  The legal advice to me is that the Oireachtas has the power to dispose of the assets of the Trustee Savings Banks or to alter their status as it sees fit.  This power is, of course, subject to the condition that the rights of depositors are fully protected in relation to their deposits and interest thereon under any amending legislation, in accordance with accepted practice.</P>
    <P>I will not go through the sections of the Bill item by item as much of it is self-explanatory and is broadly consolidating and updating the existing legislation.  I propose, therefore, to focus on the more significant items which will affect the status of the Trustee Savings Banks.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="567" /> Part I of the Bill, which brings us up to section 8, deals with standard procedures including the laying of regulations before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I would like to make special mention of sections 5 and 6 at this stage.  Section 5 allows for regulations to remove difficulties in the implementation of the provisions of this Bill when it is enacted.</P>
    <P>This power to make regulations which could modify the terms of the legislation was criticised in the Dáil on the grounds that it assigns to the Minister an authority which properly belongs to the Oireachtas.  First of all, let me make it quite clear that there is nothing novel in this approach.  There are several precedents, the most recent being the building societies legislation and the sole purpose is to facilitate unforeseen adjustments of a technical nature without the need for further legislation.  Any regulations that might be introduced under the terms of this section could only be of a minor nature and would be introduced simply to facilitate the implementation of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The existing Trustee Savings Bank legislation is complex and is in many respects seriously outdated in today's environment and the present Bill is the first major reform of that legislation in this State.  There is, therefore, a strong possibility of unforeseen technical difficulties arising in giving effect to the terms of the present Bill and this provision is to enable the Minister to deal with them.  This power can effectively be exercised only within the context and intentions of the present Bill.  There is no question of the possibility of the thrust of the legislation, or of any of its provisions, being undermined by the use of this section. Despite the apparent breadth of its drafting, my advice is that it can only be exercised in a very limited way.  I would draw your attention to the time limit of three years on this section, and to the fact that, as provided in section 4 of this Bill, any regulation made under this section would be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas who would have the <Col N="568" /> power to annual the regulation within 21 days if they so wished.</P>
    <P>Section 6 empowers the Minister to modify provisions of this Bill by regulation to take account of relevant changes in company, banking and building society legislation.  This provision is necessary because many of the provisions contained in the Bill have originated in company, banking or building society legislation and Trustee Savings Bank legislation will almost inevitably require amendment should any further changes be made in these areas.  Instead of having to return to the House to amend the present legislation, this provision allows the Minister to make such amendments by regulation. This in no way undermines the authority of the Oireachtas as it will only apply to legislation which has already been adopted by both Houses.  It will not involve making any new legislation. These regulations will also be subject to section 4 where they will be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas which have the power to annul any regulation within 21 days after it has been placed before them.  There is a similar provision in the current building societies legislation as many of its provisions have drawn on company and banking legislation.</P>
    <P>Part II deals with the establishment and licensing of Trustee Savings Banks. While the establishment of new Trustee Savings Banks is highly unlikely in view of recent trends in the financial sector, we cannot rule out this possibility in the longer term.</P>
    <P>The requirements for establishment are specified in section 9.  The fundamental condition here is the supervisory role of the trustees.  This section also removes the outdated restrictions on the activities of the Trustee Savings Banks.  In effect, they will now be empowered to carry on, in addition to their existing activities, any other financial service which the Central Bank considers prudent.  This should open the way for them to provide a truly modern banking service and encourage them to exploit other market opportunities.  The safeguard here for the Trustee Savings <Col N="569" /> Banks, and the banking and financial sector generally, is the requirement for Central Bank approval.  Provision is also made in the section to enable the Trustee Savings Banks to carry on business outside the State.  In modern banking, with the increasing emphasis on freedom of capital movements and globalisation of services, it makes no sense to prohibit an institution from doing business outside the State and the provision in this legislation will ensure that this does not arise.</P>
    <P>Another key change is contained in section 10.  Up to now the Trustee Savings Banks have been supervised by the Department of Finance.  This is unsatisfactory because the Department are not the best equipped agency for this purpose; the appropriate supervisory authority for all banking operations is the Central Bank and the Trustee Savings Banks should be no exceptions.  Accordingly, the supervisory function is now being transferred to the bank.  This will be a much more satisfactory situation where a range of financial institutions, including banks and building societies, will come under the one supervisory authority. It will facilitate a consistent approach to supervision and is vital at a time when competition in this sector is increasing.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the trustees themselves.  The most significant point here is in sections 17 and 18 which both limit the numbers of trustees and impose an age limit.  A maximum of ten trustees and an age limit of 70 years are proposed.  Because of amalgamations over the years there has been a tendency to add to the numbers of trustees to the point where numbers were excessive and a maximum of ten is considered reasonable. I would like to avail of this opportunity to acknowledge the contribution made by trustees over so many years in promoting the Trustee Savings Banks as a community service.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with supervision. Most of the sections in this part are based on the Central Bank Acts of 1971 and 1989.  Perhaps the most significant provision under this heading is <Col N="570" /> the power of the Central Bank to intervenue and protect the depositors where it has reason to conclude that a Trustee Savings Bank will not fulfil its obligations.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill deals with the management and administration of the Trustee Savings Banks and draws heavily on the current building societies and Central Bank Acts.  It provides for the keeping of proper accounts and for the development of superannuation schemes subject to the approval of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill is concerned with the amalgamation of the Trustee Savings Banks and the procedures to be followed. In earlier years the local Trustee Savings Banks were generally independent units but mergers became inevitable as greater efficiency of operation and greater economies of scale were required.  The new provisions relax the existing requirements for amalgamation.  Previously amalgamation took place by special resolution passed by three-fourths of the trustees which is too high a proportion. This is now being changed to three-fifths.</P>
    <P>There are no proposals at this time to amalgamate the Cork and Limerick Savings Bank and the Trustee Savings Bank, Dublin.  While they share some facilities and maintain close contacts, they are entirely separate and independent organisations.  The pressures for amalgamation into one unit may well increase as competition intensifies and there are some obvious advantages in a pooling of resources.  The two banks have discussed previously the potential for amalgamation and I would expect that they will look at this again in the light of their position following the enactment of this legislation.  Amalgamation will require the prior approval of the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank.  I would certainly not stand in the way of amalgamation if both banks were satisfied that this was in their best interests.</P>
    <P>The most significant feature of part VII of the Bill is section 57 which provides for the reorganisation of the Trustee Savings Banks into companies.  There are no plans at present for any such reorganisation and the intention is to continue with the trusteeship arrangement.  As the <Col N="571" /> Trustee Savings Banks extend their activities, however, it may be necessary to introduce a company structure to allow them greater flexibility in trading and in raising capital and to open the way for more direct links with other financial organisations.  However, in an increasingly competitive environment, we must recognise the possibility that the Trustee Savings Banks may find it necessary to become associated with larger financial groupings and some level of joint venture or even close relationship may be desirable in due course.  In this kind of situation it would in all probability be necessary in the first instance to change the trustee status.</P>
    <P>Section 57 empowers the Minister for Finance to do this by ministerial order. There was some criticism of this procedure when the Bill was being debated in Dáil Éireann, on the argument that it was conferring undue authority on the Minister.  The reality is quite different; this order will have to be approved by the Oireachtas before it can take effect. In the event, therefore, of proposals for a fundamental change in the structure of the Trustee Savings Banks at a future date, the Oireachtas will have the opportunity in advance to debate this change and the reasons for it.</P>
    <P>Let me emphasise that in providing for company status two distinct options are provided for.  Conversion can be to a company controlled by the Minister or, where this is not the case, there are adequate provisions for the financial interest of the State to be safeguarded. The decision as to whether the Minister for Finance should retain this control would be taken at a later date and would be subject to prior Oireachtas approval. Contrary to the impression given by some people who spoke on this Bill in Dáil Éireann, the Bill does not determine that the Trustee Savings Banks shall be in private ownership.  It provides that for now they will continue as trusteeships and they may convert to company status at a later date under either of the options provided for and only with the prior approval of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="572" /> The present legislation served its purposes well as long as the Trustee Savings Banks simply fulfilled the role of local savings institutions.  In order to survive and prosper in the modern environment, they must have a much wider brief.  By comparison with the major banking institutions operating in this country the Trustee Savings Banks are small.  As the internal market of the European Community evolves and free movement of capital becomes the norm, there will be increasing competition for market share and the Trustee Savings Banks must have the necessary freedom and flexibility to compete effectively.</P>
    <P>The Trustee Savings Banks have a great tradition.  Even with the limiting conditions imposed on them, they have made great progress in modernising their activities and extending their range of services to the community.  The present legislation opens up new possibilities for them.  They will now extend their range of services and become banking institutions in the full sense of the term while maintaining their distinctive characteristic of special service for the smaller depositor.  They will now be in a position to provide a wide range of services and to expand their facilities in the confidence that they can be fully competitive.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before us purports to update the legislation governing the operation of the Trustee Savings Banks. On face value, there are very few in this House who could really argue against that.  However, under closer examination there are certain aspects of the Bill and certain authority vested in the Minister that bear very close scrutiny and very strict examination by the House.</P>
      <P>As has been said, the Trustee Savings Banks are voluntary bodies providing a community service.  At present their activities are confined to anything the Minister for Finance might consider contributes to thrift.  I borrow that expression from his Dáil contribution, if I am correct. Anything that contributes to thrift is within the ambit of the Trustee Savings Banks at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="573" /> We have had the figures given to us again today by the Minister and, indeed, we have heard them in the Dáil as well: £760 million depositors' money on deposit, 800 employees.  We need only look to the basic legislation of 1863 to realise, notwithstanding a few amendments and a few additions along the way to that basic legislation, how outdated the situation is for Trustee Savings Banks.</P>
    <P>As saving institutions they were developed as safe havens for the small savers.  They have continued the development over the years into a banking service, perhaps for the smaller saver as well.  This has been welcomed all around. We have seen the amalgamation over the years, from the many and multifarious small units into the larger units, and now we are faced with two savings banks, the Cork and Limerick Savings Bank and the Trustee Savings Bank in Dublin.  They have, as the Minister pointed out, a large branch network, a large retail network. However, they have been confined to taking deposits from and making loans to individuals, not to companies.  Nor can they get involved at the moment in any new areas such as fund management and new financial activities of different kinds.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, the Trustee Savings Banks face comprehensive revision of their activities.  The Trustee Savings Banks activities referred to in this Bill also relate to the proportion of the depositors' funds they are allowed to retain by the Minister for Finance.  At present it is 80 per cent which must be lodged with the Exchequer.  This amounts to over £600 million in the year.  This Bill will allow Trustee Savings Banks to compete on equal terms with other financial institutions, particularly competing abroad, which would appear to be the flavour of the month when anybody is discussing financial institutions.  Quite seriously, it appears to be a great way forward for all the financial institutions in this country in terms of the Europe of post-1992.  It will be necessary to have a gradual and phased reduction of the funds the Trustee Savings Banks have invested with the Exchequer as well as transferring them to the Central Bank <Col N="574" /> from the Minister for Finance's supervision.</P>
    <P>I would like further details from the Minister as to how this operation will be carried out.  When you consider 80 per cent of the funds in the last financial year, over £600 million, were invested with the Exchequer put against EBR if I read the situation correctly, over what length of time will this be phased from the 80 per cent that is now with the Exchequer to what we are now proposing?  I can see quite difficult hiccups if the matter is not phased smoothly.  I have not read anywhere in either the Official Report or in the Minister's two speeches both here today and in the Dáil how he intends this to be carried out.</P>
    <P>There have been many comparisons made in relation to the operation of savings banks in other European countries.  The Minister dwelt on different countries here today.  Similar legislation passed through the French and the Danish parliaments.  The Minister referred to Germany and, indeed, in 1986 there was this type of legislation in the UK parliament.  All of the changes generally relate to structural and operational changes in savings banks.  Particularly they concern themselves with amalgamation, technical innovation and the possibility and reality of changing to company status.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the ownership of the Trustee Savings Banks here and, in the Dáil.  This caused quite a lot of vexation among many of the contributors in the Dáil.  It is not an area that I personally get over-excited about, nor do I feel threatened necessarily by privatisation, even though I accept what the Minister said today, that really we are not considering privatisation at this point. That may be further down the road but it is not what is before us in the Bill today. However, when the matter arose in the UK parliament I understand they took advice there as to who actually owned the Trustee Savings Banks and on the savings banks situation in the United Kingdom and that they were satisfied in the end that their Government had the <Col N="575" /> right to proceed as they did.  We apparently have taken the same advice, or are using perhaps a precedent for very similar legislation.  Perhaps the Minister could develop for this House the source of his advice in relation to the whole ownership issue of the Trustee Savings Banks and how he is so confident &mdash; and I hope he is right in his confidence &mdash; that we are entitled to do what we are doing here today.</P>
    <P>I would like to place on record my thanks to the trustees and to the Trustee Savings Banks generally for the role they have played over the past century or so for the small depositor in our country. They have, perhaps, been underrated. Perhaps, because of the restrictions placed on them they have not been as obvious in the commercial market, nor has their PR been as vigorous or as aggressive as other financial institutions. We should expect changes in this area in the future if and when this legislation is passed.</P>
    <P>A point that may be missed, and I hope will not be changed with the changing complexion of the Trustee Savings Banks, is that their opening hours are far more sociable than the present hours of the banks.  They open through lunch hour and later every evening.  I realise there are delicate negotiations going on in this area and I hope it will be only a matter of time before all banking institutions will provide what I would like to call sociable hours for their clients, for their depositors, for their customers, whatever title you would like to put on them.</P>
    <P>There is one very worrying aspect about this legislation.  That would appear to be the fact that the Bill has been advanced before all the details in relation to it have been worked out between the Central Bank and the Department of Finance. I have been advised by, and have spoken to parliamentary colleagues each of whom has been Minister for Finance in recent years Deputy Noonan and Deputy Dukes.  As late as February 1987 when the legislation had been held up for quite some time there were four very important outstanding issues.  Only one of those <Col N="576" /> four issues &mdash; and I will detail them in a minute &mdash; appears to be addressed by this Bill.  So, I can assume &mdash; and perhaps the Minister could confirm whether I am right in this assumption &mdash; that only one of the four problems has been resolved and the rest have been left in another arena slightly removed from the Houses of the Oireachtas, to be dealt with either by order or by ministerial regulation, or by some area other than by directly bringing the details before this House. The details were not presented to the Dáil, so I hardly expect we will have the benefit of the details we will need.</P>
    <P>The four areas that have been causing problems are as follows: (1) the accountability of the trustees of the Trustee Savings Banks to the Central Bank and to the Minister for Finance generally; (2) the determination of interest rates paid and charged by the Trustee Savings Banks to their customers; (3) interest rates and management expenses on funds placed by them with the Minister, and (4) the related question of investment of the Trustee Savings Banks' funds.</P>
    <P>After a lot of deliberation and months and months of discussion, negotiation and advice, these matters were outstanding as of February 1987.  I know time has moved on since then; we have had two Governments since that time, but only one &mdash; the first of these issues, namely, the accountability of the trustees of the Trustee Savings Banks to the Central Bank and the Minister for Finance &mdash; has been resolved.  I would appreciate if the Minister could dwell in some detail in relation to the four points which held up this type of legislation for some years when perhaps we could have been debating it before now.  When only one of the four issues has been resolved that previous Ministers felt prevented the legislation from being presented to both Houses, how does the Minister think we are in a position to debate thoroughly and with a full understanding what is before us here today?  I am afraid the groundwork was not completed.  Only one of the four issues has been dealt with.  I await with interest the Minister's <Col N="577" /> response to that point because it underlines perhaps my main problem with Second Stage.</P>
    <P>As I say, I support the overall intention of the Bill but I have enormous difficulties with aspects that relate to the fact that three of the four difficulties that presented themselves over the years still remain outstanding.  We do not know, for example, what the conditions of the licences will be, the true extent of the scope of this Bill, or how the interest rates will be determined.  I would have thought those three issues were fairly basic to what we are discussing here today.</P>
    <P>There is another point to which I would like the Minister to respond; again, it may be a matter of some misunderstanding, but certainly views differ as to the present situation.  At present I understood that the Trustee Savings Bank deposits were underwritten by the Government.  This goes back to a few years ago when Deputy Alan Dukes was Minister for Finance and there was a scare abroad in relation to a certain savings bank and depositors panicked. There was the whole scenario of a possible snowball effect, of deposits being withdrawn and the undermining of the bank.  Deputy Dukes, as Minister, went on radio at the time guaranteeing that the Government would underwrite all the deposits of the small depositors with the savings bank and that there was no need to fear.  I would like the Minister to respond to what the position is in relation to that whole issue at present and what the position will be if and when this legislation is enacted.  I will be tabling a series of amendments for Committee Stage and will go into the points in more detail at that time.</P>
    <P>The first section that causes me difficulty &mdash; I am sure it may cause some other Members of this House difficulty and I feel the Minister tried to pre-empt much debate in this area &mdash; is section 5. The Minister referred to it specifically today.  Notwithstanding the assurances the Minister tried to give us, I am afraid the interpretation would appear to be that the Minister is effectively wanting <Col N="578" /><i>carte blanche</i> in relation to what may or may not happen over the next three years if difficulties, should arise of any technical nature in implementing different sections of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would have thought, given the amount of debate and discussion between the Central Bank and the Department of Finance, the number of years it has taken to bring this Bill before the House, that any difficulties could be pre-empted and that they could be nailed down in detail in the different sections of this Bill.  Perhaps the Minister might, by example, indicate to this House where he thinks such problems may arise.  He cannot, of course, give us specific examples of technical difficulties because if he could he would have put the resolution to the problem in the Bill rather than request <i>carte blanche</i> to resolve the problems himself. &ldquo;Unforeseen technical difficulties&rdquo; are the Minister's own words.  I find that scope far too wide for any Minister to come before this House and request.  I know there was great unease in the Dáil in relation to this matter as well.  Because of the Minister's request in this area, notwithstanding precedent which he pointed to today, he could perhaps detail for us to a far greater extent why he feels it is necessary for him to take this power to himself.</P>
    <P>Section 6 will allow the application by regulation of relevant changes in company and banking and building society law to the Trustee Savings Banks as many of the provisions of this Bill will have been drawn on existing and proposed legislation in these areas.  Again, we are talking about laying regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is a vital area and difficult as it is to cede to the Minister his request in relation to allowing him the powers to decide this, that and the other, the Minister, at least should consider an affirmative order in relation to this section rather than just a regulation laid before the Houses.  I know we can annul the regulations within 21 days, if we ever get around to doing it and if Standing Orders allow us to do so but, quite frankly, it should be put in a positive way.  Will the Minister please <Col N="579" /> consider an affirmative order rather than just regulation?  At least that will guarantee debate and it certainly would put to rest many of the queries that are in my mind at the moment in relation to the <i>carte blanche</i> the Minister is requesting. I hope he will be able to concede to this House what I feel is a very reasonable request.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister consider affirmative orders both on section 5 and section 6?  He allows that procedure later in the Bill and I am requesting that he extends that to ensure there is a full democratic debate on matters he feels might be essential.  We would probably agree with the Minister but we would like to be able to contribute and to listen to his views as they arise and, hopefully, support what he intends doing as the different issues arise.</P>
    <P>Section 9 removes the limits on the present activities of the Trustee Savings Banks and puts them on a more commercial footing, which is essentially what this Bill is about.  We can have no argument with the principle of that.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with the procedures for the granting of licences by the Central Bank to the Trustee Savings Banks. Again, we have no details as to what the conditions in relation to these licences may be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>They are all different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could expand again because we do need a detailed discussion here.  Perhaps some of the conditions attached to the licences would be totally unacceptable to the Houses of the Oireachtas, bearing in mind the very special nature of the Trustee Savings Banks and the very special job they have had to do over the years and, we hope, will be able to continue to do as well as expand.  Could we have some indication as to what range of conditions may or may not be attached to these licences, what they will even concern themselves with, how restricting <Col N="580" /> or limiting these licneces may be or if they are restricting or limiting in any way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;authority in these areas for some time.  I know that finally the details in any individual licence will be the responsibility of the Central Bank. Because the Minister is asking us to support him in transferring a function from him to the Central Bank, a function which has been a matter for a Minister in these Houses, I certainly would be concerned that I would know little more about what we would be giving up and what we would be ceding to the Central Bank.  The whole principle of introducing licences for the first time to the Trustee Savings Banks needs to be developed more.  We need to be told what exactly will be considered in relation to conditions on these licences and how restricting, if at all, these licences may be.</P>
      <P>Once I know exactly what the conditions will be and the terms under which the Central Bank will be taking over the regulatory role of the Trustee Savings Banks, I have no difficulty with the concept that all banks, all financial institutions, are under the same supervisory authority.  But before we relinquish our present position, which is vested in the Minister at the moment in relation to Trustee Savings Banks, I would ask him to be more forthcoming with us.  I would ask the Minister to indicate to us exactly what the position will be in relation to these licences and the range of conditions that may or may not be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 12 allows the Central Bank to attach to the issue of licences &ldquo;such conditions&rdquo;&mdash; this is the point I am making; this is the sort of vague reference in the Bill to what we are ceding now to the Central Bank.  As this is central to <Col N="581" /> the future operations and the future success of the Trustee Savings Banks competing freely with other financial institutions, we should have some indication as to what these conditions may or may not be.  We should be entitled to examine those conditions and then, hopefully, satisfied by what the Minister will tell us, support him in relation to what he is proposing to do in this section.</P>
    <P>Just to mention in passing, as the Minister did, sections 17 and 18, the reduction in the numbers for some in relation to the number of trustees &mdash; not fewer than five, no more than ten &mdash; and there is a 70 year age limit.  Will there be provision for that being extended under any circumstances? Perhaps the Minister could indicate that to us.  Indeed, at present in the Garda Síochána legislation and various other pieces of legislation we have age limits and retirement ages included, but there are ways and means by which these can under certain circumstances be extended.  The Minister might indicate that to us.  Does it mean that all those trustees at the moment who are over 70 years of age are <i>de facto</i> gone once this Bill passes through &mdash; and I presume at this stage we are assuming it passes through, given the numbers game in this House?  Are we to assume that all those over 70 years of age are, as a result of this Bill, deemed ineligible to continue holding office?  Is there any phasing-in of this requirement for the older members, who have given years and years of voluntary community service as trustees in their local savings banks?  I would ask the Minister to dwell on that for a moment. Perhaps the Minister could give us some figures as to how many will be affected? Apart from the age clause that will affect some, there is the whole position as to the existing numbers in the two main Trustee Savings Banks here.</P>
    <P>Section 32 provides that trustees shall pay into a special account, in the name of the Minister for Finance, or invest in the purchase of Government securities such proportion of the deposits as may be determined by the Central Bank after consulting with the Minister.  This comes back to the general point I made earlier, <Col N="582" /> that I would ask the Minister to develop in more detail how the transition from the 80 per cent investment in the Exchequer now to what down the road, I assume, will be more autonomy for the Trustee Savings Banks to do as they will with their own deposits, how that transition will come about?  Is it section 32 I should be looking for?  Perhaps the Minister would develop that in relation to the points I made.</P>
    <P>In relation to the amalgamation of the Trustee Savings Banks, which is a realistic possibility &mdash; I am not sure that that view is widely held at the moment &mdash; when one looks at the financial institutions and the whole stage post-1992 and the increased competitiveness, the need for economies of scale and the pooling of resources, it is more than likely that the two savings banks in this country will have to consider that as a realistic option. As the Minister pointed out, they have had discussions in the past which did not come to fruition, but perhaps this legislation will act as a catalyst and allow them to consider pooling their resources. Neither are particularly large in the overall scale of financial institutions at the moment, but I think my information is correct in saying that, if the resources were pooled and the capital available to them was pooled, they would be a considerable force, certainly on the Irish stage and hopefully they could develop to become an equally important force on the European stage.  Of course, we are not just talking about amalgamation within the country; there can be amalgamation between savings banks across European borders, which is an interesting scenario in this area.  Again, this will have to be looked at in great detail.  I agree with the relaxation of the requirements in this area from three-quarters to three-fifths of trustees by special resolution. Three-quarters would be considered too restrictive overall in the democratic procedures today.</P>
    <P>Section 58 gives authority to the Minister for Finance to reorganise the Trustee Savings Banks into companies and to arrange for the transfer of all assets and liabilities to the new companies.  The <Col N="583" /> Minister may make a draft order, etc., and it shall not have effect until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas. To me that is an affirmative order, if I interpret the parliamentary draftsman's language correctly.  I approve of that method as a procedure.  I am asking the Minister to apply the procedure of affirmative order to the two previous sections, sections 5 and 6, where you are talking about regulations and laying orders before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In view of the importance of what we are doing today, would the Minister consider approving an affirmative order for sections 5 and 6 as well as section 58, which I think is very well placed?</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I support the basic concept of what the Bill is intended to establish. I have serious misgivings about giving the Minister, or any Minister, the scope to make decisions on areas and issues that should be detailed and covered in this Bill.  This should be the case if the proper groundwork had been done, if all outstanding matters in terms of differences of opinion between the Central Bank and the Department of Finance had been resolved, rather than just one of the four matters I have previously detailed. For the Minister to demand the scope that he has today, and as he did previously in the Dáil, might be acceptable in a dictatorship but, quite frankly, in a democracy, without giving us the necessary details and the full explanations as to why the groundwork has not been done, I do not believe that what the Minister is demanding of us is acceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to welcome the Minister, Deputy Reynolds, to the House.  When he was Minister for Industry and Commerce a noticeable feature of his work was that he was forever bringing forward Bills which had been left behind by other Ministers and by other Governments.  In particular, the Insurance Bill and the Companies Bill were brought forward by him when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash; both Bills had been talked about <Col N="584" /> for many years but were finally brought forward by him.  Similarly, as Minister for Finance he brought forward the Central Bank Bill early in the year and indeed there were other pieces of legislation also.  He is renowned for introducing legislation; he is a man for action. Despite what Senator Doyle said, this is a Bill that has been around for ten years. Yet, it is this Minister, Deputy Reynolds, who has come forward with it.</P>
      <P>As we all know, this is an important Bill.  It provides for a very comprehensive revision of the legislation governing the status and the operations of the Trustee Savings Banks.  As previous speakers mentioned, this legislation goes back to 1863 and there have been some amending provisions during the years.  The essential requirements of that Bill have largely remained unchanged.  As other Senators and the Minister have indicated, this legislation served its purposes well when the Trustee Savings Banks were simply saving institutions.  However, in modern conditions, and particularly with the advances in banking in more recent times, the legislation is no longer adequate and certainly in my opinion it very seriously restricts the ability of the Trustee Savings Banks to realise their proper potential and to compete as effectively as they should.</P>
      <P>The Trustee Savings Banks have provided a most useful service for the community. The movement, which was founded in the early years of the last century, was established to provide a safe depository for the small saver and for small savings.  It developed a banking service which has become identified with the smaller depositor and the smaller borrower and which has in many cases almost a parochial or certainly a very local character.  The fact that they dealt with the very personal sector of banking was in itself a restriction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other restriction, of course, is the fact that 80 per cent of all moneys they hold on deposit could not be recycled or reloaned for the normal activities of the bank &mdash; things like mortgage finance, bridging finance, personal loans.  Only 20 per cent of deposits they took in could be <Col N="585" /> used for that purpose.  If you compare that with the other commercial banks, they can use, as I understand it, 65 per cent of all their deposits for this purpose. Clearly, that is unfair in so far as the Trustee Savings Banks are concerned.</P>
    <P>What the Trustee Savings Banks have been looking for for years, what they want and what they are now getting, is the same pitch with the same rules to allow them to develop in the future.  The Minister has referred to future developments and to a further branch network. I know there is a site earmarked for the Minister's home town, Longford, and I welcome them there.  I would suggest that when this legislation is through they might consider a branch in Boston, where I think they would do well from the Irish emigrants.  It could be very profitable and successful.</P>
    <P>Despite what has been said by the previous speaker about restrictions, they have been doing extremely well.  The total of balances due to depositors at the end of last year was in excess of £760 million and they have in the region of 800 employees.  They are a substantial retail banking operation.  There is room for a great deal of expansion, but it is necessary in the first instance to remove the existing restrictions on their activities and to give them scope to provide a full retail banking service.  Many of the services they provide include current accounts, foreign exchange, but a full service cannot be provided under the existing legislation. The range of their activities is legally confined at present to deposit taking, making of secured loans and such activities as, in the opinion of the Minister for Finance, contribute to thrift.  As things now stand, they are confined to taking deposits from and making loans to individuals only, not to companies.  In the modern world of finance this has to be seen as a very severe handicap; it does not allow them to respond at all adequately to the business opportunities that are there for the taking.</P>
    <P>In addition to the restrictions relating to deposits and loans, they cannot invest in new areas, such as other financial activities, fund management, corporate <Col N="586" /> finance and so on.  They are dealing effectively and well with the smaller things like current accounts, deposit accounts, bridging finance &mdash; very basic banking activities.  I understand that in the area of ATMs they slot into third place overall after the Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks in terms of volume and, therefore, they are ahead of the Ulster Bank and the National Irish Bank. That in itself is an excellent achievement, but they cannot invest in the new areas where they might like to for the future, new areas perhaps of leasing, stockbroking, insurance, perhaps a smaller or a newer lifetime, or would it be a trustee-time? If they do, I hope they will consider agencies to the insurance brokers.  I think that would be very welcome.</P>
    <P>I have a great deal of admiration for the Trustee Savings Banks.  I see them operating in my own town of Athlone and they certainly work very well.  Over the years they have recognised and accepted the real needs of their customers by staying open at lunch time and that service is invaluable to workers. They have also provided late-night openings where you have supermarkets.  I understand that is not done on a national scale but it is done in areas where it is appropriate and that, too, is welcome. Generally it can be said that they have been the innovators of the lunch-time and the late opening principle, which I have no doubt will be the practice of all banks and all financial institutions long before 1992 and after.</P>
    <P>Banking is different today.  It is no longer a luxury, it is now regarded as a very essential service.  It has to be used by people in many cases on a day-to-day basis and in some cases on an hour-to-hour basis.  Most workers have their salaries paid by way of bank transfers.  This is certainly something that is very welcome, even if it is for security reasons alone.  That, too, puts greater demands on banks to meet the needs of those who go to work each day, and the banks are responding to that demand.  Generally the whole innovative movement by the Trustee Savings Banks in the area of late openings is something that will be <Col N="587" /> developed and worked on in the future by all of the banks.</P>
    <P>The question of privatisation has been raised.  Obviously, none of us has a crystal ball: we cannot see into the future.  We cannot ignore the fact that we are in a fast-changing world so far as financial services are concerned and in the case of the Trustee Savings Banks it seems to me that the first movement would be a merger or some arrangement in this direction of the Cork and Limerick Savings Banks and the Trustee Savings Bank, Dublin.  The Minister referred to that in his speech.  He made the point that there are no proposals at this time to amalgamate the Cork and Limerick Savings Banks and the Trustee Savings Bank, Dublin.  He went on to say that the pressure for amalgamation into one unit may well increase as competition intensifies and there are some obvious advantages in pooling of resources.  He further stated that, if amalgamation does come about, it will require the prior approval of the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank and that he would not stand in the way of amalgamation if both banks were satisfied that this was in their best interest.  This is the proper approach.  If it happens, it will be nothing new.  Mergers, take-overs, amalgamations are a regular feature and have been of business life in this country and, in particular, of the financial services industry.</P>
    <P>In recent times we have seen many takeovers or amalgamations, mergers, call them what you like.  Some years ago the one I had a particular interest in was the Irish Civil Service Building Society, as it was then known, which was taken over by the Bank of Ireland.  Some people knew that, before the Bank of Ireland made their offer of £25 a share, there were two other groupings interested in taking over the Irish Civil Service Building Society; and they were then, as we all know, the only building society publicly quoted on the Irish Stock Exchange.</P>
    <P>The ICS, as they are now known as, are trading away under the wing of the Bank of Ireland and benefiting from the <Col N="588" /> legislation that we had earlier in the year, the Building Societies Bill, which was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas. Recently, we have had the takeover, again in the building society area, of the Irish Mutual Building Society by the Irish Nationwide Building Society.  In the insurance world we had the Guardian Royal Exchange taking over New PMPA earlier in the year.  The list is pretty endless. Only in the last week AIB announced that they are to acquire a stake of 80 per cent in the stockbrokers, Goodbody James Capel, with the option to take full control at a later date.</P>
    <P>In the business world we had the famous battle in Westmeath for the take-over of the Westmeath Co-op by the Goodman Group.  We had the Premier Tír Laighean take-over by Waterford Express Dairies.  So, it is an ongoing, changing world.</P>
    <P>There has been much debate on the question of ownership.  Again, not having a crystal ball, nor the Minister having a crystal ball, it is not possible to say what will happen.  The preference seems to be that the Trustee Savings Banks will be taken into public ownership.  The first priority for all of us here is to ensure the survival of the Trustee Savings Banks in today's highly competitive market place. The question of ownership arises only when there is a proposal to change the trustee status and there is no such proposal at this point.</P>
    <P>The immediate priority is to encourage and enable the Trustee Savings Banks to provide a wider range of services to a wider public.  None of us can say what directions the Trustee Savings Banks may take in the longer term, but the concern of all of us should be that they should grow and prosper.  This Bill is facilitating that.  It is to be noted that, whatever direction may be taken by the Trustee Savings Banks in the future, the Minister for Finance of the day will have the power and the responsibility to protect the public interest.  That is very important.</P>
    <P>What the Trustee Savings Banks want is a level playing field.  We are endeavouring in this Bill to facilitate them in providing a competitive banking service <Col N="589" /> in equal competition with other banking institutions.  Over the years they have developed a track record of reliability and good service, which I believe will allow them to grow significantly once they are given the freedom to do so.  This Bill will allow for an extension of their activities and will allow them to respond more flexibly to the requirements of a market.  The transfer of the supervision of the Trustee Savings Banks from the Department of Finance to the Central Bank will also be important.  The Central Bank are the appropriate proper supervisory authority for a banking operation and this will further facilitate the changes referred to in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that the whole financial sector has been going through a period of dramatic change for many years.  New and improved technology, the implementation of EC directives, are having a big impact on how we must conduct our business now and in the future.  I referred earlier to the Building Societies Bill and to the Central Bank Bill.  We cannot forget the ACC (Amendment) Bill, which gave the ACC extra flexibility, extra status and, indeed, gave additional powers to the ACC.  This Bill is doing something similar for the Trustee Savings Banks.  In a changing and challenging world of finance, I feel that the Trustee Savings Banks will prosper as a result of this Bill and I wish them every success in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say at the outset that I certainly welcome the general thrust of this legislation as being fairly positive and, indeed, quite acceptable from the point of view of status.  The thrust of the Bill is to allow the Trustee Savings Banks to compete in the market place.  One of the issues about State and semi-State involvement in companies which has bothered me more than anything else since coming into public life has been the constant haranguing and criticism of semi-State industry at times when they just were not in a position to compete because of the <i>minutiae</i> of legislation.  Fot that reason I am particularly happy that this legislation will <Col N="590" /> improve the condition of the semi-State sector and allow it to compete in the market place with other similar industry.</P>
      <P>It raises issues for me, however, that I would like to have clarified.  The central confusion I find in the Bill is the particular relationship that this legislation will have with the proposed Companies Bill.  There are aspects of those two pieces of legislation which, if not in conflict, are so closely interwoven as to invite some explanation from the Minister.</P>
      <P>I would also like to raise some fairly general points about the Trustee Savings Bank.  It is, of course, part of Irish life. It is the High Street bank of the people. It must be allowed compete; it must be given its head.  The accounts of the Trustee Savings Banks are normally published in the last week in November and there is always a little bit of a schemozzle if they are a bit late being published or a bit late arriving.  I recall, one famous November some years ago, meeting the manager of a building society which is on the corner of the street which also has the head office of the Trustee Savings Bank in Dublin area.  I know him quite well.</P>
      <P>He told me they never had such a day. He said they were coming with wheelbarrows up Abbey Street from the Trustee Savings Bank, withdrawing from the one bank and lodging with him.  He said it was a record day for his building society, that they never had seen the like of it before, that they never know that level of money existed in such liquid proportions. It was all because of a lack of trust in the bank because of some foul rumour that circulated and which had no basis in fact.  It brings home to us and is a very clear indication of the way people worry about their money and the way people need to have trust and confidence in the institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I like about this legislation as a generality is that it brings the legislation which governs the workings of the Trustee Savings Banks more into line with the operation of normal commercial banks and for that reason it will occasion fewer questions about the type of bank that is the Trustee Savings Banks.  Indeed <Col N="591" /> it will allow them to merge more into the general banking and financial scheme. That is important if it is to be a success.</P>
    <P>I would also like to ask the Minister what have the Trustee Savings Banks been worth to the State. What do we get out of them on an annual basis?  I have a very fundamental reason for asking that question.  Reference has been by earlier speakers to the question of nationalisation and to the position of Irish Life on many occasions.  Irish Life is the most successful company of its type on this island, and perhaps even on these islands. The State holds a 51 per cent share-holding in Irish Life.  I am delighted with that and I will fight to preserve that type of arrangement but I have one question: If we own 51 per cent why do we not get 51 per cent of the distributed profits?  In other words, Irish Life is a classic example of a nationalised industry which operates in a way which I, as a supporter of nationalisation, do not accept because it makes it too easy to sell it off on the basis of what it is worth.</P>
    <P>What is likely to happen is that within the next 18 months the Government will bring in a proposal to allow Irish Life to be sold off to private industry.  It will be bought by people who will pay us, let us say, £250 million.  It will look good in the books and it will seem like a very attractive proposition but the fact is the people who buy it will insist on getting their profits on a year-by-year basis, to which they are entitled, and we will have lost the argument.  I would say in those situations, let the State take its profit now on a year-by-year basis.  What is it worth to us to have a State involvement in the Trustee Savings Banks?  Let us make it worthwhile for the State and for the taxpayer. I know that goes contrary to the thinking of the trustee arrangements etc., but I raise it.</P>
    <P>I want to have confirmed to me that the same liquidity ratio which applies to normal commercial banks in terms of the relationship between deposits, overdrafts, loans etc., will in future be the same for the Trustee Savings Banks as <Col N="592" /> it is at the moment for the commercial banks.  What I am asking is that the Central Bank should ensure that precisely the same conditions and no more are placed on the Trustee Savings Banks as are at present placed on the commercial banks.</P>
    <P>The difference between the banks is a theme which I have to come back to every time because the Trustee Savings Banks are seen as different.  I do not know if the Minister ever had the experience of trying to transfer money from one of the main banking groups to the Trustee Savings Banks.  It can be a bit of a job at times, although I know they have got their Act together a bit.  I do not know whose fault that was.  Was it the big bad commercial banks sitting of the State minnow?  Why is it that there has been &mdash; it is not quite as bad at the moment &mdash; this block on the transfer of money from the normal commercial banks to the Trustee Savings Banks?  I am talking about Bank Giro or credit transfer.  I would like to know how that is to operate in the future.  I want to be assured that this legislation will make clear that the cartels cannot put the boot into these in any non-commercial way.</P>
    <P>The other point is the arrangement for the clearing of cheques.  Until recently I understand the Trustee Savings Banks were not involved in the normal clearing of cheques.  They had a system of their own.  It took a bit longer which was useful to those of us who were operating our very dicey overdrafts and working out the number of days it took to transfer from one to the other.  At one stage I had it down to a fine art.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Although it acted to my benefit on most occasions I still have a certain resentment about it.  I believe we should protect the Trustee Savings Banks even if it means nasty letters going to people like myself, which does not make me unique among politicians.  I raise these questions perhaps in a facile way but they are serious basic issues to which I want a response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="593" /> There is another question I want to raise.  I have not got the Central Bank Act with me.  The Government kicked it through with contempt for this House earlier in the year without proper, due discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not go into that history, that black day for this House.  I did not get the chance to study that Bill as I would have liked.  I am certainly aware that under the legislation which was amended by that Consolidation Act the number of bank branches which may be opened in any one year by a bank is restricted, from memory I would say to two or three.  I listened with interest to Senator Fallon looking after his own and the Minister's constituency with new branches in Longford and a couple of other places.  Of course, my evil mind thought if they are to be restricted in the number of branches they may open, I hope there will never be political interference &mdash; I know the Minister would not involve himself in any way &mdash; in deciding where those branches are situated.  Will the Trustee Savings Banks be limited in the number of High Street outlets they may open in any one year?  Are they subject to the Central Bank legislation on this matter or are they free agents as trustees?  It is important in terms of servicing the needs of people, particularly the small punters around the country. The essence of the Trustee Savings Banks in so many ways is dependent on a wide retail distribution network which, of course, is costly as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past month a new bank has been set up and has come into operation in the UK.  It is unique among banks in that it is quite contrary to what we are talking about today, this is, a bank that does not have any branches at all.  That is its great claim to fame.  You can do your business 24 hours a day, 365 days a year through the means of technology.  It is an electronic bank.  It will provide a 24-hour service throughout the year.  It is of vital importance that the Trustee Savings Banks become totally electronic banks <Col N="594" /> parallel with their High Street outlets.  I think both those developments must go in parallel.</P>
    <P>The banking system is different in many parts of the world.  People who do not have the experience of going to banks in other countries do not realise quite how liberal is the banking system here. Before the Euro-cheques came in if you tried to get a cheque cashed in Germany it could take an hour and a half.  That gives an understanding of the sort of old-fashioned, fuddy-duddy attitude there is to banking in many parts of the world. One way around this is through electronic banking.  I want to tie this in with the facility which is being made available in the Bill to allow involvement in international banking.  I get confused when I see legislation which facilitates the international movement of labour, capital, finance, whatever it happens to be.  I understood that under the Treaty of Rome this activity could take place anywhere. I would like the Minister to explain if this is simply tidying-up legislation in order to bring us into conformity with the requirements of our European partners and involvements, or is it something which is necessary in its own right.</P>
    <P>The idea of a bank operating without international contacts and access is almost a contradiction in terms.  We have now reached the stage where there are no national banks anymore.  There is no Dublin Stock Exchange anymore.  These terms are out of date.  It is as easy to buy shares in Irish companies in Cologne or London as it is to buy them in Dublin at the moment.  It is a European Stock Exchange with branches in various cities. Where does that leave the Trustee Savings Bank?</P>
    <P>I raised the question earlier about the connection between this legislation and the proposed companies legislation which began as a Bill here and is now being dealt with in the Dáil.  Since it left us a number of proposals have been addressed.  One of those leads to a very complicated position.  That is that within a year we will have passed legislation which allows companies to trade in their own shares.  I am not sure whether that <Col N="595" /> applies to private companies as well as publicly quoted companies.  I do not want to go into details of how that operation works because it is very complicated. Companies will be able to buy up their own shares.  This will allow them to have greater control over their profits.  What would happen under that legislation if the Trustee Savings Bank decided that it wanted to buy from the Minister for Finance some of his 51 per cent shares in the company?  A section of the Bill restrains the Minister from disposing of shares which would leave him holding fewer than 51 per cent.  Another section of the Bill allows the Trustee Savings Bank to set up companies.</P>
    <P>I presume that the ownership of those companies would also reflect the ownership of the parent company and that the Minister would have a 51 per cent at least interest in each one of those companies. I do not know if that is the case. It is not spelt out in the Bill.  I certainly want to know if that is the case.  If they are set up as companies under the new Companies Bill and if that new Bill also allows the company to deal, trade and buy its own shares which legislation would then take precedence.  Would it be the one which says the Minister may not dispose of more than 49 per cent of the shares or the Companies Act which says that the company may buy or trade in its own shares?  I would like that to be seriously addressed.  For me there is some conflict there.</P>
    <P>As regards the setting up of companies, I welcome that as a most progressive development.  This brings me back to my original thesis of the restraints that have been put on semi-State companies over the years.  The best example I can give is the comparison between the ESB and Aer Lingus.  In the original legislation there was one significant difference.  The Aer Lingus legislation allowed them to set up their own companies and hence their success in having strings of hotels in America or catering companies in Dublin Airport or companies like Airmotive on the Naas Road, and so on.  They have <Col N="596" /> been allowed to set up commercially significant, viable, profitable and successful industry.  The small traders of Ireland in the twenties did not want the ESB to be set up in the first place and because of the pressure they were able to put on Governments at that time the ESB were not allowed to sell coal, among other things &mdash; just to bring the Minister back to Clare on an issue which will be of interest to him.</P>
    <P>Last year we passed legislation to allow the ESB to set up their own companies. Before that they were in an utter mess. For example, they were tendering for the setting up of electrification schemes in places abroad.  Because the legislation did not allow them to set up companies they had to get companies set up in Saudi or wherever, in which they did not have the controlling interest although they did have to underwrite all the expenses of the company.  It had to be underwritten in a way that it did not come back to the parent company; this was impossible.  It meant they were acting illegally for years and years.  Their hands were tied and they were not able to compete internationally. That is what can happen if a semi-State company are not allowed set up their own companies.  That is one of the reasons why I welcome this development in this legislation which allows them to set up their own companies.</P>
    <P>There are issues which concern me. One has already been raised by Senator Doyle.  That is the writing of regulations arising from various sections of the legislation. Whether it be dealt with by the Oireachtas by a positive or negative process is a matter that should be of concern to every parliamentarian.  I am not getting into a discussion about the Minister for Finance or the Oireachtas.  The positive process is the one where the Minister comes in and says he proposes to make these changes and it has to be approved by vote or otherwise of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>An affirmative order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The affirmative order has to be approved and accepted by the House.  The negative process is where <Col N="597" /> one picks up the Seanad Order Paper any day, turns to the back page and sees a series of perhaps &mdash; today there are 16 &mdash; laid before the Seanad.  This might be regulation, statutory order or whatever. There is never a reference to them in the House by any Member.  I often check them out in the Library to see what they are about.  I have found some interesting things going back to old pieces of legislation but nobody knows about them.</P>
      <P>The negative process is that parliamentarians have to check those every day.  If they do not like what is there they go back to the main legislation and find that they have so many sitting days to get the House to reject it.  Of course the House will not reject it because the House will not be able to get it on the Order of Business.  In effect it is a clandestine operation.  The Minister says he is going to make a certain change.  He sends it on to the Chief Librarian.  That is it done.  It will appear on the Order Paper, the Librarian will contact the Clerk of both Houses and ask them to include it in the Order of Business on one day next week.  It is included one day next week, most people never notice it and within 21 days it is gone.  That cannot be an acceptable process.  I have given the worst aspect of it there.  I am not saying the Minister would be trying it on, but not all the wisdom is deposited or invested in the advisers of the Department of Finance, good and all as they may be, and let me rush to the defence of goods, hard-working public and civil servants.  Nevertheless, there could also be some expertise outside that area, maybe even in the Houses of the Oireachtas, people who would point out some little difficulties.  Therefore, I think these matters should be discussed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Col N="598" /> In section 58 of the Bill the formation of new companies has to be done through the affirmative process.  Therefore, both practices are included in the proposed legislation.  Could the Minister say why one is more important than the other, why one is different from the other?  It is a very straightforward, straight up question. It seems to me there is no good reason for having the different processes in the one piece of legislation when the two issues being dealt with are quite close in this issue.  Section 4, as I understand it, will deal with fairly substantial issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Sections 4 and 5 are the two sections I am talking about.  The regulations are based on section 4 and explained in section 5.  They are fundamental issues.  They are as fundamental as the setting up of a new company.  Certainly they are important in this legislation.  I would ask that that would be considered.</P>
      <P>Part VI deals with amalgamations.  I approve the requirement of three-fifths as opposed to the three-quarters previously. Is this three-quarters of the shareholders, of the trustees?  Are we talking about the small group of trustees in this case?  Where will that relate?  I am back to the Companies Bill again.  What happens if the legislation allows the Trustee Savings Banks to set up other companies which may have shareholders and where shareholders have certain rights which, according to this legislation, might well be usurped by the trustees?  Can that happen?  I think it can as I read the legislation.  I am sure the Minister will tell me that it cannot.  I certainly would like to hear an explanation of how that will work out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fallon and others have welcomed the opening up of the Trustee Savings Banks, allowing them out to the marketplace, allowing them to do their own thing, to give the service, to compete with the big boys.  It is all very well until one reads section 6 where they are allowed to merge with each other; it is sort of incestuous.  What happens if they <Col N="599" /> spot another small bank somewhere else which they feel they could take over, a bank in trouble, and they want to buy it? Can they take it over?  Can they compete on the commercial market?  As I read the legislation, they cannot.  Why are we restricting them?  Many of us here at the back look forward to the time when the Trustee Savings Banks will be running the banking in this country and we feel that now is the time to make a start on that and allow them to move forward on this issue.</P>
    <P>The question of mergers also arises in this case.  Under this legislation can we enable the Trustee Savings Banks to merge with other banks &mdash; as opposed to a take-over &mdash; to merge with other non-trustee banks?  Can that happen?  If not, why not?  As I read the legislation, it cannot happen.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would indicate the thinking of Government.  In other words, I do not see it as any protection to the depositor.  I do not see it as any protection to the development of the Trustee Savings Banks.  I see it as a fetter.  I see it as something that retards and restricts progress.  I want to know why.  I always worry when I see the semi-State companies, or those companies in which the State has a major interest, not being allowed do the things the private sector can do.  If we are going to have restrictions let us restrict people at all levels equally and give them all a fair chance.  I would like to hear it developed further.</P>
    <P>In regard to the transfer of power from the Minister for Finance to the Central Bank, my immediate response is a positive one.  I would be happier that it should be treated like other banks.  I believe the Central Bank is the place in which that power should rest.  It raises two fundamentals. First of all, precisely what power are we handing over?  What are the precise details of what are being transferred?  What is it that the Minister can do now which will in future be done by the Central Bank?  Those are very clear and fundamental questions.</P>
    <P>There is something more menacing and more worrying down the line.  I am back <Col N="600" /> to Europe.  The Government are in deep discussions at the moment with counterparts from the other 11 members of the Community and talking about having one currency, one central bank, one great big financial milieu in Europe.  What happens to our little Trustee Savings Banks in that milieu?  We are not actually transferring the powers from the Minister for Finance to the Central Bank, what we are effectively doing today is transferring the power from the Minister for Finance to the European directorate dealing with finance, or the European Central Bank or whatever is going to be there in place of the national central banks.  That is clearly what is envisaged.  I hope the Minister will not attempt to deny that.  Everybody knows what is going on.  The point I have just made has not been adverted to.  It creates problems for depositors.  I want to hear that discussed.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle raised a question which is very close to my own heart.  This is the growing and creeping &ldquo;ageism&rdquo; which is manifesting itself in our legislation these times.  What happens when you reach age 70?  I am fast approching it myself.  This Bill contains two little gems of &ldquo;ageism&rdquo;. It says, first of all, that when you reach 70 you can no longer be a trustee.  Why? What is the magic about 70?  I am aware that is has been downhill since 40.  I do not have any aspirations to be a trustee of a Trustee Savings Bank at age 70, but if I were to be one at 69½, is it that I would be considered to be <i>non compos mentis</i> or what happens at age 70?  Somebody appears to pick these figures arbitrarily out of the air.  One can either do the job or one cannot.  It is not like being in a particular job or being a member of the public or Civil Service or whatever.</P>
    <P>In section 41 we have something similar, but in the other direction.  We are told that a person of full age may bank. If somebody walks into a bank with money is that not enough?  What is the thing about &ldquo;full age&rdquo;?  Why do we need that added in in section 41?  I would like to hear a definition of &ldquo;full age&rdquo;.  It must be a legal one.  Maybe it means 18, maybe it means the age of criminal responsibity, age seven.  We have all different sorts of <Col N="601" /> ages in our legislation.  What does this mean and why is it necessary to tell somebody that he or she is entitled to deposit money?</P>
    <P>I want to finish up with one gem in this legislation which I am very pleased with and which represents a very positive progressive attitude from Government.  I know it will be close to the heart of Senator Norris who has been asking the Government to deal with certain issues arising out of a judgment from Europe. It states that for the purpose of this section, a person is connected with a trustee of a Trustee Savings Bank if, but only if, &ldquo;he is a Trustee's spouse or he lives together with him as a spouse&rdquo;.  We think that is progress.  I will have more to say about this in the future.</P>

      <P>The <Col N="602" /> Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Bill, 1988, has been passed by Dáil Éireann with amendments and I would now like to explain these amendments to this House. Some of the amendments are of a very minor and technical nature but there are also a number of major ones.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 arose out of points initially made in this House.  It provides a wider definition of &ldquo;broadcast&rdquo;, which now includes the transmission, relaying or distribution of visual images or sounds by means other than wireless telegraphy. In other words, the transmission of images or sounds by wireless telegraphy, or by any other means, or by a combination of wireless telegraphy and any other means is now covered by the definition of &ldquo;broadcast&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 is really a composite of three separate amendments. The presence of two of these, that is, the inclusion of the travelling community and sexual orientation, owes much to the original debate on the Bill in this House. However, I would first of all like to say a few words about the first change to the definition of &ldquo;hatred&rdquo;, that is, the extension of the scope of the definition to include hatred stirred up against specified groups of persons outside of the State.  I was concerned that, under the original definition, subtle forms of hatred could be stirred up against groups of persons on account of, say, their race or religion, in very specific areas outside the State. Although, in the Bill as it stood, hatred incited against groups of persons outside the State could have been an offence if that hatred was felt by representatives of those groups within the State, there could have been circumstances where such hatred would not have affected any of the groups of persons in the State.  This potential loophole has now been closed off.  From a drafting point of view it means we have just one definition of &ldquo;hatred&rdquo; which applies throughout the Bill and accordingly that definition now appears in section 1, the interpretation section, and has been deleted from sections 2, 3 and 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is little I need to say to defend <Col N="603" /> the other two amendments to the definition of &ldquo;hatred&rdquo;, that is, the inclusion of the travelling community and sexual orientation.  I am glad to say that these amendments have proved to be both popular and uncontroversial.  The impressive case made for these amendments in both Houses of the Oireachtas gave rise to a review of what groups should be given the explicit protection afforded by the Bill.  To understand the changes, I think it is necessary to remember the reason why this Bill was introduced in the first place.  The Bill is based on a report from an interdepartmental committee and it was intended to give effect to one of the matters necessary before Ireland could ratify the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The word &ldquo;ethnic&rdquo; was included in the definition of &ldquo;hatred&rdquo; in order to give effect to the relevant provision in the United Nations Convention on Racial Discrimination and as a matter of policy and for the sake of certainty it was decided to include specific reference to the travelling community in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of &ldquo;sexual orientation&rdquo; is also not necessary in the context of ratification of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  However, as the debate on the Bill progressed it became clear that it was very relevant as far as the Bill was concerned in a domestic context.  As with the travellers, sympathy alone is of very little benefit to homosexuals when they are being verbally attacked and abused.  An opportunity has now arisen to be more than just sympathetic and I am happy to be able to avail of this opportunity to give the protection afforded by the Bill to homosexuals.</P>
    <P>I was conscious that the types of verbal or written attacks that can be made against the travellers and homosexuals that are intended or are likely to incite hatred against them can, and indeed does, lead to violence.  Without the protection of the Bill I could foresee that these attacks might increase and an opportunity to prevent those attacks would have been lost.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 5 to section <Col N="604" /> 2 of the Bill are all connected.  Section 2 contains the central provisions of the Bill and it is of the utmost importance that it be exactly right.  Accordingly, in the light of comments made in the other House, and indeed touched on in this House, the section was re-examined to see if it could be tightened-up and this examination was concerned mainly with the definitions of &ldquo;public meeting&rdquo; and &ldquo;public place&rdquo;.  The problem which was identified centred on meetings which were attended by small select groups, for example of an association, and at which it would be difficult to claim that the public were entitled to be present.  Take the situation where a meeting is organised for a town hall or hotel room or other conference facility which members of an association attend for the purpose of inciting hatred against one of the groups referred to in the definition of &ldquo;hatred&rdquo;.  The members so present might not have been regarded as members of the public in the way that the term was used in the definitions of &ldquo;public meeting&rdquo; and &ldquo;public place&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The situation was remedied by the three amendments to section 2, the purpose of which was to delete the definitions of &ldquo;public meeting&rdquo; and &ldquo;public place&rdquo; and to replace them with one of &ldquo;private residence&rdquo; into which was incorporated the old definition of &ldquo;public place&rdquo;.  The result is that it will be an offence to incite to hatred in the terms of the Bill, in any place, public or private, except in a private residence and the private residence exclusion is heavily qualified. Thus, it will be an offence to incite to hatred, in the circumstances covered in section 2 (1) (b), and where the other conditions of the section are met, anywhere outside a private residence and even in a private residence if the words, behaviour or material concerned are heard or seen by any person outside that particular private residence or if they are used or displayed at a public meeting in the residence.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 has a secondary effect of removing the old definition of &ldquo;hatred&rdquo; from section 2.  Amendment No. 6 is simply to insert the word &ldquo;visual&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;images&rdquo; in section <Col N="605" /> 3 (1).  It was inadvertently omitted from the Bill when published.  Amendment No. 7, also to section 3, is quite technical but will have practical application.  In proceedings for an offence under section 3 alleged to have been committed in respect of an item, a script on which the item was based will be evidence of what was included in the item.  This is provided by subsection (7).  Subsection (8) paragraph (d) provides that, where a copy has been made of the script by or on behalf of a member of the Garda Síochána, it too shall be evidence of what was in the item.  Amendment No. 7 avoids the necessity of calling the member of the Garda Síochána, or another witness, to prove that the document produced to the court was a correct copy of the script.  If the document appears on its face to be a copy of the script and to be signed by the member, it will be taken that this is the case, unless evidence is produced to show that this is not so.  The amendment will avoid the waste of time and expense caused by calling witnesses to prove formally matters unlikely to be in dispute.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 is consequential to amendment No. 2 in that it removes the definition of &ldquo;hatred&rdquo; from section 3 of the Bill.  It may be puzzling at first sight that amendment No. 8 consists of a definition of &ldquo;script&rdquo;.  The explanation is that subsection (9) of section 3 contained the definitions of &ldquo;hatred&rdquo; and &ldquo;script&rdquo; and amendment No. 8 simply reproduces the definition of &ldquo;script&rdquo; alone.  That definition is unchanged.</P>
    <P>There are two amendments to section 4.  Amendment No. 9 is a technical amendment which will ensure that section 4 (3) will operate as originally intended.  The words &ldquo;the court&rdquo; in subsection (3) meant, in a case tried with a jury, the trial judge, and, in a case tried in the District Court, the District Justice. Accordingly, under subsection (3) as it appeared in the Bill, in a case tried with a jury it would have been a function of the trial judge to decide whether or not it was right to be satisfied that it was reasonable to assume that the material or recording was not intended for the personal use of the defendant.  The effect <Col N="606" /> of amendment No. 9 will, where a jury is sitting, make that a function of the jury. Where there is no jury, it will be a function of the District Justice.  That was in any case the original intent of subsection (3).</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 10 is consequential to amendment No. 2.  It deletes the definition of &ldquo;hatred&rdquo; from section 4.  Amendments Nos. 11 and 12 to section 5 are related and arise out of an amendment accepted from Senator O'Toole during Committee Stage of the Bill in this House.  The draftsman advised that the wording of the amendment did not fully meet its objective, that is, to include reports of committees of the Oireachtas or of either House of the Oireachtas in the scope of the section.  These amendments meet that objective.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 13 involves the deletion of the original section 8 of the Bill and its substitution with a new section. This new section was inserted to meet reservations about the effect of the section as it stood.  It was suggested that on the original wording a person arrested for an offence could not be charged even in a Garda station without the consent of the DPP.  The amendment makes it clear that a person can be charged in a Garda station, and remanded in custody or on bail, in advance of the decision of the DPP, but that the formal charge in court alleging the offence, and all subsequent proceedings, will take place only with the consent of the DPP.  The section in its amended form is a standard provision found in other criminal legislation.</P>
    <P>I come now to amendment No. 14 to section 9.  The purpose of section 9 (1) (b) is to ensure that a District Justice or Peace Commissioner would not be able to issue a warrant to the Garda to search premises for a script or recording of a broadcast item unless satisfied that a requirement was made pursuant to section 3 for the production to the member of the Garda of the script or recording and that the relevant item was not produced to the member.  The purpose of the amendment is to provide for the situation where a script or recording was produced to the member of the Garda but he was <Col N="607" /> not afforded an opportunity of making a copy of the relevant item.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 15 to section 12 amends the Short Title of the Bill and amendment No. 16 to the title amends its Long Title.  These amendments are necessary to accommodate the inclusion of &ldquo;sexual orientation&rdquo; in the definition of &ldquo;hatred&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Senators will agree that many of the amendments I have just explained are important and that they leave us with better and more relevant legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because of the celebration of United Nations Day on 10 December and the ratification, hopefully, and full acknowledgement of the United Nations covenants that I appeal to the Minister today to include in section 1 (2), where he outlines hatred against the various groups on account of race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, membership of the travelling community or sexual orientation, incitement to hatred towards women and children.  I know this has been debated over the last few weeks, but I wish that this would be included because we know that within certain areas relating to hard pornography &mdash; I could go on and on, but I want to make it brief &mdash; there are various forms of violence and humiliation which I would suggest are an incitement to sexual hatred and violence.  If we are legislating here in the name of freedom, we should really be talking about civil rights and civil liberties which in my, and in Fine Gael's view should include freedom for women and children within this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to clarify one point.  This week editors of all English newspapers have met to see how standards could be enforced re the British media.  I wonder whether there is scope within this Bill for a similar situation within our Irish media.  There was an example in recent times in a national newspaper, which I do not wish to quote because I think I would be just adding to the exploitation of the infringement of an <Col N="608" /> individual's rights, but I can furnish the Minister with details later.  I am asking him whether this Bill includes the freedom, as it were, of the media to print what they like in cases where they are violating an individual's freedom.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to comment on this Bill, as amended, and to address the amendments.  First of all, in some general terms, the Minister has very generously and very appropriately indicated the value of Seanad Éireann as a revising participant in the process of Government of legislation with the Dáil. The Minister made it quite clear that he valued the long, detailed and scrupulous examination of the original Bill and that, in a spirit of intellectual inquiry, he and his Department were prepared to take very seriously indeed the arguments that were entered onto the record here in the Seanad during that debate.  I have to welcome that and I welcome the amendments in particular.  Apart altogether from the technical amendments &mdash; and I take it there may be some small discussion on those, but even if there is not, the Minister may take it that I, for one, accept the persuasive force of his arguments with regard to most of the technical adjustments made in this Bill &mdash; there are two principal amendments here.  These concern the inclusion of the travelling community and the question of sexual orientation, both of which were initially placed against the Bill here in the Seanad. This indicates that we have matured as a people and as a Government.  Particularly in the context of the next few months it is very important that these kinds of amendments be made during a period when we will be assuming the Presidency of the European Community. This is a valuable indicator of the fact that we are an equal intellectual and moral partner with the other countries in the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that this be stressed because it has been suggested recently <Col N="609" /> that this Bill, as amended, is a dangerous instrument and will restrict freedom rather than enhance it.  I do not believe that is the case.  Although I am aware of the fact that incitment legislation does not always have the immediate direct intention, nor will these amendments, that they are intended to have, one has only got to look up the road 90 miles where there is already in place incitment legislation and it does not, tragically, inhibit people from committing outrages against the members of different communities whom they have taken into their heads to dislike.  It is, however, very important that this Bill be passed and that it be passed this afternoon because, among other things, if it does not pass with these amendments, it is quite possible that Ireland, very embarrassingly, during a period when we hold the Presidency of the Community, could become a principal publications centre for material that would be rejected elsewhere in Europe.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has taken on board a number of amendments which will positively affect this situation.</P>
    <P>I was particularly pleased that the Minister indicated that one of the amendments is a tidying-up of an amendment that was introduced by my colleague, Senator Joe O'Toole.  I would like also to refresh the memory of the House with regard to another amendment, that is the question that is addressed in amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 5 to section 2 of the Bill which concern the places of assembly which may or may not be covered by the operation of the Bill and in particular the definition of private house, meeting hall and so on.  My recollection is that this was introduced at some length by Senator O'Toole.  At the time my attention was so firmly focused on other amendments, as the Minister can understand, that I was not sure of the relevance of what my distinguished colleague was saying.  The Minister, obviously, has a clearer understanding of what was going on at that stage and has welcomed and incorporated the suggestions made regarding this point.  He said that this matter was raised extensively in the Dáil and perhaps <Col N="610" /> referred to in the Seanad.  I would simply like to establish the fact that these matters were quite comprehensively covered in the debate in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be tedious because we had our say here in arguing forcibly on these amendments and the Minister has clearly studied them.  I would like to end with two observations, both general but also quite specific to these amendments. The first is that as originally introduced without these amendments this was minimalist legislation.  It was, in fact, enough to meet the requirements necessary to allow us to become a signatory to the international Covenant on Human rights. I very much welcome the fact that the Minister has clearly signalled that he intends to be a creative Minister for Justice and not to confine himself merely to minimalist legislation that will meet our requirements in these matters.  It is generous, good and useful that he has decided to expand the provisions of the Bill to do something positive for the development of Irish society.</P>
    <P>The second and final observation I will make is that to a large extent this is a theoretical situation, apart from the few practical situations I have outlined such as the danger of Ireland becoming a publishing centre for reprehensible materials, usually from the extreme right. It is largely theoretical and hypothetical. That does not mean that I do not welcome it; I clearly do.  What will give teeth to this Bill and to its amendments is if the Minister finds himself able to follow it up with what we urged during the debate on the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Bill, namely, a Bill concerning discrimination. I understand that this is also something that may be in the pipeline in order to allow us to ratify yet another international protocol.  It may not be appropriate for the Minister to address himself to this particular point in his reply; I hope, however, he may find himself able to do so.  I urge the Minister to consider the introduction of such a Bill outlawing discrimination and to show equal wisdom in drafting this legislation to ensure that it also includes both the <Col N="611" /> travelling people and the question of sexual orientation.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of particular pleasure to me to read amendment No. 16 which concerns the Long Title of the Bill, An Act to Prohibit Incitement to Hatred on Account of Race, Religion, Nationality or Sexual Orientation.  That, as the Minister well knows, places it as an historic document whose importance reflects very considerable credit on him.</P>
    <P>I would like to add just one rider, because everything I have said has been positive.  This is totally uncharacteristic of me and would like to add one minor technical cavil, that is, that I regret there were not sufficient copies of the Minister's excellent speech.  I hope that does not indicate an assumption that there would be a less than general interest either in the Minister's words or the very important substance of what we have been discussing here this afternoon.  I have no hesitation in giving a warm welcome to this series of amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we can work ourselves into a position of being perpetually critical of Government.  I want to give an unequivocal welcome to this legislation and to congratulate the Minister. The Minister is a politician who lives in perhaps a harsher world of politics than university Senators and he deserves a particular compliment.  He cannot have been certain when he and the Government chose to extend the provisions of the Bill to cover the travelling community and sexual orientation that he was not going to have descend on him a frightening cacophony of dissent and the sort of extraordinary extremism that exists in this country.  I would have been prepared to reassure him on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have an inclination in this country to apologise for ourselves.  I suspect there are many European countries whose media would be inclined to look at us as an illiberal and conservative society who do not have legislation to prevent incitement to hatred against people on the grounds of sexual orientation.  Let us be very clear about what this Bill means. <Col N="612" /> The relevant phrase in terms of the new definition of hatred is written material, words, behaviour, visual images or sounds, as the case may be, are threatening, abusive or insulting and, having regard to all circumstances, are likely to stir up hatred.</P>
    <P>Let us be very careful of what this means.  There are many people in our society who are inclined to be very vocal, particularly about the travelling community, what they do or do not do and about; they are also vocal about the alleged responsibility of the Gay community towards the AIDS epidemic. People are inclined to say quite remarkably horrific and horrible things.  Let them all be warned now that if those things they say and do are likely, having regard to all the circumstances, to stir up hatred, they are committing an offence. We have introduced legislation to defend various vulnerable minorities and we have chosen freely &mdash; in this regard the Minister deserves particular plaudits &mdash; to incorporate two groups in our society who have been the subject of considerable and appalling verbal abuse and, indeed, in some cases physical abuse, and considerable harassment.</P>
    <P>Once this Bill comes into force any people in our society who launch into some of these horrific diatribes will be, in my view quite rightly, liable at least to investigation because we have said that the limits of debate in our society are extremely broad.  We have, in fact, extended our vision of who is incorporated fully within our society but we have also said that within those limits of debate to say things directly or by publication, which are likely to cause hatred towards any of the groups identified in this Bill, to say that or to do that, is an offence under the law.  This is a very welcome day and it is another small indication of something that, as a fairly vocal critic of Irish society I have said on frequent occasions but whatever my criticisms of Irish society I do not regard us as an illiberal conservative society, I do not regard us as in any way, having <Col N="613" /> the reactionary imagery that is portrayed of this country.</P>
    <P>This is a remarkable tolerant society, given the traditional religious values.  The people who have traditional values in this country are also a remarkably tolerant people.  The fact that legislation like this can be passed quite easily once the Minister was persuaded shows the degree to which our society is a remarkably tolerant society, without, in many ways, some of the more ugly manifestations of extremism that other societies have to deal with.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be complimented in giving leadership.  I would like to associate myself with what Senator Norris said. The Minister has made a fine start at being a reforming Minister.  A great deal of legislation is needed in the area of reform.  A great deal of legislation is needed in many areas where this Minister could contribute, simply to put into formal fashion many things that are accepted in our society.</P>
    <P>I do not want to detain the Minister unnecessarily.  We have now reached the first stage in a process of recognising that there are weak and vulnerable minorities within our society.  It is extremely important that the political process at national and local levels reflect that view, particularly as far as the travelling community are concerned, that they are no longer to be seen as a soft target for a good headline in an evening newspaper, provincial newspaper or local newspaper, but are identified as a vulnerable group whom the Oireachtas have chosen quite specifically to protect.  I compliment the Minister on what he has done.</P>
    <P>I am very proud of the role this House had in beginning and developing the debate on the way in which this legislation should apply.  I compliment the Minister and, indeed, many Members of the Oireachtas who created what effectively became a consensus to extend the provisions of this Bill so that we were not just making fine gestures about groups who, perhaps, did not present a problem in our society but were identified specific groups within our society who, for one reason or another were vulnerable and liable to be the victims of incitement to <Col N="614" /> hatred.  What we are saying is, &ldquo;We will not simply produce empty rhetoric; we will produce legislation that could well have a specific effect on the way we do business in our society&rdquo;.  The Minister is to be complimented for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to embarrass the Minister by heaping any more praise upon him from the Independent benches than is avoidable and I do not want him to feel politically uncomfortable when there is an unanimity of support from these benches for what he is doing.  I should remind the House that it is barely seven or eight months ago since an amendment very similar to the first one proposed by the Minister was decisively rejected here.  I do not know how the Minister managed to get the Cabinet to change their minds and I would not ask him to tell us that.  I would put on record that, personally and collectively this side of the House congratulate him on being able to do that and having the courage to come forward to both the Dáil and Seanad to do this.</P>
      <P>It is only right that those of us who proposed or supported such an amendment such a short time ago should recognise that there were supposed political difficulties in producing an amendment to this legislation which included both the travelling community and sexual orientation. I suspect that those difficulties because of the way this amendment has gone through the Houses so easily, have now been proven to be more in the mind than factual.  I hope, as Senator Norris and Senator Ryan have said, that this will be the forerunner of similar liberal, sensible attitudes towards these sort of issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that this means that the Minister will be prepared to introduce legislation, first of all, in response to Senator Norris's case in the European Court on human rights.  Having got this Bill through, that should be easier, with the change in attitudes, but I hope it will also mean that he will be prepared to look again at liberal social legislation, like marital breakdown. I hope that as a consequence of the ease with which this has gone through <Col N="615" /> from is party's side he will look again at the possibility of having another referendum on divorce.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that with the support of the Fianna Fáil Party for legislation and amendments of the sort tha Minister is bringing forward here, similar legislation on divorce or in response to the European Court of Human Rights decision, would pass through the House almost without opposition.  The Minister has made a very good start in doing that. I congratulate him, but I hope it is only a start.  I hope the matter of divorce will be tackled.  I hope discrimination against homosexuality will be tackled and I hope that this will continue in the way that it started.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a point about those who criticise this sort of legislation. The main, camouflaged criticism as I understand it is that it is a form of censorship. I am afraid to say that the word &ldquo;censorship&rdquo;, in liberal terminology or in ordinary termonology, in this country is now a word of abuse.  I do not regard &ldquo;censorship&rdquo; as a word of abuse.  In certain circumstances, censorship is utterly justified.  Those who criticise this Bill on the grounds of censorship are saying quite simply that you should be allowed to do these things because of some ethereal principle to which we all subscribe, that people should be able to say anything like, whatever the consequences.  I do not subscribe to that.  I do not think most people who want to see an ordered, civilised society subscribe to that.  We have only to look at a very controversial issue, which is supported by the principal parties in this State, section 31, which is similar in many ways to this Bill because it stops people from inciting other people to kill other people or do harm to other people.  Censorship in itself should not be a prejorative word.</P>

I was really saying that if &ldquo;censorship&rdquo; is to be a pejorative word we should have explained to us why it is such a bad thing.  In the case of this Bill and the amendments, which certainly expounded censorship, I personally welcome it for what it prevents.</P>

      <P>I would like to join my colleagues in complimenting the Minister on this Bill.  I particularly welcome the sections that refer to the travelling people.  The two most unpleasant nights I spent during my 16 years as a member of Dublin Corporation were those that I spent in my constituency where public meetings were held to discuss the efforts of Dublin Corporation to site in a very small, very modest, very well thought out location a few houses for travelling people.  In the second instance the site was in a middle-class area and the particular project was extremely well thought out.  The meetings which I attended were horrific.  I will never forget the abuse which was showered on the travelling people and I am very glad that that sort of behaviour will now be outlawed and it will be an offence.  I am glad to say that the public representatives for my area stood firm and the proposals went through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin Corporation have been hampered in other parts of the city in their <Col N="617" /> efforts to provide facilities for travelling people by unfounded fears which are stirred up by local community associations and other groups.  I very much welcome the provisions of this Bill which I hope will facilitate Dublin Corporation and other local authorities in the efforts they are making to improve the lot of the travelling people.</P>

I also compliment the Minister on the inclusion of travellers.  Very few people have done as much for the travelling community as the Minister for Justice who, when he was Chairman of Dublin County Council, brought in a very comprehensive plan to see that they were housed and given halting sites.  I would like to congratulate the Minister on these two amendments.</P>

      <P>I wish to join in the words that have been said in support of this legislation.  I would also like to thank the Minister for being generous in his response to the points I made recently in the House.  I find it quite gratifying that the two amendments which I put forward have now been accepted.  It is a fair reflection on the Government that the Minister has been prepared to take this on board and make these changes.  It makes it stronger.  However, it creates some confusion among people who believe that this is an actual discrimination Act.  The amendments tighten up the Bill in the way we wished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to give an indication of the confusion that is caused very often by some of the subsections here.  This morning I was in a travellers camp site in the west Dublin area.  There are 70 families living there and they have to get their water supply from the tap.  I will not describe the horrific hardship endured by those people.  One person said to me &mdash; and it goes right to the definition of hatred &mdash; that they cannot get schools for their kids, they cannot get many things they <Col N="618" /> are looking for and she asked me: &ldquo;Why do the settled community hate us?&rdquo;  This Bill is about hatred.  I am pleased that the definition of hatred is extended at least to incitement to hatred of such a cultural indigenous group as the travellers.  It points with some emphasis to the great need for an anti-discrimination Act.  Can I speak to specific amendments?</P>

      <P>In regard to private residents it does not cover the particular point which was raised at an earlier Stage of the Bill, that is the idea that a private club, whether it be in a private or public place, could still organise incitement to hatred.  I do not see that that has been covered by amendment No. 3.  I would like to ask the Minister to say if this covers the situation.</P>

Once the Minister has replied there is no scope for him to answer questions.  I shall ask the Seanad about the next Stage and if the Bill is agreed.

      <P>I commend the motion and in broad terms I support it, except that I have a problem with the words &ldquo;greater democracy&rdquo; because to be quite honest, I do not believe that there was any such thing as any form or semblance of democracy within the eastern European bloc.  Having said that, I commend the Motion and I would urge the Government to continue, as they have been doing, to use their influence, both unilaterally and within the European Community, to encourage the process of democratisation of the European bloc countries.  It is essential that they should do this in an attempt to completely rid the eastern Europe of the curse of communism, Marxism and socialism.  President Gorbachev should be commended because through his efforts of <i>perestroika,</i> restructuring in <i>glasnost</i> openness, he forced with outstanding strength and courage the hardline Eastern European communistic dominoes into the oblivion of political obituary.  We have witnessed the demise of each regime over the last few weeks, in particular, the off-loading of the political mavericks and animals synonomous with Marxist oppression the mass murderers who exploited the people in Eastern Germany, such as Honecker, like Zhivkov in Bulgaria, and the inevitable overthrow of the leaders in Czechoslovakia.  This has been an achievement for which President Gorbachev must take credit because he has realised that international communism, Marxism and socialism have failed broadly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, we must ask ourselves the question, is President Gorbachev as leader of <Col N="621" /> the eastern bloc states going to divest himself totally of the regime of communism and socialism.  We have to ponder and wonder about that, because, only last week, in typical communistic rhetoric, he told a Soviet youth gathering, and I quote: &ldquo;the fact that Marxism had in the past been wrongly applied was no grounds for giving it up&rdquo;.</P>

The utopian image that was built up about this some 45 years ago, right throughout the eastern block countries and maintained as a result of the Warsaw Pact, has resulted in nothing more than 45 years of total misrule, of mis-government, the perpetration of deceit and dishonesty, a rule by police states in all the eastern European bloc countries where people were ruthlessly and murderously exploited, where political dissenters and ethnic minorities were cruelly murdered.  The little mini-Marxists in this country should look to see what their colleagues have achieved over the last 45 years.</P>

There was oppression by silence, failure to inform the peoples of the eastern block of western developments, failure to develop new technologies. People lived with low wages. The type of money they had was little more than &ldquo;yokey dokey&rdquo; money which, I have no doubt, some of our friends over there would find it very hard to use.  It <Col N="622" /> would deeply disrupt their social lives if they had to use the sort of money that the people they would support in Eastern Europe have had to use on a daily basis for the last 45 years.</P>

      <P>The myth of full employment that our pseudo-socialists pretend obtains within the eastern bloc countries is something that amazes me. Employment there is little more than a deceit and a misconception.  The stories of corruption that have emanated from the eastern bloc countries are based on absolute fact.</P>
      <P>The people who led these Marxist regimes got themselves fine residences, fine holiday homes.  The abuse and misuse of power was part and parcel of how these regimes operated.  Certainly, I would advise any mini-Marxist in this country that in the past 45 years communism and Marxism have produced nothing but poverty, oppression, silence, hunger and a lack of basic food and clothes.  All one has to do is go to any of the eastern bloc countries and see the tiny cars and the appalling housing conditions. Why is it that the hard currency shops which operate in many of the eastern bloc countries are gazed on in abject amazement by the poor people who have been exploited?  For the poor people who are the victims of communism, Marxism and socialism, that is the only opportunity they have of seeing the type of goods which people living in true democracies use in a normal fashion in their normal everyday lives.  The only purchasers in these shops are diplomats and foreigners who can afford to purchase the goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question we must pose ourselves and which is most important for the future is, how far we can go and how far we must go to help to support those countries within the eastern bloc who wish for real, true and genuine change? Even in those countries the people are not sure how far they can go or will go. It is obvious that the Hungarians, who have been trying to change their ideological philosophy of economics over the <Col N="623" /> past number of years have not really advanced that far and neither have the East Germans.  It is a matter of how genuine this change is as to how far western Europe can go to support that change.  This poses enormous questions.</P>
    <P>Countries in western Europe should not subsidise pseudo-reformed Governments operating on minuscule delusions of Marxist policies.  The reforms, restructuring or <i>perestroika</i> should be true and genuine, albeit slow.  They will have to radically change towards more democratisation and the total elimination of communist, socialist and Marxist philosophies. The western countries have their own rights and needs in relation to developing their own structures and their own demands.  Certain preconditions should be fulfilled.  There should be free and secret elections; the end of power monopoly of the communists; the establishment of free trade unions; a free press; the introduction of a market economy. All of those five conditions should be fulfilled.  We should not have to subsidise a socialist economy.  We, in western Europe must behave responsibly on behalf of the people of the democratic world whom we represent.</P>
    <P>Only last week I had an opportunity privately to go to Bulgaria and what I saw saddened me.  Admittedly, I was there at the time when the Bulgarian people were looking for great change and the opportunities they felt might result from that change.  They had been led for over 30 years by the Secretary of the Communist Party, Mr. Zhivkov.  What I saw made me feel sad: it was certainly a microcosm of what was happening throughout the eastern bloc countries.  There was the classic situation of poor housing, abject poverty, the deceit which has been used to mislead the people, the charade of full employment when around the main squares of Sofia hundreds of peole were walking around aimlessly.  They were not going into the shops because there was nothing to get in the shops.  I lost my luggage on the way out and it took three Bulgarians two hours to get a shirt for me.  The amazing thing is when you go <Col N="624" /> into any of the shops in the main streets of Sofia some 50 or 60 people stand behind you and see what you are doing. I asked one Bulgarian what all these people were doing walking around, why were they watching someone who was buying goods and he said they did not have anything else to do.  I had been told by everyone else I had met that there was full employment.  I asked him, &ldquo;How can I reconcile this viewpoint with what I have been told authoritatively?&rdquo;  He said, &ldquo;No one works here because there is nothing to work at.&rdquo;  The average monthly wage is 240 leva.  According to their banks one leva is equivalent to one US dollar but all one has to do is walk outside the door of the hotel and you will get ten leva for one US dollar.  Those people earn the equivalent of US $24 per month or US $6 per week.  All one could see were people hoping for change.</P>
    <P>However, one would have to question whether they are genuine.  I wish to quote from a recent edition of the <i>Sofia News</i>, dated November 16-22, 1989 and the speech of Peter Mladenov who has succeeded Zhivkov.  He said:</P>
    <P>Sending Mr. Zhivkov to a well deserved rest, we are thanking him cordially for all that and we wish him many long years of health, buoyancy and creative activity.</P>
    <P>The fact of life is that most people in Sofia would tell you that Mr. Zhivkov is gone missing.  They would also tell you that his son who they allege spent US $3.5 million playing blackjack in Monaco five weeks ago, is also missing.  They would also tell you that the Deputy Prime Minister who lost his job on Friday is also missing.  Is this the sort of society the mini-Marxists over there would like to have here?  Ignorance is bliss.  We will have to question the genuineness of the reformation because in his closing words Mr. Mladenov said:</P>
    <P>The Bulgarian Communist Party being bone of the bone and flesh of the flesh of the Bulgarian people, being a political force whose roots go deep into the history of this country, takes an <Col N="625" /> enormous responsibility for the success of restructuring.  This is a responsibility to the people of present-day Bulgaria, a responsibility to those who devoted their life and labours to the struggle for the triumph and establishment of socialism on Bulgarian soil, a responsibility to the succeeding generations. </P>
    <P>We are assuming that responsibility.</P>

      <P>It is a long time since I have heard such patronising drivel.  It is positively nauseating to have to listen to it.  A few points should be put on the record, that for every mass murderer you can identify on one side of the eastern bloc you can certainly find an equal, if not a ten-fold number outside the communist states.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that Senator McCarthy is leaving us at this time.  His thesis on the failure of communism, Marxism and socialism which he has delivered with such glee to us is interesting.  Of course, he has pointed out problems which have existed but where do they not exist?  This morning, less than ten miles from here, in a travellers' camp site, 60 or 70 years since Independence, I saw 70 families who have got one tap between them, no access to education and no access to health.  It is easy to walk into any country in the world and point out flaws.</P>
      <P>Before I go any further, I want to make it absolutely clear that I do not stand here to make the case for things that are wrong in another jurisdiction, be it communism, Marxism or socialism.  It amuses me that the previous speaker does not find it philosophically in his capacity to distinguish between socialism, Marxism and communism.  I do not intend to use my time to give him a lecture on political philosophies but it seems to me that all those who have prayed for all those years to save Russia must have had their prayers answered.  It appears that crusade has come to an end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would tell Senator McCarthy just one little story of another visitor to Hungary <Col N="626" /> in recent times.  It is an absolutely true story of an American visitor &mdash; whose father-in-law I recently met &mdash; who was in Hungary and developed a very serious abscess in his gums.  He was brought to the local health centre which, in his words, was a little grotty but had very good facilities.  He was dealt with with great efficiency; the abscess was drained, he was given medication and he was treated as he would wish to be treated. He was charged the equivalent of $1 for that.  His point was that if he had any future problems with his teeth it would be safer and cheaper for him to get a plane from the United States to Hungary to have it treated.</P>
    <P>I take the view that there is no political philosophy which is the correct one.  The whole sense of political life is that it must change constantly, it must be constantly examined, modified and applied in reflection of the will of the people and the changing times.  It is also important to state, in response to what Senator McCarthy has said, that the motivating force of capitalism &mdash; which cause he so ably puts forward &mdash; is the power of selfishness, greed and profit.  That is what makes capitalism work and that should be kept in mind.</P>
    <P>I welcome the motion put down by Fine Gael which deserves a positive response.  All politicians should welcome change wherever it may come from.  I always worry about those who sit here and condemn somewhere else without ever seeing the problems which are there beside them as they are so myopic in their approach.</P>
    <P>We have seen a revolution in the last number of months in the eastern bloc countries.  Make no mistake; <i>perestroika, glasnost,</i> the readiness to change and the massive changes we have seen in those countries represent the second revolution in this century for those countries, particularly for Russia.  We should also look at the source of the first revolution.  While I do not intend to make a history lesson out of it, it is very clear that communism was born as a result of the aggrandisement aspirations of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, of the threat of fascism <Col N="627" /> from Germany; of the suppression by the Tsars in Russia and it grew out of a dream of revolution which led to the October Revolution in 1917.  Let us leave it there and look very briefly at what happened in between.</P>
    <P>Rather than have anybody come back and disagree with what I have said, let me say straight away that I have been a consistent critic of those administrations in the east who have felt it necessary to imprison their people, to suppress civil and political rights in their country and to disallow the growth of free trade unions, for instance.  I was one of the first supporters in this country of the need for free trade unions in Poland and was a member of the Irish Solidarity Support Group.  I have always argued for free movement and free travel, as I have supported the charter of civil rights of the UN.  I speak with a very clean position on that.  I have been a constant critic of many aspects of the eastern bloc countries or what is known as the Second World.</P>
    <P>It was the difficult birth of that first revolution which led to the problems perhaps, and to the advances of the past 50, 60 or 70 years in those countries. Whatever Senator McCarthy might say, the levels of poverty and unemployment, the access to health services, to education and housing is something that is available in those countries and which we would aspire to have here.  Let us also recognise that.  Let us remember all our young students who are worried about third level places and points.  That does not exist in the Second World.  They have access to education at all levels and they have access to housing.  It is interesting to hear the discussions of those in East Berlin since the border was opened which prove that people want to live at home. It is interesting to hear them say they have a job, a good house and an enjoyable life, that all they want to do is to travel and that they have no intention of staying away from East Germany.  Choice has been brought into it and that has pointed out the ludicrous nature of the Berlin Wall.  We, as a people, must know <Col N="628" /> more than anybody that you cannot suppress people, you cannot suppress civil or political rights, they will win eventually. That kind of suppression will not succeed.</P>
    <P>The lack of poverty, the control of employment, the access to health services, to education and to housing should serve as a headline to governments throughout the world including Senator McCarthy's own party in Government.  I hope that with the spread of egalitarianism throughout Europe our people will get an improvement in those areas and that the demolition of borders and the demolition of the walls will lead to an egalitarianism that will find expression in increased employment, improved health service and housing and access to education. That is what we should learn from it.</P>
    <P>I question the patronising demands of Senator McCarthy to have conditions before we help and support changes in eastern Europe.  This House has a proud record of looking at problems anywhere in the world and being prepared to intervene, to discuss, to help, to support, to criticise whatever is needed; and we will continue to do that without any of the pre-conditions which he would look at.</P>
    <P>We also need to recognise the difference between our world, the world of the consuming capitalism and the world of the Second World, where they have managed to instil in their young people and in their ordinary working people a love of arts, culture, theatre, ballet, the fine arts, which we have failed miserably to do here.  It is significant that Senator McCarthy can produce here the <i>Sofia News</i> from Bulgaria, which is written in English.  I wonder if we were to produce a magazine or newspaper in this country, written in the language of a country 1,000 or 500 miles away, whether people would be able to read it.  That is a fair reflection on their educational system.  It is something to which we should aspire.</P>
    <P>We might also look at the contribution to industrial and technological development which has come from eastern Europe.  I think we would say: &ldquo;Let us share information on these things &mdash;<Col N="629" /> share and learn from each other&rdquo;.  Let us start a new process, a new initiative in egalitarianism.  Let us move forward, learning from each other.  Let us move forward attempting to create a better life, a better standard of living, a better quality of life, better access to the things that determine the quality of life.  This should be available to the people of the West as well.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the point that is most important in the Fine Gael motion, in welcoming the moves towards greater democracy, is that we are all of one voice on the issue.  Nobody in this House would disagree with that motion or disapprove of it.  Of course, we welcome it.  We can start at that point putting whatever codicials we want on to it, but we are committed to that particular point.  So what do we now do?  Do we now stand back, like Senator McCarthy, and look at a world of people who have come from rural peasant backgrounds, which would include most of eastern Europe, and criticise their efforts; or do we say: &ldquo;These people have something to offer; we have something to give; let us learn from each other and move forward together to create a Europe where the quality of life is improved for all&rdquo;?  This has to be the way forward.  It is not a case of Senator McCarthy's name-calling.  This adds nothing to the debate.  It reflects a dearth of political movement.  It reflects a paucity of ideas.  It reflects a resistance to change and it indicates to me that the biggest threat created by the demolition of the Iron Curtain-Berlin Wall has been that we will no longer be able to differentiate between where communism was and where capitalism is.</P>
    <P>We will no longer be able to point the finger and say: &ldquo;There they are over there&rdquo;, because the visitors to Europe will find themselves unknowingly in eastern Europe and they will see that they are only ordinary people trying to scrape a living like the rest of us.  Let us get together on this; let us look forward and resist the capitalising drivel of the previous speaker.  Let us look at this in a broad, open way and learn from each other.  Let us learn from the advances in <Col N="630" /> eastern Europe in the area of housing, social welfare, education and so on, and let us give to them the best of our world and together let us move forward.  What we have seen marks the end of statism and marks the beginning of a participatory democracy which we would hope to see worldwide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to support this motion.  I would like to say that I had the experience of being in Eastern Europe &mdash; in fact, in East Berlin &mdash; when Gary Powers was shot down over Russia. That experience brought home to me the depth of feeling, of fear, in the people there.  That, of course, was before the time of the terrible wall in Berlin.  I have been back there many times since and it certainly was not a pleasant sight.</P>
      <P>What we are witnessing in Eastern Europe today is, I believe, the end of Stalinism and not necessarily the end of communism.  Nevertheless, it is a very welcome change and a change which we in the West must encourage and help in every possible way.  Gorbachev is already one of the most remarkable leaders of his time.  If he succeeds &mdash; and there is no guarantee yet that he will &mdash; he will be ranked among the great leaders of all time.  If he fails &mdash; and there are millions out there who would want him to fail &mdash; we will see a return to the Brezhnev doctrine at best and a military dictatorship in the Soviet Union at worst. That would end the process of democratisation in Eastern Europe, which could not only be a tragedy but which could also be a danger to world peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us rejoice, but not gloat, at what is happening.  The process is a huge climb down for communism or socialism, whatever they like to call it.  To gloat in their misery could endanger the process and thereby endanger peace itself.  Successful change will only be assured, I believe, if Gorbachev can put in the shops the goods which the people need, thus getting rid of the interminable queues and uncertainty about supplies of essentials, such as bread, butter and meat.  <i>Perestroika</i> must succeed.  So far, unfortunately, it is not succeeding.  It is in this respect that we <Col N="631" /> can help with western technology and generous western credit, both of which are so urgently needed for strengthening Soviet industry.  At present we in the West are prohibited by a body in Paris called COCOM and by the United States export control restrictions from supplying on security grounds thousands of items to the COMECON bloc, which they so urgently need for their industry.  Now is the time for the West in general, and for the United States in particular, to lift most of these restrictions, thus helping Gorbachev to get his economy moving and, in the process, making the world a better and safer place for all of us to live in, as well as providing a huge market for items such as information technology equipment, such as we can make here in Ireland but which presently we are not allowed to export for security reasons, because of COCOM restrictions and American extra-territorial legislation.</P>
    <P>The suffering of these countries at the hands of Hitler and Stalin, as well as their puppets, is something we cannot fully comprehend.  Now is the time for the West to extend the generous and magnanimous hand of help in a type of Marshall Plan to enable the eastern bloc countries to re-structure their economies. The easy credits and high technology products, plus western management expertise, can do for these able and well-educated but very suppressed people what western industry has been doing for the peoples of the West for a long time now.  Changing their lifestyles will be as important as their new-found freedoms in bringing stability and democracy to this part of Europe which has suffered so much for so long at the hands of so many tyrants and totalitarian regimes.</P>
    <P>Overseas, too, there will be some effects from the democratisation process. It will change their subversive activities overseas as well as discouraging the export of revolution by countries such as Cuba, Vietnam and China.  Russian withdrawal from Afghanistan and Cuban withdrawal from Angola is already evidence of this change.  Additionally, Mr. Gorbachev has made it known to his allies <Col N="632" /> that they can no longer count on his help, civil or military, if they embark on under-mining Governments, of whatever colour or creed.  Adventurism, it seems, is out.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves what effect this will have upon the European Community and what effect will it have on the COMECON bloc?  Already East Germany has very ready access to the markets of the Community &mdash; that is not fully realised.  So in that respect I do not think, as far as East Germany at any rate is concerned, it is going to have very much effect.  Inevitably, in order to help them, we will have to let others have easier access to our Community markets.</P>
    <P>But there is another concern which many of us have and that is the whole question of resources.  With the help that is required in the East, is there a danger that the resources being set aside to help the countries in the peripheral dis-advantaged areas of the West will be watered down?  Will the Federal Republic of Germany now feel more inclined to help its neighbours to the east than its partners to the west?  Personally, I have no great fears on that.  The sums, in any case, are so derisively small that I do not think it is going to affect the position.</P>
    <P>There is another issue of course, a burning issue, and that is how is it going to affect the whole balance of security and what will be the relevance of NATO and the Western European Union and the Warsaw Pact?  Are these bodies going to be less relevant or irrelevant?  Frankly, I believe they will be less relevant but not irrelevant.  Being less relevant means reduction of spending on armaments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  Military spending, of course, is at such levels that it astronomical.  For example, the United States alone has a military budget for 1988 of $300 billion; the spending by the Soviet Union, although it is hard to come by accurate figures, is probably slightly greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The saving on a reduction of military spending could be used for very useful purposes.  To clean up the environment, <Col N="633" /> for instance, would be a good start. Improve our medical research.  Help the Third World, especially Africa, also Cambodia and Bangladesh.  All these places in need could get help from the moneys being reduced from the awful spending we had an arms for such a long period of time.  We also need resources to replant the forests, to control erosion and desertification as well as flooding, which is regularly caused by deforestation, particularly in an area like Bangladesh. The deforestation of the hills in Nepal has caused huge problems, not only for Nepal but particularly for Bangladesh, where the silt washes down into the delta, blocking the water and flooding out 100 million people there.  The task is so enormous that it requires the resources of the developed countries of the West and in this eastern Europe could play a good part with western Europe.</P>
    <P>We particularly need research into alternative sources of energy.  The present situation that we have today is entirely unsatisfactory.  Most of our energy comes from fossil fuel, which is certainly damaging our environment.  In Europe a significant quantity of it is coming from nuclear energy, which holds the danger of doing damage to our environment. We have to get something that is both safer and cleaner.  That requires a considerable amount of research money. Perhaps nuclear fusion is the answer, but the moneys involved are huge.  We can also examine the prospects of getting energy from wind, waves, solar energy, geo-thermal energy and renewable sources of energy, such as very high yielding, high dry matter crops, and using bio-ethanol and so on to drive our cars and propel our power stations.  These are all measures that have to be undertaken as a matter or urgency in order to protect the environment, which we are literally destroying.</P>
    <P>We in this generation, the generation before us, and the ones immediately after us, are enjoying a standard of living that we are not entitled to by using up the capital of carboniferous fuels that have built up over millions of years; we are using them up over a few hundred years <Col N="634" /> and in the process destroying, or at least seriously damaging, the environment.</P>
    <P>The other questions we have to ask ourselves are critical ones.  Will there be two Germanys?  Quite frankly, I do not care.  I would prefer to see two.  It seems from the polls carried out up to today in East Germany that the East Germans would prefer that there be two.  It is not clear how many of the West Germans would want to join their neighbour to the east.</P>
    <P>The other areas of contention will be how much latitude will the 15 different republics in the USSR be given?  Already there are outbreaks of hostilities in nine of the 15 republics between different nationalities.  This, in fact, could well prove to be Gorbachev's most difficult problem to reconcile &mdash; to reconcile the pent up hostilities which heretofore had been crushed by the power of the Soviet tanks.  With the withdrawal of these tanks and the arrival of <i>glasnost</i> old hatreds have come to surface too frequently. That would be regrettable; we should not gloat about it; we should try to spread oil on troubled waters and in so, far as we can to help our neighbours to the east to find the accommodation we found among ourselves in Western Europe &mdash; despite two bloody wars we have managed somehow to find a formula to live together. Let us pass that formula on to our neighbours in the East.  If Gorbachev succeeds today it will only be a matter of time until China, Cuba, Romania and Albania follow.  They have little choice, despite their present crushing of any form of demands for democracy.</P>
    <P>We are living in historic times.  History is unfolding at a frighteningly rapid pace before our eyes and the speed of change is danger in itself.  The outcome of these momentous events will affect not only the peace, freedom and prosperity of Europe, it will also influence events worldwide, now and in the future.  Our efforts in the West must be guided to facilitate democratisation, followed by disarmament and the transfer of military spending to the provision of food for the hungry, health for the sick, freedom for <Col N="635" /> the oppressed and safeguards for the environment now and in the future.</P>
    <P>There is no guarantee of success, but let it not be said of us that we stood idly by when the poor, the needy, the sick and the oppressed and the environment itself depended upon us to make some sacrifices for the betterment of all mankind. I believe the opportunity is presenting itself before our very eyes to make an historic contribution to the world and we should not pass it up.  As Shakespeare said, &ldquo;He and he alone has failed, who has not tried&rdquo;.  Let it not be said of us that we failed, that we let our brethren of the East down when they needed us.  A new dawn is breaking.  Let us wake up to avail of it and to make this little planet of ours a better and a safer and a healthier place for all of us now and for our children in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Right.  I support the motion but I deplore the contribution of Senator McCarthy, which brough certain echoes of another Senator McCarthy from the United States of America.  It would be very dangerous for us to engage in the kind of crude, ill-informed and ill-judged triumphalism that was evident in what Senator McCarthy had to say and I wish to dissociate myself totally from it. I would like instead to associate myself with the remarks of Senator Murphy when he indicated that what was being <Col N="636" /> dismantled was State monopoly socialism and not the ideals of the October Revolution of 1917, which was indeed a glorious vision and one in which the founders of this State would have no difficulty whatever in joining.</P>
      <P>I remember what the situation was like in the 1950s.  This was brought back clearly to my mind when I was in Hungary in March of this year and I saw some of the early demonstrations on their national day in March.  I saw for the first time names that I recalled from 1956, the name of Imre Nagy, the name of Pal Maleter, names that were almost forbidden in Hungary for many years.  I remember with great emotion seeing those names because I remember when in 1956 the West, having encouraged and fomented revolt in the eastern bloc, did in fact stand idly by and left these people to become the victims of Soviet aggression.</P>
      <P>The most remarkable thing that has happened in this very extraordinary series of events is that there has been no attempt whatever to intervene from the forces of the Soviet Union.  We should pay a special tribute to the outstanding moral courage vision and leadership of the President of the Soviet Union, Comrade Gorbachev.  Without him none of this could have happened.  It is significant that this process is continuing, a process which is dangerous for him.  In contact after contact with the states of Hungary, Czechoslovakia and, most lately of all, in Bucharest, the Soviet leader has indicated and I quote his words:</P>
      <P>...the comparison of views and opinions, the exchange of work experience, help find ways to discover the humanitarian potential of socialism. The progress of each of the brotherly countries and the attractiveness of socialist ideas in the world depend on these.</P>
      <P>It is to his vision that we must pay tribute. I welcome the fact that there are calls today for the re-emergence of figures like Dubcek in Czechoslovakia.  I recall on my way back from that meeting in Budapest how our plane was diverted to Prague.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="637" /> There was a group of parliamentaries who had not mentioned the fact that at that period, during that week, Dubcek had applied for a visa to visit the fraternal meeting of the Communist Party in Italy and had been denied.  I went around that plane and, with the agreement of the Dutch, the Swedes and the Koreans, we sent from that plane to the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia a telegram of fraternal greetings and asking that the question of Mr. Dubcek should be looked at.</P>
    <P>I would like to make two points and then hand over to my two colleagues. There is a problem in the West, I believe, that is, that there has been no parallel critique of the standing of capitalism in the West.  We see intellectual honesty, rigorous inquiry &mdash; there has been no parallel.</P>
    <P>I will finish on one point.  We see countries surrounding and within the sphere of influence of the Soviet Union being encouraged to develop freedom of expression, free ideas and so on.  What do we see within the American sphere of ambience?  If you compare what is happening in Hungary, Czechoslovakia and so on with what is happening in Nicaragua, in El Salvador, in Kampuchea, there is a moral lesson for us.  I greatly wish that I had time to develop these arguments, but, in deference to my friends I will give them the remaining time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be ample opportunities, I expect, to talk about these issues for one reason or another on many occasions over the next few years. I would like to say one thing, and one thing only.  To suggest for one second <Col N="638" /> that the reemergence of democracy in eastern Europe has anything to do with the success or failure of socialism is a total myth and fabrication.  East Germany describes itself as the German Democratic Republic.  Nobody has suggested that that means the demise of the unlamented regime in East Germany is in any way a threat to democracy.  Just because people give themselves titles creates nothing.  Let us remember this: the one unanimous theme we have heard from the citizens of East Germany, from the citizens of Poland, is that whatever they want they do not want westernstyle capitalism.  Lech Walesa has said he does not want westernstyle capitalism.  Everybody, New Forum in East Germany and indeed the Protestant Churches in East Germany, have made it clear that they have no great time for western capitalism.</P>
      <P>Let nobody gloat.  We are entering a new and challenging era.  I, as one who has always stood on the left in politics, feel much happier with the future without the burden of sham socialism that has bestrode eastern Europe for 40 years to be used against my arguments.  I will stand on the basis of socialism on its merits, on its values and on its genuine humanitarian impulses.  I am very happy that humanitarian impulses are now widespread and that our society can argue and discuss on the basis of ideas.  As Senator Norris said, the one thing western society sadly lacks at present is the capacity to address itself honestly &mdash; evidenced, for instance, by its inability to understand the massacre of six priests by armed forces trained by what is supposed to be the greatest democracy in the world.</P>

      <P>I support the motion. Occasionally in a lifetime we see an amazing, historical event.  What we are witnessing daily is a whole series of events which are little short of miraculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="639" /> These happenings which we see nightly on our televisions are leading at least to two momentous, enormous events of greater significance on world politics than anything seen since the end of World War II.  I refer to the two things which I believe will happen.  One is the break-up of the Soviet power block and the other is the reunification of Germany.  Those are two momentous events with which we are going to have to come to terms.</P>
    <P>In reference to that, I would like to quote from a statement by Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the Bundestag on 16 November 1989, when he returned from Poland.  He said:</P>
    <P>Since the night of 9 November 1989 the state of the nation in a divided Germany has been radically changed. After more than 28 years the desire for freedom of our countrymen in East Berlin and in the German Democratic Republic has peacefully overcome the Wall and the fortifications that have kept us apart.</P>
    <P>Last weekend, after being separated for nearly three decades, the Germans celebrated their Wiedersehen, their kinship and their unity for all the world to see.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to three or four people who, I believe, brought this about.  One is Mikhail Gorbachev, without whom this could not happen.  But there were men before him who made us aware of what was happening in the Communist bloc, men such as Alexander Solzhenitsyn.  I would also like to pay a special tribute to that great man, Lech Walesa.  I will end with a quotation which is very apt.  It is from the leader column in <i>The Sunday Times</i> of 12 November 1989:</P>
    <P>There is a great opportunity here for the world to be a better place as it begins our third millennium: no more Cold War, no more nuclear balance of terror, no more fear of a third world war, the end of communist totalitarianism, the triumph of liberal <Col N="640" /> democracy.  But all major historical shifts are fraught with danger and, since we are talking about events on a 1789 scale, it is a sobering thought to remember, on this weekend of great hope and joy as the Berlin Wall is dismantled, that the French Revolution was followed by three years of increasing disintegration, two years of terror and 20 years of war.  It is the supreme task of today's political leaders to manager the forthcoming revolutions rather better.</P>
    <P>I hope that Ireland will be ready to play its part.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say, first, that I heard on my office monitor one of the most absurd speeches I have heard in this House in the past five or six years from Senator McCarthy.  It seems to me that to come out at this time with that sort of manic triumphalism is not only unhelpful but unrealistic.  It is just not the right time for those who have been part of the capitalist system for a long time to indulge in that sort of absurd and unrealistic triumphalism we heard from Senator McCarthy this evening.  It is wrong to say that it is all over, that Stalinism is over or that indeed communism is over &mdash; and there is a great distinction between the two.</P>
      <P>I am old enough to remember what happened in Czechoslovakia when Alexander Dubcek was trying to do exactly what the people of eastern Europe are doing at the moment.  Neither should we claim at this stage that we are in some way responsible for what is happening in eastern Europe.  It is no credit to the West that the forces of freedom are rising in eastern Europe; it is something which they are doing spontaneously and autonomously themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this motion asks that we encourage this democracy I think it is right that we should be aware that this is not a time to precipitate action on our part, It is a time for restraint, for encouragement but <Col N="641" /> for realising that the affairs of the east must not be interfered with.  While we may approve of what is happening, it would be unhelpful for us to make irresponsible statements of the sort that Senator McCarthy made here this evening.  While we acknowledge what is wrong in the east, what has been wrong and all the evils that have happened not only in that society but in this society, we should recognise that we ourselves can learn from some of the good things in the east which are now emerging to the gaze of the western media.  For many years we have been told about but have been unaware of some of the great benefits in the east &mdash; in relation to housing, employment, jobs and the lack of the sort of poverty which we appear to see in the west.  If this trend in the east continues it should teach us a lesson about looking at ourselves as well and saying that what is happening in our society, with a certain amount of introspection, is no better and no worse than what is happening there and that maybe they are advantaged by what is happening and that they will turn out in the end to have a greater, a better and a more humane society than ours.</P>

      <P>The events of recent days have rightly been described as momentous.  Indeed, Senator O'Toole described them as revolutionary and his description is quite apt.  It is hardly eight months since the Soviet Union elected the new Congress of People's Deputies.  That election was not fully democratic, yet already the Soviet parliament has demonstrated that it has the potential for being an independent decision-making body determined to bring about radical changes in the way the Soviet Union is organised and governed.  During this time, we have seen Poland choose a non-communist government under Mr. Mazowiecki, while in Hungary the communist party has dissolved itself and preparations are under way for free parliamentary and <Col N="642" /> presidential elections.  In all these countries, political change is being accompanied by attempts to bring about a major restructuring of the economy, of the institutions of state and of society as a whole.</P>
      <P>Even more dramatic are the events we are witnessing in the German Democratic Republic, whose leadership had long resisted change.  Massive but peaceful agitation by its citizens eventually brought about the retirement of Mr. Honecker and his replacement as leader by Mr. Egon Krenz.  More importantly, it obliged the authorities to reopen the Berlin Wall, to allow new freedom to travel, to promise free elections and allow the formation of a coalition government under Mr. Hans Modrow.  There is still much to be done, but these events bring with them the hope that the GDR will, in the near future, transform itself into a democratic and pluralist state.</P>
      <P>The sudden alterations in a country that was up till now resistant to the idea of change give grounds for hope that those other countries that still lag behind must soon accept the need for reform. Already, the gathering momentum for change has affected Bulgaria.  Mr. Petur Mladenov, the new leader, has declared himself willing to accept reforms, albeit of a limited nature and within the existing institutional framework.</P>
      <P>There are signs too, of incipient change in Czechoslovakia as far as the freedom of its citizens to leave the country is concerned. Nevertheless, the widespread demonstrations in support of political reform show that these initial concessions are insufficient to meet the legitimate demands of the people of Czechoslovakia for further fundamental changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government fully welcome and encourage those developments which point towards increased democratisation in Eastern Europe.  We do this primarily because we believe that the ability freely to choose their Government and participate fully in the management of society will inevitably bring with it the <Col N="643" /> possibility for the citizens of these states to enjoy at last the basic human rights and fundamental freedoms which we in Ireland take for granted but which have been in large measure denied to them.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we recognise that recent events have an effect which transcends the borders of the countries concerned. They bring with them the prospect for a further decrease in international tension and for dispelling the residual mistrust that has for too long underlain relations on the European Continent.  They also bring a challenge to all European countries: how to manage the affairs of the new Europe that is taking shape.</P>
    <P>We believe that, in reacting to the changes that are now sweeping through Europe, we should maintain close contact and consultation with our partners in the European Community.  As the Taoiseach inferred in the Dáil, the heads of state and government of the Community welcomed, last Saturday, the moves toward economic and political liberalisation in Eastern Europe, and undertook to adopt the necessary policies to support the peoples of Eastern Europe in their efforts to achieve democratic freedom.  A number of proposals were made in this regard, and it was agreed that the Troika will study a proposal to establish a new international bank which would help in the restructuring and economic development of Eastern Europe; the Troika will report to the European Council in Strasbourg on 8 and 9 December.</P>
    <P>Already a year ago, at Rhodes, the European Council reaffirmed its determination to act with renewed hope to overcome the division of Europe and promote the values and principles which the Twelve have in common.  The Twelve undertook to strive to achieve full respect for CSCE provisions, promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms, progress in the arms control and disarmament field, and the development of <Col N="644" /> political dialogue with our Eastern neighbours. At Madrid in June, the heads of state and government reaffirmed the validity of this comprehensive approach, which integrates political, economic and co-operation elements, as well as their belief that progress in the fields I have mentioned remains a necessary element for further tangible results to materialise from the improved East-West relations.</P>
    <P>Because the pace of reform varies so much from country to country, and some countries continue to refuse to carry out moves to liberalise, the Twelve have adopted a policy of treating each country on a case by case basis.  They have, for instance, suspended negotiations for a further co-operation agreement with Romania on account of that country's human rights situation.  The Paris meeting decided that economic aid to Eastern European countries would be conditional on a return to democracy, respect for human rights and secret and free elections in the countries concerned.</P>
    <P>The Twelve recognise that the efforts being undertaken by many countries to restructure their economy will initially cause hardship to their population, and will require assistance from the world community if they are to achieve lasting results.  The European Commission was requested by the Summit of industrial nations held last July in Paris to co-ordiante world response to the requests for assistance received from Hungary and Poland.  In addition to the co-ordinating role of the Commission the Community has already made a substantial contribution of food aid to Poland, and will provide a budget line of 300m ECUs for assistance to these two countries in 1990. It is planned that a further 100m ECUs will be provided from the national budgets of the member states.  Ireland is making its contribution to this effort.  I am happy to say that the Estimates for 1990, published last week, make provision for a bilateral contribution of IR£650,000 for assistance to Poland and Hungary.  This is in addition to our share <Col N="645" /> of the assistance provided by the Community as such.</P>
    <P>The Community is also expanding its relations with a number of countries of Eastern Europe.  Following the joint declaration between the Community and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA), a number of East European countries have accredited representatives to the Community.  Both Poland and Hungary have signed co-operation agreements with the Community, and negotiations are at present under way to conclude a co-operation agreement with the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>In the political field, too, the Twelve are increasing their links with the more progressive East European countries. The Twelve Foreign Ministers of the Community met Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze at the General Assembly earlier this year.  Meetings have also taken place between the Presidency and the Foreign Ministers of Hungary and Poland, as well as with Yugoslavia.  It is the intention of the Twelve to build upon the results of these meetings and further develop relations in appropriate ways in the future.</P>
    <P>The Twelve are convinced that the CSCE process provides the appropriate framework for achieving greater progress in East-West relations.  Ireland has always attached great importance to the conference on security and co-operation in Europe (CSCE), which is the forum in which all European countries &mdash; except Albania &mdash; are represented and in which the wide spectrum of relations between them can be negotiated.  We warmly welcomed the adoption in January this year of a substantial and balanced closing document to the Vienna CSCE follow-up meeting.  This reaffirmed the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act and other CSCE documents, and also contained important new commitments in the fields of human rights, human contacts and security.  We are firmly of the view that all obligations assumed in the CSCE must be implemented fully and are <Col N="646" /> essential for full and fruitful co-operation between the countries of Europe.</P>
    <P>One of the most important aspects of the Vienna Concluding Document (VCD) is the human dimension mechanism which enables participating states to monitor the implementation of the human rights provisions of the CSCE, and to raise with other states instances where they believe commitments in this field are not being observed.  Already, the mechanism has been invoked by many states, including the Twelve, and has proved its value as a means of bringing about dialogue on human rights matters with other participating states.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the record of implementation of the human rights provisions remains uneven.  Many East European states have shown a dramatic improvement in the degree to which individual rights are fully respected in practice, yet in many others further progress is necessary.  In some, little or no improvement can be detected.  The Government have already had occasion to express their grave concern at the continued violations of human rights that occur in Romania, as well as of the treatment that, since May, has led over 300,000 Bulgarian Turks to leave their country and seek refuge in Turkey.  The Czech authorities continue to treat their dissidents harshly, despite the example being set by neighbouring countries.</P>
    <P>As referred to by Senator Raftery in his very thoughtful and considered contribution we are all uncomfortably aware that Europe is the scene of the highest concentration of conventional armed forces in the world.  The vast majority of these are deployed by the opposing military alliances.  Any developments which serve to create an atmosphere conducive to the reduction of these forces are to be welcomed.  At present, in Vienna, talks are taking place in the framework of the CSCE aimed at the establishment of a stable and secure balance of conventional armed forces in Europe at lower levels (CAFE).  The <Col N="647" /> participants in this negotiation are the members of NATO and the parties to the Warsaw Treaty, those states which have the largest concentrations of military forces and equipment.  I am glad to say that these talks, of whose progress we are regularly informed, are going ahead rapidly and there is reason to believe they will conclude ahead of schedule next year with the adoption of a significant agreement. I share Senator Raftery's concern that the cost of this armament could be put to much better use.</P>
    <P>All CSCE member states participate in the second set of negotiations at present taking place in Vienna, the negotiations on confidence and security-building measures (CSBMS).  Already, in Stockholm, the participating states in the CSCE agreed on a number of measures to enhance confidence and security in Europe.  The Vienna talks are intended to build on the results of Stockholm, and it is our hope that they should go further and elaborate additional measures aimed at increasing confidence and security. Discussions are proceeding satisfactorily at the CSBM talks, and it is intended that agreement will be reached before the next CSCE follow-up meeting opens in Helsinki in March 1992.</P>
    <P>The developments I have described in Eastern Europe would not have been possible without the major reappraisal of Soviet foreign policy which has occurred under President Gorbachev.  He has expounded this on numerous occasions, notably to the United Nations General Assembly last December and, more recently, to the Council of Europe in Strasbourg.  Major features of this &ldquo;new policy&rdquo; are the removal of ideology as the motive force of foreign policy and emphasis on the role of international law as the framework within which relations between states must be conducted.  This latter is, of course, a principle which we and our partners in the Twelve have always regarded as central to the maintenance of normal relations.  This new <Col N="648" /> approach by the Soviet Union has had, as one of its most important results, the abandonment of the &ldquo;Brezhnev Doctrine&rdquo; by which the USSR arrogated to itself the right to intervene by force if necessary in the affairs of its allies.  This point was referred to by quite a number of Senators in their contributions.  It was this doctrine which stifled the attempts to introduce reform in Czechoslovakia in 1968.  Had it still been in force today, it is certain that the events we are now witnessing could not have occurred.  This was also a point that was made by very many Senators in their contributions.</P>
    <P>We look forward to a further significant improvement of the good atmosphere that at present exists in East-West relations.  The forthcoming meeting between President Bush and President Gorbachev will, we hope, serve to reinforce the links between the two super-powers and help to strengthen international security.  We believe this will set the scene for the rapid conclusion of a number of negotiations in the arms control field.</P>
    <P>Successive Irish Governments have sought a halt to the nuclear arms race and the eventual abolition of all nuclear weapons.  We are encouraged by reports that negotiations in Geneva are making progress towards their objective of a 50 per cent reduction in the number of strategic missiles.  The effects of such a cut would be felt most immediately in Europe, the area of greatest military confrontation in the world.</P>
    <P>I can sympathise and concur with most of what Senator McDonald said in his very sincere and detailed speech, in particular with his hope that the Community should not miss this great opportunity to cement the hopes of the founding fathers of the Community.  I noted Senator Conroy's analysis of contemporary Europe and his look into what the future holds, his hopes and fears for and about the USSR and, indeed, Eastern Europe and the effects its future direction will have on not only Europe but on the rest of <Col N="649" /> the world, a point also touched upon by Senator Murphy in his very thought-provoking contribution.</P>
    <P>German reunification was mentioned by a number of Senators.  In my view, this is a matter for the two Germanies and is best left to the free choice of the German people.</P>

      <P>Senator Jackman spoke of freedom and questioned what it means, a point also raised by senator Murphy.  I cannot in the scope of this very limited debate answer Senator Jackman's question.  However, my own view is that the greatest freedom is that of life itself. Another is the choice to elect a government from a free choice of parties and candidates, freedom to comment on politicians and policies.</P>
      <P>Senator McCarthy's contribution gave us the benefit of his experience of travelling in Eastern Europe.  It was, to say the least, controversial and the response was predictible.  But tonight, as mentioned by Senators Ryan and Ross, is not the time to go into the rights and wrongs of various political ideologies or systems. There are faults in all systems and while that is so I would prefer to live under the system we have in Ireland and other democratic countries.</P>
      <P>Senator Staunton said it would be desirable to establish resident and diplomatic missions in a number of countries which are at present moving towards democracy.  As Senators are aware, our network of resident democratic representation is small and, unfortunately, must remain so for the future, given our limited financial and personnel resources. Possibilities for its extension are examined periodically in the light of our national interests and the availability of the necessary resources.  I can assure Senators that when the question is next being reviewed due weight will be given to the points which have been made in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="650" /> The Government are in full agreement with the terms of the motion before this House.  We warmly welcome the events of recent months which have brought many countries in Eastern Europe nearer to democracy and full respect for human rights.  We recognise that there is still much to be done before all the aspirations of their citizens are fully realised and that, as many Senators have noted, the support and encouragement of all the European democracies is vital at this stage.  We are determined to play our part, both individually and as a member of the Community, and we will make full use of our coming Presidency of the Twelve to ensure that they can play a positive and full role in supporting change in Eastern Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>May I thank the Minister for a very comprehensive and very full reply to the terms of the debate?  I do not think anybody in this House on any side, even though there were fairly sharp differences of opinion expressed this evening, could disagree with the general thrust of Government policy on this matter or on the need to follow along the lines which he outlined.  In particular the Minister's emphasis on a country by country, case by case approach is the right approach at this stage.  It is very easy for us, on the edge of Western Europe, to think in terms of Eastern Europe as one solid homogenous bloc.  In fact, it is a rich tapestry of different countries, different traditions and different systems even if they were all within one particular overall framework.  It is important that we do not have any simplistic views as to how the unfolding events in Eastern Europe are to be approached.  I do not think any of us would think we have any sort of simplistic solution or panacea to offer because we are at the early stages of a process.  Ten or 15 years ago if the events we are seeing today in Eastern Europe had happened the streets would probably be full of people rejoicing, the churches would be full, Te Deums would be sung, <Col N="651" /> there would be High Masses, there would be triumphalist sermons and so forth because what is happening is something which very few people thought they would see in their lifetime.  If these events had happened ten years go people would have been right to rejoice and celebrate because the regimes in Eastern Europe were and in most cases still are repressive, inefficient regimes which do not allow participation by their citizens, which in many cases deny them basic fundamental human rights.</P>
      <P>It is very important at this stage that we do not allow a rewriting of history by people with a left-wing view of politics. There was some of that here this evening and there has been some of it in recent times.  I do not want to be controversial this evening but I certainly have to look a little awry at some of the statements coming from The Workers' Party.  It is very difficult to question anything The Workers' Party say without inviting a torrent of personal abuse and invective. That has been my experience over the past number of years when I asked the sort of questions I would ask of Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats, or the Labour Party: the answer has always been abusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find the stance of The Workers' Party at the moment particularly intriguing.  Up to a few short months ago many of the regimes in eastern Europe, and particularly that of East Germany, were held up to us as an example of how society should be structured and could be run.  I did not hear one single voice from The Workers' Party in the years before the present upheaval suggesting that all was not well in East Germany, suggesting that major changes should or could be made or saying that reform was necessary.  Now every time I turn on my radio or television The Workers' Party are there rejoicing in the advent of democracy in eastern Europe.  There is a very serious question of credibility involved in all of this.  I <Col N="652" /> know it will not be addressed but I would like to put it on the record.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an easy question to put on record when there is not a representative of The Workers' Party in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confident that what I will say will be reported and will be back in the Politburo, perhaps before the debate is over, but maybe I am over-emphasing the importance of this House in the general scheme of things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not my purpose this evening to comment in detail on what the Minister has said.  He has given us a very comprehensive and very satisfactory reply this evening.  I certainly will not employ the invective used by Senator McCarthy on the back row over here but I do think some of the attacks were unfair.  Senator McCarthy may have been excessive.  I am certain he invited some of the attacks which came fast and furious from my learned colleagues on the back row but the fact is he was talking about regimes which are failed regimes.  Most of the eastern European countries are, to quote a well used phrase, failed political entities. They are failed political entities, they do not involve their people in the decision making process, they have not provided free elections, they do not have free, open parliaments.  They are failed economic entities and they are regimes which have relied to a great extent on repression of one form or another.  That is a fact.  For people to attack Senator McCarthy for saying that, however colourfully or excessively, is to fly in the face of facts, in the face of history.  We do not have to look back too far to the Prague summer, to the bread riots in East Germany in 1964, to Hungary, to see very clearly and very starkly the type of regimes, which existed.  There was a very strong view expressed by Mr. Honecker only a few short weeks ago, if we understand things correctly that perhaps the tactics in Tiananmen Square might well <Col N="653" /> be used in East Germany.  It was the old way and there are those in positions of power and influence who believe it may yet be the best way.  We should not be naive about this.</P>
    <P>We should not rush in to believing that all has changed.  There are people in positions of power and influence in the countries we are talking about this evening who almost certainly believe that the old way is the best way and so we have to tread very cautiously in all of this. I would say to those who came in to attack Senator McCarthy that there was a strong core of truth in what he was saying, however excessively he said it, however much he set out to provoke, which he did, those of a very different point of view.</P>
    <P>Like the Minister, I think there is not much point in talking about that at this stage.  We are into a completely new phase and as a country we have a small role to play.  We cannot be triumphalistic, we did not do anything to bring it about but we are now at a stage, with the Presidency of the European Community pending where, with imagination, our Government can provide guidelines, steer other countries into policies which will as far as possible, encourage the emerging democracies, if that is what is there, in the eastern European countries. Perhaps we are in a stronger position than most to do that because as a country which itself has suffered from division we can perhaps see more clearly than most through some of the myths.  I hope we can be in a position to provide a truthful and honest guide to the emerging events in eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>I am glad this Seanad opened with a debate on the exciting historic events in eastern Europe.  With the constant supply of television programmes sometimes it is difficult to distinguish between what is truly historic and what is merely ephemeral. What we are seeing is truly historic. We are at the beginning of a process and it can go any way.  We could very well see the reassertion of hard-line control, we <Col N="654" /> could see the Honeckers re-emerging. There is no sense of the inevitable about where we are, there is no way we can be certain that the good guys are going to win at the end.  We do not have the answers.  We probably do not have a huge amount of knowledge at this stage of what is happening but I believe we will have a small but significant opportunity during our Presidency of the European Community at least to try to guide the process in a way which will prove fruitful for all of us, all Europeans, all citizens of the world, at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>I believe this debate here this evening in its own small way will have started that process of debate in Ireland and I hope, in spite of some of the excessive language on both sides this evening, it will be a debate that can be conducted without too much ideological baggage on either side, a debate which will be motivated by common sense and by our common desire, as Europeans, to see a greater, bigger, more inter-active Europe of which we can all be part.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>Before we go on to the next business, may I thank the Minister for his attendance at this debate and for his excellent contribution.  The Seanad has started on a high note in terms of a debate on foreign affairs issues which are of current importance.  Even though excessive or colourful language, or language that people might not like, has been used in this debate it was excellent. I sincerely hope we will continue during this session to advert to topical matters.</P>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for his suggestion that instead of dragging out a debate of importance over three or four weeks perhaps we should tighten up our procedures and have a three-hour debate on a motion such as this on the day.  It is a suggestion the House can take on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be worth while to begin by stating the problem since I did decide to raise the issue on the Adjournment.  No matter how colourfully I describe the roads of Cavan, no matter what extremes of language I seek to so describe them, I will not in any sense convey properly the conditions of those roads.  Most of the county roads of Cavan at the moment, as those who travel those roads will know, are covered with craters and potholes.  The best way I could describe them is as being akin to the Tibetan passes of India.  There is major subsidence of the roads.  The potholes on the roads are so big they are a safe refuge at the moment for perch and pike.  I often wonder if there would not be a case for a rod licence to be applied to the roads of Cavan, they are in such a horrendous condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is so grevious that the school buses can barely travel on some of the roads and their drivers have refused to travel on others.  The public health nurses, ambulance crews and general practitioners are refusing to travel many of the roads.  The quality of life of the people at the backs of the hills and on the by-roads and county roads of Cavan is diminished beyond measure.  It is impossible to drive a car safely for any distance on them.  The hardships to the <Col N="656" /> local people there is immense and I am in no sense overstating the problem.</P>
    <P>The difficulty has been contributed to by a number of factors.  County Cavan is a drumlin county and has a difficult topography.  It also has a very large food processing sector.  In the county of Cavan there is a quarter of a million pigs in pig units.  There are large milk plants at Killeshandra and Baileborough.  Cavan has a very high county road mileage &mdash; 1,500 miles.  It has no railways and no airstrips.  Traffic going to Greenore and Larne must travel through County Cavan.  The county caters for extremely high volume of traffic and, as is the case throughout the country, there has been a major increase in heavy traffic and cars on these roads in recent years.  The situation is grevious beyond measure.  So much so, that some local residents decided at a recent meeting to block their road for a few hours a day as a form of protest.  There have been meetings throughout the county in community centres and halls.  A road action committee is in existence in the county and has held public meetings throughout the county.  I find it necessary to inform the House of how serious the problem is, how seriously the people perceive the problem to be and how terrible an imposition the condition of the roads are on the lives of decent tax-paying people.</P>
    <P>A recent technical report from engineers was presented to the estimates meeting of Cavan County Council, which unanimously refused to pass or even debate the Estimates on the grounds that we could not proceed to discuss estimates considering the conditions in which the people are living.  At the last meeting it was established that, of the 270 miles of main roads, 23 are suitable for modern traffic &mdash; those are not my words, they are the words of the professional experts. Of the 1,500 miles of county roads, and I quote: &ldquo;Many of these miles are impassable&rdquo;. The problem there is tremendous.</P>
    <P>Last year we were able, from our rate <Col N="657" /> support grant and local revenue, to allocate £187,000 for maintenance of county roads.  It was proposed in the estimates this year that £202,000 be allocated in the coming year for maintenance of the county roads.  Last year we got £740,000 from central funds.  It is the opinion of the professional engineers, consulting engineers and lay and professional people throughout County Cavan that there is need for a programme of county road improvement.</P>
    <P>Under that programme a minimum of £7 million would be necessary this year and another £7 million next year to put the roads in any kind of working condition. Obviously I do not have to point out to the House that each year the roads proceed to deteriorate more.  I propose to conclude on the next point and to allow the next speaker to contribute.  With your indulgence, we would like to give the last two minutes to Senator Ó Foighil.</P>
    <P>Our tourist industry, which is central to the local economy in County Cavan, is suffering because of the condition of the roads.  Volumes of letter have been sent to the editors of local newspapers from returned emigrants complaining about the condition of the roads.  Our food processing sector, which is central to our economy, is in jeopardy because of a failure of heavy vehicles to get in and out expeditiouly to those locations.  Our agricultural industry in general is suffering and, most importantly, the social and cultural lives of the people is in shreds because of the situation.  It is now incumbent on the Government to rush through a vastly increased allocation of money, way above the rumoured allocations, for the upkeep of these roads and that is my contention to the House.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator O'Reilly's description of the roads in <Col N="658" /> Cavan.  I would also like to air the views of the people of Monaghan regarding the state of the roads in that county.  The county roads of Monaghan are in a very bad state.  They have deteriorated over the last seven or eight years.  In 1976 and 1977 we got only £8 million for our main and county roads and in 1978 we got £15 million.  That is when the trouble began, because there was not enough money being provided for main and county roads.  This is a very serious problem. The roads in County Monaghan were not built to carry the type of traffic they are now carrying.  They were built many years ago to accommodate much lighter traffic.  Railways were provided in the county then but now the roads carry all the freight in and out of the county.  The drumlin type soil of the county roads cannot stand up to the heavy traffic they are carrying.  The county roads were built years ago for horses and carts but now milk tankers, oil tankers, meal transport, all developments that took place in the last two decades in the farming community, are using them.  That transport goes in and out to the farms and different towns.  I appeal to the Government to provide extra money for the county roads which are the big problem in Monaghan.</P>
      <P>I would like to pay special tribute to the Minister and congratulate him.  In 1988 some £47 million was provided for main and county roads and in 1989 some £60 million is being provided.  We are going in the right direction but more money needs to be provided for the main and county roads.  I am very happy with, and welcome the substantial increase &mdash; a staggering figure of £60 million &mdash; being provided in the present year.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Harney, and thank her.</P>

      <P>Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil aon deis againn an tseachtain seo comhghairdeas a dhéanamh le duine ar bith.  Táimid ag caint anois faoi bhóithre na tíre seo.  Tá Seanadóirí eile tar éis bheith ag caint faoi bhóithre atá ann. <Col N="659" /> Táimse a dhul a chaint faoi bhóithre a bhí ann agus nach bhfuil ann anois.  Tá siad imithe scon scan ón tír.  Shiúil muid uilig sa Teach seo an tír nuair a bhíomar ag dul thart ag iarraidh vótaí a chruinniú le haghaidh an tSeanaid.  Cuirfidh mé geall le haon Seanadóir nach raibh aon áit níos measa ar aon bhealach ná na bóithre thiar i gConamara agus baineann sé seo leis an gCabhán agus le Muineachán. Toghcheantair na hEorpa a bhfuilimid ag caint futhu anois, agus is cuid de thoghcheantar na hEorpa Conamara.</P>
      <P>Tá an scéal chomh dona sin ag an nóiméad seo go mbeidh máirseáil mhór agóide ag muintir Chonamara Dé Luain seo chughainn ag déanamh ar oifigí Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe, áit a mbeidh rún á phlé ag na comhairleoirí contae ag iarraidh ar an chomhairle chontae na bóithre a thréigean.  Is í an chiall atá leis an bhfocal &ldquo;tréigean&rdquo; i mBéarla ná &ldquo;abandon&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;éirí as&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Tá an chomhairle chontae tar éis a rá linne, agus tá sé ráite leis na Seanadóirí go léir i ngach contae, nach bhfuil dóthain airgid ann le caoi cheart a chur ar na bóithre.  Tá ráiteas déanta ag Príomhinnealtóir Chontae na Gaillimhe a rá ag an nóiméad seo go dteastóidh £15 mhilliúin tirim maidin amárach le caoi éicint a chur ar bhóithre Chonamara.  Má cheaptar gur flaithiúlacht é, mar a dúradh nóiméad ó shin, go bhfuil an Rialtas i mbliana ag dul ag cur £20 milliún sa bhreis ar fáil don tír ar fad, má roinneann tú é sin idir sé chontae is fiche, nó seacht gcontae is fiche má chuireann tú dhá chomhairle chontae Thiobraid Árann san áireamh, feicfidh tú nach mbeidh le le fáil ag aon chontae ach thart ar £600,000 sa bhreis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I nGaillimh tá deich gcinn de cheantracha innealtóireachta agus, má roinneann tú é sin ar an deich, beidh suas le trí scór míle punt le fáil ag gach ceantar. Ag an nóiméad seo tá bóthar beag amháin i gConamara atá titithe as a chéile go hiomlán agus chosnódh sé £60,000 le caoi a chur air.  Mar sin, as an airgead <Col N="660" /> breise go léir a bhfuil an Rialtas ag caint faoina chur ar fáil, an méid a bheas le fáil i gContae na Gaillimhe, ní chuirfidh sé caoi ach ar bhóthar bheag amháin ceithre mhíle ar fhad, mar go bhfuil sé titithe agus imithe as a chéile.</P>
    <P>Léiríonn sé sin, dar liomsa, cé chomh dona agus cé chomh huafásach is atá ceist na mbóithre.  Tá mé ag tacú leis an méid a dúirt an Seanadóir O'Reilly, go bhfuil sé thar am go ndéanfadh an Rialtas beart de réir an ghéarghá atá ann, agus airgead thar na bearta a chur ar fáil i mbliana; mar na bóithre nach ndéanfar i mbliana ní bheidh siad ann le déanamh an chéad bhliain eile.</P>
    <P>Is ag dul in olcas atá an scéal lá i ndiaidh lae.  Nach aisteach an rud é go bhfuil daoine thiar i gConamara lánsásta dul amach maidin amárach agus na sliogáiní bóthair, nó na potholes mar a thugtar orthu, a líonadh iad féin &mdash; tá cleachtadh maith agamsa bheith ag líonadh potholes freisin; chaith mé na blianta á ndéanamh &mdash; ach níl aon chead acu.  Tá an dlí chomh haisteach sin anois go bhfuilimid i sáinn chomh maith le chuile shórt eile.  Tá sé ar nós an mhadra sa mháinséar, the dog in the manger.  Ní féidir leis an chomhairle chontae iad a dhéanamh.  Ní thabharfaidh an Rialtas an t-airgead dóibh chun iad a dhéanamh.  Ní ligfidh an chomhairle chontae do mhuintir na háite iad a dhéanamh iad féin, atá sásta iad a dhéanamh. An té a déarfas liomsa nach bhfuil crisis ann ó thaobh bhóithre na hÉireann agus bóithre chontaetha na hÉireann de, tá dul amú mór air.</P>
    <P>Cén fáth go bhfuil sé tagaithe chomh dona sin, go gcaithfidh rún bheith os comhair Chomhairle Contae na Gaillimhe Dé Luain seo chugainn ag iarraidh ar a gcomhairleoirí bóithre Chonamara a thréigean &mdash; to abandon roads in Conamara. Céard a chiallaíonn an rún sin má théann sé tríd?  Tiocfaidh sé suas anseo go dtí an tAire Comhshaoil agus caithfidh seisean fiosrú áitiúil a chur ar bun le míniú iomlán a thabhairt ar an bhfáth a bhfuil an beart seo á dhéanamh acu.</P>
    <P>Níl an scéal go maith.  Tá sé léirithe <Col N="661" /> anseo anocht cé chomh dona is atá sé.  Is deas liomsa deis a bheith agam cúnamh a thabhairt don éacht atá déanta anocht ó thaobh bhóithre an Chabháin agus Mhuineacháin de.  Dá seasfadh chuile dhuine de na Seanadóirí suas anseo anocht bheadh an rud céanna le rá ag gach duine acu faoi gach contae lena mbaineann siad.  Mar sin, tá sé thar am rud a dhéanamh.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh an scéal le fáil ag an Aire anocht ón gcruinniú seo, agus mura mbeidh, beidh scéal le cloisteáil aige agus le feiceáil aige ar Theilifís Éireann Dé Luain seo chugainn.</P>

      <P>I note the Adjournment matter concerns itself with funding for Cavan County Council. I did not know the council had responsibility for Connemara.  Senators were a little wide in their interpretation of the Adjournment matter.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Reilly began by telling us that he was not going to be colourful; he then went on to compare the roads in Cavan to the Tibetan passes into India.  I do not know if the Senator has been to India but if he has I do not think in fairness he could compare the roads in Cavan &mdash; on which I travelled recently &mdash; with what are called roads or passes in India.  We have to have a sense of proportion and not over-exaggerate in these matters.</P>
      <P>As the Senator knows, the primary responsibility for the funding of works on non-national roads, including county roads, rests with individual local authorities. Traditionally, work on these roads was financed from local resources, with limited State road grant assistance. However, because of the concern about the deterioration to the network of county roads, significantly enhanced levels of road grants have been provided in the past few years to supplement local authority expenditure on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment has already announced that the Government <Col N="662" /> have embarked on a three-year programme involving discretionary grants totalling £150 million for the improvement and maintenance of county and regional roads.  Grants totalling £47.4 million have been allocated for this purpose in 1989.  This compares with £33.4 million for similar works in 1988 and £14.5 million in 1985.  The 1989 discretionary road grant allocations notified to Cavan County Council for regional and county roads amount to £1.528 million, which represent, an increase of £319,000 or 26 per cent on the grant payments made under equivalent headings in 1988. That is almost two and a half times the level of the grant payments in 1985.</P>
    <P>The 1989 grant was provided on the following basis: block grant for maintenance work, £252,000; block grant for improvement work, £1.119 million and the European Community Western Package for local roads, £157,000.  The discretionary grants are allocated in proportion to the mileage of non-national roads in each county.  Cavan County Council were allocated their fair share of available resources in 1989.  The conditions governing expenditure of the grants were changed in 1989 to give more discretion to county councils and to allow more funds to be spent on surplus restoration. Local authorities may spend up to half their block grant for road improvements on this type of work in 1989.</P>
    <P>The funds available for road grants in 1989 were allocated in full to local authorities earlier this year and there are now no additional resources available which would allow extra road grants to be given to Cavan County Council, or, indeed, to any other local authority in 1989.  The Minister for the Environment has allocated a rate support grant of £3.78 million to Cavan County Council for 1990 and this has now been notified to the council. The rate support grant for 1990 represents an increase of 3.5 per cent over the 1989 grant.  The rate support grant for Cavan County Council has been adjusted on a number of occasions in recent years <Col N="663" /> in respect of the elimination of local authority financial responsibility for contributions towards supplementary welfare allowances, county committees of agriculture, loan charges written off under the local loans fund and in respect of rates payable by the ESB to the council.</P>
    <P>A road grant provision for 1990 has now been determined and the Minister for the Environment will shortly be announcing the allocations available to <Col N="664" /> the local authorities.  I understand he intends to do this within the next week. As recently announced, increased funding is being provided for roads in 1990 and Senator O'Reilly and the other Senators can be assured that Cavan County Council will be allocated its share of the additional funds.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday 23 November 1989.</P>
