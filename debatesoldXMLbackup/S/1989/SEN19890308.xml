      <P>I have notice from Senator Gerry Reynolds that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in view of the joint statement following a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference to state what steps are being taken to proceed with the restoration of the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore canal.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator John Connor of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Tourism and Transport to confirm that no obstacles will be placed in the way of the proposed flights originating in New York, via Reykjavik, and landing at Connaught Regional Airport, Charlestown, County Mayo.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Philip Hogan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to intervene immediately with the Revenue Commissioners so that the ban on the postal stamping services can be lifted forthwith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator <Col N="418" /> Katharine Bulbulia of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to recognise the grave situation facing the Waterford Teachers' Centre which may have to close if sanction cannot be given for a full-time director with adequate remuneration.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Tony McKenna of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for CIE Iarnród Éireann to provide a proper rail service for the people of the greater part of North Tipperary and surrounding area.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Reynolds, Connor, Hogan and Bulbulia as suitable for discussion.  I have selected the matter raised by Senator Reynolds and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Connor, Hogan and Bulbulia may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret I have to rule that the matter raised by Senator McKenna is not suitable for discussion on the ground of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>
    <P>Before I call the Leader of the House I want to make a brief statement on the division bells.  Last Wednesday, Senator Cregan, the Fine Gael Whip, reported to me that he had missed a vote because the bells were not working on the fifth floor of the five storey office block.  I want to assure Senator Cregan, and indeed all colleagues, that the bells are now in working order.  I also want to thank Senator Cregan for bringing this matter to my attention so promptly and I regret he missed that vote in the circumstances through no fault of his own.</P>

      <P>It is intended to take Items Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 today.  We will take Item No. 4 from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I am glad you have sorted out the matter of the division bells. As I understand it, the bells were turned off without any consultation with this <Col N="419" /> House.  We all shared in the embarrassment caused to Senator Cregan who is a most conscientious Senator and would never miss a vote if that were at all possible.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, may I express the revulsion of my party at the massacre at Coagh yesterday.  It makes the protestations of Mr. Gerry Adams and Sinn Féin ring very hollow indeed and I would like to express our sense of outrage at this gunning down of people yesterday.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, may I also express the annoyance of this party at the fact that once again this week it is only a one-day sitting.  We were told on the Order of Business last week that there would be work for two days this week but we now find that the House will not be sitting tomorrow.  There are very many items on the Order Paper which could well be taken, in particular Item No. 25, in the name of the Leas-Chathaoirleach, on the ozone layer.</P>
      <P>It was very difficult to us to look at the weekend at the prancing around of Mrs. Thatcher, a born-again environmentalist, when we see what she has done to the Irish Sea, to the North Sea, acid rain and so forth, while in this House we have a motion on the Order Paper for over a year which would give some indication of our Government's willingness to act on this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that you allowed Senator Manning to express his revulsion at the killing of innocent people in County Tyrone and I am pleased you did that.  I would like to join with him in expressing total revulsion at the slaughter of people up there.  That is really doing nothing for this nation; it is setting us back light years as equal partners in <Col N="420" /> Europe.  I think that every reasonable person in the country has got to stand up at every opportunity and protest about it.</P>

      <P>Senator McGowan and Senator Manning have been allowed to speak but really expressions of sympathy should not be allowed on the Order of Business.  Under the Standing Orders of this House it is the Leader of the House who should move votes of sympathy but both of you have done it now, anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly will do my best &mdash; no doubt I will be guided by yourself &mdash; not to stray out of order.  Perhaps the Leader of the House could be urged, when he replies, to make some reference to this tragedy that has darkened the land.  I would certainly welcome an opportunity, if that could be provided, to make some suggestions which I made previously to the House that for this kind of crime the privilege of Irish citizenship should be removed from those convicted. However, I look forward to an appropriate opportunity to make that point in some greater detail.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he could give me some indication if there is an intention of taking Item No. 33 which deals with the conferring of honorary citizenship of Ireland on Raoul Wallenberg.  This is a matter that has considerable interest in this country.  I will be going to Budapest where Raoul Wallenberg disappeared and will be making this point there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Leader of the House for the information I received recently from him pertaining to Item No. 46 which has been most helpful to me.  I shall pass it on to the various industrial concerns that have contacted me expressing some anxiety in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is out of order, but I think it is appropriate on behalf of the Labour Party that I be identified with the expression of revulsion at what happened yesterday in the village of Coagh. It would be inappropriate if we did not associate ourselves with this condemnation and indeed the extending of sympathy to the families of the bereaved.</P>
      <P>May I also ask the Leader of the House to use his good offices when he is in touch with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Lenihan, who has an interest in this area, to express the condemnation that I am sure most people would feel here about the Israeli attack by a bulldozer yesterday on an UNWRA health centre.  This type of provocative violence by governments will have to stop particularly in the occupied territories.  This Government and this country help to support UNWRA which is a United Nations relief agency.</P>

      <P>Senator Ferris, I have an Order Paper in front of me and there is nothing about votes of sympathy or bulldozers on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to bulldoze my way through this either but I am asking the Leader of the House to use his great influence and interest in this area to express at least my regret and my condemnation of the Israelis for what they have done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>While joining the Senators who have expressed concern and regret at the horrible incident in Northern Ireland yesterday I would like to raise another matter with which this House has been concerned recently, the matter concerning a small country far distant from here, that is Tibet.  This House had a major and very constructive debate on the situation in Tibet.  In his contribution on that motion on 1 February the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Seán Calleary, made specific reference to the fact that the Irish Ambassador in Beijing would be monitoring events&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot have a long discussion on it.  Perhaps the Senator will ask the Leader of the House a question and let him reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to say that I think this is a matter on which the Seanad is on record as having expressed concern prior to the very serious events of the past few days.  Many of us foresaw the possibility of the kind of loss of life and serious outbreak of violence in Lhasa and the Minister of State in his contribution to the debate, said:</P>
      <P>Our Ambassador in Beijing will clearly monitor developments in Tibet and other parts of the territory of the People's Republic of China and report fully to us on them.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Leader of the House on behalf of the Seanad &mdash; not on behalf of one or two individual Senators because there was a very broad measure of agreement at the end of the debate &mdash; to contact the Minister for Foreign Affairs and ask whether our ambassador is monitoring in Tibet what is happening.  One of the great concerns is the closing-off of borders, the stopping of any reports out of Tibet&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to abuse the goodwill of the Cathaoirleach in this matter but I think it is important that the Leader of the House, on behalf of the Seanad, would ask the Minister of State for a report from our ambassador. One of the matters asked for was that Ireland would intervene in the United Nations on behalf of Tibet.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be of interest to the House to know that two countries, Canada and Holland, have intervened in the United Nations.  So far as I know, Ireland has not.  Notwithstanding the very <Col N="423" /> strong views expressed by Senators, we need to be assured that we are taking a strong stand on this matter.  I would appreciate it if the Leader of the House could make a formal representation to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same point, I do not intend to continue the debate but I will ask a direct question of the Leader of the House.  In the light of the events of the past month and in the light of the Seanad debate on Tibet, does he not accept that it was quite irresponsible of the Government party not to allow any of their members to participate in and contribute to that debate a month ago? At that time a decision by the Government to intervene might well have led to the saving of life in Tibet over the past week or so.  I think it was grossly irresponsible and I hope the Leader of the House will confirm that for me.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the Fine Gael Party in the House raised the question of the one-day sitting again this week.  This is the third week in a row that we have had a one-day sitting.  I should like to put it on record &mdash; and I should like to get the response of the Leader of the House &mdash; that as far as I am concerned the Government party's lack of ability to structure a programme of work for two days per week and to structure the business of the House in such a way that it would work for at least two days a week, shows gross incompetence.  It is an abrogation of responsibility and it is a gross waste of taxpayers money.  What brings this House into disrepute is politicians working one day a week when the country expects to see them working throughout the week.  I do not want to hear the stories about the work that is done outside the Chamber &mdash; we are well aware of that.  I am making the point that it is unacceptable for the Government party to have us work only one day per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also remind the Leader of the House that on a number of occasions he has given commitments that Thursday would be used as a way of clearing the <Col N="424" /> motions on the Order Paper.  He gave that commitment to me, to members of the Independent group, members of the Fine Gael group, to Senator McGowan on a number of occasions when he raised the issue and he has given it to many others.  I want to know how he can stand up here and blithely give commitments to us which are not fulfilled.  He has given absolute commitments to Senator Manning and to me &mdash; this is a fair question on the Order of Business &mdash; to deal with the report on libel.  He gave an absolute commitment to myself and to Senator Ryan that there would be a debate on the Middle East.  He gave a commitment to myself that following the debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>These are all on the Order Paper, every single one of them. He gave a commitment to myself that after the debate on Bord Telecom the report on the ESB, which is also on the Order Paper, would be debated.  Every single one of these is on the Order Paper and on each one of them I received a commitment from the Leader of the House.  We have now reached a stage where the commitment of the Leader of the House is something we cannot depend on.  This inability to structure work over two days a week in a way that will have the House working efficiently and effectively is not good enough.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we should give the Leader of the House an opportunity to reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In replying he will no doubt attribute to me words which I have not said, as he normally does in this situation. I will indicate those to you&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because you will be asking him to conclude and you will not allow me back in again &mdash; I am quite <Col N="425" /> aware of that.  Therefore, I ask you to allow me to make my point as I am on my feet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult because I do not have long experience in the House.  Finally, on the question of the motion on Tibet, we did agree to withdraw that motion on the basis that the Minister would take certain actions and would move in a certain direction. This he has failed to do.  Would the Leader of the House also agree with me on that point, that the Government have failed to act on their commitment to that particular point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the call by Senator Manning that the House would order Item No. 25.  The year 1987 was officially designated The Year of the Environment and towards the end of last year we tabled that motion to heighten the awareness of the damage being done through the destruction of the ozone layer.  It is a pity the EC have lagged behind states like the US in taking any action.  It is absolutely a fact that the EC had done nothing until the meeting was called in London last weekend, at which I was very happy to see our Government represented.  It is time that we should at least be aware of it and I hope the House will order an early debate on Item No. 25.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>During the last sitting of the Seanad I asked the Leader of the House if he was aware of the crisis in the bakery industry.  He assured me that he would have a discussion with the Minister for Industry and Commerce with a view to having a debate in this House on the matter.  I want to know the result of those discussions to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I call the Leader of the House to reply I want to say something to the whole Seanad because obviously Senators are not listening and do not know the rules and the Standing Orders.  I have been in the Seanad since 1977 and I do not remember a Cathaoirleach ever before having this kind of long discussion on the Order of Business or having to take the length of time it has taken me to clear the Order of Business. There was between all parties a Whip system under which Whips talked to each other and did not bring everything to the floor of the House.  I understand that everything that Senators say here is important but there was and is a system of participation in respect of the Order of Business outside the Chamber before we come into the House by which we settle what we will take for the day.  I wish we could go back to that again rather than have this long debate on items some of which are certainly on the Order Paper.  I wish there was more co-operation between the Whips before they come into the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>There was always an opportunity for Members on the Opposition side of the House to ask questions. The Cathaoirleach was often in the House when Fianna Fáil asked the same kind of questions and I had to answer from that side of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points have been made.  I did not realise when I was <Col N="427" /> speaking to Senator Cregan last week that the point the Senator was making was a valid one.  I thought that something had happened that I did not know about. In actual fact, something had happened that I did not know about; some people had taken it upon themselves to turn off the bells in certain rooms around the House.  I did say I did not think what he said was correct.  In the event, it was correct but there was nothing I could do about it.  However, we did go and find out what had gone wrong and somebody had turned off the bells.  As it happened, it did not make that much difference except that certain people might have been recorded as having been missing when they were around the House.</P>
      <P>On the question of one day sittings, I said last week that we would be sitting two days this week and that we had sufficient business.  In fact, through no fault of anybody else except myself, I decided a certain item would be taken tomorrow but as it turned out the matter cannot be taken tomorrow because of the absence of the Minister.  I take total responsibility for the fact that we are not sitting tomorrow but I did not realise the Minister was going to be absent.  The Whips got word about a particular item but, unfortunately, it had to be withdrawn.</P>
      <P>However, the business for the next few weeks is fairly heavy and there is absolutely no doubt that we will be sitting on two days each week.  We have the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill, Committee Stage; we have the Bord na gCapall (Dissolution) Bill, Second Stage; we have the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Bill, Second Stage; the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Bill, Committee Stage; the Jurisdiction of Courts (Maritime Conventions) Bill, 1988, Second Stage; and the Health Contributions (Yearly Reckonable Income) (Variation) Regulations, 1989, Item No. 11.  We will have the Social Welfare Bill in the week before Easter.  Senators can be assured they will be working in Holy Week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of points have been made on Item No. 25.  I accept it is a matter of grave importance, not alone to this <Col N="428" /> House but to everybody in the country and I can assure the House there will be an early debate on it.  I am surprised people have said it is on the Order Paper for over 12 months and that it has not come up.  The people who suggest that it has not come up in 12 months had every opportunity to bring it up themselves during that period because they could have put it on their order of priority and if they did that the matter would have been dealt with.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald said that nothing has been done by the Government in this area, that the Government had not been cognisant of the fact that the ozone layer has been damaged and that they have done nothing.  The Senator knows, as well as I do, that is not true and that the Government have made every effort over the past number of years and for the past two years in particular, to bring in environmental controls which are much stricter and more stringent than any environmental controls ever previously introduced.  The Senator knows that in a number of areas laws have been introduced which will ensure that people who are in industries which have a deleterious effect on the ozone layer will be dealt with in a manner in which they would not have been dealt with, prior to this Government coming into office.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris mentioned Item No. 33. There is no system in the country at present to confer honorary citizenship upon Raoul Wallenberg or anybody else. It is a matter that should be brought to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of both Houses and the CPP of both Houses should discuss it.</P>
    <P>The matter raised by Senator Ferris, the Israeli attack on UNWRA is something obviously that all of us in this House must condemn.  It is the United Nations agency which has been working with refugees since 1947.  It is disgraceful that a government should attack a hospital in the Jabilya Camp in Gaza City and, of course, we condemn it.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole and Senator Robinson mentioned the Tibetan debate.  Questions have been asked whether the Government have been monitoring what <Col N="429" /> has been happening in that area.  I can assure both Senators that the Government are monitoring that situation.  I will have to check to see if there were particular suggestions made by the Minister of State as to what the ambassador should be doing while checking the situation and also if there were specific questions that had to be answered.  However, I can guarantee that the Department of Foreign Affairs are cognisant of what is going on in that whole area.</P>

      <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil.  In accordance with Standing Order 82 it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the Question that the Bill be received for final consideration, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil and this is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad.  The only matter, therefore, that may be discussed is the amendments made by the Dáil.</P>
      <P>For the convenience of Senators I have arranged for the printing and circulation of those amendments to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the 23 amendments before the House today, seven are purely technical and do not require that I make individual reference to them.  These are amendments Nos. 3, 5, 8, 16, 19, 21 and 22.  The following is the situation with the balance of the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 1 is simply a definition which is included for the purposes of clarity.  Amendment No. 2 increases the level of fine under the Bill for conviction on indictment to a sum of £10,000 from the original figure of £5,000.  This was suggested to me by Deputy John Bruton on Committee Stage in the Dáil and I accepted it.  Amendment No. 4 was proposed at Dáil Committee Stage by Deputy Mervyn Taylor and I accepted <Col N="431" /> that as a possible improvement and a means of serving documents on an individual under section 4.  Amendment No. 6 consolidates the fees reference in section 7 and section 59 can, accordingly, be dropped.  Section 12 (f) also has a reference to fees removed from it under amendment No. 7.  The deletion under amendment No. 9 is to allow the Minister to fully monitor policy conditions and premium rates in the marketplace. Words which are superfluous to section 20 are deleted and we do that through amendment No. 10.</P>
    <P>The former section 27 is being replaced by a completely new section.  Under the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1978, as amended by the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1981, licensed banks are permitted in the course of their banking business to enter into or accept a bond or contract of suretyship or guarantee in specific instances.  Under section 27 of the Insurance Bill, 1987 it is proposed to extend the same powers to the Industrial Credit Corporation and to Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>In their recent submissions to the Fifth Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities and to the Department, the banks maintained that, first, the 1978 Act gave very limited freedom to banks in the area of suretyship necessitating the setting up of complicated and expensive mechanisms to accommodate routine bank transactions. Banks must continually refer to the 1978 Act to make sure they are not breaking the law in issuing guarantees.  They specifically instance cases of import duty liabilities to the Revenue Commissioners and bonds for tour operators and travel agents which are statutory rather than contractual obligations, the legality of which is in doubt under the existing legislation. Secondly, the 1978 Act allowed banks to give guarantees for payment of moneys where the payment of money is a contractual obligation of the customer of the bank and not where the customer's obligation is a statutory one.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee recommended that amending legislation be introduced and the new section is <Col N="432" /> intended, therefore, to substitute for the former section 27.  Subsection (1) of the new section removes the restrictions on licensed banks under sections 2 (1) (a) (2) of the 1978 Insurance (Amendment) Act, as amended, and extends to the Industrial Credit Corporation and Fóir Teoranta the same powers as banks in the bond guarantee suretyship area.  I have decided to leave the reference to Fóir Teoranta despite recent announcements by the Government; I made that decision purely for technical reasons and for tidying-up purposes.  Senators may have thought that was out of place there but for technical reasons it is not.</P>
    <P>Both ICC and Fóir Teoranta have represented that this extension is necessary to remove impediments to their ability to provide loans or banking services to clients through their not being able to give or accept guarantees in respect of loans and related financial services.  Subsection (1) also extends to ICC and Fóir Teoranta powers to obtain and accept guarantees from foreign institutions to cover loans made by the ICC or by Fóir Teoranta.  Subsection (2) defines certain terms used in subsection (1).</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 12 and 13, both of which relate to section 31, can be taken together.  Section 31 deals with the Insurance Compensation Fund.  It proposes certain restrictions on who may benefit from the fund.  The amendments proposed, which replace the existing sections 31 (2) and 31 (4) of the Bill, are of a technical nature only and do not change the original intention behind the section which, just to remind Senators, was to restrict claimants to 65 per cent or £650,000, whichever is the lower of the sum due under a particular claim.  Legal advice received by my Department stated that a number of different interpretations were possible from the original text. Accordingly, the text has now been tightened up to avoid possible misinterpretation.</P>
    <P>An amendment to (1D) of section 31 (2) ensures that an individual will be compensated even if he is liable to a corporate or unincorporated body.  A new subsection (1E) requires that any amount <Col N="433" /> paid out of the fund shall be passed on by the liquidator to the person to whom it is due.  The new section 31 (4) (b) is designed to ensure that where the Insurance Compensation Fund is used to compensate a claimant, that claimant cannot receive more than 65 per cent or £650,000, whichever is the lower, of the sum due to him unless the fund receives from the assets of the insolvent insurer the amount which it, that is the fund, paid to the claimant.  As previously stated, this was the original intention behind this section but as a result of legal advice it has been decided to make our intention more explicit.  In any event, the likelihood of the liquidator of an insolvent insurance company being in a position to pay out more than 65 per cent of the sums due to a claimant is highly unlikely.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 is of a technical nature and follows from the amendment to section 31 (4) (b) above.  The purpose of this amendment to section 32 is to ensure that the priority given to policyholders in so far as the technical reserves of the insurer are concerned does not override the priority given to the Insurance Compensation Fund in section 31 (4) (b).  The substituted section 33 under amendment No. 15 is not different in substance from the previous draft of the section.  The amendments involved are purely technical in nature and stem from legal advice received by my Department.</P>
    <P>Section 36 is provided for by way of amendment No. 17.  This new section provides that where the High Court sanctions the amalgmation of two or more insurance companies or the transfer of insurance business from one company to another, the court shall provide for the effective transfer of the property and the liabilities involved.  I take the view that the sanction of the High Court of the amalgamation or transfer of insurance business has always had the effect of transferring all the assets and liabilities, including liability to policyholders of the transferer company to the transferee company.  While the most recent case law supports this view, it has come to my attention that the earlier case law is <Col N="434" /> inconsistent and might give rise to doubt in the matter.  This, in turn, could raise doubts as to whether we have fully implemented the relevant EC directives which require member states to provide that a scheme of transfer once approved by the competent national authority shall affect directly the policyholders concerned. This section is intended to put the matter beyond doubt by providing that where the court has sanctioned a transfer or amalgamation it shall, by order, transfer the relevant property and liabilities and that any such order shall be effective in making such transfers.</P>
    <P>During Committee Stage of the Bill in the Dáil, Deputy John Bruton put down an amendment to subsection (1) to insert the words: &ldquo;having had regard to all the liabilities of the companies&rdquo;.  This arose out of concern on the Deputy's part that the court, in deciding whether to sanction an amalgamation or a transfer of business, should take into account the liabilities of the companies involved.  While I took the view that the section as drafted was sufficient as the court would naturally have regard to the liability of the companies involved, I did agree to accept the Deputy's amendment to make it explicit that account should be taken of the company's liabilities.  The section also provides that details of the agreement and the court order be provided to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Under amendment No. 18 the Minister is empowered to require, by regulation, that insurance agents as well as insurance brokers have professional indemnity insurance.  This amendment was tabled in the Dáil by Deputy John Bruton and I accepted it.  Amendment No. 20 brings new section 51 into being.  The purpose and intent of this section is clear.  Subsection (1) (a) and (b) prescribe the circumstances in which the intermediaries, be they brokers or agents, may accept money from a client in respect of insurance.  First, an intermediary may only accept money from a client in respect of a proposal for insurance if it is accompanied by the completed proposal or the proposal has already been accepted by the insurance company.  Secondly, an <Col N="435" /> intermediary may only accept money from a client in respect of a renewal of a policy if such renewal has been invited by the insurance company.  These are important requirements because their effect will be to oblige intermediaries to have an identifiable insurance company in mind in respect of proposals and renewals before accepting money from clients.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) gives the Minister power to expand on the requirements set out in subsection (1) to meet any new contingencies.  Subsection (3) requires intermediaries to issue receipts in a specified form to their clients when they accept from them money in respect of proposals or in respect of renewals.  The receipts will establish a clear link between the client, the intermediary and the insurance company involved.  It is important that we establish that link clearly.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) is an important provision in that it will highlight to the client that the completion of a proposal accompanied by a sum of money does not, of itself, mean that he or she is on cover.  In most cases, insurance companies will not have delegated authority to an intermediary to bind them in contracts of insurance and it is important for the consumer to know this.  Usually it is the insurance company who examines the proposal and assesses the risk before deciding to go on cover and actually issue a policy.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) exempts intermediaries with binding authority from insurance companies from the receipting requirements. The policy document itself, of course, would constitute a receipt.  Subsection (6) gives the Minister power to alter or add to the information to be provided in the actual receipt.  Subsection (7) merely states that a receipt is a receipt unless proved otherwise and would, for example, put the onus on intermediaries, etc. to prove that a receipt was bogus. While the requirements of this section are new to this Bill they should already be common practice among reliable intermediaries.</P>
    <P>The final amendment involves the <Col N="436" /> inclusion of a new section at section 61. It was introduced by me on Report Stage in the Dáil as a more workable alternative to an amendment which had been tabled by Deputy Mervyn Taylor in relation to insurance contracts.  This will enable the Minister, having consulted with representatives of the insurance industry and consumers, to make codes of conduct in relation to the disclosure and warranty aspects of insurance contracts.</P>
    <P>I commend all these amendments to the Seanad today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad we have reached a stage today where the Insurance Bill will eventually be passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It got a fair airing not only in this House but in the other House and that is indicated by the number of amendments made in both Houses.</P>
      <P>The Minister dealt with an amendment extending professional indemnity cover to include agents in addition to insurance brokers.  I would like the Minster to clarify how he intends implementing and enforcing that measure.  There are many agents who, perhaps historically, have developed relationships with particular insurance companies and, therefore, are deemed to be agents.  Many agents may not consider it worthwhile continuing on the small business they are at present operating for a particular insurance company in view of the cost of professional indemnity.  It would not be financially attractive for them to continue transacting business for one particular company. Is this being introduced in an effort to get rid of agents and force the status of insurance broker on intermediaries, rather than letting them continue as agents, complying with the regulations, indicating on their letter headings the insurance companies with whom they transact business, the consumer bonding and professional indemnity cover they have and the appropriate office where they transact business with the consumer? The difficulty I have with that change in the legislation is how it will be enforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that various opinions were given about the number of agencies <Col N="437" /> a person is required to have to come under the definition of &ldquo;agent&rdquo; or &ldquo;broker&rdquo;.  The Minister is aware of the long discussion we had here in relation to that matter.  I am sorry the Minister has not seen fit to alter the definition of &ldquo;broker&rdquo; from that of four agencies to three as indicated in an amendment in the other House.  It would have meant some improvement in the appalling situation that can now arise with the enactment of this legislation.  Many brokers will now reduce the number of agencies they have in order to avoid the various requirements they must comply with which would be a financial burden to them if they come under the definition of &ldquo;broker&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>They will be treated under the definition of &ldquo;agent&rdquo; in the legislation.  Under the definition of &ldquo;agent&rdquo; an intermediary will not need consumer bonding and will not need to indicate clearly the number of companies he or she has in order to give a fair spread of market opportunity to the consumer to get the lowest possible premium.  Perhaps the inclusion of professional indemnity will assist in getting rid of a lot of the agencies.  The Minister seems to be indicating that is the road he is taking.</P>
    <P>There will be a responsibility on brokers' organisations and on brokers themselves to draw up a code of practice by which an intermediary may operate.  I regret that the legislation does not have more teeth and enforcement procedures to deal with the misbehaviour of intermediaries who traverse the countryside. They have no training, no standards of insurance practice or bona fide qualifications to indicate they know anything about what they are selling.  This is very serious because in the event of a claim under life cover or in the event of maturity of a policy there may be a huge sum of money involved which might be earmarked for a particular purpose in a household.</P>
    <P>There are cowboys in the insurance industry who have no knowledge whatever of the industry but are employed or <Col N="438" /> subcontracted by various insurance brokers to flog policies to unsuspecting consumers who take them at face value.  I would much prefer to see the voluntary commitment that was given by the life offices in relation to the cooling-off period enshrined in the legislation.  Consumers would then have an opportunity to pull out of the contract they entered into with the life office.  There was an opportunity under the regulations to give teeth to the code of conduct that would rigorously enforce the type of standards we expect brokers and intermediaries to operate which would have eliminated the great concern at the moment about the manner in which policies are sold.  In reading the debates in the other House, I regret the Department seem to have little knowledge as to how consumer bonding will be enforced particularly in relation to some intermediaries.  A long debate took place on that in the other House.  I would like the Minister to indicate to us how consumer bonding, particularly in relation to brokers, will be implemented and what means will be used to achieve it.</P>
    <P>The Minister is extending the application of the Bill to the Industrial Credit Corporation and to Fóir Teoranta.  The major problem we can see arising in the future in relation to insurance is the apparent ease with which banks and building societies can become involved in the insurance business.  There will be a plethora of life companies after 1992 which could absorb many of the existing Irish life offices if they are not competitive or if they have not got their act together.  We could have a lot of banks and other financial institutions other than life offices involved in the insurance business. I would like to know what regulations the Minister will introduce to ensure that managers and staff of financial institutions do not play a role in the sale of life assurance policies to subsidiary companies of financial institutions.</P>
    <P>Since this legislation went through the Seanad I have no doubt that the Minister got an enormous number of complaints about the practice that is growing up particularly with the Lifetime operation <Col N="439" /> which was brought to his attention in this House.  At that time the Minister gave the impression we did not know what we were talking about in relation to this appalling activity that was taking place. Inducements were given to staff of financial institutions to sell policies for a particular life assurance company.  As a result of the level of complaints the Department received in the past six months, I hope the Minister is prepared to take on board suggestions that were made to him in this House, even though they may have been made by people who had perhaps an interest in relation to the matter.  There is a lot of talk about that at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware of my interest in this industry as an intermediary. That has been declared on more than one occasion but I am always anxious to see that there is fair play to everybody in the industry.  The alarming growth in 1988 in the business of a particular insurance company that is linked to a bank should have alerted the Minister to the fact that either there was something wrong in relation to the other life companies or else there was some malpractice in the life time operation, as was indicated to him in this House earlier. The Bill fails to address that problem.  I hope that the Central Bank Bill which is at present going through the Dáil and will come before this House will include amendments which will ensure that customers' accounts are used solely for banking purposes and not as a source of information for the sale of life assurance policies.</P>
    <P>We must state quite categorically the extent of life assurance activities, what limits we will put on them and what scope we will give to financial institutions and life offices involved in the writing of business. It could get out of control if we allow the present development to continue. I would like to hear what controls the Minister intends putting on it.  The consumer may not be treated in the best possible way if we allow that to continue without regulation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="440" /> The Minister on many occasions indicated that the main purpose of this legislation, together with other legislation in the justice area, was to bring down the cost of insurance.  The regulation of intermediaries is another part of it.  What we are doing in the Insurance Bill is to regulate intermediaries.  The whole package of measures of which the Minister has often spoken is to reduce the cost of insurance to the general public. However, there has been very little evidence that reductions, if there are any reductions, are being passed on to the consumer.  I do not see how you can reconcile the Voluntary Health Insurance Board bringing in, as part of their recovery plan, a regulation to cease payment for victims of motor accidents&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any evidence of benefits being passed on to the consumers as a result of what is proposed. Developments such as those in the VHI will not reduce motor premiums but will provide a greater possibility for motor insurance companies to load policyholders in order to compensate for the risk they will have to carry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like if the Minister would indicate what efforts his Department will be making in order to ensure that life offices, particularly the wholly owned Irish ones, will be able to face the stiff competition we will encounter after 1992.  There is a great challenge to insurance companies in that regard.  The consumer is waiting anxiously for foreign companies to come into this country because they feel they <Col N="441" /> will get a better deal.  I always wonder why Ireland, a small country in the context of many European insurance companies, is treated separately and as one region, and that UK companies are not prepared to treat the British Isles as one unit for the purpose of motor insurance. They treat Ireland on its own and, as a result, load policyholders and consumers to the hilt rather than spreading the risk over a wider territory.  Has the Minister entered into any discussions with the life assurance and general insurance industry in order to ascertain if they can widen their scope and thereby further reduce the premium to policyholders?  Perhaps there are regulations preventing him from doing that.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to this House.  I am very pleased it has come to the stage where we can regulate insurance intermediaries. I had hoped it would go further in relation to the areas I have mentioned, namely, consumer protection and particularly the role of financial institutions getting into the life assurance business.  I hope the Minister will have the necessary controls and protections under the regulations to ensure that there is fair play given to all aspects of the insurance industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say how pleased I am that we are finally in the home strait, as it were, with regard to the Insurance Bill.  The Bill was introduced in the Seanad and with the number of amendments both here and in the Dáil it has become a much better Bill as a result of the discussion in both Houses.  The Minister can take a lot of credit for his active response to most of the amendments. He played a major role in bringing about what we have with us today &mdash; a far better Bill than we had at the beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like the previous speaker, I cannot say that everything in the Bill suits me.  I have always declared a particular interest in the Bill but, at the same time, I accept the Minister has a responsibility to see that the best Bill is produced for the consumer and to ensure fair play for the various intermediaries of the insurance <Col N="442" /> business.  It is a great and a very honourable business and one which has been with us for hundreds of years.  Insurance has played a major role in the development of the economy.  This Bill is regarded as being the most important insurance Bill for 50 years and on leaving this House today it will be a much better Bill than when it was introduced.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points I would like to touch on and perhaps the Minister will reply to them.  Section 36 is important and will have considerable implications in the future.  I am not sure if the Minister has any particular company or take-over in mind but within the industry the bush telegraph is a mighty indicator of events and there are very strong rumours and there have been for the last year or so of take-overs within the industry.  Perhaps the Minister would make some comment on that.  If he has any inside information he may not wish to tell us but we would like to know about it.</P>
    <P>I would like further clarification on section 44.  It is provided that an agent may have four agencies, four life and four non-life and that he must have a consumer bond.  Under section 45 the Minister may, by regulation, provide that a person cannot act as or hold himself to be an insurance broker or an insurance agent unless he has taken out a policy of professional indemnity insurance in a specified form.  It is saying that an agent and a broker must have the professional indemnity policy and I would like clarification of that.  An agent with four life and four non-life agencies had just a consumer bond and the other extras such as special clients' accounts which are small in comparison to this regulation.  It is now being provided that with four life and four non-life agencies he must also have a professional indemnity bond.  One could argue that there is no difference at all between the broker and the agent.  This point is worthy of clarification.  The key word in this is that the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo;. I would like further clarification as to what he has in mind with regard to that word.</P>
    <P>Section 51 is a new section the Minister has inserted.  I am not in any way against <Col N="443" /> the idea of a person receiving a receipt for money paid to an insurance broker or agent.  This may involve further administrative implications for an agent or broker.  In the case of a person taking out a composite insurance &mdash; for example, he may want his car or tractor insured and fire and public liability and employers liability, all of which involve separate policies &mdash; it is to be assumed that one receipt would be sufficient in that case or is there to be a separate receipt for each of the policies and each of the payments made for each policy?  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that point?</P>
    <P>I understand that section 60 is taken for an amendment which was recommended in the Dáil by Deputy Mervyn Taylor.  Again, I do not disagree with this.  It is no harm to reflect on this because a feature of insurance over the years has been the moral and physical aspects.  The physical aspect for example, in the case of a house would be whether it is roofed with mineral felt or is of standard construction and so on.  On determining that point certain rates can be applied and one can be assured of getting value in terms of premiums. However, in regard to the moral aspect, if the applicant is telling lies, is deliberately misrepresenting a situation, then no premium would be sufficient for the risk. There has always been within the insurance industry the concept of innocent misrepresentation, of genuine omission. That has always been part and parcel of insurance, of dealing with claims.  While this is reinforcing the <i>uberrima fides</i> principle, generally speaking insurance companies would ignore an innocent misrepresentation and pay a claim that should be paid as a result of a policy in force.</P>
    <P>Senator Hogan referred to competition in the changing world of the financial and insurance services.  I would have to agree with him.  Certain banks and life insurance companies are very strong sellers of their products at the moment.  I do not know the regulations under which the people operating the Lifetime scheme <Col N="444" /> receive their licence from the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The staff of the Bank of Ireland are thinking more of the Lifetime scheme than they are of the business of the Bank of Ireland. They have regular conferences.  I am told there are little presents for them if they produce so many policies and so on.  Was that ever anticipated?  It could be argued it is unfair competition.  Building Societies are also as active in that respect.  The whole financial services industry is changing. I make the point about the Lifetime scheme because I happen to have some experience of it.  I know of a person who approached his bank to take out money to put into an Irish Life bond.  He was brought into a room and was advised on what to do.  There is that pressure and I do not think it is fair.  I make that point in support of what Senator Hogan has said.</P>
    <P>The Bill is almost completed and I think the industry will welcome it.  I would like to know from the Minister when it will come into force, what period of time the agent will have to decide if he should become a broker or if he is a broker what is the situation should he decide to go back to being an agent.  He would require a period of some time, perhaps a year or two on whatever is decided.  I do not think it should be to long because we have been waiting for the Bill for a long time and it should be enacted as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>One amendment which the Minister brought in in the Seanad, which I welcome very strongly, was that dealing with the role of the auditor of the company. Where the auditor has the slightest suspicion there is something wrong he should advise his department and if he fails to do so there are various penalties provided.  That should be organised and put into place immediately.  I am sure there are other aspects of the Bill which should be brought into force quite quickly also.  Perhaps when the Minister is replying he will comment on both aspects and indicate whether the Bill will be held over for two years or partially held over for two years.</P>
    <P>In general, I welcome the Bill.  We had <Col N="445" /> much discussion on it.  I repeat what I said earlier.  We have a much better Bill now.  That is the function of both Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; to examine, analyse and improve legislation.  We have done so in regard to the Insurance Bill with the help of the Minister, Deputy Brennan, who has been very supportive at all times and has accepted many of the amendments. We thank him.</P>

      <P>I agree with the comments made by Senators Hogan and Fallon that this is a very important and significant Insurance Bill and that it has been improved by a number of amendments in this House and also in the other House, which we are now considering. However, I remain deeply disappointed that the Bill is not a genuine consolidation measure consolidating the important insurance provisions.  This is particularly regrettable because the Bill has taken a long time to go through both Houses.</P>
      <P>The Minister will recall it was introduced into the Seanad in October 1987 &mdash; it has been almost 18 months going through both Houses.  However, it is a weighty and important Bill and I do not think it has been an undue time for serious consideration of it.  Unfortunately it is not a Bill which consolidates the insurance provisions in an Act of the Oireachtas in primary legislation because, as the Minister is aware, it refers to and is to be read not only with the earlier insurance Acts commencing with the 1909 Act but also with the statutory instruments, with the Irish ministerial regulations made under the European Communities Act, 1972 and these are principally the non-life insurance regulations of 1976 and the life assurance regulations of 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those two statutory instruments contain enormously important regulatory provisions in this area.  The interpretation section in section 2 is an interpretation largely by reference to those statutory instruments.  Many of the terms like &ldquo;insurer&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-life insurance&rdquo; or indeed the amendment introduced today of &ldquo;solvency certificate&rdquo; means what they mean in the statutory instruments.  I think <Col N="446" /> it is not a good way of legislating.  It is not desirable that we would interpret Acts of the Oireachtas by reference to earlier statutory instruments.  It is extremely important when a measure has been implemented by statutory instrument which is authorised by the European Communities Act but it is not a desirable way of introducing major changes into our own legislative code.  It is something that can be done in the short term but a significant area like insurance should be incorporated into primary legislation when there is an Act.  There are lots of examples of that where something was implemented by statutory instrument and then the Oireachtas brought in an Act subsequently and the Act incorporated the statutory instrument.  The statutory instrument was repealed because it was replaced by the primary legislation.  It is extremely important that this be done in an area like insurance.</P>
    <P>I raised this in my Second Stage speech on the Bill but at that stage I hoped that the opportunity might be taken for incorporation of the 1976 and 1984 statutory instruments into the Bill itself.  I raise it now because it is clear that we are going to have further amendments in the insurance area in the context of the internal market.  I would urge the Minister that it is important that we have consolidation into an Act of the Oireachtas to be read together with this Bill so that it is regulated by primary legislation.  On the amendments themselves a number of points have already been made on the detail of them.  I would like to refer to two new sections which are introduced by way of amendments made in the other House.</P>
    <P>The first relates to the powers of the court under the proposed new section 36 with respect to amalgamation or transfer of insurance business.  The Minister has clarified the purpose of that, to ensure that the liabilities are transferred and that the persons are fully protected by the assumption of liabilities by the new company to which the business has been transferred.  I would like the Minister to give an assurance that the protection of <Col N="447" /> employees would also be fully incorporated on such a transfer under the power of the court.  I am thinking in particular of the transfer of undertakings directive and the statutory instrument &mdash; I think it is 306 of 1980 &mdash; on the acquired rights of employees in the event of a transfer, that he is satisfied that where the court does sanction a transfer here that that statutory instrument would apply and that the employees concerned would have the full protection of the statutory instrument.</P>
    <P>The other section I want to refer to &mdash; a new section introduced by way of amendment in the Dáil &mdash; is the new section 60 on codes of conduct, on duty of disclosure and warranty.  That appears to be section 61 of the Bill as passed by the Dáil but that is only a minor matter and will be corrected.  Like Senators Fallon and Hogan, I consider this to be a useful power for the Minister but I do not see where there is any sanction or where there is any enforcement of it.  The Minister could clarify that point.  If, for example, he does consider that he should prescribe codes of conduct, what happens if companies do not abide by them?  As far as I can see, there are no sanctions at all for non-compliance with the code of conduct and therefore it would be important to ensure that this section is fully integrated with the powers of the Minister. The Minister has explained that it was a Report Stage amendment in the other House and that this is a Government amendment on the proposal put forward by Deputy Mervyn Taylor.  It is important that we ensure it is effective if the power is exercised by the Minister.  I would welcome the clarification of that.</P>
    <P>Otherwise, like other Senators, I welcome the fact that the Bill is now reaching a final stage and I join with Senator Fallon in asking when precisely the various stages or sections of the Bill, when it is passed, are to be brought into operation. The Minister has a fairly normal power now to bring in different sections at different stages or different times.  Normally, Ministers are clear on what the likely timescale would be for bringing <Col N="448" /> sections into operation and I would welcome if he would inform the House of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will start by sincerely thanking not only those Senators who took part in today's Report Stage debate but also thank the Seanad for its consideration of this Bill throughout all its Stages.  We have taken on board many of the proposals and suggestions which have been made by the Seanad and this Bill reflects a lot of thinking of individual Senators. That can be seen in the legislation itself.</P>
      <P>Senator Hogan raised a number of points with me.  First of all, the point about sections 44 and 45.  This is the position where the Minister would be enabled to make it a requirement that agents would have to have professional indemnity.  That was an amendment I accepted from Deputy John Bruton in the Dáil.  I made it clear I was doing that in a spirit of co-operation but that the formal intention was not to apply that professional indemnity clause to agents for reasons which were explained at length in the House.  Deputy Bruton convinced me it was no harm to have an enabling power there in any case in the event that a Government, or a particular Minister, would change their mind at some future time and I put it there on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is intended to use it in the area of brokers; it is not intended to use it in the area of agents.  The reasons I need not go into any great length but basically they were because we were quite satisfied that the companies would be made to stand behind the agents, as it were, and that this clear link was being established between agents and the companies.  Acts of error or omission and so on were all being made the responsibility of the individual company where an agent acted so we were quite satisfied that that professional indemnity was not required in those cases.  The key phrase there is &ldquo;the Minister may&rdquo; and I have made it clear, and I am glad of the opportunity to do it again in this House, that it is not my intention to activate that part of the Bill.  It is <Col N="449" /> our intention to activate it in regard to brokers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan expressed some disappointment about the number of agencies being permitted to agents but we have had all this debated in this House and in the other House and in the Dáil we had a formal vote on that situation. So, it is well and truly settled.  I wanted to say this to the Seanad and in fairness to Senator Hogan and Senator Fallon and others who raised this with me, we gave it quite an amount of thought, we looked at it from every possible angle, we made every effort to go along with the views of the Senators on it.  I was unable to do so in the end for very practical reasons and very strong, indeed legal advice as to what would become of people if I allowed a gap or a lacuna to open up and I accepted that advice in the end.  It may not be perfect but it is certainly a step in the right direction.  I appreciate that some Senators are disappointed about that and I know they would have preferred had I further restricted the agents but I think it is unnecessary to do that and that this gives everybody a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    <P>On the codes of conduct &mdash; Senator Hogan referred to that &mdash; I introduced an amendment.  It was originally an idea and a proposal from Deputy Mervyn Taylor; it was a good thought of his and one I was happy to accept.  We will be laying down codes of conduct for insurance companies to tackle a number of areas but particularly one key area which was highlighted by Deputy Taylor, namely, where some item on a form would be warranted as being correct but it might be a very minor item and because it was a very minor item the whole policy could fall, a claim could be turned down. It was a particular legal case which he referred to which I do not want to go into in any detail.  He referred to a particular legal case where a claim was challenged on the basis that a person warranted that all the facts were correct and it turned out that there was some minor item like, for example, overlooking a previous small claim or something like that and that made the whole thing fall.  We wanted to be sure that did not grow up <Col N="450" /> as a device in the insurance industry to have individual companies get out of commitments which they had entered into.  I propose in the code of conduct to ensure that we deal with that kind of issue.  Senator Hogan also talked to me about life after 1992 in the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the question I ask myself every morning.  The Senator knows we are doing a number of things. First, there are still a number of directives coming from Brussels which will radically affect the life business in particular.  The idea is that eventually the whole life business will be operating on a freedom of services basis which, in effect, means that somebody without an establishment here can dip in here and take business out of the country.  It works the other way also, of course.  That is what that means and that is coming.  I have asked the industry to prepare for it and I am working with the industry to prepare for it.  On the non-life side we are preparing them for competition by getting insurance costs down and the Senator knows our programme in that regard and the fact that insurance costs are now falling on the general side.</P>
      <P>The Senator asked me about Lifetime assurance.  This is a particular company. The Senator mentioned the name so I suppose we are as well to face it.  My Department have had talks with the Lifetime company and have reiterated to them our wish that their banking parent and the Lifetime assurance act at arms length and I have asked and received very strong assurances from the company that this, in fact, will be the case.  The Central Bank, I understand, are looking at a number of guidelines to be introduced to give effect to underpin my request in this area.  I know that both the Bank of Ireland and the Lifetime company are very well aware of my strong desire to ensure that arms' length arrangements are not only there but are seen to be there, and are seen to be there by the industry.  That is the direction we have taken on that at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="451" /> Senator Fallon asked me about section 36, as to whether we had any particular company in mind.  There are two answers to that.  It will not go astray in having it here in the event of any particular company having this particular problem.  That is as much as I can say to the Senator about that at this stage.</P>
    <P>On sections 44 and 45, there was a similar query from Senator Hogan on the question of agents and I have dealt with that.</P>
    <P>On section 51, the question of receipts, the Senator asked me about that.  The position there is that one receipt will suffice. The idea is to make sure that any money is actually receipted, any policy is receipted.  I think one could take a pragmatic interpretation of that.  I am glad the Senator also welcomed the code of conduct and I want to refer to that in a moment, when dealing with Senator Robinson's point.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon also raised the question of Lifetime assurance.  I have dealt with that matter in my comments in reply to Senator Hogan.  I will continue to insist on that arm's length arrangement and will continue to monitor it.</P>
    <P>In regard to the time span, the period of time we have allowed in the Bill for this to come into effect is two years.  That is section 49, subsection (3).  That does not apply to the rest of the Bill.  There is a two year period from the date the Bill comes into effect for that situation to be actually effected: in other words, for agents to get four and the broker to get five upwards.  The rest comes in immediately, unless there are particular orders.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson expressed disappointment about consolidation.  I am disappointed about that also but I had to make a balanced judgment.  This Bill has been lying around for nine years and I took a decision that it was not going to lie around any longer and we were going to try to get it passed.  Even so, it took us 18 months to get it passed.  I shudder to think what age I might be if I decided to consolidate this Bill: I would not bet on a political career of that length.  I thought it was better to get this Bill <Col N="452" /> through now rather than attempt a major consolidation, which it would certainly be.  We would not be looking at this Bill for many more years had I attempted to consolidate it.  That is the practical answer to that.  It would be nice to do it but it is just not practically possible given the time scale.  That does not mean that we have given up the idea.  There is a lot of new EC legislation coming at us in the insurance area and I will try to work towards a day when we can do some consolidation work on it.</P>
    <P>The Senator asked me about section 36, the protection of employees in the event of a court sanctioning transfers.  This is not one that we can address under insurance legislation.  Other legislation exists for this purpose which is administered by the Department of Labour. However, in the context of a court's overall consideration on a transfer of business situation, I am satisfied that the court would have regard to the repercussions of the transfer on the employment situation. There is something else in the Bill which would meet the Senator's concern, but that would look after it.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson asked about the code of conduct and about enforcement. She is quite right, but the enforcement procedure we would use, once we get the code of conduct put in place, would come under section 3 of the Bill which, in effect, would become an order.  We would introduce the code of conduct by order under the Bill and orders under the Bill are enforceable and those who do not carry out the orders under the Bill are guilty of an offence.  That would handle that particular situation.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank Senators for their support on this Bill.  I know that, like all legislation, it does not give everybody all of what they want.  But let me say this: the Bill has been nine years coming and today it passes all Stages in this House. It is timely because it prepares the industry for 1992 in large measure.  It brings in new powers to supervise the industry which are essential if we are going to meet the challenges of 1992.  It does not finally solve but it sets up a division <Col N="453" /> between brokers and agents which I hope the market will build on over the years. What I want to do here is to build up a very professional body of independent insurance brokers who are clearly seen by the public as such and to have other people in the industry more attached to companies because they are agents and to be seen to be so attached.  We get that kind of transparency.  The person who deals with an intermediary knows the difference between a broker and an agent and knows that, on the one hand, they are dealing with independent persons and, on the other hand that they are dealing with those who are closer to companies.  It is up to the market itself as the years go by to build on that division which I have now put down and I trust the market will do that in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>On top of all that it is a piece of legislation which protects the consumer, particularly through the bonding arrangement. If somebody hands over funds to an intermediary we put in a bonding arrangement similar to what travel agents have to do to protect funds.  With the new supervision clauses preparing the industry for 1992, the clear division between brokers and agents and the consumer protection, I am satisfied that between all of us we have done a good day's work in putting this legislation together and I thank Seanad Éireann for their support on it.</P>

      <P>Before we proceed with the amendments I should like to remind Senators that the proposer of an amendment may close the debate on that amendment but no other speaker may speak more than once on each amendment.  Amendment No. 5 is consequential on amendment No. 1 and they may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 32, to delete &ldquo;assaulted or includes&mdash;&rdquo; and in page 4, to delete lines 1 to 5 inclusive and substitute &ldquo;assaulted.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 and amendment No. 5 arise out of a debate we had on Committee Stage.  On that occasion the Minister argued cogently&mdash;the amendment was in Senator Fennell's name &mdash; that the amendment did not actually attempt to change the definition of rape but attempted instead to change the definition of a rape offence.  I have, therefore, in order to make it clear what we are deciding, introduced these two amendments to, on the one hand, meet what I thought was a reasonable objection by the Minister to Senator Fennell's amendment on Committee Stage and also to offer the House, as carefully as I can, a definition of rape which would go along with the majority recommendation of the Law Reform Commission.  Amendment No. 1 simply leaves section 3 (1) with the term &ldquo;aggravated sexual assault&rdquo;.  I think that particular crime and that particular term is a useful addition to the criminal law and the whole area of sexual violence but it leaves it simply as meaning:</P>
      <P>a sexual assault that involves serious violence or the threat of serious violence or is such as to cause injury, humiliation or degradation of a grave nature to the person assaulted.</P>
      <P>But does not go on to include certain specified offences, all of which have one thing is common, which is that they involve forcible sexual penetration of bodily orifices.  We had a discussion indirectly the last day on it.  I have suggested that the Principal Act, the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, be amended by the insertion of the following:</P>
      <P>A man commits rape if&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) he has unlawful sexual intercourse with a women who at the time of the intercourse, does not consent to it, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="455" /> That is as in the Principal Act&mdash;</P>
    <P>(b) at that time he knows she does not consent to the intercourse or he is reckless as to whether she does or does not consent to it,...</P>
    <P>That is as it is in the present Act.  I then propose that we extend the definition of rape by saying: A person commits rape if&mdash;</P>
    <P>he commits an aggravated sexual assault against a person and that assault includes</P>
    <P>&mdash;That, of course, is building on the Minister's definition of &ldquo;aggravated sexual assault&rdquo; as contained in the Bill but specifies an aggravated sexual assault which includes&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) penetration (however slight), by his penis of the anus or mouth of the person assaulted; or (ii) penetration (however slight) of the vagina of the woman assaulted by any object held or manipulated by him.</P>
    <P>In other words, I propose that those two forms of aggravated sexual assault ought to be incorporated in a definition of rape. I propose it without an enormous amount of optimism that the Minister is going to accept the amendment, but I think it is necessary on such a fundamental matter to have a clear decision by this House for or against it.  I do not want to go through the report of the Law Reform Commission at length, but I will refer to a couple of pertinent chapters from it.  The Law Reform Commission referred to a seminar which they held on this whole issue.  On the question of the extension of the definition of rape they say:</P>
    <P>We attach considerable significance to the fact that these views</P>
    <P>&mdash;these are views supporting an extension of the definition of rape&mdash;</P>
    <P>are held by persons who are in daily contact with the victims of assaults and who are in a position to observe their use of language.  We were also told <Col N="456" /> by them that appropriate labelling of offences contributes to the victim's sense of being vindicated and protected by the State and that any description which seems to understate the gravity of an offence or put it in a lesser category will be resented by the victim. Consistently with such an approach, we have already decided that we should take terminology into account by suggesting that indecent assault is a wholly inappropriate expression to describe the more serious forms of sexual assault.</P>
    <P>The point they are making in that paragraph on page 7 of the Law Reform Commission's report on rape &mdash; and this is the critical point in this whole discussion &mdash; is that the views of persons who are in daily contact with the victims of what the Minister would call &ldquo;aggravated sexual assault&rdquo;, but which I think we should call &ldquo;rape&rdquo;, are that labelling and terminology are of extreme importance to the victims.  That concern that labelling and terminology are of extreme concern to the victims is extremely important in terms of the dissenting report which is referred to in paragraph 56.  The nub of the dissenting report &mdash; the minority report of the president and of Mr. O'Leary &mdash; is that the objective of the law as they see it is the apprehension, conviction and punishment of the guilty. The nub of the argument in the minority report is that changing the definition would not in their view contribute anything to the apprehension, conviction and punishment of the guilty.</P>
    <P>If one considers these two views, the view of those who work with the victims of rape of how important it is to them that proper terminology be used to describe their experience, and then look at the minority report which effectively gives that a secondary role and talks about the role of the law in terms of the apprehension, conviction and punishment of the guilty, the problem is clearly illustrated. It is a matter of whom the law is for.  The minority report sees the function of the law &mdash; it is obviously a major function although not necessarily the <Col N="457" /> only, and probably in this case not the most important function of the law &mdash; in terms of apprehension, conviction and punishment of the guilty.  Many other people, judging by the Law Reform Commission's report, see the function of the law as having the effect of giving some vindication to victims, of giving some sense of support to victims and of the fact that many people express outrage to those who deal with the victims of rape when they discover that what was done to them and what they feel to have been rape is described as some other different offence.</P>
    <P>I fully accept the Minister's argument that it is important that similar penalties should apply to these offences, but I do not think we should allow ourselves to be influenced, however weighty the persons who produced this minority report, to be swayed away from the overwhelming interest which should lie at the whole attitude of the State and the community to crime which is not just the punishment of the guilty but also the vindication of the victims.  It is an area in the whole area of crime which we have only begun to talk about, only begun to look at, and that is the whole area of victim support.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I think it is necessary to make some comments on some of the statements of the minority report because I do not want to draw this into a man-woman conflict or anything like that but some of the phraseology used in the minority report is, to say the least of it, distinctly unhelpful to women and arguably unsympathetic to them.</P>
    <P>The concluding paragraph of their dissenting report says:</P>
    <P>Nor does the creation of the two new offences of sexual assault and aggravated sexual assault present the same problems of definition that arise when one attempts to find a generally accepted basis for a definition of rape, other than vaginal sexual intercourse without the consent of the woman, the description traditionally attached to it by the community and the law for centuries.</P>
    <P>The first question on that is whether we <Col N="458" /> should attach much weight to traditional definitions about things which involve sexual violence against women, given the traditionally unequal role that has been allocated to women throughout the centuries. Therefore, I think it is a very dicey area to quote tradition in terms of how we legislate for something as sensitive as sexual violence, and particularly sexual violence against women, given the historical context of the hostility to women, of discrimination against women and, indeed, the whole context of marital law which we are now almost rid of, which saw women as subjects and chattels and possessions and, indeed, in some cases, sexual playthings of men.  All of the historical base for legislation about things like this is flawed by the fact that all of that history was a history of discrimination against women and that is why there is an inadequate argument for not changing the law.</P>
    <P>The argument for changing it has come from women, from those who work with women and from those who feel they know the minds of women.  The majority of the Law Reform Commission, who presumably were present when all these views were being expressed, were swayed by those arguments.  On the one hand, you have the majority of the Law Reform Commission swayed by the arguments and, on the other hand, you have what I think is a limited view of the law by the minority report based on a perception of the law as being responsible for apprehension, conviction and punishment.  I think that is a limited and inadequate view and it does not satisfactorily take into consideration the important symbolic view of law, the whole value of law as a statement of values of a society, the whole value of law as a statement of the parameters within which a society operates.  All of that is equally important.</P>
    <P>The law is not just something for the courts and the Garda; is it a statement of the values of a community, the statement of the values of a country and the statement of the values of a society.  In that statement questions of apprehension, conviction and punishment must also have added on to them questions of how <Col N="459" /> society sees a crime, how those who suffer the crime see the crime.  I believe that in that context and in the context of the victims of rape it is particularly important that the minority report of the Law Reform Commission, which is in my view a little bit dispassionate, a little distanced from the suffering of the victims, ought to be treated as it is, as a minority report.  The majority report, which I have attempted to introduce in this amendment, and based on a clearly held view of the victims of rape and a clearly held view of any woman I have asked as to how she would describe forcible oral intercourse.  Every woman I know to whom I have asked that question says it is rape, as sure as the traditional definition of rape.  It is something about which women in particular feel threatened.</P>
    <P>It is a fact worth mentioning &mdash; though I do not want to labour it &mdash; that the authors of the minority report were both men.  Men, in particular, have an obligation to be particularly sensitive in their use of language in this area.  As I said, some of the language in this report, particularly the slightly over-inflated status given to tradition in this area, suggests a slight male dominance in thinking and a dominance based on an area of activity, namely, the law which has been male-dominated for centuries.</P>
    <P>The more I read about it, the more I think about it and the more I listen to women and to those who speak for the victims of rape, the more convinced I become that we are doing women a disservice if we do not do what most of them to whom I have spoken to, most of those who have spoken to the Law Reform Commission, want done, namely, extend the definition of rape not enormously but simply to involve forcible penetration of the orifices of the body.  In my mind, that involves no legal niceties; it is clear-cut, definite and it meets the needs of those who have suffered to speak a name for the offence that is committed against them that satisfies them and describes in our language what they have felt.</P>

      <P>It is appropriate as it is International Women's Day today that we should be discussing legislation which is going to affect the position of women very radically and very fundamentally. This Bill is to be welcomed.  There is a great deal in it that is good and that has long been sought.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to once more come back to the kernel of the Bill that I feel concerned about with the amendments put down by Senator Ryan.  They are certainly tidier and easier to deal with in terms of what we want to change than the amendments I put down on Committee Stage.  It is very good that on Report Stage we can get another chance to discuss them.</P>
      <P>I absolutely accept and support all the points made by Senator Ryan.  He has certainly got a very good grasp, insight and understanding of what we are talking about in our appeal to the Minister to listen and act on these changes.  I make no apologies at all for labouring this particular area of the legislation because it is very important that we get this Bill absolutely right.  This legislation will have to stand for many years; hopefully it will be the right legislation and we will not have to come back to it as quickly as we have had to come back to the 1981 Act. Therefore, it should reflect the contemporary lifestyle and what happens in our country at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must extend the concept of rape to deal with other serious violent sexual offences.  This is crucial and I emphasise it once more.  I suggest that perhaps this issue has not been discussed enough.  I know many people will think this subject has been over-laboured and over-discussed and that there is nothing more to be said about it, but it seems we need to slow down a little bit on this one because we seem to have a very definite difficulty with it.  Perhaps it is something that we should take as a section, maybe we should take it on its own as a section and bring it into the all-party committee and discuss it on its own &mdash; this concept of rape and whether it should be extended or why it should be extended.  I believe that the approach that is being taken at present is <Col N="461" /> against the interests and the feelings of the vast majority of the people who will be influenced by this legislation, that is, women.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be aware that today particularly, and in the run-up to today, the abiding call from women's organisations has been that you take another look at the legislation, that you listen to appeals to change it and bring in the amendment which is before you today.  I feel that labelling and terminology are very important.</P>
    <P>I know that this Bill will make a very firm statement.  It should go out loud and clear to would-be rapists that they cannot and must not rape, and also they cannot and must not seriously offend and gravely assault women in the way we read so often in court reports, that is, women are being effectively raped with bottles, screwdrivers or broom handles.  This is something that perhaps was not seen in years past, but is certainly too often happening in today's Ireland.  To all intents and purposes this is rape.  Therefore, we must make our legislation reflect this and call it by what most people see it as, and seriously question the traditional definition of rape: sexual intercourse without consent.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe in consultation on legislation pending or on amendments that are sought.  A great deal of conflict, argument and opposition can be avoided if various interest group are consulted in advance of legislation.  If we consider this legislation, surely the crucial group to consult would have been the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights a committee comprising Members of the Dáil and Seanad which brought out an excellent report, a report which, I think set the course of this Bill.  In their report entitled Sexual Violence, they explained under the heading &ldquo;Definition of Rape&rdquo; how they went about their report.  They took submissions from the incorporated Law Society and from the Garda Síochána and in the submissions from the Garda Síochána &mdash; I think I said this on Committee Stage and even on Second Stage, but I think it is worth saying it again &mdash; the Garda Authorities:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="462" /> indicated that they were satisfied that sufficient legislation exists to deal adequately with other forms of penetration as distinct from sexual intercourse, and they made the point that the possible consequence of unlawful intercourse, i.e. pregnancy, makes rape a unique crime.</P>
    <P>However, they did inform members that they would have no objection in principle to broadening the definition of rape, so they would not at the end of the day object to this.  Therefore, the women's groups, women's committees, and the Garda Síochána have not a fundamental objection to it.  We have to come down again to the Law Society and, as Senator Ryan pointed out, to the two lawyers &mdash; one a High Court judge &mdash; who were party to the minority report of the Law Reform Commission.  Having listened to all these submissions and reflected again the Joint Committee came back with their recommendation.  After &ldquo;careful consideration&rdquo; the members of the Joint Committee agree that &ldquo;the definition of rape should be widened to include the types of indecent assault referred to at (a) on page 8&rdquo; of the report.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to reflect seriously on this.  If the Minister has any doubts at all or believes that we could be right and that we could be putting forward a case that should be listened to and action should be taken.  I suggest that he takes his time, and does not go ahead with it, but admits that he is having second thoughts and that something should be done.  I am sure that a suitable and practical alternative could be arrived at.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly about this one.  It is an issue that is not going to go away.  I appeal to the Minister to seriously consider it and in this particular case have an understanding of what the women are saying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few points on amendment No. 5.  It is with some reluctance that I speak on this subject because it is difficult to speak on it.  Since I am a member of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights and <Col N="463" /> originally I did take the line which Senator Fennell has expanded on and since I have been influenced by the Minister's logic, it is only fair that I should again go over very briefly the area that I have dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Senator Brendan Ryan is in agreement with the term &ldquo;aggravated sexual assault&rdquo; in section 3.  I have to say that I was tempted to put down a motion asking the Minister to change that to the term &ldquo;sexual violation&rdquo; for the simple reason that sexual assault seems to me to be an incomplete situation whereas violation is an act completed.  It seems to me from the debates we have had in this House that sexual violation would to some extent satisfy the case that is being made by Senator Fennell.  I realised that on Report Stage it is necessary to have a seconder to a motion.  It would not be an easy thing to do and perhaps it might not be the proper thing to put down an amendment.  I suggested to the Minister that perhaps &ldquo;sexual violation&rdquo; would be a better term.  I realise, of course, that the term &ldquo;aggravated sexual assault&rdquo; has been suggested by the Law Reform Commission and has been considered at great length.</P>
      <P>I have been influenced by the case the Minister has made.  The Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill, 1987, came before this House, and in the early stages in another place, I was concerned with the course it was taking, but seeing that the Minister and those with opposing views came together and drafted legislation which satisfied both sides, I think it is clear that the Minister wants and has attempted in every case to meet many of the points raised.  I have no doubt that in this particular Bill it will be exactly the same.  I would like to quote from the Minister's reply, at column 127 volume 122, on 16 February in this House as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal to extend the definition of rape does not offer any material benefit in the prosecution of offenders in the legal protection afforded to victims or in deterring potential future <Col N="464" /> offenders from committing offences. Indeed, there is the danger that I referred to on Second Stage that a broadening of the definition of rape could work against the interests of women; that danger is there.  The perception of rape by the public could well be changed to the extent that the stigma and odium which the public attach to rape would be reduced, thus bringing about the opposite result to that desired.  I have heard no new arguments that would justify change in the Government's position on this issue. The deficiencies in the existing law which give rise in the first place to the proposal to extend the definition of rape are, I am fully satisfied, being remedied in this Bill.</P>
    <P>That specific case has not been dealt with by Senators Fennell and Ryan.  That still remains and that must be a considerable influence on anyone who is concerned with this legislation.  Furthermore, I would like to quote what my colleague, Senator Lydon, said on that occasion, at Column 124 of Volume 122 of the Official Report of the Seanad:</P>
    <P>In relation to the points made there, perhaps we are looking at this the wrong way around.  I see aggravated sexual assault as a much more horrific crime even than rape.  Rape is a horrific crime but to be penetrated by a knife is surely more horrific than to be penetrated by a penis.  There are some crimes which are so horrific in the whole area of these perverse, sadistic sexual attacks that they can only be described as aggravated sexual assault and even the word &ldquo;rape&rdquo; does not cover them.  I would like to look at it the other way around.  The word &ldquo;rape&rdquo; has certain connotations in the public mind and it does not sufficiently cover some of the horrific crimes that can be committed and perpetrated against another, male or female.  It is just another viewpoint and it is one of the reasons I agree with the Minister's wording.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Fennell that it is <Col N="465" /> appropriate that on this particular day we should be dealing with this legislation and hopefully we will conclude the debate.  I would have to ask, as I said before, would the legislation be better because of this amendment.  Taking into consideration what Senator Brendan Ryan has said, that the law is there not alone to punish the criminal but to vindicate the victim, and everything else it comes down to a definition of language, as the Minister has clearly stated.  I must agree, of course, with Senator Fennell and others who have stated clearly that it is women who are the victims, and of course their views must be given priority.  I have no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>As I have said before, my simple understanding of the objections to the wording and to the Minister's decision not to extend the definition is that women who have been sexually assaulted or assaulted in a way that would come under the term &ldquo;aggravated sexual assault&rdquo; would feel that the term does not cover the injustice that has been done.  In all other ways, the punishment, penal servitude for life, and the procedure through the courts are identical to the procedures for those charged for a rape offence.  At the end of the day, to change the definition would not seem to me to improve the legislation.  I think that is the important consideration.</P>
    <P>I realise there is a difficulty with the legislation satisfying the psychological damage done to the victim.  There is a difficulty, but I think the Minister has been very forthright with this legislation and indeed all the members of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights have accepted it.  While I too agree that we should perhaps pause in a situation like this, I certainly would not agree with Senator Fennell's suggestion that we should put this legislation more or less on the shelf even for a short time, because I think it is a very considerable step forward and is seen as such by every individual. I think it would be unfortunate to delay its passage through this House.</P>
    <P>I want to state as clearly as I can my attitude to the legislation.  I feel I understand the points that have been made by <Col N="466" /> Senator Fennell and Senator Ryan and by and large I agree with them, but as I have said at the end of the day we are concerned with legislation that will deal with the criminal and, as Senator Ryan has said, that will vindicate the victim. This legislation does that.  I honestly believe that the Minister has given great consideration to this legislation and I accept the logic of his statements.  The Law Reform Commission changed its attitude and we have this minority report. When you consider that erudite men and eminent lawyers are capable of doing that, obviously it must be hard to get unanimity in any general sense when it was impossible to get it there.  However, taking everything into consideration and the case that the Minister has put, I feel that I must accept the Minister's point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to say on the amendments in the names of Senators Ryan, O'Toole and Fennell that the Government cannot be accused of conservatism in relation to the Bill.  In the international context this Bill is on any view a radical measure.  If the Government felt that the correct approach would be to extend the existing definition of rape they would have no hesitation in doing so.  As I have already informed the House, this is not a political issue.  That being so, what, then, are the arguments on each side?  The main argument advanced for extending the definition of rape to include other serious sexual offences, and this was the argument put forward by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights, is that these other acts which are as humiliating and degrading as rape are now charged as indecent assault with a lesser maximum penalty than rape and without the protection at present afforded to victims of rape by the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981.  That argument has been met by the inclusion in the Bill of the new offence of aggravated sexual assault which will have the same penalty as rape, which will be tried in the Central Criminal Court along with rape and will attract the same <Col N="467" /> procedures that presently protect the victims of rape.</P>
      <P>The remaining arguments in favour of extending the definition of rape relate to the following: first, that the public's understanding of rape has changed and, in particular, that women who have been subjected to sexual assaults not amounting to rape feel that, in fact, they have been raped.  Second, that calling these offences rape would benefit the victims psychologically.  I am not at all convinced that the existing law does not coincide with the community's concept of rape, neither may I say were all the members of the Law Reform Commission.  The difficulty, of course, is that there is no research which can prove or disprove this argument.  Rape has always had a very distinctive meaning: non-consensual intercourse <i>per vaginum;</i> and it would be surprising, to say the least, if the community's view of what constituted rape has undergone a recent sudden change. It would appear from the English Law Reform Commission's report that no such change has taken place there.  It may well be that some women have described what has happened to them as rape, although it does not amount to rape, as a form of convenient shorthand to describe what they have experienced.  I can understand that, but that would not however seem sufficient reason to change the definition of rape.  In addition the facts that rape crisis centres who assist victims of all sexual assaults put forward the view that all assaults involving sexual penetration of whatever kind should be classed as rape would undoubtedly encourage the use of such shorthand by women who come into contact with the centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another argument is that victims of serious sexual assaults not amounting to rape would benefit psychologically by describing the experience they have been subjected to as rape.  I can appreciate that argument being made in the context of the existing law where the offence charged is indecent assault and the maximum sentence is ten years imprisonment. However, any psychological <Col N="468" /> assurance that may be thought to be needed will be supplied by the obvious seriousness with which the Bill as presently drafted treats these serious sexual assaults.</P>
    <P>What we are talking about in reality is nothing more than a change in the nomenclature; that this is so is borne out by the amendments tabled by Senators Ryan, O'Toole and Fennell.  Under the amendments, acts of penetration other than rape which constitute aggravated sexual assaults, which under the Bill and under their amendments could be charged as such with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and the same safeguards for victims as exists at present for rape victims, could also be charged as rape.  That is the only change contemplated in the amendments.</P>
    <P>In my view the arguments against making that change far outweigh any arguments in favour.  Firstly, there is no consensus in favour of the change.  In the commission, the president, who is a distinguished High Court judge, and its fulltime commissioner, who has long experience in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, were against an extended definition of rape.  The Law Society and the Garda Síochána argued against it before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights and it is clear therefore that many of those who have experience in administrating the criminal law are not in favour of the proposed change.  Their views must carry considerable weight.  The current edition of the <i>Irish Law Times</i> in its editorial also argues against the extended definition of rape and states:</P>
    <P>The Bill sensibly proposes that there will be a new offence called aggravated sexual assault, ... for which the maximum penalty should be of imprisonment for life.</P>
    <P>The next major argument against extending the definition of rape is that rape is clearly distinguishable from all other forms of aggravated sexual assault.  As I have pointed out already on a number of occasions, the essential ingredient of rape <Col N="469" /> is the absence of consent to sexual intercourse. Although in many cases rape will be accompanied by violence, the essence of the crime is the absence of consent to an act which in proper circumstances constitutes an expression of human love. Absence of consent has to be proved in every case.  On the other hand, in the case of the aggravated sexual assaults we are talking about, consent will not normally arise as an issue.  Indeed, Senators Ryan, O'Toole and Fennell acknowledge that fact in the way they have drafted their amendments.  I take the point made by Senator Ryan on Committee Stage that consent might possibly be an issue in a case of oral intercourse, but I would imagine that that would be a rare occurrence.  In respect of penetration by instruments, it is inconceivable that consent would ever be an issue in such a case.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I do not fully understand the argument that the possibility of pregnancy should not be regarded as a distinguishing feature of rape.  The Supreme Court certainly considers that it is.  I would have thought that, although not the only one, the possibility of pregnancy is certainly one of its distinguishing features. It has been contended that the argument of pregnancy as a distinguishing feature is unsound because it ignores the cases of rapes committed on older women.  That is to misunderstand the position.  It is only the act of rape that can give rise to pregnancy, none of the other offences referred to can, and one cannot ignore that fact.</P>
    <P>The effect of bringing a number of offences within the definition of rape would constitute a major change in the law and I have argued that the result of doing so might have the opposite effect to that intended, that the result might well be to change the public perception of rape.  The public would no longer know when a rape as presently defined had been committed and as a result the stigma and odium which the public attach to rape could be reduced.  Senator Ryan does not agree on that point but I think there is a real danger here.</P>
    <P>There is another danger that once one <Col N="470" /> starts to extend the definition of a well known crime such as rape where does one stop?  This is a difficulty referred to in the minority commission report.  The majority recommended an extension of the definition based on the Crimes Sexual Offences Act, 1980, of the State of Victoria. Yet only recently the Law Commission of that state has recommended further changes.  There is a heavy onus on those who seek a fundamental change in the criminal law to establish the need for that change.  The present law on rape is one of long standing and gives rise to no difficulties of definition.  The Government cannot ignore the fact that the change being suggested might have results which have not been contemplated particularly when what is being proposed does not offer any material benefit in the prosecution of offences or in the legal protection afforded to victims or in deterring potential future offenders from committing offences.</P>
    <P>In my view we should think long and hard before changing the definition of rape.  I am fully satisfied that the changes in law at present contained in the Bill can be defended on the basis that they bring about obvious and desired improvements in the law.  I cannot say the same in relation to the proposal to extend the definition of rape and for these very sound reasons I must oppose those amendments.</P>
    <P>I might add one small point in relation to the amendments themselves.  Despite the obvious effort made in the amendments to make the extended definition of rape neuter in gender it has not been altogether successful, because the masculine is used in some places as intending to refer to men only and in others to other men and women.  The provisions particularly in paragraph (c) (ii) are clearly ambiguous in this regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not argue with the Minister about the ambiguity of paragraph (c) (ii).  There is another House <Col N="471" /> in which that could be tied up, so I am not going to argue about that.</P>
      <P>I am sitting here with a slightly increasing sense of distaste.  I fully accept there is no party political debate here, but there is a fairly fundamental debate about perception which has nothing to do with party politics and I am quite sure of that. I know Senator Fitzsimons a long time and I know he would not have changed his mind on this issue simply because the Minister and his party told him so. Senator Fitzsimons is a man whose record in this House on a number of issues is such that he is testimony to the Minister's eloquence and not to the Minister being a senior member of the same party.  I have an increasing sense of distaste because, with the exception of Senator Fennell, we are all men here.  The minority report of the Law Reform Commission was written by two men.</P>
      <P>The bodies which have to a greater or lesser degree resisted the extension of the definition of rape have been the Garda Síochána, who are overwhemlingly male, and the Law Society, which are still overwhelmingly male and are doing their best to preserve their bastion by their strange practices of examination.  Let us remember that the only woman member of the Law Reform Commission voted to support this change and let us remember who she was, because I think this is important if we are going to talk about needs, psychology and feelings.  The person who voted in favour of that was Ms. Maureen Gaffney, B.A., M.A., Psychologist, Eastern Health Board and a research associate, presumably in psychology, with University College, Dublin.  A psychologist, a woman who was a psychologist, and member of the Law Reform Commission, apparently she could see the validity of the extended definition.  She could see it from the point of view of defining in law what the victims feel the crime to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to get involved in a long discussion about what is or is not the appropriate form of sexual intercourse. <Col N="472" /> There is something delightfully old-fashioned about the description by the minority report: &ldquo;the sexual act which can provide the most complete expression of love between men and women and normally enables conception to take place.&rdquo;  With all due respect to the two men who wrote that, that has an echo of <i>Humanae Vitae</i> which should not be present in a legal document from a High Court judge and a professional solicitor. Sexual intercourse has developed a little bit beyond the normal conception of children stage.  It is an unworthy phrase for two such august gentlemen to put into a report.  There is a lot more to the love between men and women than the conception of children.  It says something about the perception and views of the people who wrote that minority report that they put such language into it.</P>
    <P>That is why I have an increasing sense of distaste, because the one thing that has been clear to me is that everybody who could claim to represent women and every woman who has spoken that I am aware of on this issue and all those who have dealt with the victims of rape from this issue have said two things since this Bill was published: first, that the Bill was most welcome in many aspects &mdash; that needs to be said again and again &mdash; but that the first major deficiency they say was the unwillingness to give the name of rape to offences whose victims feel themselves and believe themselves to have been raped.  I accept that the Minister has come a long way.  I accept that the idea of describing some of the appalling offences as indecent assault was wrong and that has been changed.  I accept that the concept of aggravated sexual assault has come a long way.  I accept that the trial procedures and all of those things have brought us a long way.  I do not accept that we can simply stop there and for men to say to women &mdash; this is what it has really amounted to&mdash;&ldquo;Until you can prove to us that this needs to be done, we will not do it.&rdquo;  It seems to me the reverse ought to be the case: unless we can prove to women in particular that what we are doing is better than what they want, we are obliged to listen to <Col N="473" /> those who carry the pain of this with them for the rest of their lives.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that overwhelmingly they say we should change the law and we have not the right to place on them the onus of proof.  In my view the onus of proof lies on us.  I do not like too much of this juxtaposition of men and women. But it appears to me that everybody who can talk authoritatively about the perceptions of women or the perceptions of the victims say one thing and a lot of other people say the opposite.  It is wrong to suggest that we cannot change until they prove to us.  In fact, quite the opposite should be the case: we should change unless we can prove to them and persuade them that what we are doing is necessary, just and right.</P>
    <P>May I say, in conclusion, that I accept what the Minister says.  He has a valid point about the whole relationship between rape and the possibility of pregnancy. I want to repeat again &mdash; and the Minister agreed with this on Committee Stage &mdash; that probably the worst threat of all now is the possibility of AIDS, which is worse than pregnancy.  Pregnancy as a result of rape must be awful, but let us be clear that forcible anal intercourse, involving as it probably would, blood being released, is probably the single greatest risk to a person of contracting AIDS; and, given the possibility of these crimes being committed by people who perhaps had other reasons to have contracted AIDS, this must and will be a serious and frightening experience.  That is not the central issue.  The central issue is the perception of those who are the victims of rape and the perceptions of <Col N="474" /> women generally.  I do not think their arguments have been adequately argued.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I have a considerable regret about this and I look forward to what I hope will be a resumed argument in the other House.  I know a number of the Opposition parties take a similar view to myself and my colleagues.  I sat back and tried to listen to the debate and it seems to me that what has happened is that the Minister and the minority have said: &ldquo;Maybe it is true, but until they can prove to us that it is true, we will not do it.&rdquo;  I do not think that is an adequate response. I appeal to the Minister even between now and when the Bill comes before the other House, to think about what this looks like to those out there who want something different.  How do they see it? How do they interpret it?  What do they think we are doing?  We are in danger &mdash; and I regret this very much &mdash; of spoiling the public perception of an otherwise fine piece of legislation by virtue of the omission to do what most people who want reform have asked the Minister to do.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage Senator Ryan raised a question in relation to the drafting of paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 3 (1), in particular the apparent inconsistency in referring in paragraph (a) to the penis of another person while referring in paragraph (b) to the vagina of the woman.  I undertook to consult with the parliamentary draftsman on the matter and the amendments now proposed by me will, I believe, solve the problem raised in a satisfactory manner.  I am thankful to Senator Ryan for raising the matter.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, lines 3 and 4, to delete &ldquo;of the woman assaulted&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;consent&rsquo; means a consent freely and voluntarily given and, without in any way affecting or limiting the meaning otherwise attributable to these words, a consent is not freely and voluntarily given if it is obtained by force, threat, intimidation, deception or fraudulent means;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I want to raise with the Minister a particular problem.  The Bill contains the following wording in section 8.  This is to do with the question of consent.  It states:</P>
      <P>It is hereby declared that in relation to an offence that consists of or includes the doing of an act to a person without the consent of that person any failure or omission by that person to offer resistance to the act does not of itself constitute consent to the act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a very welcome step forward. That was, unfortunately, the second part of a two-part recommendation from the Law Reform Commission, the first part of which contained a recommendation to insert a definition of consent into the Bill. The more I thought about it, the more I became somewhat concerned that the absence of a definition of consent, while I accept what the Minister has said that it has not been a problem in successfully prosecuting cases, may have been a serious deterrent to the initiation of prosecutions. There is an area in which we do not have much information.  We are trying to clarify the fact that a person who <Col N="477" /> is raped does not have to show evidence of physical resistance.  There are a whole lot of other ways of putting a person under enormous pressure to consent to sexual intercourse.  The amendment I have inserted to define the word &ldquo;consent&rdquo; is taken verbatim from the report of the Law Reform Commission.  It states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;consent means a consent freely and voluntarily given and, without in any way affecting or limiting the meaning otherwise attributable to these words, a consent is not freely and voluntarily given if it is obtained by force, threat, intimidation, deception or fraudulent means;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I thought a lot about examples where this would arise.  The one that comes to my mind and that requires a response on this issue from the Minister would relate to the offence of incest.  I am thinking in particular of a father who induces, say, a 16 year old daughter to have sexual intercourse.  It may well be that no force or threat of force was involved but I am not convinced at all that it would, by that definition of consent, be able to be said that the use of the authority of a father to induce a daughter to do something that she would otherwise not wish to do, result in a prosecution for rape under the present law.  The problem is that incest carries a maximum penalty, according to the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908, of seven years in prison.  By contrast, aggravated sexual assault and rape under previous legislation and this Bill carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. It does appear that by any reasonable standard of what should be free consent the use by a parent of the authority of a parent <i>vis-à-vis</i> a child; the use of, perhaps, financial dependence by a woman on a man where they are not married or even where they are married &mdash; the use of all of those things to induce a woman to consent to sexual intercourse involves such a diminishment of the person's freedom to dissent that consent is absent.  I very much doubt if under the present law it would be possible or likely that a member of the Garda or the Director of Public Prosecutions would prosecute for <Col N="478" /> rape.  That is the specific example that I would offer.</P>
    <P>There are ways of getting around the definition of consent which would not be susceptible to clear prosecution under the existing law.  It is necessary to state clearly that any consent which is not freely or voluntarily given, if it is obtained by force, threat, intimidation, deception or fraudulent means, is not consent.  The word &ldquo;deception&rdquo; in particular is significant. The whole area of incestuous relations, where a father uses his position <i>vis-à-vis</i> his daughter, seems to be an area in which by no standards could one believe that consent was involved in the way that we all understand it; but it could still leave young girls open to what would effectively be, in Senator Fitzsimon's phrase, a sexual violation which amounts to rape.  It is important that we should address the issue of consent, not just in terms of previous experience in terms of achieving convictions but in terms of looking at whether the absence of a definition of consent is, in fact, an inhibition to prosecution in many cases where people should be and ought to be prosecuted, not for incest but what is effectively rape.</P>

      <P>I would like to second this amendment.  I am very pleased that Senator Ryan put it down.  It was something that was dealt with in some substantial way in the report on rape of the Law Reform Commission.  The Bill will be all the better for having this amendment and this definition of consent put in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission stated in their consultation paper that they were not aware of any problems having arisen as a result of the non-definition of consent and at that point they said the law should be left as it is.  They stated: &ldquo;While no cases have been drawn to our attention in which the present law created serious difficulty, it was represented to us that it was certainly capable of doing so.  The Irish Association for Victim Support was strongly of the opinion that the absence of a definition had influenced verdicts.  It would be accordingly advantageous if the <Col N="479" /> Legislature were to clarify the law so as to put it beyond doubt the consent obtained by force or fraud was not consent. It was urged that there was a real danger of juries equating a failure to offer physical resistance with consent.&rdquo;  They went on to say: &ldquo;We feel that there is considerable merit in these arguments. As we pointed out in the Consultation Paper, the law has been put beyond doubt by legislation in Western Australia, New Zealand and Canada.  We think that the case has been established for making similar provision in this jurisdiction. Accordingly, we recommend that legislation should provide....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They continue on to suggest that the wording of the amendment as put down should be included.  I am sure that the Minister will reply and indicate his views in so far as he left out this particular section of the Law Reform Report in drafting the Bill.  With regard to consent, I think it is something that is very fundamental in charges of rape and in the hearing of rape cases.  Not very long ago a social worker in the country said to me that there are very many rape cases that are never reported and never dealt with. These are cases of young girls who get into a car with some fellow after a disco or a dance and are driven up the mountain and the car is locked and the girl cannot get out.  She is petrified and terrified and she is raped in every true sense of the word.  She feels so guilty and so bad about it but she is so unsure that she does not resist and does nothing about it. That, to me, is very regrettable.  This definition of &ldquo;consent&rdquo; would make it quite clear that behaviour such as that would be defined as rape and the basis of the rape would be that the man was deceiving the woman.  I will support this amendment and I will be very interested to hear the Minister's view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this amendment.  I think the question of consent is a very important one.  This Bill, although I regret that some of my amendments were not accepted, is a major move in the right direction and is <Col N="480" /> greatly to be welcomed.  It is appropriate that we deal with the issue of consent particularly on this day at this time because just about now there is a march of women &ldquo;reclaiming the night&rdquo; as their slogan is.  There are people who are afraid of rape and afraid that this notion of consent may occasionally be interpreted in such a way as to suggest that women in some curious manner invite rape. However, I have a specific point to make with regard to the question of consent directly related to this amendment.  I support very strongly what Senator Ryan has said on the question of incest.  I would like to emphasise by making a specific point on this issue.  I am sure the Minister will be aware that in the case of incest very frequently the child is damaged not just by the act and these acts take place frequently over a considerable number of years with what may well appear to be the consent of the victim.</P>
      <P>One of the consequences of this is that even when legal action is taken and when the culprit is punished or sent for treatment the victim is left with a very considerable sense of guilt, a sense that she or in certain circumstances he has been complicit in the sexual activities engaged in at the behest of the father.  It is particularly to obviate or to get around this very damaging by-product of such situations that I wholeheartedly support the amendment by Senator Ryan.  I am sure that this matter will be taken on board by somebody up there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As was anticipated by the movers of the amendment, I am not in a position to accept it.  The Law Reform Commission state in their annual report on rape and allied offences that they were not aware of any particular problems having arisen as a result of the non-definition of consent.  The proposed amendment would effect significant changes in the existing law which I am opposed to and which were not advocated by the commission.  The Law Reform Commission in their consultation papers were of the view that there was no need for any statutory definition of consent.  In their final report, as a result of certain <Col N="481" /> representations received, they thought it might be advantageous to clarify certain aspects of the existing law.</P>
      <P>My concern is that any statutory definition of consent would lead to confusion rather than to greater clarity and could also lead to unintended changes in the law.  The proposed amendment now before us only confirms this view.  The amendment is derived from a definition in the law of Western Australia.  A proposal to include a similar definition in the law of the state of Victoria was considered by the Law Reform Commission of Victoria in the context of their review of the law on rape in June 1987 and was strongly rejected because of the changes in the law which would be brought about by such a definition.</P>
      <P>The difficulties arise particularly in cases where consent is vitiated by the fact that it was obtained by fraud or by threats.  The existing law in the case of fraud is that there is no consent, for example, where a man induces a woman to have sexual intercourse by impersonating her husband.  In such a case a man can be found guilty of rape.  Nor is there any consent where the fraud relates to the nature of the act.  However, misrepresentations by a man as to wealth or his willingness to marry would not vitiate consent to intercourse and rape would not be committed in such circumstances. I do not accept, as this amendment proposes, that a man who persuades a woman to have sexual intercourse with him by deception as to his willingness to marry should be guilty of rape and liable to life imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of sexual intercourse obtained by threats it would be impossible in a statutory definition to draw the line between those threats under which the act would constitute rape and those which would not constitute a basis for a charge of rape.  Sexual intercourse obtained by a threat to kill or seriously injure a women clearly constitutes rape but a threat by a fiancé to break off an engagement if the women does not consent to sexual intercourse would surely not be sufficient to ground a charge of rape.  In between these two points is a <Col N="482" /> grey area which can only be resolved case by case.  Therefore, apart from the declaratory provision in section 8 of the Bill, I would be opposed to having consent statutorily defined as it would inevitably cause considerable difficulty and confusion without, on the other hand, affecting any improvement in the existing situation.  For those reasons I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has a point. I read the report.  One of the very good things about this Minister is that his replies on Second Stage are usually comprehensive and deal with most of the points raised by Members.  I wish he would have a word with some of his Cabinet colleagues on that because some of their replies are not nearly as comprehensive. I was trying to anticipate some views on a number of my amendments on other legislation and I must say the ministerial replies at the end of Second Stage did not enlighten me.  To be fair, the Minister is very good at that. I would have anticipated a reply to my amendment.  But I do not think the Minister addressed the issue.  The Minister would agree with me that a father who, using his position as a father, induces a child of his to have sexual intercourse is guilty of rape.  I do not think it is sufficient to describe it as incest.  It is my view that society at large would see that as such. The relationship between a father and a child is so unique&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I know I am totally out of order but would the Senator allow me to state that in the case of incest consent is not a requirement of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but incest is a lesser crime in terms of penalty than rape.  It carries a seven year sentence. Another way of putting it is that perhaps, in terms of the way in which the law is interpreted by those whose duty it is to enforce it, we should make sure that the concept of consent is clearly understood by the Garda.  The view the Minister has of consent is a fairly wide and broad definition of consent.  I accept that <Col N="483" /> section 8 of the Bill is a contribution towards that widening.  The example I am concerned about is the father who induces a child, by virtue of his position as her father, to have sexual intercourse. By any standards, and given the fact that this seems to be an increasing problem in our society, that ought to be defined as rape.  As far as I am concerned, it should be clearly seen as rape.  The question of what constitutes consent becomes difficult there.  I do not propose to do more than raise the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris made a very good point in that one of the real long term consequences of incest is a sense of guilt that people carry with them.  If the offence that the person was to be charged with were defined as rape it would have the consequence of transferring the guilt away from the victim and on to the perpetrator of the offence.  I suggest to the Minister that while he may not wish to put in a definition of consent he and his officials should reflect over the next few weeks on how it would be possible to interpret consent, if not define it.  I would worry about an employer who could make threats.  We discussed this earlier on Committee Stage in terms of sexual harassment.  There could be an implied threat by an employer.  I worry about a parent <i>vis-à-vis</i> a daughter.  There is an area of ambiguity there which would effectively allow somebody who had been guilty of forced sexual intercourse to plead guilty to a lesser offence of incest. I do not think that is what either I or the Minister would wish.  I ask him to think about the matter again.  I do not intend to pursue the matter.  I will withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 2 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>2.&mdash;Section 2 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the deletion in subsection (1) of &rdquo;by order&rdquo; and the substitution therefor of &ldquo;as soon as may be practicable, and if necessary,</P>
      <P>(b)  the deletion in subsection (3) of &ldquo;as he considers appropriate&rdquo; and &ldquo;in his opinion&rdquo;,</P>
      <P>(c)  the deletion of subsection (9).&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this amendment our intention is to strengthen the position of the Water Pollution Advisory Council which, I understand, is not in operation at present.  Basically we are seeking to delete &ldquo;by order&rdquo; in subsection (1).  The subsection would then read: &ldquo;That the Minister shall after consultation with any other Minister who appears to him to be interested appoint a body which shall be known as the Water Pollution Advisory Council and is in this section referred to as the Council.&rdquo;  The second part of it relates to confining to some extent the powers of the Minister relevant to the <Col N="486" /> council.  What we seek here is that subsection (3) of section 2 of the Principal Act would read: &ldquo;The Minister shall take such steps to keep the Council informed of matters relating to the control of water pollution which are likely to assist the Council in performing the functions assigned to it by subsection (2) of this section&rdquo; Finally, we are seeking to revoke section 9 of the Principal Act: &ldquo;The Minister may by order amend or revoke an order under this section&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the UK it is alleged that four million people are drinking water that is above the EC levels for nitrate content and there is a strong feeling abroad that the amount of nitrates consumed in drinking water may have some relation to cancer. The Government have abolished An Foras Forbartha and the regional development organisations and we believe that it is all the more necessary now to have a strong water pollution advisory council.  I understand the previous council consisted of county engineers and various interest groups.  Councils like this may get up the nose of Ministers at times.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at this amendment not in the context of his own stewardship but in a situation where possibly at a future time there could be a Minister who may not be as committed to solving pollution problems as he is.  This council would also provide a forum for an exchange of views based on the experience of various local authorities and in general be a body that could react quickly to developing situations.  For instance, there may be some reason at the moment to believe that nitrate and potassium levels in drinking water are on the increase.</P>
    <P>Basically, we are seeking to ensure that there is a strong Water Pollution Advisory Council as is set out in the Principal Act and that there should be a yearly report to the Minister which would be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>Slipped in at the tail-end of this Bill, in section 30 is a proposal to repeal a number of sections of the <Col N="487" /> Principal Act.  Among those is the proposal to repeal section 2.  Effectively, as the explanatory memorandum says, section 2 concerns the appointment, composition and functions of the Water Pollution Advisory Council.  Contained in a Bill whose objective, much trumpeted, is to do a wonderful job to improve the quality of the waters in this country, we actually have a proposal to abolish the Water Pollution Advisory Council.  I do not know a lot about the Water Pollution Advisory Council but I have Parts I and II of &ldquo;Water Quality in Ireland &mdash; The Current Position&rdquo; produced by An Foras Forbartha.  This was prepared by the institute for the Water Pollution Advisory Council in 1983.</P>
      <P>I am at a loss to understand how the Minister can on the one hand tell us that he is committed to rescuing our waters from the imminent peril they are in &mdash; and this report quite clearly identifies one major imminent peril in the area of eutrophication &mdash; when he abolished the body which carried out the study of water quality and he is now abolishing the body which was set up to give advice about water quality.  I do not think it is possible to be overly impressed with the Minister's commitment on this issue if he is abolishing all the independent agencies which could advise him and tell us what was actually happening.  My amendment, No. 45, suggests that the Water Pollution Advisory Council ought to be left in existence because independent advice, untrammelled by day to day considerations and not hamstrung by the Official Secrets Act, if that is possible, is what we need in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said on Second Stage that it was a matter of regret that the Minister did not have an opportunity to reply in the same depth to Second Stage as his immediate predecessor in that seat today, the Minister for Justice, has done on a couple of occasions.  His junior Minister replied with a collection of platitudes and assurances of serious consideration on Committee Stage but with no response to the specific issues that were raised on Second Stage.  That is not the first time that has <Col N="488" /> happened.  It happened on another Bill last July, and I regret that.  Members ought to know what the Minister's views are on specific issues raised on Second Stage.  One of the specific issues I raised was the question of the Water Pollution Advisory Council and the absence of independence.  What we need in our society for a clean environment are regulation, enforcement and independence. The regulations to a certain extent have been produced, though the 1977 Act was not exactly enthusiastically enforced in large areas.  We can talk about enforcement at a later stage.  Independence is a critical part of it if public trust is to be restored in the willingness and indeed the capacity of statutory authorities to enforce high standards of water protection. The abolition of An Foras Forbartha, followed now by the proposed abolition of the Water Pollution Advisory Council, is an entirely retrograde step.  I do not believe in the trust me I know what I am doing type of environmental protection.  The real basis for environmental protection is openness, the full and complete provision of information and regular monitoring and the provision of that information to the public at large. I heard the Minister speak eloquently when he was in London about the obligation of each individual to protect the environment.  It will be very difficult for any individual to contribute to the protection of our environment if most of the information is locked inside the Minister's Department or locked inside local authorities without having any independent monitoring or information gathering agency available to tell the public what is going on.</P>
    <P>I regret very much the Minister's proposal to abolish the Water Pollution Advisory Council.  However lacking in teeth that body may have been, that is a further step in the wrong direction.</P>

      <P>The Bill appears to strengthen considerably many aspects of the 1977 Act and closes many gaps that existed in that Act.  I am very worried about section 2 of the Act, which is being repealed.  It means, as other Senators mentioned, that the Water Pollution Advisory Council is being abolished.  I was on the Shannon yesterday and was quite horrified when I saw the closeness of some of the areas of pollution, such as silage pits, etc., to the water's edge.  It will be very difficult to control a lot of the pollution that we will be faced with in the future.</P>
      <P>I keep emphasising how important our waterways are.  We do not value our waterways.  Some of us do.  Some farmers are extremely worried at the present situation but there are some who do not worry about it and will try to get away with as much as they can.

    <P>The term of office of the last council ended on 31 December 1986.  In previous years the council was active in promoting an appreciation of the importance of clean water and the need to avoid pollution. It commissioned a number of reports on environmental issues, notably the 1983 review of water pollution in Ireland.  At that time the work of the council effectively filled a vacuum that <Col N="490" /> existed.  There have been some developments in recent years which have tended to diminish the score for an effective role for the Water Pollution Advisory Council in these areas.  The council's function in promoting awareness of water pollution issues was taken over by the Environmental Awareness Bureau in 1985.  With the abolition of that body in 1988 it has now reverted to the Department of the Environment and the environmental research unit.  In addition, environmental awareness promotion directed at the farming sector is now catered for by the newly established farm environmental advisory service within Teagasc.  Teagasc has organised seminars, courses and practical demonstrations in every county.  The service also offers farm assessments and advice on pollution prevention measures to individual farmers.  Recently, the Department of the Environment and Agriculture and Food co-operated on the production and distribution to approximately 200,000 farmers of a booklet on farm pollution called <i>Farmyard Wastes and Pollution.</i></P>
    <P>As regards the commissioning and publication of reports on water pollution, I assure Senators that the absence of the council will not result in any diminution of activity in this area.  In fact, my Department commissioned a further review of water quality in Ireland, which was published in 1987.  That is the one that Senator Ryan has in his possession today and he also had it with him on Second Stage.  It might be interesting to note that it was the Department of the Environment who asked An Foras Forbartha to do that report in 1987.  It was prepared at our request, not at the request of any other party or body.  I intend that such periodic reviews will continue and will be produced in the future by the Environmental Research Unit.  They will also be published.</P>
    <P>The decision to abolish the council as provided for in section 30 of the Bill reflects the Government's commitment to rationalise the manner in which public services are provided.  I cannot accept these amendments.  I would remind <Col N="491" /> Senators that the advisory body referred to by them got involved in useful work so far as the publication and circulation of leaflets and posters were concerned.  It also commissioned some reports.  None of that activity has diminished: in fact, it has increased in volume under the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>I should like to put at rest one particular item that has cropped up on more than one occasion and has been referred to again here by Senator Ryan in so far as An Foras Forbartha and the Environmental Research Unit are concerned. The Environmental Research Unit is collecting and publishing information and it will continue to do so.  The Official Secrets Act applies to it in the same way as the Official Secrets Act applied to An Foras Forbartha and to suggest or imply that there is any difference is misleading.</P>
    <P>I might refer to the remarks made by Senator O'Shea.  In passing, it is interesting to note that there is no problem in this country of nitrates in drinking water. It might also be wise to remember that the Water Pollution Advisory Council the Senator referred to had nothing whatever to do with the question of drinking water.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances I feel that the new arrangements are an improvement on what existed in so far as the advisory council was concerned.  It is my intention, with the new agencies which now exist, to continue to provide the level of information and the publishing of that information, as was the case in the past but at an expanded rate now.  For that reason I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>The Minister is right. The reports I have in front of me were actually produced by his Department.  It was an earlier report that the Water Pollution Advisory Council commissioned from An Foras Forbartha.  I am quite happy to be corrected by the Minister. Since I probably mentioned it on Second Stage he could have corrected it then if he had been here and it would have avoided the error.  I am sorry about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="492" /> The issue is not just the Water Pollution Advisory Council.  The issue is how we create a clean environment in this country and how we manage to do that in tandem with proper economic development. The increasing evidence &mdash; the Minister may not be aware of this &mdash; is of overwhelming popular distrust of the agencies of the State in their role as defenders of our environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true.  I tried not to interrupt the Minister, he should not interrupt me.  He does not know the state of public opinion that exists in the lower harbour in Cork and in east Cork over certain industrial developments.  He must not be aware of what is happening in the country.  The one thing I would not accuse the Minister of is being unaware of what is happening in the country.  He has a very close ear to what is happening.  We will just have to disagree on that point.</P>
      <P>I know and I am satisfied that there is an increasing popular distrust, an increasing belief that local authorities cannot be trusted to protect the environment and that State agencies cannot be trusted to protect the environment.  The outrageous attack by the manager of the IDA on environmental groups is the sort of thing that confirms people's view that the State is on one side and the environment is on the other.  It does not help to do that sort of thing.  Drawing all these resources into the Department is not the way to do it.  It is important to remember that important sections of the 1977 Act, like section 15 relating to water management plants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my mistake.  It was not for me to withdraw amendment No. 1.  I am sorry.  The reason I am talking about these things is that the question is <Col N="493" /> the appropriateness of drawing the functions of a body like the Water Pollution Advisory Council into the Department. The point I am making is that I am of the opinion &mdash; I think the facts bear it out &mdash; that there is increasing public distrust. The Hanrahan case in south Tipperary and the apparent lack of a capacity, willingness or ability on the part of State agencies to protect the owner of that farm or to identify the problems on the farm, necessitating for him an extremely stressful passage through the Supreme Court, does not help public opinion.  The fact that smells in Cork harbour cannot be identified does not help public opinion. The gross inadequacies in some of the studies that were done for the Killeagh project does not help public opinion.  It is not the way to convince public opinion to draw these functions into a State agency under direct political control of the Minister of the day.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the fact &mdash; the Minister has said it on at least one occasion &mdash; that members of An Foras Forbartha were covered by the Officials Secrets Act.  That was a most regrettable fact but drawing the body closer to the apparatus of State does not somehow excuse that.  What we needed was legislative independence for bodies like An Foras Forbartha so that they could become effective environmental protection agencies, operating independently of politics, of pressure groups and simply defining base line standards and enforcing them where they saw fit.</P>
      <P>It is an unfortunate fact that no industry proposed by the Industrial Development Authority, to my knowledge, has ever been refused planning permission by any local authority.  Effectively, the only real filter we have is the Industrial Development Authority.  If they say it is all right, then everybody else apparently organises themselves to go along with it. That is not the way to convince the public that we have effective environmental protection.  There are multiple instances in this Bill of ambiguities which I do not believe are the way to reassure the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 15 of the Principal Act to do with water quality management plans, <Col N="494" /> is barely started.  In the case of only four river areas have water pollution management plans been completed.  No local authority has ever been directed to produce such a plan and in the case of most rivers plans are in preparation and will be produced at some stage in the future.</P>
    <P>Section 26, which gives the Minister the authority to specify standards for sewage effluent, has never been used to specify standards for sewage effluent.  It is a question again of &ldquo;trust me, I know what I am doing, it will all happen eventually.&rdquo; The record of central Government on enforcement of specific areas of legislation in existence for 12 years does not reassure the public.  Therefore, to draw back into that Department areas of activity which could have given some semblance of independence is the wrong way to go.</P>
    <P>It is not simply the existence of the Water Pollution Advisory Council that is at issue here.  It is the philosophical background to such a decision of centralising areas of activity back into the Department.  I know material will be published, I know material can be published. I am not certain that all material will be published at any stage in the future because the controversies are going to get worse, not better.  As the Minister is aware, we are running into a world environmental crisis and serious decisions and choices will have to be made.  It will not be solved by platitudes and by simply hoping for the best.  It will be solved by public opinion learning and knowing what is happening to our country.  That will happen only when people believe they are getting reliable, independent and trustworthy information, untrammelled by concerns about the views of the IDA or local authorities or anybody else about the need for one thing or another.  We need independent information.  This section as it stands is moving against creating a proper climate of public opinion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to approach this constructively and I would like to say at the outset that I believe the Minister is <Col N="495" /> making every effort to improve our legislation. There is one misgiving I still have &mdash; Senator Ryan has alluded to this to some extent.  In regard to the Water Pollution Advisory Council, there was an independence there.  I would ask the Minister does the same independence exist with his Environmental Research Bureau?  Is that purely internal in the Department?  From the terms of reference here the Minister can set up the type of water pollution advisory council he wishes and ask various interest groups in.  There are people in the environmental lobby who perhaps could cause a lot of annoyance to Ministers and so on, but these people have their place as part of a process and I believe that we should cater for them under legislation.  I share the misgivings of Senator Ryan about centralising everything into the Department. I would prefer to be in the situation where we have a relatively independent organisation monitoring the scene.</P>
      <P>With regard to what I said about nitrate in drinking water, this is caused in the main by water courses becoming polluted with nitrates from agricultural uses and there is some evidence that this problem may be increasing in the country.  It is something that needs to be watched very carefully because, as the Minister knows, once the nitrates and, indeed, potassium are in water courses, it takes a long, long time to clear water courses again.  If the Minister can assure me that there will be independent monitoring away from very direct control inside the Department, I certainly would be happy to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I would go along with every attempt to improve the legislation to avoid pollution of any sort in waterways.  It is essential that there would be an independent body to monitor possible sources of pollution because there is a genuine fear among the people now &mdash; and this fear must be allayed &mdash; that there is not enough manpower in the first instance to do the monitoring that is necessary.  The very last line in the explanatory memorandum with this Bill <Col N="496" /> says that the Bill does not give rise to any additional financing or staffing costs.  If there is now such public awareness about pollution, the dangers and possible sources of pollution, how can all possible sources be monitored properly without additional staff or additional cost?  The staff is simply not there in local authorities to do that.  The great fear of the people is that we will end up with legislation on paper that will not improve the situation on the ground.  As previous speakers said, we are going to hear more and more about pollution and the sources of pollution because there is now a genuine public awareness about pollution and the dangers of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon de Buitléar</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister what the function of the Central Fisheries Board will be in monitoring pollution? I find them an excellent body.  I have never reported a case of pollution to them that they have not reacted to it. They have sent out their inspectors and, indeed, have brought culprits to court as a result of the inspection.  What function will they be playing in relation to pollution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Senator de Buitléar there is no change at all in so far as the fishery bodies are concerned.  They are unaffected by this legislation.  So there is no change there.</P>
      <P>I would have to say that the issue we are talking about is the question of the Water Pollution Advisory Body in so far as the substance of these amendments is concerned.  It should be remembered that the Water Pollution Advisory Body never did any monitoring of anything ever and it had no staff to do that kind of thing. So we must not get the issue confused.  I am not satisfied that there is any increased distrust in the public mind in so far as agencies controlling or advising on environmental matters are concerned. I am going to make it quite clear as to why I think that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Foras Forbartha is referred to continuously in this debate.  It might be of interest to Senators to remember that An <Col N="497" /> Foras Forbartha, throughout its complete life of some 23 to 25 years, was chaired by a civil servant of Assistant Secretary status for the entire period of its life.  Everybody is telling me how magnificently independent it was, a super independent body.  So let us at least remember that it was chaired by a civil servant for its lifetime.  Let us remember also that its work programme throughout its entire existence was approved by the Department.  In addition, it was financed virtually in its entirety by departmental funds.  This is the body that I am continually reminded was a super independent body and had the freedom to do this, that and the other.  So be it.  My case is made.  The Environmental Research Unit will have the same freedom.  There will be no difference.  It is not going to have any restrictions placed upon it other than were placed on An Foras Forbartha in so far as the Official Secrets Act was concerned.  That was a red herring I disposed of in the other House on more than one occasion.  It is not now being canvassed anywhere.  I would have to say, just to make it an even stronger situation still in so far as the publishing and the giving of information to the general public on all matters concerned with its activity are concerned and, in fact, on environmental matters generally, I am taking the unique step inside the next few weeks, as announced by myself at the recent Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis, that a new information unit is being set up by me in the Department, which will be available not just to students of the environment but individual groups or members of the general public to seek information about any matter that we have a responsibility for.</P>
    <P>That is the most advanced step ever taken by any Minister for the Environment since the foundation of this State. That kind of openness pervades the whole system that I have created in so far as the environment is concerned down from the Custom House and for the life of me I cannot understand why some Senators will persist in trying to see that in some way there is a curtailment now of independence in so far as An Foras <Col N="498" /> Forbartha's replacement is concerned when you recognise the history, the formation, the financing and the staffing of that body.  Let us at least be square about it.  This amendment cannot stand up in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>Senator McCormack raised the question about staff matters.  What I am saying is that I see nothing wrong in having qualified engineers carrying out monitoring work for local authorities or agencies involved in monitoring.  If there is excess staff in certain areas because of depleted programmes or changed programmes of activity by authorities, then there is nothing wrong with deploying existing staff to deal with matters related to monitoring of the environment.  They are increasingly involved in that kind of work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister very nicely said that there might be excess staff in county councils because of changes in work procedures.  If this Bill becomes law will the local authorities have the same function and how can they carry out that added responsibility if, as the Minister acknowledges, there is change in circumstances? A change in circumstances means cut-backs in local authority budgets. They cannot have the same number of staff.  Staff being let go are not replaced.  In those circumstances how can they take on the extra responsibilities involved in this Bill without some other aspect of their work suffering?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it like this to the Senator that local authorities deploy whatever staff they have available to them to best advantage.  Do not forget the existing Act.  The Principal Act is already part of the responsibility and they are in fact carrying out their functions under it.  Despite what some Senators might suggest, they do take action on a wide range of subjects under the Act. In fact, several cases were taken in the recent past in the southern part of Ireland and are currently being processed through the courts.  We know of some famous High Court actions that are currently being processed there as well.  It is not right to say that they are not active in carrying out their functions as indicated. If Senator McCormack had been here during the Second Stage debate, I gave in quite some detail the total staff, technicians, hydrologists, administrative staff, engineers and others.  I gave the details of the numbers employed in a professional way in applying this legislation. As far as I am concerned, not a bad foireann le haghaidh na hoibre.  In those circumstances, while I recognise the Senator's point that local authorities of course would love to have extra staff &mdash; everybody wants extra staff &mdash; I am satisfied that the staffing arrangements and the possibilities for redeployment and the deployment of existing staff into works related to the environment are adequate to deal with the matter, as instanced by the increased level of activity in prosecutions and court hearings last year.</P>

The commission was included in the definition of board of conservators in section 1 of the 1977 Act and as powers have now passed to the regional boards from the boards of conservators the amendment is necessary to maintain the position existing under the 1977 Act.

The last time there was a major debate in the Seanad on a related matter it was indicated that the fisheries boards were under scrutiny, that there was a debate going on and a report out, in fact that the fisheries boards would be abolished.  Would that have an effect on this?  Supposing that power were transferred to the fisheries boards and then, according to the plans of the Government of about a year ago, the fisheries boards went out of existence, where would the power go, or is the idea of abolishing the fisheries boards now abandoned altogether?</P>

      <P>I welcome that. It clarifies the position of the original subsection (5) (a) which led to considerable confusion as it suggested that some trade effluents could be exempted. It is now evident that only a trade effluent for which a licence exists is exempt. Section 3 (2) (a) is a welcome amendment. It allows provision to amend Acts which conferred exemptions on certain activities such as Shannon Electricity Act, 1925, Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, Turf Development Act, 1946, and Local Authority (Works) Act, 1949.  This came against the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board on the Dargle River only last summer when they were working on a bridge there.  Some of the material got into the river and of course there was a very serious fish kill and they did not succeed in bringing the council to court.</P>
      <P>I am worried about the effluent.  I would ask the Minister to start moving as quickly as possible on that amendment, especially in relation to the Turf Development Act, in relation to Bord na Móna. There are some terrible problems with silt on the Oranmore River, in Tullaghan Bay, the draft netting pollution of beaches and the effect on shell fish stocks in the Ballycroy area and also in the River Deel and Lough Conn.  I know that Bord na Móna have done some work and they do not admit that they are at fault; but salmon cannot spawn, shell fish have been affected and I think it is most unfair that the board can get away with this sort of thing.  I would ask the Minister to act on that amendment.</P>

      <P>I am aware of many of the matters referred to by Senator de <Col N="503" /> Buitléar, in particular the Ballycroy one in my own constituency.  It is quite extraordinary how you can have sea pollution attached to some of these discharges or poor management.  This gives the opportunity to tighten up on that.  He may also be aware of Lough Derg.  Sediment is building up there, too, to an unacceptable level.  He can be happy in the knowledge that I would be aware of these things and that this gives us an opportunity of strengthening our hand in that regard.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to make additional funding available to Bus Éireann in order to maintain the school transport service at its present level throughout 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the third time I have spoken on this issue in the House in the past 12 months. <Col N="504" /> I raised it first in June of last year on the Adjournment and I raised it again on 8 February this year.  There is an ongoing situation of uncertainty which we in the Labour Party feel requires clarification urgently.  The Minister, Deputy Fahey, who responded to us in the House on the last occasion on 8 February told us that the Department were saying to Bus Éireann that they had to provide the service without any reduction or without increased charges on the money that has been allocated.  We would contend very strongly that this Pontius Pilate attitude to what is a very severe problem and a problem that is going to get worse is just not good enough.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a company which employs many people.  There are, for instance, 1,600 drivers of private contract buses in the school transport system and there are 1,100 people working for Bus Éireann in school transport.  Last year we had the spectre of privatisation being floated, and in four counties &mdash; Sligo, Laois, Cavan and Clare, the business of privatisation was at an advanced stage. Just before I raised this matter in the Seanad last June the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, met with a high-powered delegation from the Congress of Trade Unions which included representatives of the teachers' unions.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to say that the General Secretary of my own union who was subsequently to become the President of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions was one of that delegation.  The teachers' unions were there to show their support for Bus Éireann because of the excellent service which was being provided.  Indeed, the excellence of the service was referred to by the Minister in her speech on the Adjournment in June of last year and again by the Minister in February.</P>
    <P>The problem arises regarding the allocation. Last year £1.5 million was withdrawn from the allocation at the end of the year.  This remains a debt for Bus Éireann and I would suggest is causing a certain problem with the finalising of accounts there.  Then we found out last October that 18 per cent of the allocation, which is somewhere in the region of £5.8 <Col N="505" /> million of the estimated cost of the running of the service, was being withdrawn. We were talking about a figure as estimated by Bus Éireann to run the service of £35.3 million in 1989.  Out of that £35.3 million some £3.7 million comes in in charges.  The net cost to the Department would be in the region of £31.6 million. There is a further £5.7 million taken out of this.  The directions are that there is to be no reduction in service, there are to be no increased charges.  This just does not add up.  It makes absolutely no sense because since 1986 in real terms the cost of running the service has been reduced to £3 million.</P>
    <P>What are the alternatives?  We have had, as I said the last time I spoke here, a very prominent trade union representative saying that 800 jobs would be at risk and 70,000 school children nationwide in September of this year, will face very severe problems.  That is 70,000 out of 170,000 children who are catered for.</P>
    <P>The Department continue to make payments at the 1988 level.  The upshot of this is that come September there is going to be a very, very serious problem regarding funding.  In fact, it is highly questionable how efficiently the system will run and, as I said, one prediction from a trade union source is that 800 jobs are at risk and that 70,000 children nationwide could be without the service.</P>
    <P>The Department, and the Minister as I understand it, have had no discussions with Bus Éireann, with CIE or with any interested party as to what is to happen in September.  Indeed, a spokesman for the Department was quoted on the &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme earlier this year as saying that there would be no diminution of services in the present school year.  As we all know, the present school year continues until the end of June.  What is going to happen in September? It is not good enough, it makes no sense.  Bus Éireann from about April each year start to do their forward planning for the September intake.  On the basis of what is happening at the moment how can they plan?  Is it the secret intention of the Department, their unstated intention, to introduce charges?  There is <Col N="506" /> a formula into which the charges will fit very neatly, that is, if you introduce £1 per week charge for the primary school children who are presently travelling free and the children in secondary schools who pay £20 per term up to intermediate certificate and pay £34 per term from intermediate to leaving certificate subject to a family maximum of £70.  If these charges were doubled it brings in a very neat figure of £5.7 million.  We in the Labour Party would be utterly and absolutely opposed to any such move.  We certainly fervently hope that it is not the intention of the Department to do this. Not alone do the Members of this House and the Members of the other House have a right to know what is intended, the people involved with Bus Éireann, whether they are the drivers who work directly for Bus Éireann, supervisory staff, administrative staff, or indeed the contractors who provide 40 per cent of the service to Bus Éireann, they deserve to know where they stand in September.</P>
    <P>The other side of the coin is this.  If these charges are not introduced &mdash; and let me state again my absolute and utter opposition to any such move &mdash; how can services be maintained?  The Minister owes it to this House to tell us exactly what is envisaged.  To sit there and make bland statements, such as the Department expects Bus Éireann to provide the service without any reduction and without any introduction of charges or increases of existing charges, just is not right and is an insult to the Oireachtas. Two of us here present are teachers.  Our colleagues want to know what is happening. The stark reality is that Bus Éireann has come out of last year down £1.5 million.  They are being paid at the 1988 rate, for this year.  Is there any plan in the Department?  Is this some sort of blunt instrument type of Thatcherism &mdash; that you say you are not giving the money, let September roll on, some kind of a service is there and some jobs may be lost?</P>
    <P>That brings us to another question. Under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> any forced redundancies in the public service are not allowed.  That was <Col N="507" /> at the basis of the meeting held just before I raised this matter in June of last year and, indeed, the Minister for Education and her colleague, the Minister for Labour, were present.  One outcome of that meeting, which I know still irks trade union representatives, was that the Minister gave an undertaking at that meeting to respond in writing to Congress. My information is that that never happened.  She did make contact by phone later on in the summer, but we still have the situation that we are facing charges, facing vastly reduced services or we are facing redundancies.  There is only one solution to this, there is only one way in which this can be done, and that is by putting back the money which was taken out because there is no fat in the estimate from Bus Éireann.</P>
    <P>I believe, and I stated this when I was dealing with this problem, that the real reason why the privatisation moves were made last year was related to the problem of the replacement of the fleet of school buses presently operated by Bus Éireann. I instanced at that time how the Minister for Education had spoken about £80 million to replace all the buses.  The Minister for Finance had a different figure; his figure was £50 million.  The figure of Bus Éireann for new buses was £20 million. If we take the middle figure, the £50 million figure of the Minister for Finance, and divide that by the number of buses it comes out at £100,000 per bus &mdash; the cost, in fact, of a super coach.  Therefore, the figures of the Minister for Education and the figures of the Minister for Finance were way off target.  Bus Éireann have been replacing their fleet and at this stage 130 of the older Bedford school buses have been replaced by 95 former service buses and 32 secondhand buses.  I explained, when I spoke here last June, how those buses were available.  The board of CIE have taken a decision to provide an additional 32 secondhand buses and 20 further service buses in the present year, so that by the end of 1989 Bus Éireann will have replaced 182 of its buses at absolutely no cost to the Exchequer.  Let me stress here again that <Col N="508" /> we are talking about a company that has streamlined its operation very much on the capital side and I have outlined this in terms of the replacement of fleet.  On the revenue side I pointed out that since 1986 Bus Éireann, in real terms, are running the service for £3 million less.</P>
    <P>There are no discussions going on.  The Department has just ignored the situation. My colleague, Senator Ferris, will deal later on in more specific detail with the concerns of the trade union movement and indeed with the concerns of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The issue is considered so important that the major union involved, the Irish Transport Union, has directly communicated with the Taoiseach seeking a meeting, because they feel that no progress is being made with the Minister.  There is no progress and no meetings are taking place.  It is not good enough.  What exactly are the Department at?  They seem to be into an ongoing exercise of crucifying employees of Bus Éireann, parents, children, who as time goes on are in great doubt about what service will be there and whether there is the possibility of charges.  Let me say, in case I forgot to say it earlier, that charges are totally unacceptable.  The Minister owes this House the answer to our questions.</P>
    <P>There is only one answer to this problem, there is only one solution to it so that services can be maintained at their present level without any introduction of charges and that is to put back the money that has been taken out.  As well as the £5.7 million taken out this year there was £1.5 million taken out last year.  I would like the Minister to tell us why that £1.5 million was taken out and on what basis it was taken out.  There seems to be almost an &ldquo;ask me a number&rdquo; approach regarding reductions for school transport. It seems to be an area that is particularly targeted for privatisation; but, on the other hand, the Minister for Education's discussions with private bus operators did not indicate that they would feel capable of running the service.  Indeed, the Department found that the operations that were to have come on stream in the four counties last year were not cost <Col N="509" /> effective and were not going to improve the system.  I am at a loss in regard to this.  That is why I keep trying to find out the rationale behind it.  Why not state intentions?  We had the Book of Estimates in October.  We had the budget in January.  Still the Department are not telling us what they intend to do.</P>
    <P>May I refer to the amendment that is being proposed by the Government?  It is mind-boggling.  It says it &ldquo;notes the Government's decision to maintain school transport services at present levels throughout 1989 within existing criteria and at no increased charges.&rdquo;  Admittedly, that is rather difficult to understand. This is the sort of amendment on which Government Senators can argue that they supported virtually anything on it.  It notes the Government's decision.  I note that there is no confidence in that motion regarding the Government's ability to deliver on its decision.  It is a question of sufficient money not being there. This is merely a noting amendment.  It is telling us nothing except that the Seanad notes the Government's decision.  Everybody who knows anything about education or school transport knows very well that it is utterly and absolutely impossible to provide the service at the same level as at present without charges for the rest of this year.  The system will work until June, but there is a very large crisis facing us in September.  It is about time this Government came clean with the people who work in Bus Éireann, with the contractors who are employed by Bus Éireann, with the parents, children and teachers.</P>
    <P>We talk about planning for education. How can anyone plan for education? How can parents plan with any confidence for education when they just do not know what sort of services will be available to their children.  Perhaps this is? just a cynical exercise in the Department, saying that they expect Bus Éireann to come up with a proposal on how services can be maintained and no charges introduced inside the present rules and perhaps in late summer there will be a Supplementary Estimate coming from somewhere and the money will be found <Col N="510" /> then.  That is something that may happen. If that is what is about to happen, it is cynical and a crime against the young people of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion in the name of the Labour Party.  We totally reject the Government side's amendment which, if you read it as Senator O'Shea has read it on to the record, is either the miracle of the loaves and fishes or a three-card trick &mdash; now you see it and now you do not see it.  It is impossible for us, no matter how responsible we are in this House, to relate this amendment to the Estimates published under this heading. It is impossible to look at the estimate prepared by Bus Éireann and the trade union movement and to reconcile that with any statement that has been made by the Minister, the Government or indeed by the Minister of State who is present.  We welcome the Minister of State, Deputy F. Fahey, who has always been helpful and co-operative with us. However, we feel that tonight the Minister herself should be here because there is a case to answer and there is no satisfaction forthcoming from the Minister in this area.  We are afraid that the case to be answered is not being answered.  I shall quote the Minister of State's response to Senator O'Shea on the Adjournment Debate on 8 February.  We would not be wasting our Private Members' time again if we were not concerned that there is a major problem about to arise in this area, an area that affects many people.</P>
      <P>The Minister on that occasion, on 8 February 1989, column 2120 of the Official Report, said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, the Senator will be aware that substantial savings are required in the current year, as he has pointed out, and are expected through the entire system of Bus Éireann.  For the present it is the intention to examine all possible avenues for a reduction of expenditure within these existing structures. I consider it a matter for Bus Éireann to come forward with proposals for savings on administration and other <Col N="511" /> costs which will meet the Government's target without reducing services to schools.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that in February, which means that he is looking for additional savings to meet the demand of the Government.  The Minister then says in her amendment that the service is going to be continued as it is.  The Estimates published this year, passed by the Dáil, show £25.8 million under this heading. Taking into account the contribution from parents and children of £3.7 million, it is still a total of £31.6 million.  That in the considered opinion of Congress and of Bus Éireann is £5.8 million short of what is required but the problem is compounded by the fact that the Department withdrew £1.5 million from Bus Éireann at the end of last year, which represented a short fall on the previous year.</P>
    <P>Bus Éireann are expected to carry an overall shortfall this year of £7.3 million and still maintain the service.  Bus Éireann are saying, and rightly so, that that cannot be done without serious consequences for the service itself.  We reckon that on the division of this allocation this service will discontinue in September unless the Minister is honest enough to say that there is going to be a Supplementary Estimate.  From all the statements so far that we can garner, there is no Supplementary Estimate forthcoming.</P>
    <P>This does not just involve people employed in the public sector represented by the Congress of Trade Unions.  As is pointed out by Senator O'Shea, this involves many private contractors as well, and rightly so, because we have advocated that this school transport system can only function if it is a mixed system of the public and private sectors operating this service throughout Ireland.  The difficulties of servicing rural Ireland properly means that there has to be a mix.  There are 770 Bus Éireann school buses, 40 minibuses, 100 service buses on a part-time basis and the extensive use of existing scheduled services. So Bus Éireann within their remit can <Col N="512" /> manage with the estimate that was given last year to actually provide a service with the exception of the £1.5 million shortfall.  The private sector are producing about 1,100 private contractors who employ themselves about 350 buses and 1,250 minibuses or motorcar systems. This involves a total employment in the public sector of about 1,089 people and the private contractors employ about 1,600 people.</P>
    <P>The private contractors have confirmed that it would be administratively impossible for them to carry these children throughout the country, so there should be no question of privatisation in this sector.  There are 86,000 post-primary children, 59,000 primary school children, 9,000 special school classes &mdash; handicapped and otherwise &mdash; 12,000 concessionary passengers carried in total, of which Bus Éireann deals with 60 per cent or 99,000, and Bus Éireann through the private operators contract out the other 40 per cent, which is 67,000.  Those are extraordinarily high numbers of people who are depending on this service. The board of Bus Éireann and the Congress of Trade Unions are so concerned that they have decided that the Minister has not properly addressed this problem, and so much so that they have taken it upon themselves to write directly to the Taoiseach.  If there was a dialogue going on between the Minister, as she said there was about to be, and Bus Éireann or indeed the Trade Union Movement, whose members cannot be made compulsorily redundant, there would be no need for the Irish transport workers to write to An Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, in the following terms:</P>
    <P>Dear Taoiseach,</P>
    <P>Thank you for your letter of the 28th February in relation to Bus Éireann School Transport Scheme.</P>
    <P>It was necessary to write to you initially on the 10th January, in view of the manner in which Bus Éireann is being denied the necessary financial support to operate the Schools Transport Scheme.  There was a shortfall of £1.5 million in payments from the <Col N="513" /> Department of Education in 1988.  The provision by the Department for 1989 in respect of the School Transport Scheme is £25.8 million, which leaves the Company short of finance by £5.8 million or £7.3 million in total.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is only a matter of time before large-scale redundancies occur within Bus Éireann unless there is corrective action taken by the Government. Should these redundancies take place, it would certainly be at variance with the intent and spirit of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> between the social partners.</P>
    <P>We believe that plans currently being debated at Department of Education level, to privatise the School Transport Scheme even on a pilot basis, if proceeded with will decimate this Company, which currently employs just over 2,000 people.</P>
    <P>Taoiseach, it was against this background and coupled with the Minister for Education's negative responses to various representations over a period of time on this vital subject, that I found it necessary to write to you on 10th January last.</P>
    <P>That is a damning letter to the Taoiseach from the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.  It is a condemnation of the attitude of the Minister for Education and how she deals with this problem.  It is triggered off by representations within the trade union movements which have been made to us and have indeed been put in writing to Mr. Kennedy, the Managing Director of Bus Éireann, who has replied to the Congress of Trade Unions as follows:</P>
    <P>The current financial position is as follows:</P>
    <P>(1) in 1988, full services were provided during that year at a total cost of £31.8 million to the Department of Education.  When the final payment for these services was made by the Department of Education, a sum of £1.5 million was deducted and has since not been paid.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="514" /> You, Minister, are stealing money they need to run the service and if that money is not replaced I am afraid that Bus Éireann, as it is constituted, will not be able to survive.  Decisions have been made by people who are outside the political arena.  It is our statutory responsibility to pin the Minister with the responsibility for making the case to Cabinet in the presence of the Taoiseach, to ensure that the service which she has committed herself to retaining remains as it is.  That can only be done by a Supplementary Estimate or budget at the end of the year.  They cannot continue stealing the subsidy from Bus Éireann.  If they do, a Chathaoirligh, it means there will be an intent to cross-subsidise within Bus Éireann, Iarnród Éireann and Dublin Bus.  There is no way this can be done without damage to the overall structures. We have a responsibility in this area.  I hope the Minister on this occasion will respond positively to the Labour Party's pleading for the service.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>notes the Government's decísíon to maintain the school transport services at present levels throughout 1989 within existing criteria and at no increased charges.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted, as I am sure the Minister is, that we are debating this motion and the amendment to it tonight.  The motion raises the question as to what exactly the position will be in relation to the school transport service during 1989.  It is important that this situation should be clarified for everybody's benefit.  By everybody I <Col N="515" /> mean pupils, parents, teachers and school authorities and also Bus Éireann who provide the service as agent for the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>I say this because the school transport service is a very important service.  It is particularly important in the part of the country which I come from, and indeed throughout most of rural Ireland.  Without such a service many thousands of pupils would have extreme difficulty in attending school on a regular basis.  It is no harm to point out that the present school transport scheme was inaugurated in 1968.  This year marks its coming of age.  I believe that everyone concerned can look back with satisfaction on the operation of the scheme over the 21 years which have elapsed since then.  As a result of the post-primary school transport scheme, access to second level, and consequently to third level education, became a reality for many families for whom prior to 1968 such access was only a dream.</P>
    <P>The proposer and seconder of the motion made great play of the fact that there has been a reduction in the 1989 Department of Education provision for school transport and they have raised many questions in relation to the level of service which will obtain during the remainder of the current year.  The amendment, however, sets out exactly what the position will be for the rest of 1989.  The Government's decision is that throughout 1989 the school transport services will be maintained at present levels within existing criteria and without increased charges.  I am satisfied this decision will be widely welcomed throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Government are striving for greater cost efficiency in the operation of the school transport service should be commended rather than criticised. Despite the reduction in the Estimate, to which the mover and seconder of the motion referred, the payment which will be made by the Department of Education to Bus Éireann for the provision of the school transport service will <Col N="516" /> still be in excess of £26 million.  In anybody's language this is a substantial amount of taxpayers' money.  Besides, as I understand the situation, the payment from the Department of Education to Bus Éireann for transport services is only part of what Bus Éireann get by way of subvention from the Exchequer.  Therefore, the reduction in the payment for the school transport service cannot be looked at in isolation from Bus Éireann's overall operation.  It must be looked at in the context of that company's total budget.</P>
    <P>The Government have a responsibility to the taxpayers of the country to ensure that the greatest possible value is got for every pound of public money spent.  It is only right they should demand that Bus Éireann, in common with every other State organisation, should strive for greater efficiency.  The greater the level of efficiency which is achieved in every sector, the more substantial will be the savings which will be made.  The Government would be failing in their duty if they did not strive for such efficiency.</P>
    <P>It is not correct to suggest that efficiency can only be achieved at the expense of the service or by a curtailment of the service.  In fact, not alone could greater efficiency lead to substantial savings but it could also result in an even better service.  I believe it is generally recognised that, in common with other State companies in recent times, there is an increasing level of efficiency in Bus Éireann.  Consequently, I am confident there will be little difficulty in maintaining the school transport service at present levels on a reduced budget.</P>
    <P>I would not presume to tell Bus Éireann where to look for economies but I am satisfied that there must be areas of the country where it would be possible to rearrange the service so that a greater number of fee-paying pupils could be accommodated.  I believe the operation of the service in every part of the country should be examined with a view to reducing cost and generating more income. When the school bus routes were originally designated I am satisfied that pupil distribution at that time was a significant <Col N="517" /> factor in influencing the decisions which were made in relation to routes and pick-up points.  In many areas the position in regard to pupil distribution has changed very much over the years.  Yet, in the majority of such areas the traditional routes are the ones which are still being used; the routes which were serviced by a big bus are still being serviced by a big bus and the routes which were serviced by a minibus are still being serviced by a minibus.  These are all matters which could be looked at in the context of seeking greater cost efficiency.</P>
    <P>I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate Bus Éireann on the arrangements which the company devised last year to facilitate the replacement of the school bus fleet as the need for this arises. These arrangements should have the effect of reducing maintenance, repair and running costs over the coming years. In addition, I am quite sure that Bus Éireann, like every other individual and organisation in the country, will have benefited from such factors as reduced interest rates and the other reduced operating costs which have become a fact of life since the Government came to office.</P>
    <P>It is heartening to note that there will be no increase in school transport charges in 1989.  I am not opposed to the principle of making reasonable charges for services paid for out of public funds, provided that the people who are asked to pay the charges are in a position to do so without undue hardship.  Charging for services results in a greater public appreciation of the value of the services for which the charges are made.  However, in the case of school transport charges one has to take account of the many parents who are only slightly above the medical card eligibility limits and who have great difficulty in meeting all the costs associated with keeping children in education.  In most cases such parents are not eligible to qualify for the free book scheme and they must also meet exam entrance fees in full.  This, of course, raises the question of whether entitlement to a medical card should be the criterion on which decisions in relation to all these matters should be based.  This is a question I have raised <Col N="518" /> many times both in this House and outside.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the scheme will be 21 years in existence this year.  I feel it is appropriate that we should compliment CIE, and more recently Bus Éireann, on the manner in which they have handled the operation over that period.  Over the years as a public representative I have had occasion from time to time to contact the school transport office for my own area which is based in Athlone.  At various times I have had queries in relation to changes in bus routes, pick-up points or catchment boundary problems or other problems which are brought to my attention and I always found the people with whom I dealt to be most courteous and most helpful.  They were always prepared to listen and discuss every case at length.  While my representations were not always successful I was on every occasion given detailed explanations and reasons for the decisions which had been taken.</P>
    <P>I would also like to pay tribute to all the drivers who have been involved in the school transport scheme over the years. They have an exceptional record for safety and efficiency over the 21 years the scheme has been in operation.  I think the record will show that both accidents and complaints against drivers have been very few and far between.</P>
    <P>While the day-to-day operation of the scheme is carried out by Bus Éireann as agent for the Minister for Education, it is a matter for the Department of Education to determine the eligibility of pupils for the scheme.  In this regard I would like to pay a tribute to the Minister for Education, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, and to her Minister of State, Deputy F. Fahey, who is here this evening, for their willingness at all times to listen to representations in relation to school transport problems and the individual cases of hardship which inevitably arise from time to time.  My experience is that both the Minister and the Minister of State are at all times prepared to have such cases investigated and to respond in a positive manner whenever possible.</P>
    <P>I am sure that everybody in this House <Col N="519" /> and everybody involved with or with an interest in education will welcome the Government's decision to maintain the school transport services at the current levels and within the existing criteria during 1989.  Because of the Government's decision as outlined in the amendment, the extra funding which the motion calls for is not necessary and I would, therefore, ask the House to give its approval to the amendment.</P>

      <P>On the question of the transport service for school children I would like to put the emphasis on employment.  I would like to read a letter to the Taoiseach from Mr. Tom Walsh, National Group Secretary, Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, Industrial Group No. 4.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>My major concern, as a person associated with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, is the question of employment, and the situation that has developed nowadays of throwing people onto the scrap-heap.  There is no doubt that CIE are not happy with the situation. On the question of redundancies, CIE are quite satisfied that they will have to lay people off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the information I have gleaned, the estimated cost of providing the current level and standard of services as required by the Department of Education in 1989 is £31.6 million.  The provision in the Department for school transport is, however, only £25.8 million which represents a shortfall of £5.8 million. There is no case for the cross-subsidisation of the school transport services and the consequences of this shortfall are, therefore, very serious for the school transport scheme and all associated with <Col N="520" /> it.  Discussions have taken place with the Department officials and it has been pointed out to them and to the Minister that it is not possible to provide the school transport service to current levels and standards in 1989 unless the full estimate of £31.6 million is made available.  This is the information available from CIE.</P>
    <P>This estimate actually reflects a reduction of £3 million on the 1986 costs in real terms and shows that considerable savings have been made in recent years. The Minister for Education has stated that &ldquo;Bus Éireann is providing an efficient, safe and cost effective service&rdquo; which is in total contradiction to her attitude on funding the scheme.</P>
    <P>Bus Éireann are aware the Minister has stated that there should be no reduction in the scheme for this school year.  Bus Éireann have stated they will do their best to meet the target. However, they express some doubts with regard to the current provisions.  They believe there will be very little funds available for transport for the new term beginning in the autumn and, as a consequence, there will be large-scale reductions.  Therefore, it puts them in the awkward position of trying to make plans to meet the situation.  I do not know what options have been put to the board, but I understand that the board of CIE will not be able to meet the costs and inevitably this will lead to redundancies.</P>
    <P>Many points arise from the Department's attitude to the board.  The sad situation is that there are no discussions taking place between CIE, Bus Éireann, the Minister and her officials.  The contradiction is that under the terms of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, Bus Éireann staff cannot be made redundant compulsorily; yet, in essence if there is no money there will be redundancies.</P>
    <P>Bus Éireann have been introducing secondhand buses into the school fleets since the mid-seventies.  We have talked about safety and efficiency but there will be more talks if a contingency plan has to be drawn up to make up the shortfall in money.  Bus Éireann are not even sure how much money the Minister will spend on funding school transport up to the end <Col N="521" /> of June and they are not even sure what they will have left for the end of the year. Does the Minister expect CIE to start funding the shortfall out of their own subsidies?  This is not practical for them and they will not be able to do it.  They are doing a great job in recent times particularly since the management changes and so on.  The workers have given a lot.  Here we see that not only will some families be put in great jeopardy trying to get the children to school but that the people who are depending on Bus Éireann for a livelihood are liable to be caught in the trap of redundancy and thrown on the scrap heap the same as many other people.  I do not know if the Government expect CIE to fund the school transport scheme from their subsidy. If so, does the Minister or the Government realise that they are robbing Peter to pay Paul?  The inevitable consequences of that will be forced redundancies in Dublin Bus and Iarnród Éireann which would be contrary to conditions in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> that apply to the staff of CIE.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that CIE are considering the compulsory redundancy of 1,200 people?  That is our information, which is of major concern to us.  As members of the Labour Party we have an association with many of the trade unions and it is up to us to do something.  What is the Minister's attitude towards privatising the school transport scheme?  If this happens does the Minister realise that the black economy can develop while at the same time 1,200 people can be put out of work?  We wonder how this can be reconciled with the repeated statements from the Minister that CIE is efficient and gives value for money and is providing an excellent and satisfactory service for over 20 years.</P>
    <P>We also wonder if the Minister will ever pay the £1.5 million that is owned to CIE since last year?  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions so far have not had a reply from the Minister confirming the undertaking she gave them at a meeting with the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern, in 1988.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us something about that?  We wonder <Col N="522" /> why Mr. Walsh of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union has seen fit to write to the Taoiseach to express his serious concern about the Minister's failure to respond to the various representations both on the funding and pilot schemes.  For example, we understand that the Minister telephoned the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to tell them that the pilot schemes were not going ahead while at the same time it was common knowledge that she was endeavouring to get the private bus sector to take over and administer the scheme.</P>
    <P>If these are charges, so be it.  We have tried to dig out the information and this is what has come to hand.  We do not know the full extent of its accuracy or otherwise, but the onus will be on the Minister to give us some explanations.  Is it that the Minister has failed to persuade the private sector because they are aware of the massive amount of administration involved and that the only way they could give effect to the scheme is by operating the black economy?</P>
    <P>These are all matters of concern to us and to the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.  We are very concerned about the effects of this, not only that children would be deprived of a chance of getting to school because of the extra cost to families, but also the inevitable consequences leading to redundancies. We see it as the crudest possible use of public moneys.  In the end you are working towards uplifting the status ridden society that we have at present, even though the taxpayers and the public will be the people who will have to meet the costs.</P>
    <P>The board of CIE are satisfied that they cannot meet the situation and that both the union and themselves will have to come together for discussions.  It would be rather unusual to see the Minister having the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the board of CIE jointly snapping at her heels.  We have posed some questions to the Minister.  We trust that in the responses we will get some information on it read into the record.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of saying a few words on this amendment.  First of all, it is very important for Members of the House to stand up and voice their opinions clearly on an important issue such as this.  Expenditure on school transport is not much different from expenditure on social welfare, health, education and the whole area of public service.  I believe it is popular for all of us in public life to give the impression that we are always looking for more in order to appeal to the people on the ground whom we represent.  That might read well, but the reality is that those who are paying for the services today are very alert to what the Government are doing about expenditure.  That is why the Government are getting credit for their positive approach.  This country has done very well because our school transport expenditure is a very substantial bill.</P>
      <P>I would compliment those in charge of administering the school transport service for maintaining the service in 1989. I come from County Donegal, a county that has more school transport problems than any other part of the country because of sectarian differences and all the problems associated with rough country terrain.  We are happy that the system has been maintained at its present level.  I ask the Minister of State to urge his Department to review the situation. Every public representative in the country is aware of what has been said by all of the private operators who are working for CIE.  They say that if they got half of what CIE are getting they would run a more efficient transport service. That might be an exaggeration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the scheme was set up to benefit CIE.  The survival of CIE was a consideration when the school transport system was set up.  I was on many deputations to the Department.  I met the officials from CIE and from the Department, and I know that it was an important part of CIE's revenue.  I believe that too great a part was going to CIE at the expense of restricting the <Col N="524" /> service on the ground.  The input of taxpayers' money through the Government is a substantial benefit to CIE.</P>
    <P>I hope to see the day when the Department will review the whole school transport system and that we will cut out the awkward, difficult procedure of employing CIE to employ other bus operators in the country.  In this day and age when people run their business very efficiently, it is inefficient to put money into CIE to hire people down the country to run a school transport service.  I hope we will get rid of that system, that we will extend the service.  I believe that for the same amount of money we could substantially extend the service to many parts of the country.  If CIE now have to be subsidised, if they are ever to stand on their own feet, it is about time that it was looked at.  There is no room for inefficiency. I certainly hope the Government are able to maintain the school transport system but I believe it will be extended only if there are substantial savings.  I am looking forward to that being done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey) Frank Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express my thanks to the Senators who contributed to this debate and to say I appreciate the concern they have expressed in regard to the school transport system.  The issue before the House is, in the first instance, whether the existing level of transport service for our school children will be maintained.</P>
      <P>At the outset I want to allay the fears of the Senators on this issue.  The school transport service will be maintained at its present level throughout 1989.  The Government are committed to this and the Minister for Education has made statements to this effect on a number of occasions already.  There need be no fears, therefore, that the children will be left without services from September or at some other time during the year or that services will be curtailed.  There has been quite a bit of scaremongering on this issue and I want to say categorically that there is no basis for such claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the matter of funding, you <Col N="525" /> will be aware that the Government have been concerned at the high cost of running the scheme and have sought to have it reduced.  While the prime responsibility is to ensured the satisfactory delivery of a transport service to approximately 160,000 primary and post-primary pupils, the Department have the responsibility to ensure that the State gets the best possible value for the money it expends on this service.</P>
    <P>There is general acceptance of the fact that Bus Éireann are doing a very good job in delivering the service under the terms of the scheme.  Their expertise and spread of operations were of inestimable value in the establishment and consolidation of the scheme and continue to be vital factors in the successful provision of day-to-day services.  Great emphasis is placed on the care and safety of children and on the fair and consistent application of the terms of the scheme.  The Minister on a number of occasions has expressed her appreciation of Bus Éireann's role in these areas and I want again to put on record that appreciation.</P>
    <P>The House will accept, however, that notwithstanding these very positive aspects of the operation of the scheme, the Government have to be satisfied that it is fully cost effective.  The view is that the cost of the scheme &mdash; currently over £30 million in net terms &mdash; is unacceptably high and that measures have to be taken to reduce this cost.  The allocation made in the 1988 Estimates provided for a reduction of £1.5 million in the amount payable to Bus Éireann in respect of add-on administrative charges and this was duly implemented.  The Government decided in preparing the 1989 Estimates that further savings of £5 million on administrative charges and other costs should be effected in 1989. The provision in the Estimates has been allocated accordingly.</P>
    <P>As I have said, however, the Government have stipulated that the necessary savings be found without reducing services to schools.  In making their decision on the Estimates, the Government asked that Bus Éireann be approached with a view to effecting savings.  Officials of my <Col N="526" /> Department met representatives of Bus Éireann without proposals emerging at the time as to how Bus Éireann would propose to meet the Government target. I would like to recall that the idea for pilot projects which was proposed last year was mooted because of the large cost of replacing the school bus fleet. In 1987 Bus Éireann estimated that this would cost over £20 million.  However, when arrangements were in train for the pilot projects Bus Éireann succeeded in making a deal for the purchase of good secondhand buses in Britain at a cost of £1-£1.5 million a year over a five-year period.  In view of this arrangement, it was decided to defer the question of pilot projects.</P>
    <P>The replacement of the school bus fleet concerned capital expenditure.  I want to emphasise, however, that the achievement of current costs savings is also a major element in the objective to provide a fully cost effective school transport service. Such savings could be expected through the entire system of CIE.  Of course, it will continue to be necessary to have a rigorous but fair application of the provisions of the scheme to ensure equitable treatment for all within our cost limits.  These provisions have served their purpose well over the years in meeting the objectives of the scheme which is to provide a basic level of service to those children who would otherwise have difficulty in attending school regularly.  It is not proposed to change these conditions.</P>
    <P>In regard to charges, I know that concern has already been expressed, and again here tonight, about the likelihood of increase in view of the reduced funding. I want to assure the House that there will be no increases in charges in the current year, nor will any new charges be introduced.  I think this is noteworthy in the light of the fact that there has been no increase in charges since September, 1987, and it is a reflection of the Government's concern that a basic service be available to all eligible children at the lowest possible cost to parents.</P>
    <P>For the present, therefore, it is the intention to examine all possible avenues for the reduction of expenditure within <Col N="527" /> the existing structures.  I consider, however, it is a matter for Bus Éireann to come forward with proposals on savings on administrative and other costs which will meet the Government's targets without reducing services to schools.  I have every confidence it will be possible to achieve our targets in this way, to continue to provide a highly efficient and satisfactory school transport service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>One is rather touched by all the compliments coming both from the Minister and from the Government side regarding the efficency of Bus Éireann, regarding the marvellous way they have run the service, apart from some rather extraordinary statements from Senator McGowan to the effect that the private operators could operate at half what CIE are getting.  I do not proposes to deal with that.  I think that comment is sufficient in itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the benefit of the House, and for the benefit of the Minister, let us see what exactly Bus Éireann do.  There is a list here of the duties they carry out.  There is the verification of eligibility of primary pupils, the planning and organisation of routes, checking road conditions, timetables, loadings etc., allocations of vehicles to meet ongoing requirements, recruitment, payment, supervision of private contractors, ensuring all vehicles meet laid down requirements in terms of insurance, operating licences, road worthiness, certificates, driver licensing, driver fitness etc., collection of charges and issue of travel permits in each school term, monitoring and control of costs, supervision and checking of services &mdash; that is for 6,250 routes &mdash; undertaking a wide range of safety-related procedures, special requirements associated with transport of 9,000 pupils attending schools for mentally and physically handicapped, liaison with the Department of Education, transport liaison officers, school managers, principal teachers etc. Regarding aspects of the scheme I am sure the next item is one that strikes a chord in this House &mdash; responding to members of the public, local associations <Col N="528" /> and public representatives on queries arising.</P>
    <P>The point of view that is being put across is that, out of an estimated cost of £35.3 million, with charges of £3.7 million, which brings us down to £31.6 million, you can wipe out £5.7 million and retain the service at its present level. As the Minister has said, there is no question of charges coming in this year. I feel that approach is insulting to the intelligence of the Members of the House.  Senator McGowan made comments about the efficiency of the system. In my own area in the south-east five people operate the system for five counties. There is a very sophisticated computerised system there.  It runs in the face of reality and logic to say that such a cutback in the allocation to Bus Éireann can be effected and that the service can be maintained with no charges introduced.</P>
    <P>A recent letter from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions puts another perspective on what we are talking about.  It was sent to the Managing Director of Bus Éireann and said:</P>
    <P>At a meeting on Thursday 16 February, 1989, the unions representing members in Bus Éireann expressed serious disquiet regarding developments in regard to the School Bus Scheme.</P>
    <P>The representatives noted the extent of the shortfall in funds being provided for the Scheme by the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>The unions discussed the likely impact of the shortfall in funding on workers in the School Bus Scheme and on the workers in the company.  They agreed that before deciding on any course of action, they should seek information from the company as to the effect of the reduction in funding.</P>
    <P>It would be appreciated if, as a matter of urgency, you could let me have information regarding the company view of the effect of the reduction in the funding for the Scheme, together with any proposals the company may be considering in respect of the Scheme or Bus Éireann.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="529" /> Should you consider that a meeting to discuss the matter would be of assistance I shall be obliged if you will contact me.</P>
    <P>We have heard that savings can be effected throughout Bus Éireann, that somehow or other savings can come from scheduled services or from within Bus Éireann.  If Senators look at what is happening they will realise that type of approach does not relate to the situation we are talking about.  The bottom line is that school transport was cut back by £1.5 million last year, the service was operated at a cost that was £1.5 million more than was provided by the Government.  This year the service is going to cost a further £5.7 million more than the Government have provided, if it is to continue at its present level.</P>
    <P>I take the Minister's point that there was some sort of meeting between the officials of Bus Éireann and officials of his Department, but is it not also true to say that the officials from Bus Éireann indicated that they could not possibly operate within the limits of the money provided?</P>
    <P>I find the whole approach of the Minister's Department lamentable.  We know as little going out of here tonight as we knew coming here.  No talks whatsoever are going on.  The unions are seeking to meet the Taoiseach because of the way the Minister for Education is dealing with the situation.  The 1,100 people directly employed in the school transport service in Bus Éireann, the 1,600 drivers who are involved with contractors, the 170,000 children and their parents and the teachers of those children do not know and cannot be convinced there will be a service next September at the level we have at the moment without charges.  Let us cut out the codology.  Come September, the money will be virtually spent.  What happens in September?  The Minister's Department know that Bus Éireann are providing a service at the level of the estimate that was given to that Department. The Department still hold the position that £5.7 million is being cut out of that.  Early in September the system will <Col N="530" /> no longer be able to work and there will be a grave problem.  As I have already stated, it is seen as costing as much as 800 jobs and, even more important, 70,000 children will be left without service.</P>
    <P>Let us show a little respect for the people in this House, particularly the people on this side of the House who have raised this matter.  The Minister and his Department are arguing that what is there facing us, according to any logical evaluation of the situation, will not happen.  The Minister knows that the money will have run out by the second week in September.  What happens then? He has not addressed himself to that question.  Pious platitudes are trotted out by Members on the other side of the House and by the Minister regarding the very efficient and safe service that is provided by Bus Éireann.</P>
    <P>I have given a list of the functions of Bus Éireann.  I have also indicated the low levels of staff that are required for administration.  As the Minister found out last year when she tried her pilot projects, these magical little schemes that are dreamed up on the sleeve of somebody's shirt do not work out.  In the real world of school transport that figure of £35.3 million is the actual figure required to keep the service at its present level, without charges or a diminution of service.</P>
    <P>There is no way that we in the Labour Party will accept the amendment by the Government.  It is very significant that the Fianna Fáil Senators in this House did not come out a lot more firmly in support of the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Education, in her decision. It is nothing a decision but no more than that.  There is no confidence in the Minister because, I suggest, the members of Fianna Fáil realise that extra money will have to be found and will be of the order of the £5.7 million we are talking about, of the £1.5 million that was not provided last year.  The cynical exercise continues since last year, through the Book of Estimates in October, through the £1.5 million reduction on the final payment last November, on through the budget, <Col N="531" /> through to the time we last raised this issue and onto tonight.</P>
    <P>The situation is absolutely and utterly unacceptable.  I will come back to the Minister in September.  I believe this cynical exercise will be cured by a Supplementary Estimate coming in later on this year when much pain has been caused to many people, particularly many young people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise the question of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal and the provision of moneys so that work can commence on making the canal navigable. In a joint statement by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign <Col N="533" /> Affairs after a recently held Anglo-Irish Conference meeting they both stated, and quite enthusiastically, that the main tourism project they would envisage would be the opening of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal.  As far as Anglo-Irish relations are concerned the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal stands head and shoulders above anything else.  If we go ahead with the reconstruction of the canal it would be possible to take a boat from the Shannon in Limerick the whole way up to the Erne and into Northern Ireland.  This would be a very positive and worthwhile tourism project.</P>
      <P>As far back as 1949 the late Seán MacBride, who was a boating enthusiast, and many others highlighted the potential for the area if the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal were reopened.  Since then there have been many calls for the reopening of the canal.  Many studies and reports have been carried out by different interest groups in connection with the canal.  I am led to believe that costings have been made of what it would cost to make the canal navigable.  A number of figures were bandied around.  Twenty-seven million pounds was one figure which was latched onto for a while but I have since learned that the Office of Public Works stated that £16 million would be more or less the cost of carrying out this work.</P>
      <P>The reopening of the canal would also be of great advantage to the farming community living adjacent to the canal.  A lot of the land during the winter months is completely submerged in water.  As the Minister comes from the west, he is quite aware of the number of small farms we have and having most of them underwater is not advantageous to the economy. Flooding causes a lot of problems and hardship for the farming community adjacent to the canal.  It would be appreciated therefore if the flooding could be prevented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There would be unlimited tourism potential for the whole catchment area of the Erne basin if the canal were reopened.  Cruising and fishing would be <Col N="534" /> major tourism attractions.  In Ballinamore alone there are 60 lakes within a ten mile radius.  In parts of west Cavan there are many lakes.  I cannot help but make reference to the fishing rod licence because there is excellent potential there for coarse fishing tourism.  It is already attracting large numbers of tourists to the area.  There are plans at the moment to There is one in Carrick-on-Shannon. There is a major water sports facility on the Erne in Enniskillen.</P>
    <P>This has a great potential as well.  There is great enthusiasm from everybody in the community for the project.  They would see the opening of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal as an economic lifeline to Leitrim and indeed to Cavan.  The farmers would love to see it. The business people are willing to create different types of business ventures which would help attract tourists to the area if the canal were to go ahead.  Community councils in Leitrim and Cavan have given their full support for the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal to be made navigable.</P>
    <P>As far as the International Fund is concerned, as late as last week the Commissioner from Ireland, Mr. Ray MacSharry, and another Commissioner made £12 million available for the International Fund.  This is an opportune time for the chairman and the committee to make an initial allocation of money for this worthy project.  We heard today about atrocities carried out in Northern Ireland.  This is one way to take away a border.  If people, for instance, could travel by boat from Limerick to Enniskillen, apart from the psychological aspect, it might encourage those living in the border areas to attract tourists to their areas.  Such co-operation could perhaps go a small way towards solving the problem we have had in our country.</P>
    <P>As far as the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal is concerned, the time for talking is over.  It is now time for action.  The International Fund is in operation and they have the money to provide for this great project.  I cannot see any reason why work on the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal cannot be started and <Col N="535" /> so give an economical lifeline to that part of the country where it is very much needed.</P>
    <P>As far as the EC Structural Funds are concerned, I know Leitrim County Council have proposed that the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal get some funding from that also.  A Lough Allen community development company have submitted a very extensive and ambitious programme for EC Structural Funds.  It covers north Roscommon, west Cavan and mid-Leitrim.  They have great tourist facilities, for example, mountain walking, fishing and so on.  As I have said in this House on many occasions, Leitrim is one county which has suffered greatly from emigration.  Our tourism potential has not been fully realised and this would be an excellent way of showing our commitment to tourism, to Leitrim and, above all, to all the people.  It would show we are prepared to join Ireland in one union in a physical sense.  I ask the Minister to do what he can to ensure that the International Fund makes money available for this very worthwhile project.</P>

      <P>I welcome this debate on the restoration of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal.  I am happy to explain to the House the steps which the Government have taken to further this important project which will link the waterways of the Shannon and the Erne to create a navigable system unrivalled in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal goes back over 200 years.  Several proposals were made to connect the River Shannon to Upper Lough Erne and in the 1780s the first lock was built on the Woodford River which forms part of the waterway.  However, the work proceeded only in fits and starts with the main construction being undertaken by the Commissioners of Public Works between the years 1847 and 1859 as a combined scheme of drainage and navigation.  Thus, a full 80 years had passed by the time the canal was officially opened on 4 July 1860.  It comprised a <Col N="536" /> section of still-water canal, navigations through several lakes and the canalised Woodford River.  The Ulster Canal had also been opened and, for a brief period, it was possible to travel by canal from Belfast to Limerick.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the expansion of the railways spelled the death of this and other canals.  Transport was faster and cheaper by rail.  The canal could not compete; it declined and fell into disuse.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the dream remained that it represented a unique heritage which should be exploited.  It is only in recent years that the growth of tourism and the increasing popularity of boating holidays have offered the possibility of bringing the canal back into economic use.</P>
    <P>The restoration of the canal would provide access to a system of waterways unique and unrivalled in Europe and would be an invaluable facility for the area.  By re-opening the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal, the 300 km of navigable waterway of the Shannon, already linked to a further 250 km in the Grand Canal and Barrow systems, would be linked to the 150 km in the Erne navigation system, thus creating a single navigable system with more than 750 km of varied cruising water.</P>
    <P>Approximately 70 per cent of the navigation is wholly within the State, while the balance lies along the boundary between Counties Cavan and Fermanagh, with three short stretches, totalling about 1.6 km in length, wholly within Northern Ireland.  It is not surprising, therefore, that Shannon-Erne link was one of the first specifics projects to be considered in the North-South talks on economic co-operation in 1971.  Since then, a number of studies have been undertaken and they have highlighted the enormous potential for development of the canal.</P>
    <P>In 1980 the Erne catchment study, commissioned by the Irish and British Governments together with the Commission of the European Communities found, <i>inter alia,</i> that:</P>
    <P>The consequences of such a direct link being forged between the Erne <Col N="537" /> and the Shannon cruiseways are of the first magnitude since by combining them a navigable waterway of European importance would be created, stretching as an inland &ldquo;tourist-way&rdquo; from Limerick to Fermanagh and Tyrone in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>The linking of the Shannon and Erne waterways would generate opportunities for a wide range of new and adapted holiday products and packages, since their combined holding capacity would be of the order of five weeks thus allowing a variety of long and short holidays to be devised.  Success in this sphere would have the longterm effect of extending the hinterland of the coastal regions and of creating conditions for the design of new touring and multi-centred holidays.  In short, imaginative promotion of an Erne-Shannon waterway could result in a major new structure in Irish tourism.</P>
    <P>In 1983, a report on the Irish border areas, following a visit to the area by a group from the Economic and Social Committee of the European Communities, confirmed the findings of the Erne catchment study and said that in line with its conclusions, Community funds should be used to assist the development of the inland waterway links in the area, and that the restoration of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal should be treated as a priority project.  The report found that &ldquo;this would create an important fishing and tourist centre which would inevitably attract a large number of tourists and thus benefit the entire region&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The report also asserted that &ldquo;The opening of both the Upper Erne River and the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal to full use by pleasure craft would give a massive boost to a still very underdeveloped tourism industry&rdquo;.  Following discussions at the Intergovernmental Conference last year, and this is probably what Senator Reynolds was referring to, the British and Irish Governments agreed <Col N="538" /> to jointly recommend to the Board of the International Fund for Ireland that it should consider supporting one or more imaginative cross-Border flagship projects, one of which is the restoration of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal.  The board of the fund accepted this recommendation at its meeting in September 1988.  As a first step, the fund commissioned an independent study to evaluate the economic, particularly tourism, impact of restoring the canal, and to provide the background, in economic and tourism terms, against which the construction and maintenance costs can be considered.  I understand that this report should be ready some time next month.</P>
    <P>For their part, the Government have established an interdepartmental committee composed of senior officials from the relevant Government Departments to study and co-ordinate the work necessary to ensure that progress on the project is as expenditious as possible.  The Office of Public Works carried out a detailed report on the feasibility of restoring the canal in 1986.  The details of that report are being reviewed as are the actual costs of the project.  In addition, the Attorney General's Office is examining the legal situation.  The interdepartmental committee is co-ordinating this work and it is also studying how a possible financial package for the project might be put together.  The committee will, of course, co-ordinate its work, as appropriate, with the responsible authorities in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The reopening of the Balinamore-Ballyconnell Canal would bring substantial benefits to tourism in Leitrim, Cavan and Fermanagh.  Its unique character and uncrowded waters would also help to market the entire navigation system North and South as a tourist destination. Its restoration would in addition be a tangible symbol of co-operation on this island and indeed of the work of the International Fund.</P>
    <P>The Government attach considerable priority to the project and are making every effort to ensure that work is facilitated and advanced in every way possible. I might add that this is the first concerted <Col N="539" /> effort that has been made in recent times by a Government in relation to this project. It is my hope that through our efforts and the assistance of other organisations, such as the International Fund, work could begin in the near future on the long overdue reopening of this unique stretch of waterway.</P>
    <P>In a recent article on a canoe trip along the canal, Bernard Share described an evening after a day's boating.  He talked of:</P>
    <P>... the broad expanse of Garadice, its wooded shoreline silent except for a few evening fishermen.  A safe mooring, a fragrant fire and the promise of dinner, tents snug and secure, the prospect of open water, the satisfaction of discovery and of modest achievement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="540" /> I look forward to the day when, as a result of our efforts, that type of contented holiday pleasure will be widely available to other tourists on this restored waterway.</P>

      <P>I agree with what the Minister said.  He put it more eloquently than I did.  There have been many studies carried out on the canal and on the costings of the work.  The Minister said in his speech that he should have a costing and a report in a month's time.  I would like him to ensure that the Government would follow this up and that the costing would be available as soon as possible because now is the time to act.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 15 March 1989.</P>
