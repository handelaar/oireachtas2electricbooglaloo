      <P>I have notice from Senator Batt O'Keeffe that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The decision of Sandoz to locate in Ringaskiddy in County Cork. </P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Pat Upton of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to provide adequate funding for the Multiple Sclerosis Centre in Bushy Park Road, Rathgar, Dublin 6 to ensure its long-term viability. </P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Avril Doyle of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The serious implications of the Bridge Project report for the Irish dairy industry and the urgent need for action. </P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Joe Costello of the following matters:</P>
      <P> 1.  The need for the Minister for the Environment to increase funding to enable Dublin Corporation to continue its programme of upgrading its housing stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.  The need for the Minister for <Col N="722" /> Education to fulfil her commitment to the development of a new school in North Clondalkin for the students of St. Kevin's Community College who are in temporary accommodation. </P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators O'Keeffe, Upton, Doyle and Costello as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matter named by Senator O'Keeffe and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Upton, Doyle and Costello may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>A supplementary Order Paper has been distributed.  It is intended to take the supplementary Order Paper as Item No. a1.  We will take the Report Stage of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Bill to a conclusion today.  It is intended to order the resumption of Second Stage of the Trustee Savings Banks Bill.  At 6.30 p.m. we will resume the debate on the NESC Report No. 88 to conclude at 8 o'clock and we will take the matter on the adjournment at 8 o'clock.  If there are a number of speakers offering on the NESC debate we could possibly have that at 8.30 p.m. but I feel we should conclude at 8 o'clock, with the Minister to come in at 7.45 p.m. Tomorrow we will take the motion on the Middle East.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Item No. a1 today deals with the setting up of committees.  Is it intended that there will be debate with that or will it be taken without a short debate?  Secondly, in view of the worsening famine situation in Ethiopia, would the Leader of the House be prepared to consider, perhaps next week, devoting an hour to a discussion of Ireland's overseas development aid programme and ways in which we could focus attention on how this country would help the plight of those in famine-stricken Ethiopia?  Also today, could the Leader of the House give some <Col N="723" /> indication whether the debate on Northern Ireland may take place before the end of this session?</P>
      <P>Could I have the view of the Leader of the House on Item No. 7 &mdash; the Interpretation Amendment (No. 2) Bill?  As the House knows, this was originally a Fine Gael Bill which appeared on the Order Paper in the last session.  It has since been appropriated by one of the Independents but there is no great problem about that because it is a Bill which we would like to see on the Statute Book. In view of the remarks of the Taoiseach yesterday in the other House that he would like to see the import of this Bill put into legislation could this perhaps be taken at a fairly early stage?  It is a gesture rather than a serious Bill and it is something which would, I am sure, have all-party support in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the supplementary Order Paper, Item No. a1, is to be welcomed, but it would be important that there would be a debate on it and we would certainly not be interested in nodding it through.  We have very serious views on committees and I think it is an opportunity to air them.  Will the Leader of the House consider at some stage during the day allowing statements to be made for a set period on the question of overseas development aid?  It is a serious problem.  It is a topical issue which is being discussed at the moment and I believe we should seek to respond to it. I would prefer that be done today rather than next week or another time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask for the indulgence of the House.  The situation here is that we, as Labour Senators, are not able to do our job as we would wish because of the fact that we have no facilities.  We are going around this House begging, borrowing and cheating to get the facility of making a phone call or to sit at somebody else's desk to write a letter.  The situation is that since last June &mdash; almost six months ago when I was dispossessed on the day the Dáil reassembled &mdash; I have not got the facilities to enable me to do <Col N="724" /> my job.  Since the August Seanad elections three Senators and I have been walking around from room to room looking for facilities.</P>
      <P>I am raising the matter in the Seanad out of sheer frustration.  I have been to my own parliamentary party and I have got explanations from them.  I have been to my own Whip and he went to great detail to explain the problem.  He has made five or six &mdash; or maybe seven or eight &mdash; trips back and forward to the Government Whip without any apparent success.  I raised the matter in the Committee on Procedures and Privileges.  I went back again to my own parliamentary party.  I spoke to the Leader of the House. I spoke to the Seanad Government Whip. I spoke to the Dáil Government Whip who was supposed to have made some effort to accommodate me.  But the information I have from my own Dáil Whip is that he has not got any further with it.</P>
      <P>I am looking for the support of this House.  Apparently, nothing will be done until such time as everybody rows in behind me.  The fact of the matter is if there was anybody else in this House who was not being facilitated in the proper ways they would disrupt the Order of Business every week.  That is not my style.  I am doing it once.  I am asking for the indulgence and support of the House.</P>
      <P>I also ask that the matter be brought to the notice of the Taoiseach.  I was going to take that step but he has given the Whips a job to do.  Obviously he cannot get bogged down on that sort of thing but at least he should know about it.  The view of this House should be conveyed to him that such a situation will not be tolerated and that people who are elected to this House are entitled to facilities. Some of us have not enjoyed them for the past six months, and for four months in other cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I know I speak with the support of all the members of my party. I would like to completely support what Senator Jack Harte has just said.  It shows a total disregard for the Upper House that any Member should be treated in such a manner.  It is almost incredible to <Col N="725" /> think that four Senators elected to this House are sitting around, some since June and others more recently, for months waiting for a desk and a chair and somewhere to put their books and get on with their work.  Anything we can do to help remedy the situation we will be delighted to do.  The Labour Senators have our 100 per cent support in resolving this appalling situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Harte in his request for appropriate offices in which to conduct his work. I will not be more contentious than that. I would like to refer to what the leader of the Fine Gael group, Senator Manning, said with regard to the Interpretation Bill and to say that I think it is important that it be placed in context.  I am sure he would not wish it to appear that there was a conflict in the fact that I support what he said in regard to it.  That Bill arose from the operations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights.</P>

      <P>It was presented by Deputy Nuala Fennell, but I consulted with her before presenting it here myself. I would just like the House to be aware of that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Leader of the House to confirm that there will be the opportunity for debate on the supplementary Order Paper, and that it will be possible to amend that Order Paper.  I certainly wish to offer an amendment to it because I wish to have an Oireachtas joint committee on foreign affairs established.  We will be placing that amendment on the Order Paper if it is technically possible to do so.  I would like also, if it is possible, to have an indication from the Leader of the House as to when he proposes having <Col N="726" /> the debate he promised on Northern Ireland.  Finally, I would like to have an explanation of what happened to the debate on the NESC report last week and why it appears on this week's Order Paper, instead of having been taken, as I understood very clearly, it would be taken last week.  I was very surprised watching the monitor to discover last Thursday that it simply vanished into thin air at lunch time when there was an entire afternoon during which it could have been taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support my colleague, Senator Harte, in his statement about the disgraceful manner in which the four Labour Party Senators have been treated &mdash; three of us for the last three and a half months and the other Senator for five months.  We do not have any kind of permanent accommodation at present.  We want to ask the House to assist us in ensuring, before we come back here again, that the matter is resolved.  Secondly, in relation to Northern Ireland, I would like to ask also what has happened to that debate?  When is it intended that it will take place?  Such a debate has already taken place in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Estimates, I asked before whether we have any further indication as to when that debate will take place here.  Finally, do I understand from the Leader of the House that the only item to be discussed on Thursday is the Middle East?  Is the Derelict Sites Bill going to be dealt with this week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>To get back to Item No. a1, there can be a limited debate on it and I would suggest that it be left to the leaders of the particular groups in the House to pass comment on it.  As to the extention of committees, that is not on the Order Paper.  It is up to individual Senators to put on the Order Paper their request to have further committees set up.  We are dealing with a specific item on the Order Paper.  It has nothing to do <Col N="727" /> with other committees.  We are trying to set up the committees of the Houses which have been established, not extension of committees of the House.  Extension into other areas is not a matter for discussion on this Order Paper today.  I am afraid I will not allow discussion on the extension because we are dealing with a specific item here.</P>
      <P>On the question of a debate on Ethiopia, there are a number of requests for special debates here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Senator A Senator">
      <NameTxt>A Senator</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first time that people have interrupted me on the Order of Business on whether I can be heard or not.  I suggested last week that there may be problems with the speakers or the monitors in this House.  If there are problems they are not of my making.</P>
      <P>On the Ethiopian question, certainly that is tied in with the request by Senator O'Toole on overseas development aid.  I do not see that there is a great difficulty in having a limited debate on those two items.</P>
      <P>We will have a limited debate on Northern Ireland and that can take place next Thursday, if that is agreeable to the House.  There is no particular problem on that.  The Whips are to meet tomorrow morning at 12 o'clock and questions can be raised then as to whether there will be a debate on Ethiopia.  The Northern Ireland debate, of a limited nature, should take place next week.</P>
      <P>As far as the Estimates are concerned, we will have a debate on them before Christmas.  Again, we cannot have a full debate on the Estimates; it will have to be limited to a specific length of time. That would mean that we either limit the number of speakers or the length of time for each speaker.  That should be a matter for discussion among the Whips tomorrow morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately I have absolutely nothing to do with the facilities afforded to Members.  I took on board the queries raised by Senator Harte.  I got numerous <Col N="728" /> answers which would suggest that perhaps some of the fault is outside the control of the officers of the House.  It may have something to do with the organisation within the Labour Party.  That may be, but I am not too sure.  There may be a question mark there, but the question has been raised and we will follow it right up to the highest level.  It is disgraceful that people do not have proper facilities.  I am afraid that the Labour Party are not the only people who have not got proper facilities in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the Interpretation Bill is concerned, we will deal with it in due course.  I accept what has been said.  It was my fault that the NESC debate did not continue last week.  I ordered it, but I expected the other Committee Stage to take longer.  There was a technical reason then why we could not come back to that debate.  It is important that we finish the NESC debate this evening, because there will be a further report from NESC in the very near future.  We should conclude the NESC debate this evening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty in concurring with what is proposed before us today.  I would have preferred, perhaps, if we had somewhat more notice of this.  All Members of the House, at this early stage in the life of this Seanad, would like to take a detailed look at the operation of the overall committee system within the Oireachtas.  For some time now it has been fairly clear that the committee system has been working in a fairly haphazard way.  Some committees have been successful and effective. Others have been operating in a rather desultory way and have not been performing the purposes for which they were intended.  There are five new committees before us today.  I want to make one or two observations.</P>
      <P>First, I greatly regret the omission of two committees from the list here today, one is a committee on foreign affairs. It is disgraceful that the House of the Oireachtas do not have a permanent committee on foreign affairs.  We have seen, over the last decade or so, the increasing awareness of developments elsewhere on the life of this country, the enormous interest in, and also the impact upon this country, of these events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have witnessed the recent events in Eastern Europe.  We had a very full debate on that over the past two weeks. Without labouring the point, I think the time has come when we should have a full comittee on foreign affairs in this <Col N="732" /> House.  I do not believe any Government have anything to fear from such a committee. If it causes inconvenience to the civil servants, so be it.  I believe, in fact, that the majority of civil servants who deal with foreign policy would welcome greater discussion of major issues in the Houses of Parliament.  It is only by full debate on these matters, by fully informing ourselves and by using the debate here to communicate with the wider public that we can have the sort of healthy, open debate we require.  It is regrettable that the main discussion on foreign affairs is taking place in seminars outside the Oireachtas.  It is taking place under the auspices of the Royal Irish Academy. They had an extremely worthwhile seminar last week.  It is a great schame that such discussions are not taking place in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I want to add the full and total support of my group to the call for a full committee on foreign affairs.</P>
    <P>It is also regrettable that no attempt has been made to reconstitute the Committee on Overseas Development Aid.  I believe that in the Oireachtas of 1982-87, by far and away the outstanding committee was the committee on Overseas Development Aid.  That committee, more than any other, brought into public focus the enormous issues of policies in central America, the effects of famine in Africa and the consequences for us of what we were doing or not doing with regard to overseas aid.  That committee had enormous educational influence within this House.  It also demonstrated, in a very tangible way to the many agencies outside, and to the increasing number of people who take a very lively and committed interest in these issues, that the Houses of the Oireachtas did care and that there was a body of concerned, educated, informed opinion within these Houses of people who wanted to express their points of view and also wanted to have a sense of accountability from the Government of the day as to what was being done.  I believe the workings of that Oireachtas were greatly enriched by that committee.</P>
    <P>I would make a plea from the heart <Col N="733" /> to the Government to reconstitute that committee.  If the Government feel embarrassed about the level of overseas development aid that is not a good enough reason for not setting up such a committee.  We, in these Houses, should act as pressure points where we think it is correct.  We should act as pressure points on the Government to increase development aid if we think that is what the Irish people would want, and if we think it is the right thing to do.</P>
    <P>What I am saying on this issue is shared by people in all parties in this House.  No party has a monopoly on right or virtue on this matter.  No party has a monopoly on compassion.  All of us want to see this committee reconstituted.</P>
    <P>I would also, in this very brief debate, take issue with the length of time it takes &mdash; and this is not a criticism of the Government &mdash; in each session to have committees constituted.  There should be some quasi-automatic device whereby committees come into existence virtually at the same time as a new Parliament meets.  We should not have to wait so long for the committees to be set up. Effectively, these committees will only begin their programme of work after Christmas.  They should have been set up ages ago.  The mechanisms should have been there.  The committees should have been ready to run almost at the same time as the life of the new Parliament began.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Government at this stage to consider the greater use of select committees for the consideration of detailed and technical Bills.  We, in this House, now see all the irony of the Companies Bill, to which this House gave such attention during the life of the last Seanad.  Now the other House has referred it to a select committee.  It might be more appropriate that from the very beginning Bills like the Companies Bill should, for Committee Stage, be referred to either a committee of this House, or of the other House, or to a joint committee.</P>
    <P>Those of us who worked on the Bankruptcy Bill in joint committee will realise the greater flexibility which such committee work gives on detailed, technical <Col N="734" /> Bills of this kind.  I would ask the Leader of the House to convey to the Government the feeling that greater use of select committees on technical, complicated legislation would make for more efficient and effective working of the House.</P>
    <P>In welcoming the establishment of these five committees today, and assuring the House that we will certainly play our full part in seeing that they are effective, I would like the Leader of the House to convey to the Government our concern lest this be seen as the end of the matter. There is a need for a considerable number of other committees in this House.</P>
    <P>We have, on the Order Paper, a motion asking for the reconstitution of the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism. That was a very timely committee.  Some very important issues were aired when that committee was in existence.  Some very important legislation emanated from that committee. We are asking for its reconstitution. I would ask that while we obviously accept what is proposed today the omissions from the list be noted by the Leader of the House and that we be given a further opportunity to come back to this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to talk briefly about the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation.  I was a founder member of this committee in the Dáil in 1973 and 1977 and I know quite a bit about its workings.  But, just as this year in the context of the NESC report we are reviewing Ireland's place in the context of the European Community, it may be time to take stock as well in so far as this specific committee is concerned.  It is entitled the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  Its primary functions are: (1)  to examine programmes and guidelines prepared by the Commission as a basis for possible legislative action and such drafts of regulations, directives decisions, recommendations and opinions of the Council of Ministers proposed by the Commission; (2) such acts of the institutions of this Community; (3)  such regulations under the European Communities Act, 1972; (4) such other instruments made under statute, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I wish to make is that this committee has been an extremely useful instrument of Parliament.  Unfortunately, it is reactive in nature and is not initiating much discussion.  It is reacting against many historical legislative issues already adopted by the Community.  It is entirely reactive because of its charter.  It does not have the scope on a wider basis to initiate debate or initiate activity or to take a broader view in positive Irish sense where the Community is concerned.  I would ask the Leader of the House to convey to the Government my views in that regard, that, perhaps at the first meeting of this newly-established European Committee, the charter on which it is <Col N="736" /> based be examined with a view to giving it much broader and positive scope rather than having it as simply a reactive instrument.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not share the sort of consensus that seems to exist in this House about the worthiness and use of these particular committees which are being set up.  Indeed, on the whole they are a waste of public money and a waste of the time of the public representatives. I have been &mdash; I was going to say &ldquo;privileged&rdquo;, but that is an unfortunate word &mdash; I have been on various committees for the past seven years and without exception I can say I do not think any of them have achieved anything in terms of legislation and very little in terms of the improvement or change in public attitudes to the subject which they have been addressing.  Indeed, were the committees to be reformed in this House, or to be reformed in the Dáil, I would possibly be able to support setting them up today but the fact is that these particular committees have no teeth, have no powers and have no influence.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of nearly all of them are simply and solely to report to the Oireachtas.  Neither House of the Oireachtas is under any obligation to debate those reports, to read them or to make recommendations as a result. Indeed, I can remember few of these reports being debated in the Dáil and very few of them being debated in this House.  What they have come to be is just a form of window dressing of particular issues which have served no purpose for this House and no purpose in legislation. We had no proposals from the Leader of the House when he proposed that these committees be set up that they be given teeth or influence or that there is any obligation on us to debate their reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain areas where what Senator Manning said is correct.  Were more select committees set up, were more committees set up which actually looked at legislation, recommended legislation or amendments to legislation on an all-party basis, I suggest that there might be some merit in setting up these <Col N="737" /> committees here today.  For any of us who have sat on them for years it would be dishonest and dishonourable to suggest that they have achieved anything or that they have changed public attitudes. Indeed, I would say that in certain respects the presentation of the reports of these committees is dishonest.  It is not secret to those of us who have sat on the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies that the reports which are issued are not written by Members of the House, as is suggested in what emerges; they are written by consultants who are paid large sums by the Houses and by the committees and are rubber stamped by the committee when they get the report of the consultants.  It does not even stop at that.  Not one single report was issued by the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies which was not written by paid consultants.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, when the management and the board of those organisations which were under examination were called in to be examined by those committees, the questions which were to be asked by the Deputies and Senators were written out for them by the consultants. I sat there at meeting after meeting with Deputies and Senators literally taking a piece of paper in front of them which was given to them by the consultants and asking questions which were numbered 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and 8 and so on.  Not one single piece of individual initiative was necessary and hardly any was used.  Yet when the report was issued it was presented as though it was, first of all, written by the Members of the Oireachtas and, secondly, that the questions asked of management and unions were initiated by Members of the Oireachtas.  Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    <P>To take another example, the B &amp; I report which was issued &mdash; a very extensive good report, again written by consultants &mdash; was actually presented and written after the B &amp; I Bill came before this House a few weeks later.  It was an absurdity that there were Members of the Oireachtas wasting their time writing a report which had absolutely no input into <Col N="738" /> the legislation which was already before the House.  That report was never debated, will never be debated and should not be debated.  Yet hours of paid consultants' money was used for that particular purpose.</P>
    <P>I sat also on a committee which, thank God, is defunct, a committee on legislation. That committee was sitting and taking submissions on the Radio Bill which was supposed to come before the House a few months later.  All that committee did was sit, take submissions, accept submissions and make no recommendations and issue no report.  Yet expenses were claimed, time was spent, special civil servants were used for the purpose of keeping that particular, utterly redundant and useless committee going.</P>
    <P>If these committees are to be supported they have got to have teeth.  They are not to be used as a means of party political patronage, where the chairmanships are given out willy-nilly on the basis of one for each party and to those who do not get Cabinet posts or do not get senior Opposition posts.  That is exploitation of the committees of this House.  It is giving nominal positions to those who do not get positions in other areas and it is showing scant respect for the work of the committee.  I oppose these committees because they are going to produce reports which nobody will take any notice of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of the need to include two committees, the foreign affairs committee and the overseas development aid committee, I would like to refer to the need for the overseas development aid committee to be established. It is sad that we respond to Ethiopia when it becomes an emergency and that we are dependent on the media to highlight something that has been ongoing since the mid-eighties.  We could multiply Ethiopia by many African states.  We are <Col N="741" /> talking about Africa in crisis.  It is essential that a committee such as the overseas development aid committee would address the whole issue of development, which is not just emergency moneys or financial assistance but an ongoing assessment of our need to raise the whole issue of development.  We are not so very far away ourselves from a famine situation and the attitudes, values etc. that exist today in relation to famine in Africa are very like the attitudes that existed way back in our own country.</P>
      <P>If we are to have such a committee, the new area which worries me is that, with the changing face of eastern Europe, African countries and Third World countries in general will be way down the priority list of funding, which will create a greater emergency for them.  There are historical problems, colonial problems, the problem of drought, physical problems, climatic disabilities, etc.  I have not had an input into a previous overseas development aid committee but I hope that with the emergence of such a committee the first thing we would tackle would be our disgraceful drop in relation to how low we are in this so-called Christian country as regards reaching the United Nations target.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that in this country we have to rely over and over again on voluntary contributions.  That is not just in relation to Third World development; it is in relation to our own poor, who depend on voluntary organisations rather than the Government.  I know we have had problems ourselves with regard to recession but there is always the danger that when we are in recession we forget totally about those who are deprived, starving and dying.  It saddens me that we have to have a discussion today about why the emergency debate could not take place to help Ethiopia now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In supporting Senator Manning, I hope that when we have that committee &mdash; and I say &ldquo;when&rdquo;, not &ldquo;if&rdquo;&mdash; it will be constructive and will view what I would consider the most needy global situation and that we will not be perceived as craw-thumping or responding when the media <Col N="742" /> tell us but will respond as a Government to the deepening crisis.</P>
    <P>It is Africa in crisis, and we should consider the problem constructively, sincerely and in a non-political fashion.  We should lift our contributions, especially if the economy is becoming buoyant.  We should not forget that the most generous country in regard to Third World aid happens to be a Third World country itself.  I think that puts a big question mark on our western values and western democracy.  I plead that that committee be given priority and that we do not just respond to Ethiopia at emergency level but look at the full notion of development which brings it right down even to the classroom.  I plead with the Minister for Education that she instantly set up a development section and include development education in the new curriculum, to create an awareness in our young people that they will follow through.  The underlying related problems should be studied.  We should not become mobile only when we see the problem on our screens and when the media tell us we should act.</P>

      <P>Very briefly, I would like to support the view of Senator McGowan in regard to his comments to Senator Ross.  I regret to have to say that Senator Ross is looking for an element of notoriety. I was a member of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities and I attended most of those meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, he made the point that members were claiming expenses.  That is ridiculous because the meetings were all held on the days the Seanad or Dáil met. He levels very serious reflection on many members of those committees and I regret that very much.  In my time on those committees I never saw a question handed to a member of the committee to ask.  We debated reports which were prepared by our members, notably Senator Mary Robinson.  Senator Ross should withdraw much of what he said because he has been unfair to the many members of those committees and the <Col N="743" /> officials who work very hard to bring about good results.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">

      <P>In so far as the selection of committees is concerned, truly they are instant committees.  I got them in much the same way as one purchases instant soup, two seconds before one cooks it.  I got these one minute before the House sat this afternoon.  It is unacceptable to expect anybody to make a meaningful comment on the contents of these committees when they are administered to one in that manner.  Certainly, we would have liked to have had a reasonable opportunity to go through them to see what is contained in them and what is left out.  As far as what is conspicious by its absence, certainly the foreign affairs committee is of concern to us.  It is in this House and those in the other House who should be formulating and be involved in the creation of policy in relation to foreign affairs rather than it being the exclusive property of civil servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very concerned that the overseas development aid committee does not appear.  That has to be a matter of great <Col N="744" /> and immediate concern to us, because we all have seen, even as late as last night, the terrible situation which is developing in Ethiopia.  It is important that this country, if for no other reason but for its own self-interest, should take a reasonable and serious attitude to development aid for Third World countries.</P>
    <P>There are other matters also which are conspicuous by their absence.  There is no mention of a committee on poverty. The report from the Conference of the Major Religious Superiors tells us in fairly stark terms that there are of the order of one million people in this country who are living below the poverty line.  Surely those people are worth consideration by a committee of the Oireachtas?</P>
    <P>To judge our values and our priorities, the page dealing with the first committee, which incidentally I had an opportunity to read, tells us that it is: &ldquo;To direct and control the Oireachtas Restaurant&rdquo;.  Lo and behold, item number one by way of priority for the Houses of the Oireachtas is to control and direct the Oireachtas Restaurant.  What does that tell us about ourselves?  I will let you draw your own conclusions.</P>
    <P>Item No. 3 states: &ldquo;To regulate and supervise the operation of the research service for Members&rdquo;.  As far as the Labour Party are concerned, we will be talking about basic research, research tools such as a chair to sit down on and a desk on which one can write letters rather than writing them up against the wall and, at the same time, trying to get an opportunity to sneak a phone call while one of our colleagues is speaking in the Dáil.  It is disgraceful that we should have to talk in these terms when we are expected to function as serious parliamentarians who have to make meaningful contributions to serious issues affecting our people &mdash; to find that we do not have a desk to sit at or have the use of a telephone.</P>
    <P>I am sure the other committees are OK because, as somebody said, if they worked in the last Seanad they should be able to work in this one also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to congratulate the Acting Chairman on his elevation to high office.</P>
      <P>Despite the outburst of Senator McGowan from the Fianna Fáil Government benches, I want to put it clearly on the record that the first I heard, or as far as I know anybody on this side of the House heard, about these committees &mdash; their number and the names &mdash; was this morning and not last night, although there was an indication that they were coming.  However, at the last meeting of the Committee of Selection there was no indication they were there.  If, as Senator McGowan said, they have been selecting members for those committees over a period of time, that is grossly unfair to the rest of us who heard nothing about them until this morning.  We now have to make a decision before tomorrow morning for the report of the Committee of Selection.  If information was available earlier we should have had it.  We certainly did not have it &mdash; by inference, by innuendo, by information, or otherwise.</P>
      <P>We are very cranky in this House when Ministers are interrupted in order to go to vote in the other House.  One of the great problems of the work of the committees of this House is that, precisely as Senator Fallon has said, they all meet during the sittings of this House.  I have long been opposed to that extraordinary practice.  If committees are to be operational, functional, effective and efficient they should meet at a time when the Houses are not meeting, and somebody else can worry about expenses.  It is disgraceful that when a vote is called in this House or in the other House when a committee is in session half its members have to leave.  That is going on all the time and, for that reason, committees should function outside the times of the sittings of the Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now want to put on record again what has already been said by Senator Manning and Senator Jackman in relation to the resuscitation or the reinstatement of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Development Co-Operation. It is essential that this committee be set up.  There are people in this country <Col N="746" /> whose life's work is to look after overseas development.  Their involvement is full time and complete.  At present we are giving 0.16 of a percentage point of GNP to overseas development aid.  In 1986 that figure was 0.27.  In other words, it has actually halved over the last three years, halved in the period of time since this committee was abolished, because we are failing to keep public awareness and consciousness on this issue.  The United Nations' recommendation is 0.7.  We are a disgrace in the civilised world.</P>
    <P>We are disgracefully selfish and greedy as a State.  It is not good enough for us to say that people are giving it on the ground.  This form of unsolicited taxation which people are paying should be reflected by the State.  If the people are generous, the State should reflect a similar generosity.  That is something we need to look at, it is something we are required to look at and it is something that we are committed to in the UN.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about that commitment it is essential that it should be reflected in the Estimates for the Departments each year.  It is clear that Ireland, being the 23rd or 24th richest country in the world has one of the most abysmal records in terms of official State aid to the Third and developing world.  That is a fact.  It does not matter what people put into black babies boxes or how they try to expiate our national embarrassment by contributing to all sorts of fund raisings. That is the people's response to the Government's abrogation of its responsibility.</P>
    <P>One small step along that road would be the setting up of the overseas development co-operation committee.  This would be a reflection of what people want.  People have shown this in their response to Live Aid and in other initiatives collecting money and resources for the Third World.  They respond to it every time a television programme shows another of the world's black spots.  We have a great sense of need to respond quickly and immediately but the Government we elect to do that job are ineffective and refuse to move on it.  It is good that we are really top of the <Col N="747" /> league for independent generosity to the poor but we are much nearer the bottom in terms of Government and State aid.</P>
    <P>I want to draw attention to the fact that that dichotomy exists.  It is reflected here today in the fact that we do not have a committee to direct attention to something which is of grave interest to all citizens of this country because there is no doubt that as well as being top of the league in terms of generosity to the Third World individually and being at the bottom of the league in terms of State support for Third World and overseas development aid, our citizens are among the most knowledgeable in the developed world about what happens in other parts of the world.  That concern, generosity and interest should be reflected in the setting up of an overseas development aid committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would regret if the Labour Party became paranoid about the order of speaking and I would simply remind them that they do not actually have sufficient numbers to constitute a group.  So, in some ways, allocation of time can be seen as reasonably generous. I say that in a spirit of total begrudgery because Senator Upton stole my best line.  I, like him, had clearly noticed that the very first item is the establishment of the restaurant, which seems to place the senatorial gaff above the needs of the world.  There is no question of doubt that this is underlined by the fact that a number of distinguished public figures were throughout lunch time outside the gates of Leinster House picketing both Houses of the Oireachtas because of the shameful situation that is being allowed to occur with regard to overseas development aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join completely with what has been said around the House, that we are in a very regrettable situation.  I will not repeat what Senators Upton, Jackman, O'Toole and others have said but I would simply add my little grain to what they have said.  It is not just the situation that our contribution officially has declined catastrophically.  It is, in addition to that, <Col N="748" /> true alas, to state that we actually benefit disproportionately from many of the Third World countries.  For example, as our aid to Sudan has declined, our exports to Sudan have rocketed.  We are, in fact, profiteering at the expense of those whom we no longer find it convenient to support at the levels of a few years ago, which even then did not meet the requirements of the situation.  I urge that the committee which existed previously should be re-established.</P>
    <P>I would like to say that I applaud Senator Shane Ross's honesty in what he said.  His experience is quite different from mine.</P>

      <P>I may say that I also was aware that the operations of the committee to which he referred were suspect precisely because, although Senator McGowan proved incapable of understanding the point Senator Ross was making, reports were drafted by civil servants and questions were supplied.  I was aware of this, that, in other words, it was merely a dumb show intended to mislead the public into thinking that intellectual activity of some kind was actually taking place when it was not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, to be fair, I have to say that the committee in which I was involved did very good work.  It was non-partisan and there were positive contributions from all the parties involved.  That was the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights chaired by Deputy Monica Barnes.  That important committee which considered reports, interviewed leaders of industry and examined sections of Irish life where there was a possibility of women being discriminated did very valuable work.  I would like to correct the record because it was stated without contradiction that these committees met always on sitting days of the Oireachtas.  This was not the case with <Col N="749" /> this committee.  We quite frequently met, even during a period in the summer, when neither House was sitting.  It is important that accuracy be maintained in this matter.</P>
    <P>I would like to seek some guidance from the Chair with regard to whether it is possible and, if not, why, to amend this item to seek the inclusion of an expediency motion requiring the establishment of an Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs which has not been established.  I would like guidance to see if it is not possible to amend this item so as to include that important matter.  I certainly believe it is logically related.  If we are not able to include it, does that not tell us something about the way in which our operations are spancelled by red tape and out-of-date regulations in this House?  I would like to say that I consider it extremely important that we establish this foreign affairs committee. It is related to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Development Aid.</P>

      <P>If the Senator would allow me to make just two points.  My understanding is that Senators are being allowed four minutes each.  The Senator has now exceeded his time.  I would be glad to give him another few words if he wishes.  In relation to the committee on foreign affairs, it is a matter which should more properly have been raised on the Order of Business.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take issue first with Senator Norris in his rather begrudging reference to the Labour Party, that they do not properly constitute a group.  I suppose if we looked at a textbook definition of what constitutes a group it might be difficult to find that a number of Independents constitute a group either.  I would not like to introduce the same note of begrudgery into the matter.  They are quite entitled to form a group for whatever reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the matter before us, not having been in the House before obviously I have not had the experience of seeing Oireachtas joint committees in operation.  I have not had the opportunity of going through them but the very first one there relates to a matter that, proportionately, is far more trivial than what <Col N="752" /> is being referred to as being absent from the supplementary Order Paper.  I would like to lend my voice to those who have asked that the foreign affairs committee should not be omitted.  We have already in this House discussed the question&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I ruled that issue out of order.  It is a matter that could more properly be raised on the Order of Business. It is not appropriate to what is before the House.  I rule it out of order. I am going to be very firm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I will move on to the next point.  A committee on foreign affairs has already been referred to and I lend my support to those who said it should be included.  The overseas development aid committee has been referred to and has been dealt with at length as well.  We are a country which has provided a tremendous amount in charity but when it comes down to discussing what the State should do in taking the initiative the matter is not allowed to come before the House. It is left with the civil servants or to the populace at large but we who have the authority to take decisions on this matter are not given the opportunity in relation to committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleagues, Senator Upton, has said there should be a further committee in relation to poverty, unemployment and emigration.  These are very relevant issues which concern every single man, woman and child in this country.  We do not have a committee to deal with them. We are talking about one million poor, about 250,000 unemployed, about 40,000 to 50,000 emigrating annually.  Why have we not got a committee dealing with <Col N="753" /> those matters?  These are substantial relevant matters and should be on the supplementary Order Paper today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, may I ask for clarification as to why, for example, discussion of overseas development aid or the committee on poverty, neither of which also appear on the Order Paper, was deemed to be less irregular than commentary on the foreign affairs committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris had exceeded his time by two or three minutes and I asked him to make his remarks relevant to what was on the Order Paper.  Senator Costello spoke well within his limit and I was a little tolerant. I now call on Senator Lanigan to conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are here today to discuss five joint committees of the Houses.  The matter of other committees is not before us today.  We are speaking on specific issues.  I am very perturbed that somebody tried to trivialise the work done by certain committees.  It is disgraceful that people should get up here and just because there is a joint committee on services in this House there is an intent to trivialise it.  The Senators who are talking about the setting up of this particular committee are the very people who give out about the waste of public money in this House and possibly outside this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Joint Services Committee is a most important committee and there is a lot of money spent by the Members of this House and on the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I do not think it should be trivialised as was attempted.  It is a most important committee but, of course, it might be a question of seeking <Col N="754" /> a headline.  Perhaps that was not what was meant but I must say it seemed to me that was the inference that was being drawn.</P>
    <P>I was disgusted to hear the remarks of Senator Ross on the operation of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the EC.  That committee sat day after day, hour after hour and it has brought forward many&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>And never once&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the one the Senator was on.  The Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the EC was the committee that was mentioned and it was one committee that did sit and brought forward a large number of reports.  The Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies definitely brought forward a lot of reports and is well regarded&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was well regarded by everybody who attended those meetings. Questions were asked by Members of the Oireachtas.  It is disgraceful that it is inferred here by Senator Ross that these questions were put into the mouths of members of that committee.  That is not true.  The word &ldquo;inaccurate&rdquo; was mentioned. I would say that it is not true.  It is disgraceful that matters like this should be brought up in this House.  Again, there is a trivialisation of the work of these committees.  In future this type of trivialisation or inaccurate statement should not be allowed to be made in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>This is nonsense.  Senator Lanigan was not even sitting on the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is that we have agreed that there are these joint committees.  I take on board the points that have been raised regarding the need for a foreign affairs committee and for the committee on overseas development <Col N="755" /> aid.  Again, we can bring forward these suggestion to the Committee on Procedures and Privileges and to the Government and we can take it from there.</P>
      <P>On the setting up of other technical committees, joint committees or committees of this House, committees of this House are a matter for the Committee on Procedures and Privileges of the House in consultation with the Government and we will have discussions with the Government on the setting up of other committees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, the situation is that one of the points that Senator Upton made was, that today they were handed a document as new Senators and without having any opportunity whatever to consider the terms of reference as set out they are being asked to vote on something which they have not been able to digest and examine properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>My advice, Senator, is that once the Leader of the House summarises, the debate is closed at that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that.  I can understand that procedure.  The fact of the matter is that he did not reply to the question Senator Upton raised and that was whether they would be afforded time or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is that these joint committees have been set up. The question was asked last week by the Leader of the Opposition in this House as to when these committees would be set up and I replied.  If Senators look at last week's debate they will find out exactly what I said.  I do not think it should be inferred that this has been thrown at new Members or anybody else. It was brought to the notice of the Members of the House last week when the Leader of the Opposition asked a question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, some very serious charges were made by Senator Ross.  My understanding of what he said was that all committees of the House operated in the way in which he described.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>May I please speak without interruption for one moment to make my point? My understanding was &mdash; I listened very carefully &mdash; and that all committees operated in this particular way.  As somebody who has served as a chairman of a committee and vice-chairman, who wrote many reports, none of which appeared under my name without my being fully aware of what was in it and having written most of it &mdash; the same was true of Senator Robinson on the same committee, of Senator Walsh as he then was &mdash; I take very great exception to what he said.  I feel this is a slander on all people who worked on those committees over the years and who produced reports, some of which may have been ignored, others of which may have been influential but the reports were produced by the people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I really want to clarify today whether the charges made by Senator Ross are being made against all the committees or whether they are being made against one specific committee.  If he is making very serious charges of what amounts to a virtual dereliction of duty against members of a specific committee, this matter is so serious that it should be referred to either the Committee on Procedures and Privileges of both Houses or to some body where the charges can either be substantiated or, as I am sure is more correctly the case, shown to be false.  I cannot have a situation where a gross slander is allowed to stand against the names of many very hard-working <Col N="757" /> Members of all parties in both Houses. I regard the matter as one of extreme gravity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, first, I wish to record my opposition to this motion for the very good reason that the Leader of the House misled the House just now in his speech.  Secondly, because you have allowed Senator Manning to ask the question, which was stretching the procedures of the House, I should be allowed to reply to it.  The point I was making about questions asked by Members of both Houses being put to them and written by consultation apply to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies and I stand fully and four-square behind that statement. It applies exclusively to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 32, after &ldquo;forensic testing&rdquo; to delete &ldquo;all or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>What we have got in the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Bill is a substantial piece of legislation which seeks to harness technological developments that have occurred in recent times in the fight against crime.  For that reason, we feel it is extremely important that proper well-thought out, relevant amendments would be introduced, as we have done &mdash; we have introduced 16 amendments &mdash; and that they would be accepted by the Minister. We are very concerned that so far the Minister has not accepted any of them.</P>
      <P>We have here on the Report Stage three of the central amendments which we feel would plug the loopholes or the gaps in this legislation.  We feel the legislation is flawed and perhaps nowhere so much as in section 2, because effectively what the Bill is stating is that there really is little or no need to provide caution or restraint in the exercise of these extremely wide powers.  This section is a prime example of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section makes provision for a person in custody under the provisions of section 30 of the Offences Against the <Col N="774" /> State Act, 1939.  We all know just how wide the powers are in that Act in relation to offences, scheduled and unscheduled, and in relation to the length of time of detention &mdash; 24 hours with the possibility of doubling that to 48 hours on the authorisation of a superintendent.  In the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 the powers are extremely wide also.</P>
    <P>We are trying to say that the reference should be to &ldquo;appropriate samples&rdquo; rather than have a catch-all phrase which covers every single possible test and sample.  It should not be &ldquo;all or&rdquo; but should be &ldquo;any&rdquo;.  In other words, it should provide that the appropriate sample would be taken rather than that potentially the entirety would be open to be taken.  Consider what can be done. Under section 2 (1) (a) a sample of blood can be taken with consent and with a medical practitioner being there.  In other words an assault on a person with a needle and a sample of their blood is taken.  Under section 2 (1) (a) (ii) pubic hair, again with the consent of the person, can be taken but it can be taken forcefully if that consent is not given and with a medical practitioner being there.  So a public hair is either pulled out or cut off. A urine sample can be taken without the presence of a medical practitioner. Under subsection (1) (a) (iv) saliva can be taken, consent will be requested.  In relation to subsection (1) (a) (v) &mdash; a hair other than a pubic hair &mdash; a garda is simply entitled to take that without provision as to how it will be taken.  It can be forcefully pulled or it can be cut.  A nail can be taken off the finger of an individual or part of a nail without any supervision.  A garda has the authority to take it without a medical practitioner being present.  All of these can be taken off the same individual.  &ldquo;In relation to any material found under a nail&rdquo;, a garda can poke under a nail to take a sample there.  Subparagraph (b) refers to a swab from any part of the body other than a body orifice or genital region.  Again, there is no medical person present while the person presumably is stripped and can have their body searched and a swab taken from them.  Sub-paragraph (c) <Col N="775" /> refer to a swab from a body orifice or genital region.  In that case consent would be sought and a medical practitioner would be present for that but that is a considerable instruction on the personal privacy of an individual.  For a dental impression consent is required and the presence of a medical practitioner.  The last item refers to a footprint or a similar impression of any part of the person's body other than a part of his hand or mouth.  All of that can be taken by a garda, without the presence of a medical practitioner.</P>
    <P>Consider how wide and how extensive are the quantity and the quality of the intervention with the person's bodily integrity.</P>
    <P>The section says that every single one of these testings can take place on a single individual.  Surely that is unnecessary?  If this legislation is intended to update us on technological developments that have taken place in relation to genetic fingerprinting &mdash; and we have been told that enormous strides have taken place &mdash; what is the necessity for all of these samples being taken in any situation?  Surely the appropriate sample is all that is required?  It is just part of the approach which prvades this Bill, namely, the catch-all nature of the Bill, that we have the powers as extensive as possible with a limited amount of restraint.  It is, therefore, a flawed Bill.</P>
    <P>Any Bill that gives powers without restraints is a flawed Bill.  Here, seemingly, is an attempt to do just that.  There is no justification in the eyes of any reasonable person to require all of these samples.  The Bill would be much better, much more reasonable, much less open to abuse, if our amendment was accepted.  We acknowledge that technological developments should be introduced but the powers should be given in such a manner as to be appropriate to what the occasion demands.  The amendment is a very valuable one and we would like the Minister to accept it.</P>

      <P>I wish simply to reiterate what Senator Costello has just said in <Col N="776" /> relation to the very wide powers which are provided for.  This matter has been debated very extensively at the earlier Stages.  If I remember correctly, I sought an explanation why, at the present level of development in forensic science, it would be necessary to obtain all of those samples Senator Costello has mentioned. I did not obtain an explanation then.  I would welcome it even at this late stage.</P>
      <P>I have a certain knowledge of these affairs and I would certainly have great difficulty in accepting why that range of sampling and analysis could be necessary in anything like what one might call the average case.</P>
      <P>It is all right to say that the Garda will be reasonable or, for that matter, that medical practitioners will be reasonable.  Indeed, I have no doubt that they will.  At the same time, I imagine that good legislation will narrow down what can be done to what needs to be done rather than to provide a wide range of powers and possibilities which really are fairly brain-blowing when you think of them &mdash; the capacity to take off a nail.  A full nail is provided for in this Bill.  This is dark ages stuff.  Why in the name of anything that is good and holy are we providing for the taking off of somebody's nail?  Would it ever be necessary?  If it is not necessary why is that provision allowed in the Bill? We should be told why.  If legislation is to be appropriate then we should narrow things down to providing for what needs to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Gaeltacht (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to refer to the contribution by Senator Costello.  He obviously made an inadvertent reference when he suggested that a pubic hair could be taken forcibly without consent.  I want to make it abundantly clear that a pubic hair cannot be taken forcibly without consent.  In relation to the suggestion by Senator Upton that a full nail can be taken, the Bill states categorically that it is a sample of a nail.  In relation to this amendment by the various Senators to delete &ldquo;all or&rdquo; in section 2 (1) the primary reason why <Col N="777" /> the words &ldquo;all or&rdquo; are included in subsection (1) is to make it absolutely clear that the Garda can obtain more than one type of sample from a person.</P>
      <P>They are also there to allow for the possibility that in an appropriate case it would be open to the Garda Síochána to obtain all the samples referred to in the subsection.  I fully accept that the number of cases in which it would be necessary for the Garda to seek all the types of sample which are listed in subsection (1) are likely to be very few &mdash; I repeat, very few.  Where such cases occur, take, for example, a very serious sexual assault &mdash; that was referred to by Senator Conroy on Committee Stage &mdash; I believe the Garda should be in a position to obtain whatever samples are required to assist them in bringing the perpetrator to justice.</P>
      <P>I would add that subsection (1) would not allow a garda in every case to take all of the samples which are mentioned. This, of course, is because a Garda officer of at least superintendent rank must authorise the taking of every sample and before such authorisation can be given the offender must have reasonable grounds for believing that the sample will tend to confirm or, indeed, disprove the involvement of a suspect in the offence under investigation.  Obviously, a superintendent could not issue an authorisation for the taking of a sample unless it could be established that the sample could be used in the investigation of the offence in question or he would leave himself open to very serious disciplinary charges.</P>
      <P>As I said on Committee Stage, I am satisfied the Garda will not take people off the street willy-nilly for the sake of taking samples.  They must have reasonable grounds for this.  While the amendment is possibly well intended, since the Committee Stage it has been given further serious thought.  I regret that I cannot accept the amendment.  The Bill is better standing as it is with the words &ldquo;all or&rdquo; included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to a number of items to which Senator <Col N="778" /> Upton and myself referred in our remarks.  Firstly, in relation to my reference to the pubic hair, I was distinguishing between various samples that can be taken, some where consent is sought, some where a medical adviser is present, some where a medical adviser is not.  That is the context in which I refer to the pubic hair.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Minister's remarks about taking a sample in paragraph (6), &ldquo;a sample of a nail&rdquo; is certainly a very vague wording.  That to my mind is quite open to interpretation as to whether the entire nail, a small part of the nail, a large part of the nail can be taken.  If you take a sample of a hair, presumably you are taking a sample of the entire hair.  If you take a sample of a nail, are you taking a sample of the entire nail or part of the nail?  It is certainly left open to that.  It is badly worded, badly drafted.  We want to pick up the flaws in the Bill.  We are not opposed to the Bill <i>per se.</i> It is the flaws in the Bill we are concerned about.</P>
      <P>In relation to the central issue of all the samples, the Minister has put his finger on it himself.  He said that the intention of the Bill is that samples should be taken as required.  That is precisely what we were saying, the appropriate sample, not all samples.  Not all of these situations would give rise to sampling but that as required, as appropriate.  The Bill leaves it wide open and in the process leaves it wide open to abuse.</P>
      <P>We are told that genetic finger printing is a very precise art, a very precise science so, therefore, even if it a serious offence once you have got one sample then you should be able to determine from that sample, once it is the appropriate sample, what your needs are in relation to determination of the offence.  That is the point we are getting at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a previous occasion when discussing this Bill I asked the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, to make a statement in relation to statistics in which wide powers were given under the Offences Against the State Act and the Criminal Justice Act in relation to superintendents authorising their right to extend powers <Col N="779" /> of detention from 24 hours to 48 hours and from six hours to 12 hours.  The Minister said he would get that information. The Minister of State here today came back the next day to say no such information existed, no statistics had been compiled.  I stated that from my contacts with legal people &mdash; lawyers, barristers, solicitors &mdash; that provision was a mere formality, that superintendents granted the permission and that it seemed to be giving the veneer of importance and authority that the permission was granted only by a person of the rank of superintendent. There is scope for abuse.  We are trying to tie down the Bill so that the scope for abuse is not there.  We are not saying that it is taking place, but the fact is that the scope is there and it is included in this section.</P>
    <P>In the past, there has been quite a lot of trouble in this country and, in our island neighbour, in relation to allegations of ill-treatment.  Some were proven, perhaps some were not.  People have doubts.  There are many people in prison at present because of the wide powers exercised by the Garda and by police forces in other countries as well.</P>
    <P>We established an O'Briain committee of inquiry to provide safeguards which expressed very considerable concern about the wide powers that were given in certain emergency types of legislation. The Offences Against the State Act is emergency legislation passed in 1939, renewed in 1972, and the provisions extended in the 1984 Criminal Justice Act.  The Barra O'Briain committee warned that those wide powers, established in so much of our legislation, gave rise to abuse.  Therefore, in order to provide good legislation it is very important that we specify the powers we are giving to our police force.  It is in their interests, in our interests and in the interests of the citizens of the State and it is with that view that we are putting forward this amendment.</P>
    <P>Question, &lsquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand&rdquo;, put and declared carried.</P>

      <Col N="780" /> Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, to delete lines 41 to 46.</P>
      <P>This refers to two provisions in the Bill which apply to minors &mdash; paragraph (b) minors under the age of 17 and in paragraph (c) under the age of 14.  We had quite a thorough discussion of this on an earlier Stage.  Of all sections I have to state that we find these two paragraphs repugnant.  As was said before, they really refer to minors and are matters which could be properly dealt with under the new Children Bill, which is at present before the other House.</P>
      <P>In my view, section 6 is completely wrong.  It is saying that the consent of a person under 18 years is to be given by the person himself or by a parent or guardian.  I do not believe that can be real consent, because in other areas such consent is not binding on a person who is a minor, unless it is for his or her benefit. That is the manner in which contracts are entered into.  They are null and void unless any contract, any agreement, in which major consent is granted is for the benefit of the minor.</P>
      <P>There is a grave constitutional question as to whether a minor's constitutional rights, the right to bodily integrity, as stated in the Constitution in Article 40, can be consented away by someone else. As described in the section, that may mean a guardian or a parent.  Can a person in authority, even a guardian and a parent, consent away the rights of an individual?  Certainly there is a grave constitutional matter here.  We must remember that a guardian could also refer to a corporate body, an institution, what constitutes a fit person and so on.</P>
      <P>Under this section if the person does not consent, an adverse inference can be drawn.  That is irrelevant from what I have said and it leads to bad law.  The provision in paragraph (b) is a serious matter in relation to the whole question of minors under the age of 17.  I feel the Bill is totally wrong in incorporating that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to paragraph (c), I have no <Col N="781" /> doubt at all that this should not have been included.  It is an outrageous paragraph to have in a Bill of this type, stating that in the case of a person who has not attained the age of 14 years the consent of a parent or guardian will do.  It is a perverse proposition to state that a child can be criminally responsible from the age of seven to the age of 14, and all that that entails, and at the same time to state that that child's consent will not be asked for in the very intrusive sampling of parts of his or her body.</P>
    <P>It looks more like an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  They are mature enough to have committed a crime but not mature enough to be asked for their consent in relation to an intrusion on their bodily cells.  The only proper thing that can be done in relation to this paragraph is to remove it entirely, to deal with it under the 1988 Bill that is presently before the Dáil.  We assume that that Bill will incorporate a provision for an increase in the age of criminal responsibility. Certainly it could no longer remain at the ludicrous age of seven.  Indeed, the Bill, by implication, having removed the consent from the child under 14 years of age &mdash; we are talking about children remember &mdash; implies that the question of maturity is something which does not exist to the same degree under 14 years of age.  Therefore, that would imply that the age of criminal responsibility must be raised to a higher level.</P>
    <P>This is a matter we feel very strongly about.  We dealt with it at length on Committee Stage; we requested the Minister to deal with it, if not in exactly the terms we suggest but to take on board the intent of what we are saying.  At this stage we feel that he might agree to do that.  We are concerned with improving the legislation, not with being obstructive and we feel that this is a most appropriate area in which the Minister could be helpful. He would improve the Bill if he were.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator Costello said, particularly in relation to this contradiction, where in one situation the consent appears to be important and <Col N="782" /> in another situation the children's consent does not count.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment was discussed at length on Committee Stage last week.  The approach which the Bill already adopts in relation to parental consent is the correct one.  The Bill must provide for the taking of samples from persons under 17 years because, as we are all aware, crimes are committed by persons in that age group, sometimes serious crimes.</P>
      <P>With regard to the specific issues of consent, provision has been made in the Bill of a requirement of parential consent in the case of a person under 17 years of age where an intimate sample is being sought.  Where the person is over 14 but under 17 he or she will also have to consent to the taking of such a sample.</P>
      <P>I believe that what is being done in the Bill represents a fair and reasonable approach to the problems that arise where samples are required from persons of immature years.  I do not think it is necessary that the consent of an under-14 year old should be obtained in these cases.  I am satisfied their interests and rights would be fully safeguarded by their parents, and indeed by their doctor or dentist as the case maybe.  As I said on Committee Stage, I doubt whether a child under 14 years of age would be capable of understanding the significance of consent in the context of the Bill and I would think such consent would be rather meaningless.  I suppose the questions could be asked what value would consent have if it was given, could one be sure that it was a free and informed consent, would there not be a grave doubt that a child might simply agree, out of fear of refusing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the Senator's remarks about minors and their contracted obligations. This is not relevant.  We are talking here about criminal law, not civil law. The age of criminal responsibility is seven and full criminal responsibility is 14 years of age.  This is what is relevant in this case. Cases arise of young people committing <Col N="783" /> very serious offences.  There is no constitutional difficulty with what is proposed in this Bill and I regret I must oppose this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a connection between the civil and criminal side.  We are concerned about a person's maturity and that person's ability to give his or her name to something in terms of a contract. It requires maturity and responsibility. The same principle holds goods in criminal law.  Maturity and responsibility are both necessary principles.  The Minister has said there would not be much sense in having the consent of the child, because the child would not be capable of understanding, but the child is capable of committing the offence and is being regarded as having responsibility from the age of seven.</P>
      <P>There is a certain perversity of logic here.  On the one hand there is responsibility when it comes to penalising the child but, on the other hand, when you are giving the child the benefit of offering his consent or refusing it, then you say he is not capable of doing it.  I fail to understand the principle of that logic.</P>
      <P>With regard to the constitutional aspects, what the Minister has said has not satisfied me in any way.  He has not given any grounds as to why there might not be a test of the constitutionality of this section of the Bill.  I must remind the Minister that the wording in paragraphs (b) and (c) is precisely the wording in the British legislation, the Police and Evidence Bill passed in 1984 and that wording was taken verbatim from that Bill without any consideration of constitutional requirements because they did not have to consider constitutional requirements as there is no Constitution in that country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A precise wording from one jurisdiction will not necessarily suit the situation in another jurisdiction.  It is unsatisfactory.  We have had our freedom since 1922 and the least we can do is to put together our own legislation, not five-year-old legislation presented in carbon copy fashion from another jurisdiction, <Col N="784" /> especially when there are legal implications. I believe there are legal implications in this and I ask the Minister to reconsider that point.</P>
    <P>Question, &ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand&rdquo;, put and declared carried.</P>
    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No.3:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 45 and 46, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) (a) The Minister shall make regulations in relation to the testing of samples for the purpose of this Act.</P>
      <P>(b) The regulations shall make provision for the independent testing of samples.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is the final amendment.  These three amendments were taken as critical areas which the Labour Party felt needed to be amended because we felt this was a good Bill flawed by substantial errors.  We are asking in this amendment that the Minister make regulations in relation to the testing of samples for the purpose of the Act and that these regulations make provision for the independent testing of samples. That is what we call a modest and reasonable proposal.</P>
      <P>There are certain regulations in relation to the taking of samples.  There are none in relation to either the destruction of samples or the testing of samples. We have to ask who will test these samples? They have not been identified. What training will they have?  This has not been established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a new area of science.  Under what conditions will the samples be tested?  What conditions will operate from the taking of the samples &mdash; look at the quantity of samples we are dealing with &mdash; in the Garda station or the prison and when they arrive at the centre where the testing is to take place?  Will the Garda be responsible for their removal, for minding them while they are in the <Col N="785" /> Garda station?  When will they be taken out of the Garda station?  How will they be transported?  What monitoring will take place?  What supervision will take place?  Where will they be tested?  Where is the testing laboratory?  Is it the Garda Technical Bureau, the Forensic Science Laboratory?  Will it be farmed out to agencies to be tested?  What will be the supervision of the testing?  I understand it is an extremely labour-intensive business to test the genetic factors &mdash; we are talking about over 100,000 genes &mdash; and that it is done very slowly, that it takes a lot of time and therefore there could be the possibility of faults and fabrication. There is the possibility of sloppy procedures, inadequate training, care and caution. All of that is very relevant but there is nothing in the Bill relating to any of this.</P>
    <P>I would like to raise the question of the defence.  Will the defence have access to these samples for their own testing?  What will happen to the samples?  Will any of them be destroyed in the testing?  Will they be available for the defence to make independent tests?  There is no reference to this whatsoever in the Bill.  Is it possible that some test could result in the destruction of a sample?  I would hardly agree with what Senator Neville said on Committee Stage on the previous occasion.  In relation to the whole area of the breathalyser, there is no reference to the possibility of a sample being made available independently to be tested by the defendant and his counsel.  Is that intended?  It would certainly be one-sided justice if the sample was available to the prosecution but not available to the defence.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the enormous cost involved in any test.  It is extremely labour-intensive.  There are 100,000 genes to be compared and it is an expensive business.  Who will pay for the test? For example, if the defence require a test, will they be obliged to pay for it?  If there are to be so many tests as described in section 2, then it will be an extremely expensive business on the State and the defence.</P>
    <P>In matters of this nature it is extremely <Col N="786" /> important that regulations be made, that they provide for independent testing, that the samples be available to the defence and that the regulations be put before the Houses of the Oireachtas, so that the matter can be debated.  That is the proper way to do it.  Regulations were provided under the Criminal Justice Act and it would be desirable that this established precedent be continued.  The regulations could be examined by this House and by the Dáil and we would have an opportunity to debate and amend them, so that the Houses of the Oireachtas would be satisfied that adequate regulations had been provided for the testing of the samples.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Costello's amendment.  What he says is entirely true.  It is important for a number of reasons that provision be made for independent testing.  It is important at a scientific level that independent laboratories compare values with whatever laboratory the State employs to carry out this type of testing.  It is bound to result in an improvement in standards.  It is fairly standard practice in laboratories to send a certain proportion of samples to other laboratories, usually outside the country, in order to validate the methods, and to confirm that their results are comparable to what is being obtained elsewhere; in other words to ensure that the results are not biased.  These tests are very time-consuming and expensive.  It will be expensive for defendants to get samples tested.  It would also be expensive on the State.  There is also the question of the destruction of these samples; how long they need to be stored; and what changes will occur in samples during storage.  None of these things is covered in the legislation.  It is important that regulations be made to cover them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important matter is that inevitably, with the passage of time, the technology and methodology used in testing these samples is bound to change.  It is important that provision is made to introduce these changes as soon as possible after they become available.  Again, there is a possibility under this Bill that <Col N="787" /> important technological advances may not be introduced when it would be entirely appropriate that they should. Inevitably, the process involved will be speeded up.  That, of course, would make the possibility of having the samples tested by the defence so much easier than would appear to be the case now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting Senator Costello's amendment, I would like to preface my statement by saying that I welcome the Bill.  It is an excellent Bill. It is important that the Garda have available to them the most up-to-date technology in crime prevention and detection.  DNA fingerprinting provides cohesive and conclusive evidence of the guilt and, more importantly, the innocence of suspects.</P>
      <P>I fully agree that the Minister should make regulations in relation to the testing of samples.  It is important that everybody concerned has full confidence in the procedures adopted.  This will ensure that proper facilities and systems are in place. It will also protect the people involved in introducing the procedures and those involved at the point of taking the test to the point of producing and submitting the reports.</P>
      <P>I also support amendment No. 3 (b) which provides that &ldquo;The regulations shall make provision for the independent testing of samples.&rdquo;  While I have full confidence in the Garda forensic laboratory, every organisation and every system is subject to human error and a facility should be available to have the sample of an accused person independently tested and checked.  This is, as I have already said, an expensive procedure. A person who may not have the means to test DNA independently, should have available to him a facility to check it without incurring expense. Again, I want to emphasise that is not casting aspersions on the Garda forensic laboratory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 provides that futher subsections (4) (a) and (b) be inserted in section 5.  In <Col N="788" /> relation to that, I wish to state that the vast majority of the samples taken, including samples for DNA testing under the power provided in the Bill, will be sent for testing to the Forensic Science Laboratory at Garda headquarters and tests will be carried out there.  This laboratory is currently staffed by some 24 highly qualified scientists under the directorship of Dr. Jim Donovan.  This laboratory has earned a high reputation in the relatively short number of years it has been in operation.  Its competence and objectivity has at no time been called into question.</P>
      <P>The actual tests which are carried out in the laboratory are of a scientific nature and many of them very complex.  It would be both inappropriate and well-nigh impossible to prescribe in regulations how such tests should be performed.  Like any expert evidence, medical or scientific evidence of the results of forensic testing must be assessed by the court.</P>
      <P>In so far as there may be concern about how samples are handled after they are taken and before they reach the Forensic Science Laboratory, the position is that they are treated like any other piece of physical evidence, that is to say they must be dealt with in a manner which will later establish to the satisfaction of the court, should the issue arise, that there could be no question of tampering and that it is safe to admit the evidence obtained from tests of the sample.  I would not agree that regulations are needed in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the question of a suspect being entitled to have independent tests carried out, as I said on Committee Stage it is fully possible at present.  It is not uncommon for the accused to retain the services of an independent finger print expert where fingerprint evidence is an issue.  I believe there is no need to make regulations for the matters covered by this amendment.  It is proper to point out to the House that each test costs in the region of £200.  I can confirm that the test would be carried out by the Forensic Science Laboratory.  Senator Neville referred to independent testing of samples. This is possible and it is open to any <Col N="789" /> accused person to have tests carried out in a private laboratory if he wishes to challenge the accuracy of the State's evidence. It is also important to point out that if the accused is covered by the legal aid scheme, the independent testing is covered under the same scheme.  As I said earlier in relation to the other amendments, they are possibly well-intentioned, but if they were to be included this section would be unworkable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that the samples in the majority of cases &mdash; to use his words &mdash; would be tested in the Forensic Science Laboratory at Garda headquarters.  Is there an implicit suggestion that the facilities at the Forensic Science Laboratory would not be adequate or that it is likely that a further source would be used?  If that is the case, that is all the more reason to make independent testing available.  I am glad to hear the Minister say that it would be available.  Remember, not so long ago fingerprint evidence went astray in the Garda Technical Bureau.  One would have thought that nothing could go wrong with something as foolproof as fingerprint evidence, but in the case of the investigation into the assassination of the British Ambassador it was discovered that an entirely innocent person had been attributed with having the fingerprints in question.  A more recent example, is the case of the Birmingham Six, where the forensic testing was not properly conducted <Col N="790" /> or monitored, though it was carried out in the confines of the police forensic laboratory.  Nevertheless, a miscarriage of justice occurred.  We are seeking to prevent the situation where something can go wrong.  I do not believe that there should be reasons for not having regulations to govern forensic testing.  We are seeking to establish procedures that will be followed by those involved.  It is reasonable for us to request that the procedures be included in legislation. It is not unreasonable that regulations covering the procedures to be followed in testing should be put before this House.</P>
      <P>It is in the interest of everybody involved, the prosecution, the Garda and the defendant, that matters be clearly stated, so that nobody could at any future time raise doubts or point a finger wrongly.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter.  The precedent was developed in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, whereby regulations on certain matters were put before the Oireachtas. It is appropriate that regulations be put before both Houses, that we have an opportunity to examine them, so that the House would be satisfied that proper procedures for testing were in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I spent considerable time in dealing with the issues arising from this proposed legislation since the last date on which we discussed it.  On that occasion, as I indicated before, I had much more to say on the matter.  The House may be pleased to know I have misplaced my notes, which is the reason my head was down.  When you were waiting for me to offer I was looking through the Bill trying to recall what I had to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, what I said before is on the record and I will not go back over those areas.  I want to reiterate a point of some substance which I was developing on the conclusion of business on the last occasion, that is the affirmative process versus the negative process.  I am particularly concerned about the section of the Bill which accommodates the changeover of these new arrangements.  Section 5 of the Bill gives the Minister power to bring in new regulations and to do anything which appears to him necessary or expedient to remove difficulties which might arise over the next three years.  In the regulations on these matters, which are obviously and can only be quite fundamental, it is only necessary for the Minister to have the regulations drawn up and laid before the Houses.  They do not need to be discussed, passed or affirmed by the House.  It seems incongruous that something so fundamental <Col N="793" /> could slide through.  I want to stress that point.</P>
    <P>What, in effect, happens?  The Minister has the regulation written and put together in the Department.  It is then sent to the Librarian of the House.  The Librarian of the House sees that it is presented to the Clerks of both Houses. It then appears once on the Order of Business for the day.  It is never discussed again, and it becomes a regulation.  To my mind it is not good enough.  I do not think it is an effective or efficient way.  It is something that I look at and examine in all legislation that comes before us now.  I see a growing trend by Government, ably assisted by those excellent people in the Civil Service efficiently carrying out their duty to see that this is a more efficient way.  People do not have to listen to a lot of nonsense from people like me who would speak on it if it had to be presented by affirmative proposal, proposed, seconded and discussed in the House.  I want to hear the Minister's reply on that.  It is something that concerns me. This occurs in a number of places in the Bill which I have referred to earlier.</P>
    <P>I want to direct the attention of the Minister to section 5.  It deals only with the next three years.  It is to cover those issues which have not been anticipated. That is a very wise kind of a section to have in a Bill.  It shows good anticipation. It is useful and necessary.  I support the idea of the section very firmly.  I believe that because it raises fundamental issues it is something which should be approved by the House by affirmative process.</P>
    <P>In my first contribution on this matter, I raised a number of very fundamental issues.  One issue which I raised the other day is the question of the shifting of control from the Minister for Finance to the Central Bank.  I do not have any objection to that: in fact, I welcome it.  It is an efficient way of doing business.  It is right and correct that the Central Bank should control the banks in the State, particularly when the Central Bank is a State bank.  It is the only true nationalised bank we have in the State.  However, it raises some fundamental issues for me.  One is <Col N="794" /> the position of the Central Bank compared with Europe and the whole European scene.</P>
    <P>We know the Minister for Finance is involved in discussions leading to the setting up of a European Central Bank, of a single European currency and of a vast number of other changes in the financial sections.  Is it not true to say that what we are, in fact, doing here today is changing the control of the Trustee Savings Banks via discussions in Brussels to the control of a joint Euro-Central Bank, which is the objective of the governments of the Twelve at the moment.  I want that addressed very definitely, because it has not been considered in any serious way so far.</P>
    <P>That leads to a number of other issues and in particular to section 30.  Whereas I agree with the proposal to change control of the Trustee Savings Banks from the Minister for Finance to the Central Bank, I have great difficulty with section 30 which gives separate issues, labelled A to J, where the Minister for Finance will still, or may still, control the decisions of the Central Bank regarding the revocation of licences for the Trustee Savings Banks.  Where is the logic in this?  Either we give control from the Department to the Central Bank, or we do not.  If we are doing it, we should do so fully.</P>
    <P>The reason I have difficulty with that is that I do not believe the Trustee Savings Banks should have to serve two masters in this particular one.  It does not make any sense.  I would like to hear exactly where we stand on that particular issue.</P>
    <P>In the last financial year the Trustee Savings Banks made a very substantial profit.  I need here to compare and consider the Central Bank and the Trustee Savings Banks, both of which are answerable at the moment, in different ways, to the Minister for Finance.  What I am not clear about is how we are going to work through the distribution of funds.  Under present arrangements, the Central Bank each year transfer what they call their surplus funds to the Exchequer.  &ldquo;Surplus funds&rdquo; are polite words for &ldquo;profit&rdquo; although it is not quite completely profits <Col N="795" /> because it is profits minus their housekeeping money, their petty cash and their superannuation arrangements with their employees.  In effect each year the Central Bank transfer to the Exchequer their surplus funds &mdash; by another name their profits &mdash; which are worth roughly around £120 million.  That was the average per year over the last couple of years.  That is precisely the amount of money that our nationalised bank gives to us each year. On the other hand, speaking from memory, the Trustees Savings Banks' annual report for last year indicated that there was £301 million invested with the Minister for Finance.  That takes place under the procedures set out by regulation 1940, or 1941, to do with the operations of the Trustee Savings Banks.</P>
    <P>The Trustee Savings Banks, as of now, have £301 million invested with the Minister. The first question is: what will happen to that £301 million when this legislation is enacted?  Will that money be transferred to the Central Bank?  Is there movement from it?  I also want to know why it is that the Trustee Savings Banks £301 million invested with the Minister for Finance only realised for them an interest return of £23 million, £24 million or £25 million.  Certainly it was far less than ten per cent.</P>
    <P>I would like to know how we arrive at these figures?  Where is the money invested?  What is it used for?  Is it simply a notional interest?  If it is a notional interest, how is it worked out?  How is the £24 million calculated?  What is going to happen to the £301 million?  What kind of a lien will the Central Bank now have on that £301 million?  Equally important is what status will the Trustee Savings Banks have within the Central Bank's arrangements?  Will they have the same status as an Associated Bank or as one of the other private banks?  Where is it going to stand <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Central Bank's famous Act which was rushed through the House here in a less than a discretionary manner earlier on in the year?  What, in fact, are the relations going to be?</P>
    <P>At present in the Trustee Savings <Col N="796" /> Banks the equity to risk ratio is approximately 12 per cent.  This is an important matter for the small investor, such as the person who goes into the High Street branch of the Trustee Savings Banks and wants to know if his money is safe and secure.  When we discussed this last week I outlined what happened one year, around the end of November, when the report of the Trustee Savings Banks was late arriving.  A rumour went around that it was in trouble.  There was a flow of money from the head office of the Trustee Savings Banks.  People lost confidence in the bank.  They queued up in order to take their money out and bring it up to a building society at the corner of O'Connell Street, which shall be nameless, but who were very happy with the arrangement.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure the confidence of the small investor, depositor, or customer of the Trustee Savings Banks they have a very high equity to risk ratio which, as I say, is in the order of 12 per cent.  On the other hand, any quarterly report of the Central Bank will indicate that the primary liquidity ratio would be more like 8, 9 or 10 per cent.  What control will the Central Bank have on those ratios under the new arrangements proposed in this Bill?  It raises a number of issues.  I think 12 per cent is far too high.  It is too conservative, too safe and is unnecessarily careful in terms of the equity to risk ratio.</P>
    <P>The reason I think it is too careful is because I have never known a bank to take a risk.  Certainly in my dealings with banks I have never known a bank manager take a risk with me.  I have never known a bank manager to take a risk with anybody.  They are not in the risk business.  They are in the business of selling money.  If they are ever to operate on a 9 per cent primary liquidity ratio &mdash; and I think that is the one we need to refer to at this time &mdash; I wonder about the Trustee Savings Banks.  Are they, in fact, fettered or are they under more pressure to hold some of their money?  Also, are they, in effect, compelled to invest all this money with the Minister for Finance? As a taxpayer I would prefer if the bank were allowed do their own thing and pay <Col N="797" /> their profits to the State, like a State bank.  I do not want them saying, on the one hand, &ldquo;Let us organise it for them so that they can become a High Street bank and compete with the big boys,&rdquo; and then say: &ldquo;O.K. let us tie them down,&rdquo; when it comes to the real money.  It looks a bit like that to me.  In relation to nationalised and semi-State industry, everywhere I look I find this.  The conservative right of Irish politics will say: &ldquo;Oh yeah, well look, these semi-State are not making money; they are not effective; they are not cost efficient.&rdquo;  As soon as they become cost efficient or effective or threatening, whether it is in regard to the ESB selling coal, or Aer Lingus running hotels or doing other things, or the Trustee Savings Banks investing their real money internationally or otherwide, they may well be held down.</P>
    <P>I recognise that this Bill facilitates the international movement of cash by the Trustee Savings Banks.  I asked a question the other day about that point.  It seems to me that under the Treaty of Rome, following the setting up of the Single European Market in 1992, it will not appear necessary to have that section in the legislation.  I asked if it is simply in there to make it seem to comply with our commitments under the Treaty of Rome, or is it there because it is necessary?  I just want to know why it is there.  Is it there in order to enable the bank to operate?  If that is the only reason, I do not think it should be there.  Banks can move cash, capital, or whatever else they want to, under our Treaty of Rome commitment.</P>
    <P>In the development of the particular customer services, the Trustee Savings Banks are now indicating that they will be moving very much into the housing mortgage market, which is a very rough and competitive market at the moment and has been for quite a number of years. The building societies operate under the legislation of the 1989 Building Societies Act &mdash; another piece of legislation which was pushed through earlier on in the year. Under that there are very strict controls on the operation of building societies. With the Trustee Savings Banks moving <Col N="798" /> into that particular market, I would like to know where the two pieces of legislation will interface &mdash; the Trustee Savings Bank legislation and the 1989 Building Societies Act &mdash; where they cut across each other and where they are connected with each other.  I am not quite clear about that area.</P>
    <P>An issue which I raised the other day, and which I did not get a chance to develop at that time, was the change of regulation in the section which decides the appropriate majority of trustees necessary in order to facilitate an integration, merger or amalgamation of a number of Trustee Savings Banks.  I think it is section 55 or 56.  I want to say, first of all, that I approve wholeheartedly of the decision to change it from three-quarters of the trustees to three-fifths of the trustees.  I would like to know the thinking behind how we arrived at three-fifths. There is a certain element of &ldquo;think of a number&rdquo; about it, unless somebody can prove me wrong by pointing to some precedent or reason for it.  I am intrigued about how people came up with the figure.  Why three-fifths as opposed to a simple majority?  Why three-fifths as opposed to a two-thirds majority, which would also be very close.  I would like to have that tidied up.  Why is it 60 per cent? Why is it three-fifths, in effect?  I would like to have that explained in some detail.</P>
    <P>The other day, towards the very end of what I had to say, I refered to the &ldquo;ageism&rdquo; which was rampant in this Bill, with certain references of people being of full age and, therefore, being entitled to the payment of interest.  I was further intrigued to see that on the death of a person his or her dependants, or those who are taking out probate, are entitled to it.  I just wondered why it is necessary for that to be there.  Surely when a depositor dies, under existing law the entitlements are paid into his or her estate. Then, of course, there is the provision, which I find quite objectionable, the one which says one may no longer be a trustee after reaching the age of 70.  What is so special about the age 70?  Is this necessary? What is the thinking or the reason behind that?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="799" /> Between what I have said now and what I said the other day, I think I have more or less covered all aspects of this proposed legislation.  However, I do want to raise one point which is slightly peripheral. One of the new customer services being offered by the Trustee Savings Banks, which is offered by all the banks now, is the leasing or lease-back arrangements, which is a huge accumulator of profit.  I have grave worries about how that stands in taxation terms.  At a later date I will have very hard, harsh things to say about our so-called high flying successful companies based in the Shannon duty free zone.  I am certainly going to be asking very harsh questions in the future as to who gets taxation from it.  Does any country, or every country, or no country get it?</P>
    <P>With the leasing arrangements here, I want to be assured that there is no conflict between what the banks are attempting to do and the spirit of the Finance Acts for the last number of years.  I would like to see that matter addressed.  I would hate to see a conflict between a State bank, as such, and the best interests of the State, particularly when it is moving into it quite rapidly.  There has been a huge development in that area by the Trustee Savings Banks.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, conclude my remarks by asking why the integration and amalgamation, etc., of these banks requires three-fifths of the majority of the trustees?  Why not just a simple majority?  The reason I ask that is because I think these should be facilitated in every way possible.  I would like to see in the legislation &mdash; and I recognise this would be a very difficult thing to do &mdash; some form by which the State could actually initiate the integration and amalgamation of Trustee Savings Banks.  The reason that I would like to see the State being in a position to initiate the integration, merger or amalgamation of Trustee Savings Banks is because of the experience of the Associated Banks.  We remember some years back when the Allied Irish Banks and the Bank of Ireland groups were formed.  It was felt <Col N="800" /> to be in their best interests then.  I do not believe it is in the best interests of the Trustee Savings Banks.</P>
    <P>What we are trying to do through this legislation is have a whole range of different banks.  I am not sure how many are left in the country now, but they are certainly in Limerick, Cork and Dublin. Why is it that we cannot initiate, or at least encourage, facilitate or prod on the amalgamation of these particular banks? Maybe there are moves in that direction at the moment.  If there are, I am not aware of them.  I was sepaking to somebody recently who had great difficulty doing business with the Trustee Savings Bank in Limerick, though she was an account holder with the Trustee Savings Bank in Dublin.  That does not help its general image.  It also puts them at a definite disadvantage compared with the Associated Banks.  I would like to hear that matter addressed also.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome the legislation. It is positive legislation and certainly develops and progresses what most of us have in mind.  There are aspects of it to which, when it comes to Committee Stage, I will certainly be addressing myself.  I will also be putting down amendments.  At the moment I welcome the general thrust and initiative taken by this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have to say will be brief and to the point.  I would like to take up the previous speaker's last point. I suppose I would have to agree with him in relation to difficulties experienced by people who would be members of one Trustee Savings Bank and trying to get facilities in another.  The purpose behind this legislation is to smooth the path in relation to the difficulties that are experienced with the Trustee Savings Banks, as they now exist and to offer them the facilities that are available to all the other banking services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to welcome the Minister here and to say how delighted I am to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  As other speakers, including Senator O'Toole, have said, the Trustee Savings Banks have played a tremendous <Col N="801" /> role in the whole area of banking, specifically in relation to the small saver in encouraging thrift.  One has to acknowledge that we owe the Trustee Savings Banks a great debt of gratitude for that type of development.</P>
    <P>There were originally four, as Senator O'Toole said &mdash; in Dublin, Waterford, Cork and Limerick.  They have been amalgamated into two &mdash; Dublin-Waterford and Cork-Limerick.  Credit must be given to the Trustee Savings Banks as they exist at the moment.  They have extended their services quite a lot under the restrictions that were placed upon them.  They have no small part to play, I suggest, in opening up banking services and facilities, particularly for the smaller saver.  They introduced an area of competition. We are all aware, in the not-too-distant past, of the type of structure the commercial or Associated Banks portrayed even in terms of bank managers. The sort of foreboding bank structures they had, produced an aura of fear among people who, in actual fact, used the facilities.</P>
    <P>Not so long ago, if you met the bank manager walking down the street you took off your cap and knelt down in front of him, because you were under this distinct impression that he was some sort of a god who decided your future at his whim.  When you went to get loans in the associated or commercial banks, you felt it was out of his pocket that the money was coming and that you were under a tremendous obligation and compliment to him for that giving service.  The Trustee Savings Banks, to their credit, got away from that type of attitude.  They brought into this area a welcome to the people, that they were providing a service like any other financial service or, in fact, any other business.  They welcomed the people to come in.  They provided facilities where people could avail of those services at convenient times, during lunch hours and late at night.  So they brought this type of change in services to the general public.</P>
    <P>As I see it, the Associated Banks operate a type of cartel.  They are in competition with one another, but they meet <Col N="802" /> at various times and decide what they are going to do, what services they are going to provide, what services they are going to provide free, what services they are going to drop or what they are going to charge for.  In that connection there is just one note of disappointment that I would like to mention here in relation to the Trustee Savings Banks and the facilities they offer, that is, the suggestion or intention of the AIB and Bank of Ireland specifically to charge fees and to provide fees for services to local authorities and for the conducting of business of the local authorities.  I find it incompatible that, on the one hand, the banks go to great lengths to highlight the fact that they are providing all sorts of facilities and benefits to certain categories of people free of charge and then, on the other hand, they state that it is their intention to charge fees for services to local authorities.</P>
    <P>Remember, the services the local authorities provide are for a substantial number of the very people the banks are at pains to suggest they are catering for free of charge.  I understand local authorities have had those services free since 1926.  What I would suggest to local authorities who find they are in difficulties in relation to having to pay these charges is to shop around.  If the Trustee Savings Banks, under the new regulations, can provide the facilities that up to now the associated and commercial banks were providing, then the local authorities should shop around and get the services free of charge.  I am sure there are other banking institutions that would readily accept accounts the size of local authorities accounts and the amount of money they put through their hands from time to time.</P>
    <P>The Trustee Savings Banks have carved out a niche for themselves in the financial services sector and it is very appropriate at this time that this legislation is being brought forward.  It will remove existing restrictions on their activities and allow the Trustee Savings Banks to provide fuller banking services. That is all to be welcomed at this time.</P>
    <P>The proposal to reduce the proportion <Col N="803" /> of total funds invested with the Exchequer as the Trustee Savings Banks extend their activities into other areas, and also the proposal to transfer the supervision of the Trustee Savings Banks from the Minister to the Central Bank, are very welcome. It will put them on the same footing as the commercial and associated banks.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said the new direction in this Bill reflects the changes in savings banks in Europe.  These banks have played a major role in providing services to local communities.  That is why I am advocating that local authorities who service local communities should consider strongly doing business with these banks where the opportunity arises.</P>
    <P>I welcome, in general, the whole thrust of the Bill.  It is very appropriate at this time.  In relation to some comments Senator O'Toole made, I find it difficult to understand his argument, particularly in relation to section 5.  Section 5, as I read it, merely gives the Minister the power to make regulations concerning difficulties of a technical nature in the implementation of the legislation.  It would be absolutely ridiculous that every time a technical problem arose the Minister would have to come back to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In fact, the legislation as passed would not be workable at all, because one can understand the delay that would arise in bringing amendments into both Houses, the availability of time and all that sort of thing. This seems to be a commonsense sort of approach; and, as the Minister stated, it is not without precedent.  It is in fact common practice in such legislation that the Minister would be in a position to make regulations in relation to any difficulties and specifically in relation to difficulties of a technical nature.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to welcome the Bill.  I want to congratulate the Trustee Savings Banks, the trustees and all of the staff&mdash; the 800 or so who are there at the moment &mdash; for the tremendous work they have done and the tremendous service they have given to this country.  I am sure I speak for many a small saver in <Col N="804" /> expressing gratitude to the Trustee Savings Banks for the facilities and the large range of opportunities given to them to save on a small scale and for the welcome given them when others, from whom more might have been more expected, did not do so.  They opened up the whole banking service so that other people, who originally might not have thought much of the small saver, now very much appreciate him.  That is due in no small measure to the development of the Trustee Savings Banks.  I welcome this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, let me begin where Senator McKenna finished.  I, too, would like to pay my compliments to the Trustee Savings Banks for the way they encouraged small savers, the way they set out to attract business, when in many ways in other banks it would not be considered wise or profitable to do so.  They have provided a very good service over the years.  They have been progressive, particularly in relation to their attitudes to consumers, the manner in which they conduct their business, the hours during which they are open.  It is much more, to use the computer jargon, consumer friendly than the sort of facilities which are provided by the Associated Banks. Generally speaking, the Trustee Savings Banks have provided a very good and reliable service.</P>
      <P>To the extent that the Bill proposes to modernise the Trustee Savings Banks to extend their scope and capacity, I certainly welcome that.  What I am concerned about, of course, is the capacity contained in the Bill to sell off the Trustee Savings Banks to the private sector.  That I would have to respond to with alarm and regret.  In the Bill, where it is being proposed that the Trustee Savings Banks be re-organised under State control, the proposals are really quite restrictive; whereas, of course, if they are going to be sold off, all the propositions in the Bill would simply be irrelevant and they will take their chances in the broader banking world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, too, would be concerned about the provisions of section 5.  It is not so much <Col N="805" /> that one would want to object to the Minister making orders to make minor technical adjustments; what would concern me is the scope of the Minister's capacity as set out in section 5.  It is not that I would want to prevent the Minister making minor adjustments; it is the capacity to make various fundamental changes which are catered for in section 5.  It is particularly regrettable that those changes are not to be made by way of an affirmative procedure rather than being left to the Houses of the Oireachtas to set about stopping what the Minister is doing rather than have the Minister to obtain approval from the Houses of the Oireachtas for what he is proposing.</P>
    <P>If I can look at some matters of broad detail in the Bill, there is a question of the trustees and the responsibilities of the trustees.  As far as I can make out, they are not particularly clarified in the Bill. The Bill provides a considerable amount of detail on how these trustees are to be got rid of.  They have to go at the age of 70, there are all sorts of disqualifying provisions, if they are out of order on a series of differing items.  There is very little, if anything, stated in relation to how they are going to be appointed.  It might be no harm if there was clarification there.  What type of people are suitable to be trustees?  How will they be selected and so on?</P>
    <P>There are some other points of general interest.  For example, the Bill talks about financial services and so on and it does not define it.  It talks about honorariums for the trustees.  This may be a polite word for a fee or paying over cash, but perhaps it would be no harm in this kind of business if a spade was called a spade. I generally associate the payment of honoraria to polite people who give nice lectures to polite societies but I think it might be better if we had a bit of old-fashioned straight talking there.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am concerned in relation to the possibilities of the privatisation of the Trustee Savings Banks.  In the United Kingdom, when the trustee savings banks were sold there were very extensive redundancies; they shed of the order of 20 per cent of their workforce in the <Col N="806" /> United Kingdom.  Part of that will arise because of the fact that when people buy banks such as the trustee savings banks they are going to buy them because they are going to have to return a profit on what they put into them.  I am worried that that anxiety to generate profit may well militate against the people who have been employed in those banks and against the sort of services they may be prepared to provide for their customers.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the Bill which is conspicuous by its absence is any dealing at all with the rights of the consumers&mdash; in other words, the customers of those banks.  What rights are they going to have?  What obligations will the banks have to them because of the fact that they deal with them?  Again, it is very sparse on that issue.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would be in favour of the general principle of modernising the Trustee Savings Banks.  I would be quite worried about the notion of privatisation. I would be worried about it even if I was not a socialist.  If I was a capitalist, which of course I am not, I would be worried about it because it will remove, as it were, competition from the marketplace in the type of things that these capitalist folk talk about with such gusto.  A spot of competition for the cartels might not be out of place if we were looking at things from that type of perspective.</P>
    <P>The State has a relatively modest presence in the marketplace.  We understand that the lads from Irish Life have been to see the auctioneers; it has not been advertised in the papers yet but we are told that its sale is in the pipeline.  Other than that the State has a relatively small presence in the banking sector.  There is the ACC, the ICC and there are these banks, but other than that I am not aware of any banking service.  In many ways, for the average punter as it were, the Trustee Savings Banks might provide the only State banks they can deal with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Trustee Savings Banks Bill, 1989.  The purpose of the Bill is to extend the range of services provided by the Trustee Savings Banks.  This Bill <Col N="807" /> allows the Trustee Savings Banks to provided a full range of banking services provided they obtain the consent of the Central Bank.  The Bill also allows the Trustee Savings Banks to convert from trustee to company status.  In general, the provisions of the Bill must be welcomed as it is another step towards a level playing field of the Irish financial services industry.</P>
      <P>This is an important Bill.  It provides for a very comprehensive revision of the legislation governing the status and operations of the Trustee Savings Banks.  This legislation goes back to 1863 and there have been some amending provisions during the years in between.  The essential requirements of that Bill have largely remained unchanged.  This legislation served its purpose well when the Trustee Savings Banks were simply savings institutions. In present conditions, and in particular with the advances in banking in more recent times, the legislation is no longer adequate.  It restricts the ability of the Trustee Savings Banks to realise their proper potential and to compete as they should in present-day banking.</P>
      <P>The Trustee Savings Banks at the moment are obliged to work under the outdated legislation I have mentioned, which has restricted them in providing a modern banking service and in so doing compete with the tremendous competition which is there today.  They have been restricted over the years.  The main restriction, of course, is the fact that 80 per cent of all moneys they hold on deposit could not be recycled or reloaned for the normal banking facilities such as mortgage finance, bridging finance or personal loans.  This type of business was confined to the 20 per cent of the deposits taken in by the Trustee Savings Banks and it put them at a disadvantage with the commercial banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to congratulate the Trustee Savings Banks on the way they have operated. I have seen it in my own home town of Tralee where they have progressed over a period of ten years from a small outlet to a most modern and efficient banking institution, a feature of which <Col N="808" /> are the extended trading hours which greatly facilitate working people.  They have a long tradition of excellent service to the people of this country and have encouraged small depositors to become thrifty.</P>
    <P>This Bill is long overdue.  It will give the Trustee Savings Banks an equal standing with the commercial banks and will assist them to compete with the other banking institutions.  In such circumstances they will do well, as they are accepted as being most reliable.  As I have said already, the Trustee Savings Banks have extended the working hours, catered for the small investor and they have encouraged them to become thrifty.  It is a well known fact that they have been responsible for setting up many saving schemes in various factories throughout this country.  I have seen that in Tralee where they have something like 13 factories organised in a savings scheme.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Trustee Savings Banks will expand their activities under this Bill.  Mention was made earlier on about transferring.  Provision is made under the Bill to transfer supervision of the Trustee Savings Banks from the Department of Finance to the Central Bank.  There is no doubt that banking facilities are essential today; it is no longer a luxury but is now regarded as a very essential service.  It is today a must for many people in all walks of life.  Many workers have their salaries paid by way of bank transfers and this is very welcome for security reasons.  This puts a lot of pressure on the banks and they are responding to the demand.</P>
    <P>The priority at this time is to encourage and enable the Trustee Savings Banks to provide a wider range of services.  None of us can say what direction they may take in the longer term, but the concern of all of us should be that they should grow and prosper and the Bill is facilitating that.  Whatever direction they may decide to take in the future, the Trustee Savings Banks are guaranteed success.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance of the day will have the power and responsibility to protect the public interest.  That is very important.  The financial sector has been <Col N="809" /> going through a period of great change and I am satisfied that the Trustee Savings Banks will continue to prosper and expand.  I wish them every success.</P>
    <P>I welcome the thrust of the Bill and, as I say, I would like to compliment the staff of the Trustee Savings Banks who have set a headline for the commercial banks throughout this country.</P>

      <P>Tá cuid mhaith go bhféadfaí a rá faoin mBille seo, faoi cad tá ann agus nach bhfuil ann agus ba chóir a bheith ann.  Ach níor mhaith liomsa an oíche go léir a chaitheamh ag caint faoi sin.  Caithfear féachaint taobh thiar den Bhille chun na forálacha atá ann a thuisc-int i ndáiríre: caithfear, cuir i gcás, féachaint ar an chóras baincéireachta agus an tslí in a bhfuil sé eagraithe.</P>
      <P>I have made a point in recent months of speaking in this House as frequently as I can in our first language in order to emphasise again and again the fact that that guarantees, for those people who have not had the good fortune that I have had to develop a good competence in the Irish language, that they are excluded from our debates because of the fact that this House does not have the basic provision of a simultaneous translation service. I intend to continue to do so to indicate my continuing disapproval of that fact.  It is the only way I know to create an increasing demand for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is interesting for a number of reasons.  It is interesting because on the one hand it does something we all know should have been done a long time ago, which is to upgrade the range of services that a very interesting part of our banking services are going to be allowed to provide. We need not go into the precise technical details because nobody, I think, disagrees with that but it is interesting that it took so long to do it.  One could wonder why.  Is it because of the lobbying of the duopoly we have, which effectively controls Irish banking and which may well become something more complex, if some of the rumours about a takeover are to be believed?  The duopoly is not particularly keen on competition and has managed to regulate or exclude most <Col N="810" /> competition out of the Irish banking market.  They may not be entirely happy with a new agency coming in.  The Trustee Savings Banks, to my knowledge, have complained frequently about not being able to be part of the general clearing house service for cheques, which makes their services a little bit more difficult of access.</P>
    <P>What is also regrettable in this legislation is that it fails to address the appalling mess that in terms of the consumer is the Irish banking system.  I will explain what I mean and then perhaps come back to what could have been done about it.  I am going to quote from a few documents. I will give the source of these documents, because they are interesting.  It is a fact that in the period up to July of this year Irish banks had experienced the longest continuous downward trend in interest rates that has taken place over the past 20 years.  That was, of course, immensely favourable to the banks.  The extraordinary fact is that, even though nominal interest rates were dropping, the bank managed remarkably well to sustain that which is of most benefit to them, which is real interest rates &mdash; the difference between the interest they charge and the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>They can go on forever giving their explanations.  They can go on forever giving their justifications, but, just to quote, at a period last July when we had the fourth lowest inflation rate in the European Community, the real interbank interest rate is almost double the average of the industrialised world, or was then, and it has probably got worse since, because our inflation rate has increased slightly, not enormously but significantly.  Our interest rates have added on 1 per cent or 2 per cent since then.  It is hard to keep track of the interest rate.  The actual real interest rate the banks claim for themselves has actually got better since then.</P>
    <P>The source of that piece of information is The Small Firms Association a branch of the CII and I am quoting from a press release of 29 July &mdash; I am sorry, this was 1988 not 1989 they were talking about. Interest rates began to climb since then. <Col N="811" /> Is it not time &mdash; not in terms of my position on the left, but in terms of the way the market economy is supposed to function &mdash; somebody had a good look at these gargantuan institutions that apparently respond in no way that anybody can see that resembles real competition in the marketplace and who have created positions for themselves where they reward themselves with levels of real interest rates that are out of line with the rest of the developed world.</P>
    <P>Why is it that a country like ours, relatively underdeveloped, but with a remarkable achievement in terms of our inflation rate, balance of payments and indeed in terms of the control that has been exercised over the problems of the public finances in recent years, should have real interest rates that are well ahead of most of the developed world? Why is it that our real interest rates should be ahead of those of the United Kingdom, for instance, when our balance of payments position is so much better? Why is it that they should be ahead of those in the United States, which has a massive trade problem and a massive public spending problem?  Why is it that our banks are so peculiarly cosseted, protected and carefully minded by themselves at our expense that they can actually impose such an alarming degree of extra cost on those who have the misfortune to borrow money from them?</P>
    <P>The truth is that our Irish banks produce a sloppy service.  Increasingly, as any customer of a bank will tell you, they are under-staffed with the result that queues are getting longer, delays are getting worse, and yet you are being charged more for every service they offer, while the quality of that service deteriorates. They impose a range of charges that nobody short of a good accountant could keep track of anymore.  They are probably the only body dealing in the marketplace that does not actually have to give their customers an itemised list of the prices they pay for individual services. They simply stick a little nought onto the end of your account saying &ldquo;charges as follows&rdquo;.  They do not even have to bill <Col N="812" /> you separately for it; they just take it off you.  I find this extraordinary that anybody else selling something in the marketplace actually has to provide you with a detailed specific account of why they want that much money from you but these enormous institutions apparently can throw their weight around to the extent that they can do these things to us.</P>
    <P>If this was all left-wing rhetoric it would be of no significance, but there is an enormous amount of evidence to sustain it. There is the extraordinary high cost of real interest rates and indeed, as the Small Firms Association have pointed out, the sustaining and indeed in some cases the extending of the real interest rates for borrowers has not been matched by the maintenance of real interest rates for savers.  I quote from the same press release:</P>
    <P>The high cost of real interest on borrowings is in stark contrast to the slump in real interest earned on deposit accounts which is, in the main, not more than 1 per cent. </P>
    <P>What they have done to us is, they have rewarded themselves because of our achievements, by increasing the return to themselves on the money that we deposit by reducing what they pay to those of us who have money to save, while sustaining an absolutely outrageous gap between that and what they charge to those who borrow from them.  I do not know who is at fault.  I do not know why there is not real price competition but what I do know is that people with a good deal more experience of trying to deal with the banks in a business relationship find our banks extraordinarily unhelpful.</P>
    <P>Again, I will refer to a press release by the Small Firms Association, dated 31 August 1989: &mdash; I apologise to the House for using only the press release but the Small Firms Association proposed to charge me £30 for the full report and even for the services of the Houses of the Oireachtas apparently they could not make an exception.  The CII is well enough off not to be subsidised by me.  I will confine myself to what they identify <Col N="813" /> as being the major points in the report. The Minister should demand from the banks a public, detailed explanation of each of these points not because of any political axe I have to grind but because this is a view of many of the people whom we expect to contribute most to the development of this country.</P>
    <P>We will hear endless speeches in this House and in the other House about certain issues that are regarded as deterrents to enterprise.  We will hear a great deal about the allegedly deterrent nature of some of our taxation.  We will hear a great deal about employers' PRSI.  We will hear a great deal about what are regarded sometimes as excessive regulations.  Why do we not hear about the fundamental problem that the Small Firms Association have identified, which is the quality and cost of the money that they need to make their businesses run?  I will refer to what the Small Firms Association identify as the problem.</P>
    <P>The first problem that they describe &mdash; and they say it is on page 27 of their report &mdash; is the absence of any price competition between banks, a situation which is unique, they say, within the OECD countries.  Would those who espouse the market economy in this House, and in the other House, who have lectured us <i>ad nauseam</i> on the value of competition, explain to me how we can ever have a vibrant, dynamic economy if our major banks cannot be induced to enter the marketplace and compete, if they are actually what appears to be a cosy duopoly determined to protect themselves.  I, as a consumer, am aware that in terms of the provision of credit cards, with one notable exception, all of the banks charge interest rates to credit card users that are higher than those charged in the United Kingdom, where interest rates are 3 or 4 per cent higher. That is only one example.</P>
    <P>The Small Firms Association assert, and it is an assertion made with the full weight of the Confederation of Irish Industry behind it, that there is no price competition between Irish banks.  Can <Col N="814" /> you imagine if the banks were State-owned what would be said about the fact that there was no price competition?  The fact that they were able to avoid price competition would be identified as a guarantee of inefficiency, of a guarantee of a lack of any concern for the consumer. Whatever sort of regulatory mechanisms we have, it is quite clear that they are working, not to the advantage of any consumer, but to the advantage of the banks and to those who have the good fortune to own large stockholdings in the banks.  To see the banks in that sort of position, where they control almost all of the credit available in the country, or a large part of it, and do it without any price competition, then claiming some credit for expanding profits, is in fact the worst of both worlds.  What you have is a private sector effective monopoly ripping off our people without any element of competition within it.</P>
    <P>It is about time that that particular cudgel was taken up, not by the likes of myself, who has a profound distaste for everything the banks stand for, but by those who believe in the market economy, who believe in competition, who believe in all of that and in particular advocate of competition and the Government who have done a lot because they believe it is a good thing to extend competition. To have a major source of development, the small indigenous firms saying that our banks do not bother to compete on price is, as far as I am concerned, a fundamental obstacle to development and one that needs to be dealt with and disposed of.</P>
    <P>Their second criticism &mdash; and this is one I know is close to the heart of the Minister for Finance &mdash; is an excessive emphasis on collateral as the basis for loan approval.  Firms with borrowings of £50,000 or less were eight times more likely to have provided collateral three or more times the size of the loan than larger firms&rdquo;.  What does that mean?  It means that small firms have to produce collateral three or four times the value of the borrowings and with a frequency eight times greater than that of large <Col N="815" /> firms.  What in heaven's name are they at?</P>
    <P>The idea of lending money with interest is that you charge interest to recognise the fact that you are sharing a risk.  There is supposed to be some risk involved in bank lending.  There is supposed to be some skill involved in assessing the risk involved in bank lending. This is what financial whizz-kids get paid enormous salaries for, the skill involved in the assessment of risk that lies behind the judgement of who to lend money to and who not to lend to.  We all know, of course, that notwithstanding the &ldquo;tut-tutting&rdquo; and the occasional letters, the banks are far happier and are delighted to be lending money to people with substantial salaries, particularly those in the public sector who are unlikely to be made redundant.  No matter how much they &ldquo;tut-tut&rdquo;, that is risk-free lending on which they are allowed to charge the highest level of interest.  Who could blame them if they are not regulated and forced into a competitive position where they could not do things like that and where they actually have to do what they are supposed to do, which is to go out into the market-place, look at a variety of possible ventures which are potentially profitable and do an intelligent risk-assessment of which of those is liable to be successful?  Other agencies have to do it without anything like the same guarantees. The IDA have to do it in terms of the potential viability of small firms.  They cannot look for collateral before they undertake to fund a small firm.  They can look for participation by the small firm but they cannot look for collateral of the order that the Small Firms Association quote &mdash; three or four times the value of the loan in collateral, three or four times secured in collateral.</P>
    <P>How can the country develop if the major sources of funding, the banks, are operating with some sort of pre-19th century idea of what is a reasonable risk? They should either get out of the market-place and let other people in, perhaps even European banks, who perhaps have a better idea of what risk-taking is about <Col N="816" /> and a greater capacity and competence to assess risk, or will they employ people who can actually do what they should be doing, which is, making professional, commercial judgments about a variety of commercial propositions and adjudicating on which ones are real commercial propositions and taking a risk, with the sums of money that are involved?  That is what they are supposed to be good at. That is what they get paid for.  That is why they earn large profits.  That is the theory.  The practice is, of course, that they have a cosy duopoly in which they can charge exorbitant rates, devalue their service by getting rid of large numbers of their employees and, in the process, make a fortune at our expense, at the country's expense and, indeed, at the expense of our economic development.</P>
    <P>The third question about the banks that the Small Firms Association would like us to address is what they describe as &ldquo;a heavy cost burden of additional bank charges and increase in unit fees charged&rdquo;.  Since 1984, no fewer than 20 additional bank charges have been introduced. No explanation is proffered to the client firm; bank charges arbitrarily appear as a debit on the quarterly bank statement.  What other body dealing with customers could get away with extracting money from them without bothering to tell them the reason?  What sort of almighty right do these institutions have to treat anybody like that?  What almighty right do they have to treat customers like that?  They are selling something which is credit to somebody else and they have the same obligations.  It seems to me we could do with amendments to the consumer protection legislation to require the banks to provide the same sort of information about the charges they impose and the reason for them as are required in other areas.</P>
    <P>The banks have still a long way to go before they regard people as customers to whom they are obliged rather than as clients who are obliged to them.  It is about time this was emphasised over and over again to the banks by public figures that the people they deal with are their customers and the line of obligation is <Col N="817" /> from the providing agency to the customer and not the other way around.  If I am a small shopkeeper in my area of Cork city, I am obliged to my customers. I am providing a service for my customers and I have reason to be grateful to my customers for coming to me.  The banks have managed to create an entirely opposite climate of feeling, where you feel that they are the ones who are doing you a favour and you have reason to be grateful to them.  It is about time the relationship was reversed whatever about the private domestic consumer in terms of their alleged contribution to economic development which must be close to zero in terms of what has been said about them by the Small Firms Association.</P>
    <P>The Small Firms Association have more to say about the banks.  They point up something that has been pointed up before: the short-term nature of most loans.  From the evidence in their report &ldquo;long term&rdquo; is defined by Irish banks as five to seven years.  Are they not great? Are they not really fantastic?  We are trying to build up large-scale indigenous enterprises capable of competing in the European market-place and we will as long as they can pay back all their borrowings in five to seven years.  Are they not great?  This is with large-scale collateral, perhaps four times the value of the loan; this with the highest real interest rates in the EC and with the worst record of non-price competition in the entire OECD and, on top of that, they define &ldquo;long term&rdquo; as five to seven years.  In the United Kingdom &ldquo;long term&rdquo; is defined as eight to 15 years and even this is considered restrictive by UK firms.  I have read reports in some of the British newspapers which suggest that the British banks are quite conservative by the standards of many European banks in terms of what they define as &ldquo;long term&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Who is going to tell these magnificant champions of private enterprise that they have got it all wrong in terms even of their own area of expertise, which is, the market-place?  Let us not forget that it was in the middle of the seventies that they had to be dragged, screaming, by the State into the house mortgage business. <Col N="818" /> They said it was not an area they were traditionally involved in and they reluctantly and with great protest agreed to allocate small sums of money into the mortgage business.  They now cannot be got out of it because they are making a fortune out of it.  There are lots of other areas where it seems to me that somebody is going to have to drag the Irish banking system screaming into the real market-place.  If they want the rewards of the market-place they have to put up with the rigours and disciplines of the market-place, which most manifestly they are not doing.</P>
    <P>Another criticism by the Small Firms Association, which could be applied to virtually every institution in this country, is centralisation of decision-making within the banks.  The Small Firms Association have the same problem the rest of us have with a country that is run in a rigidly Stalinist fashion by the Department of Finance who claim to control everything in this country directly or indirectly.  The banks are modelling themselves on our Stalinist system of bureaucracy and controlling everything from the centre as well.  I am not sure whether we will have to take the methods of our brothers in Eastern Europe to end the sort of centralisation we have but something is badly needed to end the Stalinist bureaucracy which seems to run every institution and agency in this country from the centre.</P>
    <P>The absence of any real difference between the banks in the area of costs, services and financial packages available to their small business clients has a consequence that fewer than 19 per cent of firms have changed their principal banks in the last five years.  Where firms have changed, it was usually for negative reasons.  In other words, only one in five of small firms has changed banks and most have changed, not because another bank offered them a better deal, but because they got fed up of the bank they were with for one reason or another. What a record.  What a record from people who spend a fortune on advertising telling us about how much they are on our side, how much they want to do <Col N="819" /> for us.  The one thing they will not do for us is give us a fair deal at a fair price with real competition.</P>
    <P>If I had said all that without the evidence in front of me, I would be accused of being a nasty, dangerous lefty, bashing the banks.  I am simply, therefore, putting on the record what has been said by the people who, in my view, are closest to real market economics, small firms who do not have any of the strength of a semi-monopoly or a large company, who have to compete very often with other firms doing the same thing in a difficult market-place, who are trying perhaps to establish a niche for themselves outside the country and who are strangled by an Irish banking system which is hopelessly inadequate in terms of competition, price, charges, etc.</P>
    <P>One could go on forever: the extraordinary technological ineptitude which has equipped many a small town in Ireland with two automatice teller machines because they could not get around to sorting out their technology before they put them in, so that small towns of 4,000 or 5,000 people now have two machines, when cities the size of Cork perhaps have 20, and all because two banks could not talk to each other about whether they could put together communicating technology so that all the machines can work. Now there is duplication of investment in these machines and other areas hopelessly underserviced by them.  One could go on forever about the extraordinary things.</P>
    <P>That is the state of banking and there is, unfortunately, not much in this legislation to give one hope for change.  We could be talking about turning this into an independent banking system and leaving it like that, perhaps turning it into a co-operative banking system like the system that has been set up by the Mindragon Co-operative in the north of Spain, which is a remarkably successful co-operative bank, and has funded industrial development which has produced 20,000 jobs in worker-owned co-operatives in the Basque country in the north of Spain.  We could talk about all that <Col N="820" /> sort of thing but instead, what have we? We have the altogether to be welcomed provisions to let the Trustee Savings Banks do all the things they should have been allowed to do 20 years ago.  That is fair enough.  We also have section 57, which is designed to, as quickly as possible I suspect, consign the Trustee Savings Banks into an identical position with the other banks.  Once they become a plc, one of the major banks or a European bank will surely swallow them up and any element of competition will be gone.</P>
    <P>The fundamental problem with Irish banking today is the absence of competition. They can go on forever about competition but I will believe there is competition when I see price competition. There is no other kind of competition. I am by no means an unqualified admirer of competition.  There are huge areas of life where the index of competition can be a disaster but one area where it would be most beneficial and most welcome would be in the provision of financial services.  In a couple of areas we have seen it work.  Those of us who had the misfortune to look for loans from building societies ten years ago, when you almost had to crawl in and genuflect in front of the manager before he would even talk to you, will realise that the banks in entering the mortgage market have stimulated a response of at least quality of customer service in the building societies so that you do not believe you need to say three decades of the Rosary and pray for a miracle before you will get a mortgage any more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>But they have managed to do it &mdash; as Senator Norris quite rightly said &mdash; without the one real index of competition, without price competition. There is a fundamental need in this country not to create yet another private bank, which is what the Trustee Savings Banks are liable to become.  That is a great pity as this Bill, without section 57, would have a lot to recommend it because we could allow the Trustee Savings Banks <Col N="821" /> to develop in their own way.  They could become a co-operative bank; they could be encouraged to become a co-operative bank.  They could even become, God forbid, a State owned bank, and a State-owned bank which might be able to expose many of the extraordinary cartel arrangements that the Associated Banks seem to have or the extraordinary inefficiencies, or the extraordinarily conservative lending policies that they have. Instead, we will have a small, vulnerable bank, privatised, wide open to predatory take-overs by either a foreign bank or one of the major banks at a price which would hardly put a pin-prick in the profits of one of the two big banks, given their monopoly situation and their ability effectively to write their own profit cheques every year and we will get nothing of any benefit from it.</P>
      <P>What has been essentially a small person's bank, set up to provide some sort of security for the savings of small people, will become just another little bit of two big, increasingly depersonalised, increasingly anti-customer, increasingly expensive and increasingly inefficient, so-called lending agencies.</P>
      <P>It is high time that we had a fundamental reappraisal of the quality of banking in this country.  People in certain areas of life have had to carry all sorts of burdens over the last seven or eight years. The workforce have been asked to, and have accepted, extraordinary restraint in wages.  The community at large have accepted extraordinary restraint in public expenditure with great difficulty and pain to themselves, but they have accepted it. Our banks have accepted nothing except our money in increasing amounts.  Many other areas of Irish life, the public sector, many areas of the private industrial sector, many areas of other private services and so on, have had to adjust to the fact that this is a new and different world and it is about time our banks were made to become part of this new and different world.  That could have been done by allowing the Trustee Savings Banks to continue to develop and expand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that section 57 was inserted in this Bill in case at some time <Col N="822" /> in the future the Minister might want to turn them into companies.  Nobody drafts legislation like that.  The parliamentary draftsmen did not think that up because they thought it was a good idea.  They inserted that section because the Minister and the Department of Finance asked them to insert it.  They inserted it in the form it is in because the Minister and the Department of Finance asked them to insert it in that form and it is there because somebody somewhere wants to do something with it.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, there is a peculiarity about selling off the shares in a bank that the Government arguably do not own and the State reaping the benefits.  There was a long dispute about this in Britain but they do not have the benefit of a written Constitution and, essentially, governments can do what they like in the United Kingdom.  We have a Constitution and it may turn out to be a problem if the Minister decides to sell of the Trustee Savings Banks when he turns them into a company and claims that he owns the shares.  There may be problems about whether that is right, fair or constitutional, or whether it amounts to something close to expropriation.  I will be interested to see what will happen.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole talked, quite rightly, about the sloppiness of the Minister &mdash; because the Minister is responsible, the parliamentary draftsman can only do what he tells him to do &mdash; and of successive Government Ministers in introducing legislation with catch-all provision for regulations which effectively say that in case they make any mistakes they want to be given a blank cheque for the next three years to re-write anything about the Bill which does not work the way they want it to work.  That is what section 5 is about.  It is not sinister, it is just sloppy. It is not sinister in the sense that they have any hidden agenda, it is just sloppy thinking, sloppy language, sloppy drafting, sloppy legislation and gross contempt of Parliament and it should not be in legislation.  The part which says</P>
    <P>If, in any respect, any difficulty arises in bringing any provision of this <Col N="823" /> Act into operation or in relation to the operation of any such provision, the Minister may, by regulations, do anything which appears to him to be necessary or expedient for removing that difficulty, for bringing that provision into operation or for securing or facilitating its operation and any such regulations may modify any provision of the Act in so far as may be necessary or expedient for carrying such provision into effect for the purposes aforesaid. Imagine what would happen if the present government in Czechoslovakia tried to write that into legislation &mdash; that anything that did not work the Government could re-write to make it work the way they wanted it to work. It is such incredible, sloppy draftsmanship that it defies adequate description by myself. </P>
    <P>There is no point in saying that these regulations can be over-ruled by the Oireachtas.  In an Oireachtas where the governing party have a majority in both Houses, that is unlikely to happen unless the Minister decides to nationalise AIB using the provisions of this Bill, which is unlikely.  The parliamentary scrutiny, given that the regulations are not regulations which have to be considered, is very limited.  It is extraordinary that one can stick into legislation a section such as that which effectively says, &ldquo;We have done our best but there may be loads of mistakes in it which we did not think about, but we did not get around to working them out.  So, we are going to give ourselves the power to change anything that we want to because it does not work the way we want it to work&rdquo;.  Each year, before we go through any legislation we should pass a resolution saying that we are passing this legislation but we are going to give every Minister the right to amend any part of it in the next three years in case he may find any mistakes which we did not think about.</P>
    <P>What sort of a country are we?  We are supposed to be a country of laws, not a country run by people or governments but a country that is ruled by law.  We are devaluing the law and increasing the <Col N="824" /> influence of an individual to change the law because he does not like the way it works.  In many ways this Bill would nearly deserve to be opposed because of section 5 alone but section 5 and section 57, together, make the Bill extremely unacceptable because we are simply going to prevent from competing the one area of banking which might have tried to compete if it was let, which might have tried to undermine the extraordinary cartel which has crucified many a private borrower and, indeed, most small firms, which might have tried to introduce that awful thing which solicitors, doctors barristers and none of the professions like, which is price competition.  It is good for everybody else but not for anybody important in our society and not for the banks, big companies, big professionals but it is good for the small man; it is good for small businesses but big businesses manage to avoid it.  The one possible agency which could have done this would have been the Trustee Savings Banks.  I am not saying that they would, or that they would be let, because I believe that the Central Bank have a hand in these extraordinarily conservative practices. The Trustee Savings Bank is obviously being set up, as Senator Upton said, the auctioneer is being called in to get a price and it is going to be sold off shortly, along with Irish Life, to the highest bidder.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, in relation to privatisation, the best study of privatisation that has been done has been done by a private consultancy firm and they have said that if the State sells off any asset at the proper price it is of no financial benefit to the State because the proper price is the price which reflects profitability if it is going to be profitable.  Do not tell me that privatising a bank will make it more efficient, because the record of the two big, entirely privatised Irish banks is the finest evidence one can have that privatising a large institution will not make it one bit more efficient but will probably do quite the opposite.  It is a pity that what would otherwise have been a fine piece of legislation has been devalued by the sloppiness of section 5 and the <Col N="825" /> extraordinary promise of a total transformation and elimination of Trustee Savings Banks that is contained in section 57.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the National Economic and Social Council, Report No. 88.  Ireland in the European Community: Performance, Prospects and Strategy.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator McGowan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion we discussed this matter, which was 16 November, I made some remarks about the report and on matters relating to it. I would like to take up where I left off on that occasion, where basically I was dealing with the position with regard to Irish farmers.  I made the point that in 1972, when we all campaigned very vigorously for membership of the EC we did it knowing that our industry would be in serious trouble.  We found, unfortunately, approximately ten years later when many of our industries in the intervening ten years had gone to the wall, that agriculture was getting into difficulties, that brakes were being applied on it and this unlimited potential which we looked forward to had now evaporated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I acknowledged on the last occasion that we have been net beneficiaries by being a member of the EC, we are now in the position where our standard of living is extremely low because our industrial development has been curtailed, our old industries have disappeared and agriculture with one exception, dairying, has been stagnant at best and in many respects has continued <Col N="826" /> to decline.  I make the point, and I do not think it is taken on board by the Government and many others who could contribute to its solution that a vast number of our farmers are in a very serious economic situation.  There are thousands of farmers, not necessarily small farmers in the west, who are trying to eke out an existence on a very low income.  This is because of the total collapse of the beef industry, an industry that had artificially high prices and producers of beef bought their raw materials at high prices.  They found themselves, subsequently, with margins that left very little profit.  Our grain farmers are in a similar position.  Perhaps the exceptions to the non-dairying farmers are the beef farmers and the sheep farmers whose margins are sustainable and from which they can make a living.</P>
    <P>I will push very strongly in this House for the attention of the Government that our non-dairying sector, the people who have not the licence to produce milk, must be assisted.  It is not a regional matter, it is not a matter of the size of the farm or efficiency.  It is a matter of being precluded from producing the one commodity that leaves a margin of profit in farming.  I sincerely hope some action will be taken on it.</P>
    <P>The NESC report which, is a very lengthy document, dwells very strongly on the importance of having a higher standard of living for all our people.  This is a worthwhile and desirable objective and we must work towards it.  That standard of living has got to be across the board. It cannot be sectionalised or confined to any particular grouping of people.  I am convinced, and it runs through the report, that the maximum degree of integration is desirable to give us the best results.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely important that cognisance is taken of the various regions, the disadvantages certain regions have and the advantages others enjoy and there must be a measure of equity.  Our very seriously disadvantaged position of being an island on the periphery of the mainland of Europe, our distance from the market-place, our small population and no home market of any consequence <Col N="827" /> must be considered.  In fact we are basically underdeveloped in comparison with many members of the European Community. The question of equity must, in my view, be taken very firmly into account in the context of the Single European Act, and so on.</P>
    <P>The Dooge Committee played a vital role in the internal market proposal and subsequently successive Governments laid the groundwork to make the Single European Act as acceptable and as beneficial as possible for the entire Community, including ourselves.  We all welcome the NESC report and note that it is very forward looking.  The historical meetings in Rhodes and Madrid which put the matter in a very clear and simple context, said the following:</P>
    <P>Completion of the Single Market cannot be regarded as an end in itself. It pursues a much wider objective, namely, to ensure the maximum wellbeing of all, in line with the tradition of social progress which is part of Europe's history.  This tradition of social progress should be a guarantee that all citizens, whatever their occupation, will have effective access to the direct benefits expected from a single market as a factor of economic growth and the most effective means of combating unemployment and in the construction of a Single European Market social aspects should be given the same importance as economic aspects and should be accordingly, developed in a balanced manner.</P>
    <P>That reference to the Rhodes and Madrid meetings sums up a great deal for us.  We must be conscious of the fact that there are a lot of things that we as a nation must do to be ready for 1992.  There is a vast amount of legislation which has to be passed, which fact is not at all times realised, although I know that regular ministerial discussions take place.  We must, of course, aim for a higher level of efficiency in our various sectors.  The efficiency of the Irish nation in its various facets, while I do not decry it, is not good enough to compete in 1992 with all the <Col N="828" /> situations which will then arise.  This is not very far away.</P>
    <P>We should be very glad of the radical changes in the Structural and Regional Funds which channel a great deal of money in our direction.  It is incumbent on us to make sure that these moneys are spent in the right direction and to the greatest advantage.  I referred already to economic integration.  I speak of economic integration in the European sense. This has to be solved and has to be managed and it is not something that will happen by itself.  We are striving, therefore, for 1992.  Sometimes when people talk about it I wonder if they realise the impact it will have on the whole Irish scene, because I believe it will be quite dramatic.</P>
    <P>We have, over the years, advocated the importance of added value, adding more value to our exports.  We have failed miserably in many respects in the agricultural sector, in the whole beef export industry.  An example of that is sides of beef being exported, which is just one step removed from exporting the live animal.  The same applies in many other spheres of agriculture and in the industrial section.  We have enormous potential in the whole added-value area.  We must couple this with a greater degree of diversification.  We tend to produce on tradition without having sufficiently researched the entire market area first.</P>
    <P>I believe &mdash; I said this in this House on previous occasions &mdash; that we have over the years produced a particular commodity and then we have vigorously gone out and tried to sell that commodity with expert marketeers and all the rest.  That is a totally wrong way of doing it.  We should first go out there to examine clearly and establish very fully what the consumer is looking for.  Whether it is a housewife in Paris, Bonn, Madrid or wherever, we must establish what the customer wants, either in the food sector or in the non-food sector.  We must then come back and produce to the requirement of that consumer.  The old adage is not very far wrong in this context when it talks about the customer always being right.  In a global sense, and from an Irish <Col N="829" /> point of view, we must produce what the consumer wants us to produce and how he wants it.  We might not necessarily agree that this is the best way to produce items, or, but if the consumer wants a particular product presented in a certain manner we must do that.</P>
    <P>I mentioned presentation.  One could not over-emphasise the absolute importance of this.  Presentation of Irish products over the years has been very poor. There have been many cases of Irish products being presented very badly in comparison with our European counterparts.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to interrupt the Senator's train of thought, but there is one hour left in this debate for other speakers.  I have six Senators offering, so I ask that not only the Senator but the others following to bear that in mind.  The House has agreed that there is no limit to the time Senators can speak so I cannot impose a limit, I ask the other speakers coming in to bear in mind that there are six offering at this moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to abbreviate my points as much as possible.  I spoke about presentation, which is of paramount importance.  Research is vital too. Enough of it is not being done and this is tied in very closely with education. Education and research are one and the same thing,</P>
      <P>One could not talk about the matters arising in this report without referring to the serious position of emigration.  We have 50,000 persons leaving our shores every year.  This is the official figure. Many more that we do not know about are also emigrating.  We must be very conscious of the fact that the real unemployment position is, in fact, not a quarter of a million but over 300,000.  There will be grants of vital importance available to us in 1992 if we prepare the ground for them.  We must, above all, always regard ourselves as a nation as an equal partner in Europe and should never regard ourselves as anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of points that I <Col N="830" /> intended to make but in deference to the Chairs remarks and the Senators who wish to come in I will conclude by stressing once again that the EC offers us opportunities provided we do our part in preparing our economy, industry, agriculture, workers and the entire scene in Ireland for it.  Only then can we benefit from being involved in 1992.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  I would like to compliment the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, on her speech.  I have one criticism of it but it is not directed personally against her.  Some of the speech covered the entire area.  It also covered statements emanating from the European Community in this area. They are so highly technical that there is a danger of gobbledegook.  There is a danger of alienating the ordinary citizens of the country and indeed even educated, sophisticated persons like ourselves from the use of acronyms, the use of particular specialised language systems which are quite difficult to penetrate for those who are uninitiated.  I could instance quite a number of them concepts like subsidiarity for example; phrases such as &ldquo;the completion of the internal market requires the continuation of very successful macro-economic management and supporting sectoral policies which we have been pursuing&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not perhaps the most impenetrable but it is the kind of thing that causes some hesitation.  Having gone to the trouble of penetrating it I discovered that it was not a particularly explosive concept and I felt that it might perhaps have been expressed in slightly simpler language because I am sure the Minister, who is as I know from my brief contacts with her to be at heart very much a democrat, would wish to do all in her power to make this kind of information as accessible as possible to the citizens of the country.  I am sure that she and the Government believe with me that the Community will only move forward at the correct speed and with the maximum consent of the people if the ideas that <Col N="831" /> control our future are made available to as many of the citizens as possible.</P>
    <P>This is terribly important because I was struck by a phrase in what Senator Fallon said in his contribution, that the aim of the Community should be to become the single most powerful economic unit in the world.  That is a very, very serious aim.  It causes me some small hesitation because when I look at what the Minister said, she very correctly speaks of insisting that we must be a Community which cherishes all its citizens equally.  I welcome this incorporation of some of the language of the Proclamation of 1916 into the ambitions and intentions of the European Community and would point out that it is not actually part of our Constitution. It underlines for me that the European Community is in essence very much a club and one in which we benefit from policies which remove internal distortions probably at the expense of creating a distortion in the global economy. I would like some degree of reassurance that in pursuing the aim of making the European Community the single most powerful economic instrument in the world we do not entirely neglect our obligations to other citizens of this planet.  It is very important that we note this today, on a day in which we have dealt with the non-establishment of an Oireachtas joint committee on overseas development aid and the fact that we came into Leinster House past a dignified peaceful picket of people who believe that not only the Community but in particular this country have not lived up to their humane obligations in this area.</P>
    <P>I have some further reservations.  They are concealed under some of the careful language which the Minister has used where for example it is stated that:</P>
    <P>It is scarcely realistic or even perhaps desirable to contemplate the Community exercising exclusive responsibility in such areas as social security or regional policy.</P>
    <P>That seems to me to carry an echo of recent discussions in Brussels where the British Government, for example, <Col N="832" /> wished to dissociate themselves from some of the social ramifications and it appeared almost as if our Minister for Labour at some of these talks, was also distancing himself from concepts such as the minimum wage.  It seems to me that if we are talking about cherishing all the citizens of our State equally, then we should be careful before removing ourselves from a consideration of what is a decent wage for the people of this country.  I hope the Minister may be able to give some reassurance on this point, which is very important.</P>
    <P>There is also an interesting series of observations about the political impact of these discussions.  The Minister, very rightly, places the impact of the conclusions of this report in a wider context than simply the economic one.  This clearly also has been done recently by the Taoiseach.  I would have to say, however, in this light, that the recent initiative by the Taoiseach within the context of the European Community, in writing to the three Northern Unionist Members of the European Parliament would have been more impressive and more persuasive had the latter been sent, received and perhaps replied to before it was actually bruited abroad to the Dáil.  I also feel I have got to comment on the paragraph where the Minister says:</P>
    <P>I disagree with NESC that Irish Governments have tended to see cohesion as a purely economic phenomenon.  Successive Governments here have I believe adopted a consistently <i>communautaire</i> thrust on broad strategic issues in the Community. This is exemplified by our generally positive approach to fresh steps in integration such as the EMS and the SEA.  These had much more than an economic significance...</P>
    <P>That, of course, is true but I would perhaps remind the Minister that on my first day in the Seanad after the election before this one, we had an opportunity to discuss the Single European Act.  At that time it seemed to me that the Taoiseach, who was then Leader of the Opposition was, in fact, quite scrupulous <Col N="833" /> in indicating that he had considerable difficulties in supporting the Single European Act for precisely those reasons, that it was wider than a purely economic framework.</P>
    <P>I would like to take up a very particular point about the Structural Funds and the way in which they will be dispensed.  The Minister says:</P>
    <P>The Community support framewrok which sets out the priorities, the amount and type of assistance which we will be receiving from the Structural Funds, has now been approved by the Commission.  This will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>In fact, I believe I am correct in saying that it may have been published now since the Minister last spoke: I am not quite sure on that point.  The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>Discussions are at an advanced stage between the European Commission and the various Government Departments in regard to the content of our operational programmes and these are expected to be appproved over the coming weeks.  Pending this, it is not possible to say exactly which individual projects will be selected for assistance by the funds.</P>
    <P>I want to comment very specifically on this.  Having spoken in a broad range about the distorting effect that may occur within the Community by what could be perceived as our capitalist selfishness, I want to be very parochial.  I want to remind the Minister that the consultative study which accompanied our submission to Brussels contained some very specific proposals which were costed.  They included funding for the redevelopment of areas in the north inner city, especially Henrietta Street, and the provision of support for No. 35, North Great George's Street, which was itemised for £600,000.  I would like to direct a specific question to the Minister on this.</P>
    <P>It has come to my attention as chairman of the board of trustees of the James Joyce Cultural Centre that there may very well be a move by a semi-State body <Col N="834" /> intended to strip that funding away from the James Joyce Cultural Centre and apply it to another project which was not mentioned in the consultative study.  This for me raises a very serious question. What is the point in going to Europe?  I have done this on repeated occasions to the European Community, to the Council of Europe, Cultural Funds and so on, and I have been complimented on the beauty, grace and elegance of my language, the superb quality of my submission, the wonderful photographs, the wealth of rhetoric and so on but where does it get you?  At the end of the day you get nothing.  I remember thinking, I wish I had been rude, ignorant, blasphemous and indecent and got the message across because at the end of the day there is no point in being told you have written well but it produces no result.</P>
    <P>I feel there would be real concern if, once again, the State agencies hoover in and carpetbag on the hard and determined work of people in this area seeking funds.  I would simply like to signal to the Minister the possibility that there will be a major row if this is allowed to happen again.  It would be quite unthinkable if serious, detailed lengthy submissions were made; if funds are apparently hypothetically allocated &mdash; I did ask what the precise status of the consultative study was at an earlier stage last year but I got no reply &mdash; and it will not go unremarked in the public media if this money is simply swiped.  In defence to the other Senators who wish to speak I will confine my remarks to those few points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>This NESC report is certainly a very thorough report indeed, but if there is one point that seems to come through from it, it is the question of complacency.  I do not think we should lose sight of this very critical aspect which again and again, as one reads through the report, comes either directly or indirectly to the surface.  We have no reason for complacency either in relation to our development so far within the European Community, which has been disapointing in many ways, or in <Col N="835" /> relation to the further opening of the Community in 1992.  This will certainly grant us many opportunities.  That does not necessarily mean that we are going to grasp or perhaps be able to grasp these opportunities.  Despite the many advances made since we joined the European Community, the overall picture is a very disappointing one, one in which we have admittedly moved forward but our rate of progess has been relatively slow. To an increasing extent we are becoming a small, isolated economy, which has made certain very limited progress towards industrialisation, certain very limited progress in the services sector and a rather artificial degree of progress in the agricultural sector.  I do not think any of this gives us much cause for complacency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have two other very major happenings which will be occurring over the next few years, and of which we seem to have taken very little note.  First, is the construction of the Channel Tunnel.  It is now well advanced.  It is proving to be extremely expensive; there have been severe cost overruns but, there is no doubt whatever that it is going to be completed.  When it is, the United Kingdom market will be even more closely associated with the already developed industrial economic base of north-west Germany, of the Netherlands and of France.  It will, indeed, be far closer in terms of access to the other industrial regions of significance in the Common Market such as the Catalonian region and northern Italy.  Where are we?  If anything, we are even more isolated. That is the reality of the situation.  We are working not from a state of advantage but one of disadvantage.  One may argue that we would be even worse off if we were outside the Community and that is very true.  It is essential for us to be a member of the Community.  As we read through this report, we cannot but observe the number of missed opportunities or opportunities not sufficiently taken.  That bodes ill for us.  We must in no way be complacent.  The Treaty of Rome, as stated here in the very first <Col N="836" /> chapter, expressed the determination to lay the foundations of an ever closer reunion among the peoples of Europe. The other major factor which, of course, is happening and that we are all aware of, is the dramatic changes in Eastern Europe.  However, much we may applaud and greatly welcome the social and human freedom which is introducing the reunion of families and so on, nonetheless the other reality of it is that the strongest trading partner, the strongest financial partner in the European Community now has a situation in which it returns to its natural hinterland, a great deal of which is in Eastern Europe, East Germany, Czechoslovakia &mdash; which used to be one of the most industrialised countries of Europe &mdash; Hungary.  These countries are already being financially aided by the Federal German Republic. There is an EC input to that but let us face the realities of it, it is basically a German financial input, either directly or indirectly.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the Deutsche Mark is becoming very much the currency of Europe and perhaps one of the wisest moves was, indeed, to join the EMS at an early stage.  Even there we had our problems and those problems may well now increase not decrease in the coming years.  This in turn is related, and specifically referred to in the report, to the banking situation.  We had this very imaginative move towards setting up a financial services sector, a sector which seems to be exceeding the expectations that one could have, but nonetheless the reality is that now all banking institutions in Europe and the European Communities, and basically that comes back to the United Kingdom, the French and above all the German banking institutions, will now be free to compete within this small community in so far as they wish to do so.  This has some fairly strong implications for us.</P>
    <P>Let us turn to another aspect and talk about management.  Here the report says very clearly that management is a key resource in all strategic options.  In a recent report the advisory committee on management training concluded that the <Col N="837" /> level of commitment to management development in Ireland is unacceptably low, given the economic challenges that face the country.  This is reality.  That bodes ill and certainly suggests that there can be no complacency whatever. Immediately following that paragraph, where it refers to the economic environment lessons of the past, our study, the experience since Ireland's accession, shows clearly that despite the openness of the economy to external influences, general domestic economic policy can seriously damage the overall economic environment.</P>
    <P>Here again our policy must be much more geared to the realities of the fact that we are now allied in the EMS to the Deutsche Mark, that we are now allied to a very different economy with all the implications that it has.  I wonder whether we have really taken this on board.  Let us take the example of the chemical industry.  We have, indeed, on the apparent statistics that one looks at, had tremendous developments in the chemical industry and this is, of course, to be welcomed, but it has been almost entirely foreign-based.  Irish chemical industries have either disappeared altogether or declined, partly because they were old traditional industries, partly for other reasons, that they were too small or did not show sufficient initiative, or whatever. The reality is that our internal chemical industry has declined.  That is repeated over and over again in other aspects and is, perhaps, hidden by many of the statistics which we look at.  We, as a small economy situated in what will be an increasingly remote part of Europe as the central access, which already is well away from us, shifts further towards the east, need to look to ourselves to see in what way we can effectively compete other than just simply receive social service contributions, important though these have been.  We can only compete if we make a much more organised effort to concentrate on certain areas.  We cannot compete, for example, in mass manufacturers, it is just not on in our situation or any likely development of that situation. We can, however, compete if we <Col N="838" /> are prepared to look at the top 5 per cent of the market, to adopt a policy of looking at the highly specialised, highly technical, the very high quality goods.  We have a possibility of competing in a very tough market, but nonetheless one in which a small economy has the opportunity of developing.</P>
    <P>I can cite one obvious example &mdash; which had far fewer resources then we have, and that is the Finnish economy. One could make many excuses why the Finnish economy, should have declined since the Second World War.  They have very few natural resources, they were devastated by the war, they had to make enormous reparations to the Soviet Union and yet by specialising in certain areas of machinery and equipment they are now the leading country in the world in these area.  They have a very high standard of living which is far higher than that in this country, they have developed their economy by specialising in aiming at the top niche of the market.  We have the opportunity of doing that.  In agriculture, we have potentially the best material and the best food in Europe.  We have shown that, given the challenge, we can produce very high qualify products but we really need, as a nation, as a Government, to take ourselves in hand and say we have to aim at quality, and there a small economy can, hopefully, compete successfully.  If we do not do that, we will simply gradually drift further and further back in the European Community. This backwards drift is being hidden by the fact that it is moving apparently forwards but, in reality, as compared with the other countries in the Community, we are slipping backwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I will bear in mind the Chair's words about being brief.  In Euro-speak today, as Senator Norris and other Senators have said, it is common to talk about economic cohesion.  It is a fine aspiration.  However, I am sorry to have to say &mdash; perhaps I am a pessimist &mdash; that it is pie in the sky and I will tell you why.  If the Irish economy grew at twice the European Community average which I think is a most unlikely scenario, <Col N="839" /> it would take us 20 years to match the wealth of Belgium, 22 years to match that of Britain, 28 years to match that of Denmark, etc., etc.  In other words, we are no more likely to close the wealth gap with the wealthier states than Scotland is to close it with London or Connemara is to close it with Dublin.</P>
      <P>However, that is not the entire story. What is more important is that we get rich in real terms rather than in relative terms, and I believe we can and we must do that.  Indeed, I have often quoted Finland as an example, as Senator Conroy has mentioned.  I studied there for a while.  They have some extraordinary achievements, but they also have one extraordinary resource and that is the total area of woodland is more than twice the size of England, and it is great reservoir on which to call.  Necessity forced them after the war, and they responded remarkably by concentrating in the machine tool area on icebreakers, ship building and so on where they became world leaders.</P>
      <P>Returning to the question of economic cohesion, I want to go further and say that we have pinned far too much hope in my view on the increased Structural Funds as a means of solving all our economic problems.  Such funds can be very useful if strategically used to generate increased economic activity but unfortunately in this country too many people, particularly politicans, see the increased Structural Funds as an end in themselves, not as a means to an end &mdash; the end being extra wealth and extra jobs.  If I may be realistic and throw cold water on some of these hopes, let us remember that, if the funds are doubled they will still only represent one-third of what we had been borrowing each year just to keep going. I mention that to highlight how important it is that we use the extra funds we get to generate increased economic wealth, not just to have a good time for a while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of transfer of resources is entirely inadequate in my view, more particularly when it is realised that the third level education for all those who <Col N="840" /> emigrate from Ireland cost the Irish taxpayer almost £100 million per year and such emigration represents a transfer of our most important resource from a relatively poor country to the wealthier countries, mainly in the Community.</P>
    <P>We obtain our fair share of the Community budget on a <i>per capita</i> basis, but the problem is, of course, that the total budget is far too small, only 0.5 per cent of Community GDP or, in other words, a mere token transfer to the poorer peripheral regions of the Community, possibly to keep us quiet.  The United States by contrast transfers about 2.5 per cent of its GDP to its poorer regions.  Without a similar move in Europe we will never be a Community in the true sense, but the closer integration recommended by NESC would certainly help in this direction.</P>
    <P>This report, which we cannot do justice to in the time available, highlights a number of important issues.  It highlights two distinct periods in our time of membership of the Community.  In the early years we performed quite well but our performance since 1979 has been, to say the least, disappointing.  The report, however, is relatively silent on the reckless economic monetary and fiscal policies we adopted in the late seventies and early eighties as the cause of the poor performance since 1979.  If we cast our minds back, public sector pay went up by 35 per cent in 1980 combined with horrific borrowing and spending which took inflation rates above 20 per cent.  This, in turn, drove many enterprises, including many farmers, to the wall.  Our economic woes, therefore, are to a considerable extent of our own making.  We are disadvantaged in many ways but then so, too, is Finland and many other areas I could refer to.  We did contribute to our own downfall to some extent.</P>
    <P>In commenting on this NESC report, we cannot overlook the 1992 programme, and the impact that is going to have on us, on taxation, on our competitiveness and so on.  Removal of border posts, as we all know, will necessitate the convergence of indirect taxation rates.  I do <Col N="841" /> not think we are going to have harmonisation &mdash; that is a bit too ambitious &mdash; but at least if we can get the indirect rates within 5 or 6 per cent on each side of the border, we could eliminate a lot of the distortion of trade.</P>
    <P>As a highly taxed country, convergence will automatically mean a gain for the consumer but bad news, possibly, for the Revenue Commissioners, or is it? I am not too sure.  Various estimates of up to £600 million in loss of revenue have been quoted.  I do not accept these estimates entirely for a number of reasons.  These are theoretical calculations based on things as they now stand, but things do not stand still when you start changing indirect taxation rates. Lower VAT and excise duties will mean increased economic activity and reduced smuggling, which is at present on a massive scale.  Of course, I believe it will also mean a considerable reduction in the black economy.  As the balance of incentive and penalty changes, there will be many people emerging into the legal economy.</P>
    <P>When the then Minister for Finance introduced the 48-hour restriction because of distortion in our trade, I took issue with him in the European Parliament. I did so for the following reasons.  It was a waste of time because I do not believe it is possible to stop smuggling.  If items as large, as loud and as smelly as pigs and cattle are smuggled across the Border day in day out, despite the heavy presence of police and Army on both sides, how can we stop the smuggling of items as small, as valuable and as silent as cigarettes, tobacco, spirits, consumer electronics and so on?  Of course, we cannot.  It now transpires that &mdash; the ESRI tells us &mdash; there has been no significant reduction in the flow of goods from the North to the South.  That means, in effect, since there has been a big reduction in the number of people going North to shop, that the goods are now coming South via the smugglers who all too often are also the terrorists.  In my view the only answer is to bring the indirect taxation rates, as close as possible, on both sides of the Border.  We <Col N="842" /> should concern ourselves with keeping our rates close to the one country with which we have a land border and let the others worry about their own problems. We must worry about our problem in relation to our nearest neighbour.</P>
    <P>The ultimate solution would be to bring our tax rates closer.  Differences in prices, however, are not always due to tax differences. Sometimes it is due to lack of competition or differential pricing by wholesalers or manufactureres and this, too, has to be watched carefully.  It should be remembered that when the ESRI carried out the study for the Commission on the tax differences and so on, on both sides of the Border, one of the interesting things they found was that when all elements of taxation difference on a bottle of whiskey were removed, a bottle of whiskey cost £2.05 more in Dundalk than in Newry, and it is distilled in Midleton, Country Cork.  It is not always tax differences which cause price differences.</P>
    <P>As a nation, however, we have taxed ourselves into poverty by killing the incentive to work, to save, to invest and to take risks.  Essential services, such as telephones, post, electricity, transport and so on were among the most competitively priced in Europe in 1977.  By 1982 they were all significantly dearer than their counterparts in Europe.  The toll of over-staffing, leading to high taxation and to spiralling wages, etc., made it very difficult for business to survive and unemployment took an upward trend. Those who lost jobs emigrated because of a lack of work here and many of those who had jobs emigrated because they were paying too much tax.</P>
    <P>With the economy in such urgent need of tax reform, it is incumbent upon our political leaders to tackle this matter without further delay.  Failure to do so will mean that we will continue to get poorer both in real and relative terms and the very resources we need to build our economy will have departed our shores for a better deal elsewhere.  With the momentum for greater economic and monetary union in the Community now is the time to grasp the nettle.  A lot has been said about economic and monetary union.  It <Col N="843" /> is a very noble aspiration and objective, but we must remember that the idea of a single currency can only come about when we have much more closely-knit economic and monetary policies thoughout the whole of the Community.  It also means, of course, something which Mrs. Thatcher, in particular, and many other Governments do not like, a certain loss of sovereignty, which they do not want to give up easily.  But the benefits to be gained from it are enormous, apart from getting rid of the inconvenience of all the different currencies.  For example, in terms of cost, if one was to convert our money into the other 11 currencies and back again, one would end up with roughly 46 per cent of what one started out with.  We are placing on industry throughout the Community a self-imposed cost, which is making us less competitive, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the United States and Japan.  There is also the risk factor involved, although that is minimised somewhat now by the EMS, but we still have it because we do most of our trading with Britain, which is not in the EMS.  I would like to say much more about that but I see that the Chairman is looking at the clock.</P>
    <P>Finally, I cannot let the opportunity pass without saying something about agriculture because this was the great white hope.  We were going to drown the Continent in food, milk, butter, eggs and so on.  Alas, that did not happen.  The only area where there was real significant progress was that of dairying and that was all too often at the expense of other enterprises, such as beef, cattle, sheep, tillage and so on.  If I were to put down our failure to a single cause, I would put it down to what I would refer to as the technology gap.  When we joined the Community 80 per cent plus of our farmers had primary education only, as against 90 per cent plus, in Denmark, Belgium, Holland, and so on, having formal agricultural education after second level education.  Therefore, we were amateurs competing in a very professional field.  How could we expect to have been as successful as them, given <Col N="844" /> our other disadvantages as well?  Of course we could not have been.  The situation has not improved and the recent cutbacks are to be regretted.  There are areas of Government spending that are more important than others and I would rather see the cuts being made somewhere else.</P>
    <P>With regard to food processing, here again we have not been very successful. Senator Hourigan has already referred to the fact that we produce something and then try to sell it, rather than first finding out what is needed and then producing it.  I have used this slogan in the past and I will use it again because it is appropriate: &ldquo;planning must begin at the plate and not at the plough, as in the past&rdquo;.  Farmers and food processors would spend their time more beneficially sitting at supermarket check-outs rather than in Ministers' or Commissioners' waiting rooms asking for something which they are not going to get.  We must face the reality. The consumer is the person who will decide whether we succeed or fail.</P>
    <P>I cannot let the opportunity pass either without making some reference to the European Parliament, of which I was a member for a few years and hope to be again.  The Parliament is getting quite a lot of power now.  If, after a Second Reading, an amendment is passed with a majority, 260 plus, and with the support of the Commission, that amendment can only be blocked at the Council of Ministers on the basis of a unanimous vote. I have had personal experience of this in a number of areas.  Regrettably, and I do not know what the problem is, briefing MEPs after all the committee work is done before they go in to vote in Strasbourg is marginally better than useless because if the horse is not already gone at that stage, the most you have is a few hairs of the tail.  If MEPs are not properly briefed on First Reading and certainly before Second Reading, we will never be able to get across what the country wants because the point will not be accepted at the plenary session if the committee has already strongly decided otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief and try to summarise the points I want to make. First, it is impossible to give the report the treatment it deserves, which should be a chapter-by-chapter analysis of its deliberations.  Like other speakers, I welcome it as an excellent appraisal of where we were prior to our entry to the EC, during the period of accession, where we are in 1989 and where we ought to be going in the nineties.  Looking back, the picture is a bleak one.  The Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern, referred in the Dáil to the document as being a sobering one.  I have selected specific areas I would like to refer to.</P>
      <P>One, industry and our performance, and particularly the need for developmental policies in relation to primary, secondary and tertiary industries.  Secondly, education, particularly in the area of the European Social Fund.  Thirdly, the area of social cohesion in relation to education, and particularly in relation to the Commission's repeated emphasis on its intention to promote the employment of women.  Lastly, I could not let the document go without referring to the use of Structural Funds as drawn up, submitted and in the process of being implemented between now and 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to industry and our performance, the report shows a slow growth after accession, slower than it had been from 1960 to 1973.  With a slower growth of output and faster growth of productivity, it meant that employment in manufacturing industry increased very little in the years after our accession. There was a decline in traditional industries such as textiles, clothing, footwear, with the reduction of tariff protection. There was an increase in the engineering sector particularly in the subsection where firms produced electronics and office equipment only, and I repeat only, due to a rapidly increased share of IDA <Col N="846" /> grant aid in the years from 1975 onwards. Likewise, in the chemical industry there was growth in pharmaceuticals &mdash; again because of substantial grant-aided investment between 1974 and 1977.</P>
    <P>There are serious implications for us regarding huge levels of grant.  I was glad the report centred on the fact that grant-aided plant investments have demonstrated that they have not greatly stimulated industrialisation.  Where does that leave us?  We must have developmental policies in relation to industry, particularly in the agricultural industry. Senator Conroy, Senator Hourigan and Senator Raftery referred to that.  In the agricultural sector, in the food processing area, added value is seen as added costs and added aggravation.  This approach, of course, has been maintained, fostered and geared towards commodity products rather than value-added products.  We must insist, in this area, on developmental supports.  In other words, industry must change direction.  The incentives necessary must be directed in that way.  That is very important.</P>
    <P>With regard to education within the European context, particularly in the area of funding, I am aware of EC funding and assistance in various interventions at second level, particularly in the area of vocational training and preparation of students for the transition from school to working life, or sadly non-working life, or now emigration.  I am aware of the project regarding language development, funding to RTCs, funding within the Limerick area to Co-Act, and FÁS training programmes.</P>
    <P>However, I am surprised, because of the strong emphasis on agriculture at primary and secondary levels of industry, that there is no funding going in that direction.  I would suggest that moneys from the ESF should be extended to post-secondary school students who wish to further their education towards careers in farming, particularly at the primary level of farming, and also its allied industries. I am thinking specifically of agricultural colleges, like Pallaskenry and Warrenstown.  We could draw comparisons with agricultural colleges in the <Col N="847" /> Netherlands and in Denmark where they are on the same priority as post-secondary colleges here.  I am amazed we have never emphasised the importance of agricultural education.  We have scholarships for those colleges, but no funding from Europe.  Of course, with the changing nature of Irish agricultural employment, resources must be made available. I could go on and ask why NUI university colleges, University College, Limerick, Dublin City University, Trinity College, and so on have not got ESF funding. They have got funding for post-graduate studies, lately.</P>
    <P>On agricultural training within the area of social cohesion, NESC make reference to the necessity for grants in regions which will be affected by market completion. I particularly emphasise the need here for training programmes for women entering and re-entering the labour force.</P>
    <P>My third point is in relation to the NESC reference to the repeated commitment of the EC Commission to pursue the question of women's participation in the labour force and their contribution to the development of the Community, their aim being to foster and to further women's integration into the economy and society.  This is part of the second action programme on equal opportunities for women between 1986 and going on to 1990.  This is particularly relevant for us here in Ireland where there are still proportionately fewer women in jobs than in most EC countries.  Recent figures issued by FÁS in their labour market monthly show that the proportion of women in the labour force has increased from 27.8 per cent in 1979 to 32.1 per cent in 1988. The counterpart figure for the 12 EC countries is 38.7 per cent, with only Spain having proportionately fewer women at work than Ireland.</P>
    <P>Another insidious statistic which causes me great concern is that part-time employment is of far greater significance for women than men.  I will give a few more statistics in relation to women in part-time jobs.  The 1987 figure, for instance, was 47,200, which was 90 per cent more than the 22,400 recorded in <Col N="848" /> 1979.  The 2.5 per cent of the male workforce categorised as part-time is comparable with the figure of 13 per cent for women.  In the unemployment figures for women, there was a jump from 20,900 in 1980 to a staggering 71,200 in July of this year, an increase of over 50,000 or 241 per cent.  In regard to men, comparably there was a rise of 94,000, up by 145 per cent.  Any increase we have had in the participation of women in the workforce is very slight.  Within the last ten years it is attributable to the impact of EC-related legislation on anti-discrimination, the Equal Pay Act, 1975 which, I believe, is still being breached, and the Employment Equality Act, 1986.  I am glad that NESC highlights the issues that must be addressed.  There is a need for public policies which implicity and explicitly encourage female labour force participation. On the other hand, public policies, notably income taxation of married women and the absence of public provision for child care act as disincentives to women working.</P>
    <P>What do we do?  In Ireland we must determine what particular policies must be effective and justify European financial support.  The following are important &mdash; and I will list them quickly because of time constraint &mdash; child care day centres, both from a legislative viewpoint and also inspection, selective provision by health boards and local authorities of child care services, tax reliefs for child care expenses incurred by parents, child care facilities provided by employers.</P>
    <P>These are all matters of priority.  If we are to harmonise working and living conditions, we, in Ireland, could incur disproportionately higher costs in conforming to Community initiatives because of our economic and demographic structure.  We have no direct public provision and management of child day care in contrast to many other EC countries and a less comprehensive social security and parental relief régime. We can only attempt to develop with some Community financial support but we must not expect the EC to change everything.  Here at home employers and we, as legislators, must acknowledge our <Col N="849" /> social responsibility to provide the necessary social support which women require in the workplace.</P>
    <P>Where economic constraints are cited, for example, as a reason for not creating a programme of child care facilities, one must question the values and attitudes underlying decisions about economic priorities.  In other countries, even with economic problems as serious as our own, change has occurred quite dramatically. I do not accept that we in Ireland need always have the poor mouth.  For instance, in the first four years after 1981, when the Greek Government took office the number of child care centres tripled to 400 new centres in four years.  That was in a country that is peripheral and a country that is, like ourselves, looking for increased structural funding.  They were able to do it when they set their minds to it.  The point there is that policies can be implemented if the underlying attitudes, values and priorities are there.  We should take note, because we always seem to have to look to Europe and use Europe as a springboard for recognition.</P>
    <P>Finally, I refer to the area of Structural Funds.  I will await with interest the distribution of the funds available to us, particularly in the area of integrated rural development.  Here many communities have come together, submitted projects, drawn up and formulated their plans.  I know we were not satisfied with the make-up of the working and advisory groups in relation to local authority representation, as was stated by other Senators here this evening.  The Structural Funds are meant to prepare us for the economic impact and the social impact of total integration in 1992.  Hopefully, they will not be squandered on projects which do not reflect the basic needs of our community, employment, and, especially, and I emphasise this, the preservation of the social fabric of our rural areas, where I notice that only £5 million is earmarked for the pilot schemes for integrated rural development.</P>
    <P>One last point relates to agri-tourism, which appears to be the panacea for all our ills.  I would ask how can small farmers, already under pressure, have <Col N="850" /> the managerial and marketing expertise to actually develop agri-tourism?  It is a much bandied term, but as far as I am concerned the moneys necessary to give them both managerial and marketing expertise to help them to develop this would certainly need far more than the £5 million that has been earmarked, if we wish to keep people on the land.  Again, I would have to make a very quick reference there to the implementation of the proposed Social European Charter. While accepting the NESC report's rather bleak picture of our position, there is much, I believe, that we can work on to achieve its aims.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express my disappointment with just having four minutes now.  Having waited throughout the debate for several days, I now find that at the end of the debate, I am just given four minutes.  I would like to voice my objection to that.  For that reason, I will just devote myself to one of the areas of five which I wanted to deal with.</P>
      <P>I want to welcome the report and its positive aspects, which I was anxious to go into.  I will deal with one area that has not been gone into.  I think it is regrettable that the report did not deal with the policing implications of 1992, which are going to be very important.</P>
      <P>Apart from the reference made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs about three weeks ago, very little has been said about the policing implications of 1992.  No debate has taken place in this area.  There is no doubt that the objective of 1992 is to have free movement of people without systematic checks of identity or of luggage. Little thought appears to have been extended to the control of criminal movement, drug trafficking and arms movement. The implications for the development of crime must be considered. In relation to the drug problem, a recent report by the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scale of the drug problem facing the community is staggering.  The Committee of Inquiry reports that there are as many as 1.5 million users <Col N="851" /> of heroin in the Community.  It is considered that the Community cannot continue to stand back and allow the ruinous drug trade to continue and grow.</P>
    <P>In the face of these facts and implications, the Interpol organisation has said:</P>
    <P>The drug sub-division of ICPO Interpol has not undertaken any study or research at all into the proposed free borders in Europe in 1992 in relation to drugs.</P>
    <P>The removal of frontier checks within the Community will create a situation similar to that existing in the United States at present, which has a police system consisting of State forces plus an overall body, the FBI, which is a non-uniformed police force.  The system has given rise to dissatisfaction and, in fact, the chief of police, the police president in the United States recently said:</P>
    <P>At present there is no apparatus to help our nation to mobilise, co-ordinate and focus our multiple law enforcement efforts.  Law enforcement at the State and local levels needs a collective voice at national level.</P>
    <P>The fragmentation of police forces in the United States has thus been a positive advantage to the criminal elements who have the freedom to move from state to state without local police jurisdiction, while police jurisdiction ends at the state line.  A similar situation will exist in Europe after 1992, while it will not have the added advantage of a body like the FBI.</P>
    <P>There are two other areas &mdash; I know I do not have time to deal with them fully &mdash; that are important to mention.  One is the fact that it is important to harmonise laws after 1992.  If you have disparity of laws, the criminals will concentrate their efforts in the country with the least sanctions, with the police who have least training and least equipment.  They will, in fact, base their activities there and from there farm out their operations to the other countries in the Community.</P>

      <P>Coicís ó shin tháinig mé anseo le tús a chur leis an díospóireacht ar thuarascáil NESC, agus ó shin i leith bhí díospóireacht bhreá sa Seanad.  Ní bheidh ar mo chumas anois, san am atá ar fáil agam, freagra chomh cuimsítheach agus ba mhaith liom a thabhairt ar an díospóireacht sin, ach beidh mé ag plé leis na mór-cheisteanna a hardaíodh.</P>
      <P>First, I might deal with the question that was raised by Senator Neville and bring him and other Senators up to date on what is happening in the whole area of free movement of persons and in the area of drugs.  I do not know if he is aware or not, but the Council of Justice Ministers have already appointed two groups to report back to the Council. One of these is a co-ordinators' group on the free movement of persons with particular reference to terrorism.  The second is a co-ordinators' group on drugs. Both of those are looking at the whole effect that the free movement of people is going to have on those particular areas which are of major concern to all member states, not just to ourselves.  They will be reporting back to their Ministers, who in turn, of course, as we know, will report to the internal market Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is undoubtedly true that the present time is a most exciting and dynamic period in the EC's development.  The Community, after years of stagnation and indecision, is now beginning at last to recover its original momentum and confidence. This is already beginning to be felt on the economic front, with economic growth in the EC now continuing strongly.  Real output is expected to expand this year by over 3 per cent and to continue at around this level into next year.  These growth rates are higher than in any of the last nine years, with the exception of 1988.  Employment is also increasing rapidly.  Almost two million net additional jobs were created in 1988 and another two and a half million to three million are expected to be created in 1989-90.  As a result, the unemployment rate at EC level is expected to be below 9 per cent next year.  The <Col N="853" /> prospects opened up by the internal market have been an important factor in this recovery.</P>
    <P>In order to gain the full benefits from these achievements and opportunities, economic policy efforts, as emphasised in a recent Commission document, need to be pursued in two principal directions:</P>
    <P> (i)  Improvements in the fundamental determinants of growth in the medium term so that all Community countries regain a high level of employment.  This is particularly necessary in those countries which need to catch up and will be first to benefit from the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Improve further the convergence towards monetary stability and the compatibility of macro-economic performances with sustained and balanced growth.  This is necessary so that the recovery of the last seven years does not founder on a resurgence of inflation or unsustainable external or budgetary imbalances.  In addition, greater convergence is necessary to achieve greater stability of exchange rates which is also a condition for successful completion of the first stage of the EMU.  </P>
    <P>The economic policies which we have been pursuing so successfully since 1987 are fully in line with these considerations. The substantial increase in unemployment of nearly 150,000 people in the early to mid-eighties is now being reversed.  Unemployment has fallen by nearly 30,000 since March 1987, with most of this fall occurring in the period since the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was implemented.  From April 1987 to April 1989, total employment grew by 10,000 according to official estimates. Underlying this figure is a gain of 35,000 in employment in the private sector offset by a decline in the public sector.</P>
    <P>The continued creation of new jobs and the maintenance of existing ones is the primary objective of the Government's economic policies.  To allow continued progress to be made requires a rigorous adherence to the objectives and <Col N="854" /> spirit of the programme.  If this is done we can look forward to further improvements in our employment performance.</P>
    <P>The original vision of the EC founding fathers is now coming closer to being realised.  The Community, as it is developing, will become not just a successful unified economy, able to compete more successfully with its trading partners, such as the US and Japan, in the process, it can also become a model for political co-operation between democratic nations.  As borne out by developments over the past year, especially in recent weeks, its attractions for neighbouring countries, whether in the EFTA group or in Eastern Europe, is growing stronger and its influence for peace and justice in the world at large is increasingly recognised.</P>
    <P>Our economic future clearly belongs in our fullest participation and on an equal footing with our partners in the Community's further development along lines that serve our interests.  Expanding on the themes which I outlined in my address opening this debate, our participation in this development is predicated on the basis that is accompanied by policies that:</P>
    <P>reduce the wide regional disparities within the Community; avoid creating or exacerbating social divisions in our society; foster family farming and a vigorous rural economy; provide more effective protection to an increasingly threatened environment; establish an economic and monetary union with the accompanying common policies needed for successful integration and an expanded Community budget; strengthen Europe's capacity in science and technology; and nurture and encourage European culture and intellectual life.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, no question of seeking to impose a uniform type of society throughout the Community or of asking our citizens to abandon the rich diversity of their cultures or historical traditions in order to embrace some homogenised European identity.  Indeed, those who laid the intellectual foundations for the <Col N="855" /> Community always recognised that cultural diversity was its very essence and one of the distinctive elements which distinguished it from the world's super powers.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that this strategic approach, which is the one recommended by the NESC and the one which the Government are also pursuing, has also received the board support of Senators during this debate.</P>
    <P>I am, however, particularly disappointed that, in her opening remarks in this debate, Senator Avril Doyle launched a vitriolic attack, which was based on totally false premises and inferences, on the Taoiseach and on the Fianna Fáil Party.  The House will recall that specifically Senator Doyle charged that my party, when in Opposition, voted against ratification of the Single European Act back in 1986.  This is totally untrue.  Given the gravity of the charge and the personal attacks which Senator Doyle made against the Taoiseach's integrity, it is important that I respond on this and set the record straight.</P>
    <P>The then Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government did not submit the Single European Act for ratification in the Dáil until very shortly before the deadline set and agreed by all EC partners for its coming into force, namely, 1 January, 1987.  This was despite the fact that the SEA had been signed in February 1986 and had been agreed in all its essential details at the European Council in December 1985, almost a year previously. This inordinate delay has never been explained but it is reasonable to surmise that this stemmed from internal divisions between the Fine Gael and Labour parties then in Government.</P>
    <P>In an explanatory White Paper on the SEA, which was published only following repeated pressure from my party, the possibility of any constitutional difficulty with the SEA was firmly ruled out.  This was confirmed subsequently in the Dáil by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Barry.</P>
    <P>I wish to point out to Senator Doyle that my party have always been positively <Col N="856" /> committed to this country's active participation in the EC.  This approach has been consistently followed and never subjected to the U-changes and turn-abouts which she alleged here in this House.</P>
    <P>Although we were critical of some aspects of the way the negotiations on the SEA had been conducted, Fianna Fail's position was to support ratification. We had been presented with an unwelcome choice which was stated in the Dáil on 9 December 1986 by our Leader as follows:</P>
    <P>It is not possible, now that we have arrived at the ratification stage, to reverse what was agreed during the negotiations.  What we must try and do now is preserve what we can in the new situation. </P>
    <P>Our attitude at the time was influenced by the precarious state our economy had reached under the then Coalition Government's mishandling, the fact, as now very well documented in the NESC report that regional disparities in the Community had not been narrowed and by the then Government's stance on EC negotiations which seemed to be based on the assumption that we were not entitled to press our interests and that instead we had to accept passively and uncritically what was being proposed.</P>
    <P>At the time, and here I am still talking about December 1986, all that was available were textual commitments on cohesion and convergence.  As we know from previous experience and negotiations on EC matters, these were not of any great particular benefit unless backed up by solid commitments to increase the size and effectiveness of the Structural Funds.  However, in February 1987 the European Commission presented their proposals for the reform of and the doubling of the Structural Funds and these were instrumental in making Fianna Fáil support for the Single European Act much more positive.</P>
    <P>The other major difficulty we had related to the SEA's provision for closer co-operation on matters relating to &ldquo;the political and economic aspects of security&rdquo;. Fianna Fáil sought to have Ireland's <Col N="857" /> policy of military neutrality clearly acknowledged so as to leave no doubt or ambiguity among our EC partners, but this was refused by the then Government.</P>
    <P>To ensure that Ireland's interests on these two fundamental matters were protected, we proposed a Declaration to accompany our instrument of ratification of the Single European Act but this was lost in the Dáil by 71 votes to 73.  The Government motion affirming the terms of the SEA was subsequently passed without a division.  The charge that Fianna Fáil voted against ratification of the SEA is, therefore, totally incorrect. My party's fears were, of course, subsequently confirmed with the Supreme Court judgment on 9 April 1987.  As a result, the entry into force of the SEA throughout the Community had to be delayed by six months.  The damaging effect of this country's standing could have been avoided had my party's advice been accepted.</P>
    <P>I would hope, that Senator Doyle will now accept that she was totally wrong in her charges and would have the good grace to apologise for her unfounded and personal attacks and charges.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to the proposal that an all-party Oireachtas committee should be established on the implications of the 1992 internal market programme.  It has also been proposed that a committee be established to examine and report back on the NESC report. Such committees would merely duplicate the elaborate and extensive arrangements for consultations and debates already available and we on the Government side do not, therefore, see that any useful purpose would be served in their establishment.</P>
    <P>In my address opening this debate, I outlined the strengthened EC co-ordination arrangements which we introduced on my party's return to Government in 1987, beginning with my own appointment which involves fulltime Ministerial responsibility in this area.  This continues under the present Government.  I also went on to highlight how these arrangements were subsequently enhanced further through the <Col N="858" /> European Bureau and the regular meetings of the Committee of Ministers and Department Secretaries.  Additionally, we have the Central Review Committee under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> as well as the Sectoral Development Committee.</P>
    <P>This debate has been used again by Opposition Senators to launch a fresh round of attacks on the innovative arrangements which we introduced for sub-regional participation and consultation in the preparation of our National Development Plan.  In responding to specific comments and charges made by Senator Myles Staunton, I should make it clear that, ahead of the EC's Council agreement in this area, we decided in the autumn of 1987 to move towards a programme and co-ordinated basis &mdash; as distinct from the project-byproject approach which had prevailed up to then &mdash; to ensure that we would be well positioned to avail to the maximum possible extent from the increased assistance from the EC Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>The continued sniping by the Opposition, who when in Government consistently refused to introduce any regional arrangements in the use of Structural Funds moneys, is difficult to follow at this stage.  The arrangements which we introduced, went further than was necessary under the EC regulations.  This we did out of our concern and commitments given to ensure that regional and local knowledge and experience were drawn on, so as to exploit fully all opportunities and make the most effective use of the increases in the Structural Funds. These arrangements had the support of the social partners, through the Central Committee of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and were also welcomed by the European Commission.</P>
    <P>This was the first time ever that a national plan was broken down into regional components.  Responding to a specific comment from Senator Staunton, I would direct his attention to Chapter 6 of our <i>National Development Plan.</i> There a summary is given of the objectives and strategies as identified by the regional groups and which, in turn, have <Col N="859" /> been taken into account in our development strategy and operational programmes. As will be clear from the financial tables in that chapter, which contains a detailed sectoral and financial breakdown of expenditure, each region will benefit substantially from the development measures and Structural Funds expenditures planned.</P>
    <P>Moreover, we have decided to continue these sub-regional arrangements in operation, save with one modification.  In the interests of greater effectiveness and interaction, the advisory and working group for each subregion will now be merged into one group, whose function will be to be regularly informed and consulted in the implementation of our operational programmes.  As a further and important innovation, the new groups will elect their own chairpersons and secretary and the Commission will now also be represented.  Each group will meet at least twice a year.</P>
    <P>Considerable publicity has been given to our decision to turn down the Commission's proposal of assistance for Community development.  In response, I should like to make it clear that this would not involve additional EC assistance above the levels as now agreed in the Community Support Framework.  I should also emphasise that, in the preparation of our National Plan and supporting operational programmes which we forwarded for approval to Brussels the Government fully recognised and took account of the importance of encouraging local development initiatives. Already, State agencies such as the IDA, SFADCo, Údarás na Gaeltachta and FÁS provide a comprehensive range of services to support small business and development initiatives by local community groups.  The increased resources which we will be getting from the funds will greatly enhance the capacity of these agencies and, in the circumstances, a separate source of funding would not result in the most effective and efficient use of these resources.</P>
    <P>I have already outlined the detailed <Col N="860" /> consultations at national and regional levels which we initiated in the preparation of our National Development Plan and, as I emphasised, these will be continued.  The NESC report, which we have been debating in this House, following a similar debate recently in the Dáil, was prepared specifically on the Government's initiative.</P>
    <P>At the political level, in addition to the usual parliamentary procedures available in both Houses for debates and information on EC affairs, an additional important role is provided for TDs and Senators through the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Community, which is being reconstituted at present.  This committee will, I am sure, do much valuable work during the present term of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am particularly anxious to ensure that, with a positive and co-operative spirit on all sides, a satisfactory way can be found to ensure that that Committee's reports lead to debates more often in both Houses.</P>
    <P>On the CAP, the agricultural issues raised in the NESC report have, understandably, figured prominently in this debate.  The Taoiseach has already in the debate in the Dáil given an assurance that the Government will seek to influence the evolution of the CAP along the lines recommended by the NESC.  I should also mention that the Minister for Agriculture and Food has established a group to review the agricultural situation and outlook.  This group will have consultations with the various farm organisations and experts and will submit a report to the Government in the first half of next year.</P>
    <P>The emphasis in the structural policy of the EC on aiding the family farm and on supporting income of farmers in the less-favoured areas needs to be strengthened. The basic EC structures regulation is implemented in Ireland through the farm improvement scheme.  Under this scheme, which was introduced in 1986 in replacement for the farm modernisation scheme, grant aid of £29 million has been paid to date to some 33,000 farmers undertaking investments amounting to <Col N="861" /> £185 million.  Our <i>National Development plan 1989-1993</i>, forwarded to Brussels last March, and the Community Support Framework drawn up as a result provide for the continuation of this scheme.  Compensatory payments &mdash; or headage payments as they are more generally known &mdash; are also paid and are a most effective method of increasing the income of farmers in less-favoured areas and so stabilising the population in such areas.  In the current year some £57 million is being paid in headage, of which the community is contributing 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>On the questions raised in the debate relating to the extension and reclassification of the disadvantaged areas, on 4 February 1987 the then Government submitted to the EC a proposal that all Ireland's less severely handicapped areas be reclassified to more severely handicapped area status.  The EC turned this proposal down because they stated no evidence had been produced to justify this widespread reclassification.  It was made quite clear to this country that such evidence would have to be produced to justify any large-scale reclassification or, indeed, any designation of areas as disadvantaged for the first time.</P>
    <P>If the EC insists &mdash; as it does &mdash; on evidence in the form of the required economic data to justify reclassification of areas already designated as handicapped, then it will insist even more so on such evidence to justify the designation of an area as handicapped for the first time. The criteria laid down for such designation in Ireland are (a) stocking rate must not equal or exceed 1 livestock unit per hectare (b) the percentage of ploughed land must not exceed 7.8 per cent (c) family farm income must not exceed 80 per cent of national average (d) population must not exceed 27 per square kilometre (e) at least 30 per cent of working population must be engaged in agriculture.  These are cirteria set by the EC and it is completely unrealistic, as was suggested in this debate, to suggest that they be blithely ignored in a submission to the EC to have all of the country designated as disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture and <Col N="862" /> Food are at present processing the data obtained from two survey exercise on computer.  When that processing is completed, proposals will be submitted to the Government to approve the lists of areas deemed eligible according to EC criteria for inclusion or for reclassification.  It is hoped that this can be done before the end of 1989 and, following Government approval of the lists, we will immediately make a formal submission to the Commission.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to estimate how long it will take to obtain EC approval or when payments can be made in the new or reclassified areas.  Senators can rest assured, however, that we will make every effort to expedite EC approval and that the necessary funding for headage payments will be provided in due course.</P>
    <P>In addition to these horizontal steps, a number of regional measures have been operated in recent years, tailored to the specific requirements of Irish small farmers, such as the western drainage scheme.  The western package was extended further last year to provide for farmyard pollution control schemes and a scheme of grants to assist farmers in housing animals.  These schemes were designed with the needs of the small farmer in mind.  Earlier this year the pollution control and animal housing scheme was extended to the country as a whole by way of an operational programme approved by the EC Commission, and again the scheme is designed to meet the needs of the small farmer.</P>
    <P>It is fully accepted that, with changes in the CAP and restrictions on production in traditional sectors, there is a need to diversify agriculture and to assist farmers to engage in non-traditional enterprises. A first step in that direction was taken earlier this year with the introduction of an agri-tourism programme in the less-favoured areas.  This will be elaborated and expedited when the operational programme for rural development, at present being drawn up by the Department of Agriculture and Food, is launched, probably early next year. Meanwhile, of course, a pilot programme on integrated rural development is <Col N="863" /> already in operation in 12 selected areas throughout the country since October 1988.  On completion of this two-year programme, the Government will have gained valuable experience in the field of rural development and this will assist in determining how the policy is to be operated for the future.</P>
    <P>The importance of co-operatives in Ireland is evident from the fact that cumulatively they account for an annual turnover of well in excess of £2 billion. There is no doubt that they have had a profound influence on the development of Irish agriculture, particularly in the dairy sector.  The nature and extent of the changes which have occurred in the operation of the EC milk régime, notably the imposition of milk quotas, combined with the prospect of the completion of the internal market leaves our milk industry with no option but to reorganise itself. Rationalisation and reorganisation have been advocated not alone by the Government but by the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society in its publication <i>Strategy for the Irish Dairy Industry</i> published in 1987.  Ultimately, however, restructuring is a matter for determination by the industry itself but it should be remembered that restructuring is not an end in itself but rather a means to an end.  The object of the exercise must be to arrive at a situation where our milk industry can produce, process and market our national quota to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>The co-operatives have shown already that they are prepared to adapt to the changing and challenging circumstances and this is reflected in the exceptional performance of the dairy sector in recent years.  Nonetheless, I have no doubt that the co-operative movement realises that much remains to be done in the re-adaptation process and for the emergence of a revitalised and strengthened co-operative structure.</P>
    <P>An important issue raised in the debate has been the need to expand the beef cow herd.  We are making significant progress in this area.  After several years of decline I am delighted to see that the breeding herd is now on the increase.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="864" /> The attractive package of grants available for beef cattle will underpin further development.  This includes headage payments and the special beef premium.  The changes in the beef regime mean that we have to rely much more on the return from the market rather than on EC support. A particularly welcome development has been the special arrangement between some factories and farmers to produce once-calved heifers.  This is a great example of co-operation between farm and factory and I would like to see more initiatives in this area.</P>
    <P>In this period of rapid change we have emphasised to the Council of Ministers and to the Commission that the agreement to give special recognition for our beef industry must be implemented in full.  While cattle prices are not now as high as they were last year they are &mdash; with the assistance of some price supports &mdash; higher than they were in any other of the last five years.  With low inflation and high investment we are poised for national economic growth.  Against this background, the beef industry faces unique opportunities as the supply of calves from the increased breeding herd will be coming on stream in the run-up to 1992.</P>
    <P>We are, of course, participating constructively in the present Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations.  Along with our EC partners, we have made it very clear on numerous occasions that we are not prepared to abandon the basic principles of the CAP and the Community's capacity to maintain a viable rural society.</P>
    <P>The Community's attitude to the recent US paper, which has the general backing of the Cairns Group, is that this would be a retrograde step for the GATT negotiations and for the progress achieved in the April mid-term agreement. It is a turning back to the position adopted by the US at the mid-term review in Montreal.  It is difficult to assess why the US has produced such a controversial paper at this crucial stage of the negotiations.  They have said that it is a &ldquo;negotiating document&rdquo; so perhaps this can be exploited when the proposals from <Col N="865" /> all contracting parties, including the Community, are being examined with a view to deciding on the commitments which have to be made.  It is indeed difficult to see farmers' representatives in the US Congress accepting the scope of these proposals.  The Community for its part has already submitted proposals on short-term reform and the Commission is now working on a long-term paper. While the latter paper will obviously have to contain some difficult commitments, the Commission has repeatedly stated that the fundamental principles of the CAP cannot be called into question.</P>
    <P>Ireland has adopted a consistent approach throughout all of these negotiations in that we are prepared to undertake commitments as long as they do not undermine the fundamental mechanisms of the CAP, thus seriously affecting farmers' incomes and curtailing export trade; credit is obtained for the reform measures the Community has put in place in the last year; there are balanced commitments from all contracting parties.</P>
    <P>In addition, in our discussions with the Commission we have stressed the need for supply and price discipline on world markets if balance is to be sustained. We see little point in the Community continuing to cut production if other parties move in to take advanage of this situation and thus undermine world prices.</P>
    <P>The Community, both as a major exporter and importer, has a real interest in the liberalisation and stability of world trade and we recognise the need for reform.  We are confident that our producers, processors and traders have the ability to exploit the opportunities which will be available to them in a more liberalised and stable trading system.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food ensures that all the interests involved are kept informed of developments in the negotiations through the special GATT group which he established last year.</P>
    <P>Since the Commission's original tax proposals were formulated and presented <Col N="866" /> in 1987, progress has been slow.  Because the debate touches on sensitive economic, budgetary and social questions and because tax systems differ widely across the Community, it has not proved possible to achieve a consensus as yet on a definitive tax package.  Nevertheless, this is a key element of the total 1992 programme which will have to be pushed ahead with all possible speed.  Obviously, it will be one of the important dossiers on the negotiating table when Ireland assumes the Presidency in January next.</P>
    <P>As I have said, while progress to date has been slow, some useful work has been done since the Commission adopted a revised approach to harmonisation earlier this year.  Regular and intensive discussions have taken place under the French Presidency within a special <i>ad hoc</i> working group set up on the instructions of the Council of Finance Ministers in June last.  This signifies the urgency that attaches to the work.  Firms as well as Governments must have a firm basis on which to prepare for 1992.  Some advances have been made.  These have been in regard to the structure of the VAT system.</P>
    <P>The major decision taken by the Council of Ministers is to retain zero-VAT rating of exports instead of adopting the Commission proposal to tax all goods at the exporting country's rate.  This decision means that there will be no need for a clearing house mechanism to ensure that the appropriate tax is transferred to the country in which the goods are consumed.  This is a welcome move from the Government's point of view and, equally importantly, from the viewpoint of Irish exporters who were concerned about the impact of the Commission's proposal on their competitiveness.</P>
    <P>There is also general agreement that, both in relation to VAT and excises, effective control arrangements must be put in place to prevent tax evasion.  These arrangements must be consistent with the <Col N="867" /> need to reduce the burden of administration on both traders and tax authorities. Detailed work in this area will continue under the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>The latest discussions in the Council of Finance Ministers show that agreement on the thorny question of VAT rates is still difficult to achieve.  This is to be discussed again in December.  The whole question of rates of excise also requires detailed discussion on the basis of the new proposals, involving minimum rates of tax, from the Commission.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that harmonisation in the context of 1992 could involve an unsustainable revenue loss for Ireland.  This fact has been explained and elaborated upon in Council discussions and there is evidence that the extent of our problem is recognised both by our fellow members and by the Commission. There will be pressure on us to align our rates closely with those in the UK.  At the latest meeting of the Council of Finance Ministers it was agreed that the particular situation of Ireland will be the subject of specific arrangements on the basis of Commission proposals within the general tax harmonisation framework.  The Government will be endeavouring to ensure that these arrangements take full account of our special position while enabling us to participate effectively in the advance towards the single market.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased by the level of interest shown by Senators in this debate. Of course, this is not surprising given the central importance of the subject matter of the NESC report in our national life. As will be obvious from what I have said, I cannot agree with each and every one of the views expressed in the debate but, nevertheless, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all the contributors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I extend my gratitude to the Cathaoirleach for taking this matter on the Adjournment.  It is an extremely important matter from our point of view in Cork with regard to industrial development in the area.  I ask the Chair for permission to divide my time between Senator Dennis O'Donovan and, across the way, my friend, Senator Professor Tom Raftery.</P>
      <P>I welcome the decision of Sandoz to locate in Ringaskiddy because in my view it is vital that this application be successful, given the fact that it has been submitted to probably one of the most thorough and comprehensive impact studies ever produced by a chemical company in Ireland about to set up.  I would also like to emphasise the fact that the project itself and the impact study is totally in line with EC directive 85/337 which all of us are aware has not officially been adopted in this country but, hopefully, will before the year is out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect that is important in this debate is the fact that Sandoz has adopted <Col N="869" /> an open door policy.  It has invited all shades of opinion in the environmental society that pervades Ireland now, and particularly in Cork, to examine the proposals in detail.  Indeed, a criticism that has been levelled at the impact study is that it is short in detail and not exhaustive. In my view this is countermanded by the fact that the Sandoz executives were prepared to provide confidential information about the processes being used in the Sandoz plant to REMU, which is the UCC-based study group, to Cork County Council, to Eolas and indeed to the organisation which has publicly stated its opposition to the plant.  It must be clear to everybody that there is no wish on the part of this company to hide anything. There is a clear commitment to providing meaningful employment and high quality industry, that will also ensure proper protection of our environment.</P>
    <P>It can also be pointed out that the Sandoz company in choosing Ringaskiddy had very good reasons for doing so, because the necessary infrastructure was in place, that is, the water facilities, sewerage facilities and an excellent road infrastructure.  It would also be appropriate to point out that this company intends to utilise what is termed state of the art technology with regard to the disposal of all effluents, be they water or indeed atmospheric.</P>
    <P>Taking into account the problems associated with industry already in existence in Ringaskiddy, there are a number of important issues which should be clarified for people who have reservations about chemical plants in general and particularly about this plant.  That is that the BOD, or what they call the biochemical oxygen demand from this plant &mdash; and that relates to liquid effluent &mdash; is, in fact, about one-twentieth of some of the other companies already operating in the area.  That is exceptionally low for a plant of the size proposed.  In relation to pollution the area has historically been associated with nauseous odours, some odours, of course, from which in the past <Col N="870" /> and, indeed, now, all of us wish to dissociate ourselves.</P>
    <P>What is important about this plant is that they do not intend to use mercaptans, which have been the source of smells from other factories in the area.  I should also point out that using natural gas again decreases or minimises the emissions of sulphur dioxide to the atmosphere, something that would not happen with plants using oil.  These issues in themselves, technical issues as they are, should allay the fears of people living in the area and who previously held the opinion that no further chemical industries should be allowed into Ringaskiddy until the difficulties that are there at the moment had been eradicated.</P>
    <P>I think it would be disastrous if the Sandoz Company were blamed for the sins of others.  Indeed, I would say that the Sandoz Company should be complimented in that since they have come to Ireland they have called on all the other companies in the area to make monitoring results available.  May I compliment, in particular, Pen Chemicals, Pfizers and, indeed, the others who have responded to this call by ensuring that in future such information will be made available?  May I also use the opportunity to point out that those companies with whom nauseous odours are associated are also taking steps now to eradicate this problem?  It is only fair to point out that in the case of Pen Chemicals they are ploughing in £4 million to eradicate the problem and in the case of one other company we have an investment of £500,000 to bring it into line with EC Directive 85/337.</P>
    <P>I think it would be wrong of me to allow the occasion to pass without complimenting the Ringaskiddy Community Association who have acted extremely responsibly with regard to the establishment of this plant.  They showed great foresight in having organised a study through REMU to indicate clearly to the residents in that area what was entailed in the plant.  I am glad to say that the <Col N="871" /> report produced by these experts has indicated quite clearly that there will be no damage to the environment or, indeed, any damage to health.  It was a pleasure &mdash; and Senator Raftery was with me &mdash; to attend a meeting of 400 people in the Ringaskiddy area who were proindustry and who gave vent to their feelings on how they wish an industry such as this would come into the area.  Indeed, it was gratifying that last weekend a poll conducted in the area was positive in the extreme; it was 60 to 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>I would also like to compliment the Sandoz Company for one other feature that I think is vitally important to residents in that area.  Through FÁS and the IDA they have now set out an assessment of school leaving patterns in the area and also they have established the number of unemployed people in that area.  They have given a commitment for the future that, where all other things are equal, they will do their damndest to give local employment.  I think this is one of the criticisms local people have expressed in the past, that they have got all the smells but none of the jobs.  It is very gratifying to hear that, in the case of Sandoz, this will not happen.</P>
    <P>I do not deny the right of people to ask questions, to be concerned about their environment, to demand an open door policy from chemical industries operating in Ireland and, indeed, in the harbour area.  In fact, I support them.  What I do not support, however, is emotional statements, which have not been backed up by scientific facts, emanating from many groups in the past.  My hope is that when this application is being processed people will judge it on its merits rather than make spurious claims.</P>
    <P>I would like also to use the opportunity to make this suggestion to the press.  I suggest to them that surely editorial balance should not allow anybody without proper credentials to accuse the chemical industry without having justified claims. In the Cork area in the past we have seen <Col N="872" /> people standing up and making the case that there is an increased incidence of cancer tumours in people in the Cork harbour area.  It is of note that the Southern Tumour Registry, which is in the closing stages of making a report on this issue, took the most unusual step of publishing an interim statistical report totally in contradiction with the claims that were made.</P>
    <P>As far as industry in Cork, is concerned it is worth noting that there are 60 major chemical companies in this country currently employing 12,000 people.  They have shown an increase in output which has led to increased exports over the last ten years of 10 per cent per year.  Currently they each spend £500 million in Ireland and contribute over £75 million per annum.  If we take the case of one Cork company alone, Pfizers, that company this year alone contributed £36 million to the economy, £22 million of which was spent in the Cork region.</P>
    <P>I think the people in Ringaskiddy have safeguards in that the Government have now produced an international study to examine the water quality and the air emissions in that area.  I am aware that other studies have taken place which clearly indicate that the quality in Cork harbour has improved since the last study was carried out by O'Sullivans.  The time has now come when we, as responsible citizens, who are trying to bring employment into this country for the many people who are unemployed, should call on the colleges of technology, the RTCs, the universities the employers and, indeed, the trade unions, to speak out on behalf of this industry and to give it the welcome that it deserves in Cork.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief. I would like to support my colleague, Senator O'Keeffe, in his very carefully prepared and deliberate speech in relation to the Sandoz industry in Cork. I am also cognisant that my colleague, Senator Raftery, wishes to speak on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fortunately or unfortunately, over the <Col N="873" /> last couple of months Cork has become the epicentre of debate on the pharmaceutical and chemical industry not alone in Cork but generally throughout Ireland. There seems to be a broad belief, which is being spurred on by what I would see to be a very small minority of people, that this type of industry is not welcome not alone in Cork city and that area of Ringaskiddy but throughout Cork county and indeed throughout Ireland.  I am indeed very concerned about the environment generally.  But it should be noted that the people in County Cork and the general city area, particularly around the Ringaskiddy area and Little Island, do not want industry down there at any cost. We would like to see industry there that is concerned about the environment. Sandoz in their approach to this type of industry have created history and have established a new milestone in that they have come into this area seeking local support before even submitting a planning application to Cork County Council.</P>
    <P>I think it is also of historic importance that the community in Ringaskiddy decided to have their own referendum in the Ringaskiddy area.  The community came together without any political initiative, totally on their own, and had a referendum whereby they decided that, as far as they were concerned as a local community, they would welcome Sandoz, subject, of course, to proper planning controls, air emission controls, etc.  We have seen in the Cork region recently where any type of industry, particularly anything to do with pharmaceuticals or chemicals, has been knocked on the head.  We had, in my view, a tragic and unfortunate situation in the east Cork area where a company, Merell Dow, eventually decided not to set up there, where every hurdle possible was put in their path.</P>
    <P>We have a situation in Bantry Bay where there is an on-going extreme lobby by a small group against the proposed reopening of the oil terminal which, for a <Col N="874" /> period of almost two decades, represented the economic and commercial viability of that peninsular area of west Cork.  This is an unfortunate position in so far as that it may go abroad that the public in Cork are anti-industry.  What we say down there is that we wish to see industry, but not at any cost; that the Sandoz application is the foundation for a new approach, where the public are consulted, where the local community have a say.  Subsequent to that, the company, obviously, have to apply to Cork County Council.  That application is current and <i>sub judice.</i>  We have a situation and it must be overcome, where a small lobby have extreme views about the environment.  We are all concerned about the environment, but these people are extremists and use every system to try to block and to stymie industrial development not alone in Cork but in other areas.</P>
    <P>There is the initial step of applying to the local authority for planning permission. Subsequently, there may be an appeal to An Bord Pleanála, oral hearings, High Court, Supreme Court and possibly European Court appeals.  This is unfortunate.  There must be a balance. Sandoz have provided a balance in Cork. As has been outlined by the previous speaker, there is a new approach, which must be welcomed, where the community have a say.  They have had their say, they have voted in favour of the setting up of this industry.  Cork and Munster need employment, need jobs.  Once these jobs are provided with suitable controls to safeguard the environment generally and to comply with local authority and planning reglations they must be welcomed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pleasure for me to co-operate with Senators O'Keeffe and O'Donovan on this issue.  I welcome the proposal to build the Sandoz pharmaceutical plant in Ringaskiddy subject, of course, to conditions no less restrictive than they operate under in their home country of Switzerland and also provided, of course, that the regulatory authority <Col N="875" /> of the county council would be given adequate resources to monitor and enforce the conditions.</P>
      <P>As a peripheral nation with the highest transport cost to the central markets in Europe it makes good economic sense for us to concentrate on the high-tech, low volume, high value products such as pharmaceuticals and electronics which would be better able to withstand the transport costs to our main markets in central Europe.  Furthermore, we have the required resources, plentiful supply of highly trained young people plus space, excellent water supply, an excellent working environment, to make a success of these high-tech industries, especially in the Cork harbour region and principally in Ringaskiddy which was developed specifically for such industry at a cost in excess of £100 million or nearer to £200 million in present day values of money.  Despite this heavy cost and despite having one of the world's finest natural harbours in Cork, we have only a handful of industries to show for our huge investment.</P>
      <P>The chemical industries already located there are very profitable and for the most part are clean and environmental friendly.  Regrettably, some industries regularly release odours which cause great irritation among local residents who get little satisfaction from these companies or, indeed, from the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chemical industries, too, have been too secretive in the past, thus giving rise to all sorts of fears and suspicions.  In this sort of atmosphere it was not surprising that considerable hostility has begun to build up against new chemical industry coming into the area, culminating in the deplorable debacle witnessed in the case of the Merell Dow plant proposed for Killagh, where the decisions of all the relevant organs of the State, county council, Bord Pleanála, EOLAS and even the High Court, were brushed aside by a hysterical pressure <Col N="876" /> group led by a well-heeled minority. Unfortunately, it was given moral support by some irresponsible politicians who had more of an eye on the ballot box than they had on the welfare of the area and its people.  It was an inappropriate site in any case but that being said, the decision had been made.</P>
    <P>Against this background it is imperative that the Sandoz application should succeed.  Fortunately, it has got off to a very good start as Senator O'Keeffe pointed out.  The company have been completely open with information and the residents of Ringaskiddy examined the proposal in a calm and responsible atmosphere, calling upon outside objective bodies such as University College, Cork to help them in formulating their stance on the Sandoz proposals.  Like Senator O'Keeffe, I congratulate the residents for the manner in which they approached this proposal and I am greatly relieved that they have voted by a majority to approve the location of Sandoz in Ringaskiddy.  Failure to approve the proposal could well make the task of the Industrial Development Authority in attracting significant chemical companies to Cork in future well-nigh impossible.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Sandoz proposal and I further welcome the vote in favour of Sandoz by the Ringaskiddy residents.  Let us hope that the project will not be unduly delayed by objections and that Sandoz will become the flagship which will help to attract many more of the high-tech industries we so urgently need to stem the flow of emigration and to reduce the unemployment rate in Cork city and its environs which is among the highest in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing to this debate and I want to thank the Senators, particularly the new Senators, Senators Denis O'Donovan, Batt O'Keeffe and Tom Raftery.  Senator Larry McMahon is not a new Senator <Col N="877" /> but I want to compliment him on his ingenuity and courage in the way he made his way back into the Seanad.  Very well done.</P>
      <P>The recent Merell Dow experience has highlighted the fact that industrial policy and promotion cannot be compartmentalised and separated from environmental issues, that the fact of the matter is that if we are to be successful in our industrial job creation drive, local residents in areas where industry is to be sited will have to be satisfied that the local and national economic benefits which these projects bring are not outweighed by their potential environmental disadvantages.  In other words, we need jobs but no matter how badly we need them we are not for and we cannot have jobs at all costs as a basis for industrial policy.  What we must do now is to learn from the Merell Dow experience and, indeed, from the experience of some maverick industries which we have had in the past.  We certainly do not want to be the mudguard of Europe or any other part of the world for the dumping of dirty industries.</P>
      <P>I want to place it on record that as far as I am concerned and as far as the Government are concerned it is vital that the Sandoz project goes ahead not just for the very substantial benefits that it brings in its own right but because of the impact that a negative decision on its part could have on our future job creation drive, especially in Cork but nationally also.  In this context, Sandoz will locate in an area long designated precisely for industrial purposes, that is, in Ringaskiddy and is to be commended for the open and receptive way in which it has dealt with and is dealing with the concerns of the residents in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the Government's intention that this project will adhere to the highest environmental standards and I know the company are at one with us in that objective. In fact in the overall cost of this project which is running up to £200 million, £27 million has been earmarked for <Col N="878" /> environmental protection measures and that is the scale and size of the seriousness which the company are putting into environmental protection measures.</P>
    <P>For that reason, the Government fully support the project and are most keen to see that it proceeds.  The maintenance of a clear natural environment is important for its own sake, because it influences our quality of life, and because of its importance to our most important natural resource industries, tourism and the food sector.  I am particularly interested in the food sector and its development and particularly the clean and pure environment in which food is produced.  I have no difficulty in supporting the Sandoz project or projects which adhere to the strict conditions laid down and developing in harmony with an agricultural and food industry in this country.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, concern about the environmental issue is fully justified and is, in fact, helpful in ensuring that it receives a priority which it may not have had in the past.</P>
    <P>As you know the <i>Programme for Government</i> on which we are now embarked has led to the establishment of the Office for the Protection of the Environment, which is led by Minister of State, Deputy Harney, and to a commitment to the establishment of an independent environmental protection agency.  This agency will be empowered to monitor and enforce, nationally and uniformly, compliance with anti-pollution regulations.  I am sure my Cork colleagues, particularly, would suggest to the Minister, the Department and to the Government that it might be a good idea, as we have the headquarters of the pharmaceutical and chemical industry in Cork, that this particular agency might be set up and established there.  There is nobody from Cork objecting to that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the new agency as <Col N="879" /> having a critical role to play in underpinning public confidence in environmental protection because of its unique focus on this task.  The Government anticipate that it will be up and running next year.  Public confidence must also be supported by greater openness on the part of industry and a greater responsiveness to environmental issues on the part of public authorities and public agencies generally.</P>
      <P>I have already indicated the Government's view that industrial development and environmental policy are inextricably linked.  For this reason, the IDA and SFADCo have been instructed to increase the priority which they attach to the environmental behaviour of companies in receipt of industrial grants.  This is because the Government take the view that insistence on clean industry is the only viable approach to industrial development in the last decade of this century.</P>
      <P>Obviously, the Sandoz decision to locate in Ringaskiddy, which both I and the Government particularly welcome and support, focuses attention on the situation relating to industry and the environment in that area, and especially relating to the chemical and pharmaceutical industry given the nature of the Sandoz product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have, of course, been many claims, some of them spurious, some without any scientific basis whatsoever. In particular, there was a claim about the incidence of cancer in the Cork harbour area allegedly deriving from some of the chemical/pharmaceutical operations there.  I want to point out that where objective studies have been carried out, as was done by the Statistics Department of UCC under the direction of Dr. Michael Crowley, a distinguished academic from UCC of the highest integrity, that study showed that not alone was there not a higher incidence in the area but, in fact, it was found that a lower <Col N="880" /> incidence of the disease occurred in that area.</P>
    <P>A couple of weeks ago, the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, announced that a major study of the effluents and emissions discharged by existing industrial development in the Ringaskiddy area of County Cork is to be carried out by international consultants.  The study is designed to address the public perception that some of these industries are not meeting acceptable standards and are not being effectively monitored.  The study will be commissioned and funded by the Department of the Environment.  Proposals for carrying it out are being invited from firms of international consultants who have first-hand knowledge of the matters at issue.  In particular, the consultants will be required to have practical experience of process and pollution abatement technologies for the industrial sectors concerned, expertise in monitoring systems, and familiarity with relevant international standards.  It is expected that the work will get under way towards the end of the year and be completed early in the New Year.</P>
    <P>The intention is that the consultants' report will be made available to the firms concerned and to all other interests concerned with the environment and development in the Ringaskiddy area.</P>
    <P>In particular, the report will serve as a basis for the review by Cork County Council and the new environmental protection agency of the standards and conditions imposed under the Water Pollution and Air Pollution Acts in relation to the plant and facilities concerned. The Minister of State expects that these standards and conditions would be amended, as appropriate, to bring them into line with the recommendations made by the consultants.  The monitoring régimes which are relied on to check compliance with environmental standards would also be improved or extended in line with the recommendations.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with the environmental <Col N="881" /> initiatives the Government are taking at both national and regional level, it is worth recalling that the word &ldquo;environment&rdquo; can be defined as &ldquo;the external conditions in which a person lives&rdquo;. Clearly, this refers not just to the right to green fields or clean air.  A person's environment is also fundamentally determined and affected by his ability to get a job, to earn a decent wage and to provide a reasonable standard of living for his family.  This side of the environmental issue must be brought back into the mainstream of the debate on industry and the environment.  While we want a clean environment, we do not in Ireland want to end up as a national park, of interest only to visitors from mainland Europe and others throughout the world, but with no jobs for our own people.</P>
    <P>This country needs jobs and Sandoz will bring them, both at the construction stage where it is estimated that 300 people will be employed for five years and on a continuing basis in respect of 250 permanent, high quality jobs and a further 150 to 200 jobs indirectly, and many more jobs and firms maintained in the area in ancillary industries.</P>
    <P>The proposed facility at Rinaskiddy is for the manufacture of the active ingredients of drugs for medical preparations, specifically sandimmun, peptides and fine chemicals.  These drugs, of course, are widely used in Ireland and throughout the world for the prevention of transplant rejection, in particular.  In an unrefined form it will be isolated at a Sandoz affiliated plant abroad and brought as a solid to Ireland for purification.  Peptides are complex proteins or chains of amino acids and the Cork plant is designed to produce seven named peptides.  In addition, a variety of pharmaceutical compounds or fine chemicals will be produced by conventional chemical manufacturing methods.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that all of the drug ingredients now proposed for manufacture in Cork have already been manufactured abroad, principally at the <Col N="882" /> Sandoz plant in Basle.  Equally, I note from the EOLAS environmental impact study on the proposed Sandoz facility that the company has never experienced problems of fire, explosion or environmental pollution from the manufacture of these products and that the pharmaceutical division of Sandoz has an excellent safety record.</P>
    <P>In adverting to this, it cannot be denied that the Sandoz agro division experienced a disastrous fire in 1986, well-highlighted in the newspapers, at a warehouse upstream from Basle on the Rhine.  In fighting the fire with water, agro-chemicals were flushed into the Rhine, causing a massive fish kill and contamination of the bed of the river.  Following this, the company adopted a new environmental policy which, <i>inter alia</i>, has lead to Sandoz receiving permission from the authorities in Basle to start construction of a Sandoz purification plant and a peptide synthesis plant similar in capacity and design to those proposed for Cork.</P>
    <P>This is reassuring but it is more relevant to quote some of the statements in the EOLAS environmental impact assessment. Thus, for example, the design of the chemical storage arrangements are based on guidelines which represent the very best international practice.  The potential of industrial facilities to use major accident hazards is controlled by EC Directive 82/501/EEC and the Sandoz facility does not possess the criteria which would classify it as a major accident hazard under that directive. Equally, the proposed chemical usage list does not include any substance contained in list 1 of the EC Directive on Dangerous Substances in the Aquatic Environment. Nor does it include heavy metal compounds or highly odorous sulphur chemicals such as mercaptans.</P>
    <P>EOLAS consider that the Sandoz proposal to use incinerators represents the best technology for destruction of organic vapour and liquids and the incinerator will be fitted with a range of fail-safe <Col N="883" /> equipment to prevent operation unless conditions are correct.</P>
    <P>The foregoing is not meant to represent an exhaustive inventory of the environmental aspects of Sandoz.  Rather, it is a brief indication of the results of a detailed and intensive assessment of their plans for Ringaskiddy.  It reflects well on the company and their willingness to do and be seen to do everything possible to reassure the residents in the vicinity of the proposed facility; in other words, to be good neighbours to their own industry, to the general industry and to the residents in the area in particular.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this open and co-operative attitude, combined with the conditions which will be laid down by Cork County Council, particularly in the <Col N="884" /> light of the consultancy study being commissioned by the Department of the Environment, will lay the groundwork for the establishment of an operation which will be of immense benefit to the local and national economy, and which will represent a flagbearer for our future industrial job creation drive.</P>
    <P>Taken with the fact that the new environmental protection agency will be up and running well before Sandoz commences production, the Ringaskiddy residents had every reason for confidence in voting in favour of the establishment of the Sandoz plant in their area.  Let me conclude by reiterating that both I and the Government heartily endorse that vote of the Ringaskiddy residents.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 30 November 1989.</P>
