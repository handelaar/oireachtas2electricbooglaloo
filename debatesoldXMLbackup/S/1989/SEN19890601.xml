      <P>I have notice from Senator Joe O'Toole that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The provision of a schools psychological service for primary schools and, in particular, the provision of a psychological referral service for the west county Dublin area.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator David Norris of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to give a categorical assurance that in the reorganisation of the Dublin hospital situation and the eventual absorption of the Adelaide Hospital into the new hospital at Tallaght the different ethical approach embodied in that hospital's tradition will not be overwhelmed by the dominant ethos of the Catholic ethical committees.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators O'Toole and Norris as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matter raised by Senator O'Toole and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>It is intended to take all Stages of items Nos. 1 and 2.  Because of the almost identical nature of items Nos. 1 and 2, it is proposed that both of these Bills, for the purposes of debate, shall be taken together and that item No. 2, the Dublin City University Bill, will be brought to a conclusion by one question which shall be put by the Chair.  This means that when item No. 1 has been passed, item No. 2 will be put to the House, without further discussion, by one question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The first question I should like to address to the Leader of the House is a technical one, and perhaps he may be able to throw some light on it, and that is the question of the single vote to which he referred on the two university Bills.  The reason I raise this is that I will be expressing some concern about one of the Bills, in particular, about the naming of the new university, which I very much welcome, because of a possible confusion between Dublin University, whose graduates I have the honour to represent, and the Dublin City University.  This is a matter of some concern to me and I hope to have the opportunity to vote separately on that Bill.  Although I welcome both Bills, I would have considerable hesitation about one of them.</P>
      <P>There is a second question I should like to ask the Leader of the House.  In the light of the very welcome indication from the Cathaoirleach that this will not be the last sitting of this Seanad &mdash; I hope we will meet next week &mdash; can he say when he will provide time for a debate on the Middle East in respect of which there is general agreement among all shades of opinion in the House that this is an important matter to be discussed.  Finally, a Chathaoirligh, I would like to ask if you have any news for me from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on a matter that I raised here and was directed by you to bring to that committee on a matter of what I thought to be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>My representatives had very considerable difficulties in extracting any satisfactory answer whatever from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, a Chathaoirligh, as you have regularly pointed out to me and as we have agreed on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, &mdash; I was Senator Norris's representative there &mdash; I do not have the authority of the committee to represent to him the discussions of the committee until decisions are taken and such time is appropriate.  So, if you are now giving&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Actually it is the Order of Business we are discussing and the lack of material on the Order of Business. Certainly, we have waited long enough for the university Bills to come before us. We are delighted to welcome them.  I might compliment the Government on having got through that business.  Of course, it is also indicative of the power which other people wield over the ordering of Business of this House.  I have <Col N="2170" /> taken the trouble to go back over the various commitments given us by the Leader of the House on the Order of Business over a long period.  I know this is hardly music to the ears of the Government side of the House.</P>

      <P>I am shocked that my learned friends on the other side should turn this Chamber into a Punch and Judy show every morning on the Order of Business.  It is a national scandal.  We should be discussing the business of the nation instead of turning it into a political football.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking that the Leader of the House would respond to the commitments he has given in recent times.  I will mention some only.  One was a commitment that we would deal with the Central Bank Bill, 1988 with the Building Societies Bill 1988, a commitment that we would finish and dispose <Col N="2171" /> of the Criminal Justice [Forensic Evidence] Bill, 1989; a commitment that he would deal with the report dealing with libel law and make regulations; a commitment that he would have a discussion on Palestine and the Middle Eastern position. I can continue; I have made a list of the commitments which were given by the Leader of the House.  In deference to you, a Chathaoirligh I do not intend to go through each and every one of them, detailing the quote, commitment and promise.  But the promises offered and the commitments given now fall by the wayside.  It is not good enough, is unacceptable and is unacceptable to the dignity of the House.  Those who spoke from the far side should indicate to me how they feel about promises given which have not been honoured.  Those are the issues.</P>
      <P>In addition, we are now faced, for the second week running, with the Independent group in the House not having their Private Members' time.  I refer to Item No. 6 on the Order of Business &mdash; the Criminal Justice (Abolition of Death Penalty) Bill, 1987.</P>
      <P>I also want to put on the record today that I absolutely reject the way in which we have been treated, despite solemn undertakings given to us of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, by a report which is accepted by this House, that the Leader of the House, without reference to or consultation with any person or any group, decided to change what was agreed by this House.  In other words, the decisions of the House now stand for nothing.</P>

      <P>For that reason I have to, protest most strongly and emphasise apparent Government fear of discussion of the abolition of the death penalty.  I would propose, as an amendment to the Order of Business today, that Item No. 6, the Criminal Justice (Abolition of Death Penalty) Bill, 1987, be added.</P>

      <P>Just a request with regard <Col N="2172" /> to the Order of Business.  Two different Governments have promised us the Children Bill which we have not received to date.  We are afforded an opportunity now; the Seanad is still in session.  As far as I know the Bill has been prepared.  I would ask the Leader of the House if he would contact the Minister responsible to ascertain whether he could introduce this very important, detailed and complex Bill so that we might tease out its provisions in the Seanad while we wait the reassembly of the Dáil.</P>

At the risk of repeating myself, I wish to protest in the strongest possible terms at the breach of a solemn agreement which was made between the parties in this House.

      <P>There is a history to item No. 6.  That is why it is being proposed as an amendment to the Order of Business today.  As Senator J.

I suspect he got orders from somebody.</P>

      <P>Senator Byrne talked about a Punch and Judy show.  I am not sure who is Punch and who is Judy.  It gives none of us on the Independent benches any pleasure to see this House begin in a disorderly way.  It may well appeal to the flippancy of certain of the Members opposite to make smart remarks about our demands to have serious business discussed in this House but I want to say one thing quite simply. When Senators O'Toole, Ross, Norris and I were struggling through the Committee Stage of the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987, with the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy Brennan, for weeks on end with hardly a reporter in the House, with not a word of the discussion reported &mdash; and I would not expect it &mdash; there was nobody shouting about our Punch and Judy show.  We had close on 100 amendments to that Bill many of which were <Col N="2175" /> introduced by the Government, some of which were introduced by this side of the House and many of which were accepted. We were here doing the business of this House without publicity and without notice because it was our duty to do so. It is also our duty to defend the dignity of this House, that is what I intend to do but those people on the Government side want to use it as a political football for a general election.  I like being in this House.</P>

      <P>It gives me very great pleasure to bring these two measures, the University of Limerick Bill and the Dublin City University Bill, before the House.  The high international standing of Irish graduates is something of which all Governments can be justly proud.  As we enter the post-industrial information era, the quality of education assumes a strategic importance for Ireland's continued economic and social development. Ireland looks to its people as its prime national resource and during the past 20 years or so a sustained commitment has been made to the development of education at all levels.  As a result, Irish graduates are recognised both at home and abroad as people capable of competing with the best in the sciences, technology, business and the arts.</P>
      <P>It can be argued that the monasteries of Ireland were the precursors of the medieval university as seats of learning and scholarship.  However, the University at Bologna, established in the 12th century, and, then, Paris are generally regarded as the first of the medieval universities.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to contrast the development of Bologna <i>vis-à-vis</i> Paris.  This contrast in the origins of each and their controlling influences was to be echoed in the 1968 student democracy movements and in more recent debates concerning the control of universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2179" /> The founding students of the University of Bologna were mature students with clear vocational-professional ambitions.  Eventually those students formed themselves into unions which became the essence of the governing structure of that university.  It is interesting to note that this seminal importance of the mature student is beginning to be re-echoed in the emerging attention and importance in the 1980s of the mature student and of professional, continuing education for university education.</P>
    <P>Paris was born of the Scholasticism movement, the preoccupation of French intellectual life of the 12th century, and of the reputation of the great scholar-teacher Abelard.  This was one of a number of features which distinguished Bologna from Paris, the study of law being pre-eminent at Paris.  They also differed in their governing structures, in that the University of Paris was, essentially, under the control of the professors. Subsequently established universities adopted one or other of the two governing models represented by Bologna and Paris.</P>
    <P>It is also interesting to note that the term &ldquo;university&rdquo; is not the original term to describe that form of institution; rather, the original term is <i>studium generale</i> and, as asserted by Rashdall in his definitive study &ldquo;The Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>the term <i>(studium generale)</i> means, not a place where all subjects are studied, but a place where students from all parts were received.  As a matter of fact, very few medieval studia possessed all the faculties.</P>
    <P>The emergence of the ERASMUS programme of the European Community, in recent years, with its emphasis on the exchange of students and academic staff between colleges and across national boundaries is, in an interesting way, a return to the origins &mdash; in that respect &mdash; of our modern universities.</P>
    <P>Rashdall asserts further:</P>
    <P>The notion that a university means <Col N="2180" /> a <i>universitas facultatum</i>&mdash; a school in which all the faculties or branches of knowledge are represented &mdash; has, indeed, long since disappeared from the pages of professional historians; but it is still persistently foisted upon the public by writers with whom history is subordinate to what may be called intellectual edification.  However imposing and stimulating may be the conception of an institution for teaching or for the cultivation of universal knowledge, however imperative the necessity of such an institution in modern times, it is one which can gain little support from the facts of history.&rdquo; And &ldquo;In the earliest period it (University) is never used absolutely.  The phrase, is always &ldquo;University of scholars ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Whatever the origin of the term &ldquo;University&rdquo; the history of its development makes for fascinating reading.</P>
    <P>The founding of the University of Dublin and the granting of the charter to Trinity College in 1952 marked the commencement of the modern university tradition in Ireland.  Earlier attempts to establish universities, notably by the Church, dating back to the early 14th century, proved unsuccessful.  St. Patrick's College Maynooth, was founded by an Act of Parliament in 1795 primarily as a seminary for training for the Catholic priesthood.  Thereafter, consideration of the role of Government in higher education brings to light many notable names of history.  Sir Robert Peel's Government produced the Queen's colleges scheme in 1845; Gladstone, a Liberal Prime Minister, attempted in 1873 to resolve the thorny problem of university education in Ireland but opposition to his Bill was such that it never passed into law; Disraeli's University Act of 1879 set up the Royal University as an examining body with power to confer degrees on all who passed its precribed examinations.  The early 1900s saw two royal commissions on higher education in Ireland and in 1908 the Irish Universities Act was passed.  This Act established the <Col N="2181" /> National University of Ireland as a federal university with constituent colleges at Dublin, Cork and Galway.  In 1910, St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, became a recognised college of the university.  The 1908 Act has stood the test of time and, indeed, up to now, no new university has been established since the foundation of the State.  This fact, among other things, reflects the prudent caution with which the title university is conferred in this country.</P>
    <P>The successful economic and social development programmes adopted by Government in the sixties led to the recognition that further growth would depend on a programme of major investment in education.  This strategy led to an extensive primary and post-primary school building programme.  The 1967 report of the Steering Committee on Technical Education formed the basis for the establishment of a network of regional technical colleges.  These colleges were to complement the existing colleges of technology in Dublin in offering technical and technological education to provide the skills needed for a country and economy which was becoming increasingly industrialised.</P>
    <P>It was felt, however, that there was an absence of a sufficiently strong emphasis on technological education at university level and the establishment of the National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick in the early seventies was, therefore, a significant step forward.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education of the day, Deputy Brian Lenihan, spoke of his vision for the NIHE and his expectation that it would be a new initiative, of which the country would be proud.</P>
    <P>The call for a university in Limerick, as well all know, goes back to the mid-19th century.  The gentleman, Pierce Shannon, then Mayor of Limerick, packed his traps and went to England with a deputation to press their case for a university for Limerick, but they came back with nothing.  They tried and that quest has been going on ever since then. In the sixties the Limerick University Project again took up the call in a very vigorous and sustained way.  At that time <Col N="2182" /> a clear and coherent case was presented for the siting of a university in Limerick and the objective was pursued with enthusiasm, a factor which in no small way influenced the decision to establish the first National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick.  The autumn of 1972 saw the first students enrolled in NIHE, Limerick in programmes in business, engineering, the humanities and science.</P>
    <P>The genesis of NIHE Dublin is to be found in a set of decisions about restructuring the higher education system made by the then Government in 1974.  It is instructive to remember that in relation to NIHE Dublin it was stated that it should be a recognised college of the National University of Ireland with a capacity to develop into a constituent college or to become an autonomous degree-awarding institution.  It is worth noting too that in 1862 a site was purchased in Drumcondra in Dublin to establish a university on the north side of the city and indeed the foundation stone of this university was actually laid.  That sounds a bit like something that would happen during a general election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>NIHE have now seen the fruits of their endeavours.  The initiative to have universities in Limerick and north Dublin, therefore, goes back to the mid 19th century and I am pleased that these long-standing ambitions are about to be fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the early years of NIHE Limerick qualifications were conferred by the National University of Ireland of which it was a recognised college.  With the development of third level education in institutions in the non-university sector in the late sixties and early seventies, the need for a national system for awards in such institutions was recognised.  In December 1968, the Higher Education Authority were requested to investigate the question of the establishment of such a national accreditation system.  As a <Col N="2183" /> result, the National Council for Educational Awards were set up in 1972.  The council were statutorily established in 1979 with power to award certificates, diplomas and degrees following courses of study outside the universities.  Since then the council have awarded their qualifications to the students from the two NIHEs and indeed played an important role in their development to become the renowned institutions both nationally and internationally which they are today. The two institutes were themselves established on a statutory basis under the NIHE, Limerick, Act, 1980 and the NIHE, Dublin, Act, 1980.</P>
    <P>The national institutes, so established, were challenged to develop programmes of teaching and research at international standards equivalent to those of the established universities, while giving special attention to Ireland's emerging needs in the fields of science, technology and business.</P>
    <P>The Government, on the advice of the Higher Education Authority, wished to ensure that there would also be a significant element of the humanities present, and from the outset programmes of study commenced, not only in science, engineering and business, but also in the arts.  Indeed, Ireland's first arts degree in European studies commenced in Limerick in 1972.  Degree programmes in communications and in languages and a post-graduate programme in journalism were developed in the NIHE Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is now 16 years since the first students were admitted to the national institute in Limerick, and nine years since they were admitted to the national institute in Dublin.  Since then both bodies have emerged as institutions of high standing both nationally and internationally.  Time has permitted their graduates to demonstrate their abilities in a wide range of disciplines from the arts to the sciences, and at the highest academic level up to and including the doctorate.</P>
    <P>The recognition of the achievements of the NIHEs is well known to parents and students and is reflected in the high level of competition for admission, the high <Col N="2184" /> quality of those students admitted and by the high demand for graduates.  The breadth and depth of their academic standing is also attested to by the success with which they pursue post-graduate study at other universities both within European Community countries and further afield.</P>
    <P>The NIHEs have played their anticipated role in stimulating economic development, introducing educational innovation and, indeed, have been both directly and indirectly responsible for a wide range of new enterprises which has been attracted to this country, or been created by their graduates.</P>
    <P>Some years ago it was proposed to Government that they should consider conferring a more appropriate title and granting the right to award degrees to the NIHEs clearly defining the university level standing of the NIHEs internationally. In order to rigorously establish the justification for such a proposal, a distinguished group of national and international experts were invited to examine the standing of both NIHEs and to advise the Government on the proposal to combine both NIHEs into a national technological university.  I must publicly commend and congratulate the thoroughness with which the group pursued its terms of reference.  This, on reflection, was not surprising when one considers the membership of the group: Chairman: T.P. Hardiman, BE, BSc, CEng, FIEI, MRIA, Chairman, Investment Bank of Ireland.  Deputy Chairman: M.J. MacCormac, MA, MComm, DEconSc, FCCA Emeritus Professor of Business Administration, University College, Dublin.  Members: Dr. R.E.D. Bishop, CBE, PhD, ScD, DSc (Eng), FEng, FRS, Vice-Chancellor, Brunel University and Vice-President of the Royal Society.  Dr. O.H.G. Mahrenholtz, Ing, DSc (Eng), VDI, Technische Universitat Hamburg, Hamburg, Vice-President, Deutsche Forschungagemeinschaft; Dr. D.T. Wright, BASc, MS, Phd, FCAE, PEng, President, University of Waterloo.</P>
    <P>Submissions were received from 29 <Col N="2185" /> institutions or groups; the group themselves visited institutions and met 23 groups in all during the course of their work.</P>
    <P>It was entirely proper that the study group adopted as their basic strategy &ldquo;that academic considerations were central to its work in the examination of the case for university status for NIHE Dublin and Limerick&rdquo;.  Among the many issues which they examined were the teaching, research and other scholarly work undertaken by the NIHEs; the depth of scientific background and the breadth and extent of disciplines and subjects &mdash; of narrowness and broadness of academic approach &mdash; were also matters which they examined and commented upon.  Other issues which were raised in submissions and in meetings with the group were analysed and fully dealt with.</P>
    <P>The study group concluded that the NIHEs &ldquo;are sufficiently scholarly to merit university status&rdquo;, and &ldquo;the standards of scholarship are as high as one would associate with universities&rdquo;.  In short, the study group's unambiguous findings have established that both NIHEs clearly operate at university level and fully justify the conferring of university status. Furthermore, the team recognised that the range of activities within both NIHEs encompassed not only the sciences, technology and business, but also the arts, and concluded very definitively that the National Technological University title would not, therefore, adequately reflect this comprehensive range.</P>
    <P>Other recommendations were made which would have an effect on the overall third level education system here.  Some of these recommendations would require the introduction of new legislation and I am pleased to say that this legislation is at present being prepared to give effect to the recommendation that the regional technical colleges should be given a greater degree of autonomy.  The Government also set up an interdepartmental committee to undertake an in-depth examination of the overall organisation of third level education, including the form of funding and the <Col N="2186" /> possibilities for some rationalisation of the system.</P>
    <P>In particular, however, the group's recommendation that both NIHE, Dublin and NIHE, Limerick, be conferred with full university status with power to award degrees, diplomas and certificates, has been given full and careful consideration by the Government culminating in their decision to accept the recommendations and introduce the proposals contained in the Bills before the House.  The Government decision after careful scrutiny of the technological education report, from which I will quote later, was taken in January, and announced in January.  Since then we have been dealing with the legislation and the preparation of it, culminating in the passage in the Dáil last week of these Bills and their introduction here today and I hope to see their successful passage here.</P>
    <P>The Government are deeply conscious of the historic nature of the proposals in view of the fact that these two new universities will be the first to be established since the foundation of the State. We are also conscious of the clear benefits which will derive from the enactment of this legislation.  It will convey to the international community Ireland's seriousness regarding industrial and business development in an increasingly competitive world; it will serve to emphasise the importance which Ireland attaches to excellence in learning and it will highlight the capability of Ireland's higher education sector.  The establishment of the new universities represents a further underlining of Government commitment to industrial development.  It is also a vote of confidence in and will be a significant help to the development of the communities in which the new universities are located.</P>
    <P>The legislation will enhance the NIHEs' ability to develop research and academic links with European and other foreign universities, will enhance their access to research support from international sources, will increase the number and extent of student exchange programmes, a matter of considerable <Col N="2187" /> relevance with the prospect of the single market in 1992, and will enhance the development of credit transfer arrangements and joint teaching programmes with EC and other universities.</P>
    <P>What is proposed, therefore, is minor amending legislation in respect of the NIHE, Limerick, Act, 1980 and the NIHE, Dublin, Act, 1980 in order to: change the titles of the institutes to universities; change the titles of the directors to presidents; confer the power to award degrees, diplomas and certificates on the new universities; amplify the definitions of the functions of the universities; give the governing bodies the authority to extend the functions of the universities, with the approval of the Minister for Education; and extend the functions of the academic councils to make recommendations to the governing bodies on the conferment of degrees, diplomas and certificates.</P>
    <P>The authorities of the institutes and the Irish Federation of University Teachers have been consulted and they concur with the proposal to introduce the amending legislation.  The main reason behind introducing simple amending legislation is to ensure that students who graduate this year will have their degrees, diplomas and certificates conferred by their respective universities.  With this in view, only three amendments were made to the Bills during their passage through the Dáil last Thursday.  In the general statement of intent in section 3 the words &ldquo;educational&rdquo; and &ldquo;trade union&rdquo; were added on lines 1 to 6 on page 3.  I was pleased to extend the list of bodies with which the new universities should collaborate. It would be my wish that all universities should take account of and provide for all the interests and concerns of the communities they serve.</P>
    <P>The second amendment was a minor drafting amendment to section 3 on lines 41 to 44 on page 3.  In the 1980 Acts &ldquo;An tÚdarás&rdquo; is defined as meaning &ldquo;An tÚdarás um Árd-Oideachas&rdquo;.  The words &ldquo;um Árd-Oideachas&rdquo; in the original Bills circulated were, therefore, superfluous and were accordingly deleted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2188" /> The third amendment was to section 5. The words &ldquo;and not less than 3 students of the University, representative of the student body&rdquo; on lines 6 and 7 on page 4 were added.  This lays down that students should be represented on the academic councils of the universities.  Under the 1980 Acts the governing bodies were given the task of making regulations to provide for the memberships and terms of office of the academic councils.  Under the internal regulations made by the governing bodies both of them provide for student representation and students are currently represented on the councils. However, given this amendment they will now have the statutory right to such representation. Indeed, I always had that in my own mind about student representatives on governing bodies.  I am fully committed to the concept of student involvement and was, therefore, very pleased to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>As I have said, these Bills when enacted will allow students qualifying this year to be conferred with awards by the new universities.  In the light of ongoing discussions within the National University of Ireland I expect that it may be necessary to examine, in a broader sense, the totality of university legislation.  The legislative provisions of the new universities could be looked at in the context of any such examination.  Coincidentally, last Thursday at the Question Time break I had an appointment with the NUI which was arranged some time back to discuss, <i>inter alia</i>, the matriculation examination and we discussed in a broad way the need for further legislation with regard to universities.  I indicated to the Chancellor and the deputation that I would be very glad to look in a comprehensive way at the totality of university legislation.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay due tribute to the National Council for Educational Awards under whose aegis the NIHEs have developed. The NCEA was closely associated with the two institutions in their very important early formative period.  The acknowledgement of excellence which is the basis for this legislation is an endorsement of the quality and standing of the National Council for Educational <Col N="2189" /> Awards, their processes, their awards at all levels &mdash; certificate, diploma and degree &mdash; and also of the colleges and institutions which are designated institutions of NCEA.</P>
    <P>In paying tribute to NCEA, it would be remiss of me not to advert to the presidents and provost of our distinguished universities and the generous way in which they have welcomed the Government decision and, now, these Bills.  They expressed their welcome in a most tangible way, before we ever came to our decision, in admitting the presidents of the then two NIHEs to the Committee of Heads of Irish Universities.</P>
    <P>Given the historic nature of these proposals and the important development they represent for the third level education system of the country, I am confident that this House will welcome the Bills and the Government's initiative in bringing them forward.</P>
    <P>The titles proposed for the new universities are Ollscoil Chathair Bhaile Átha Cliath (Dublin City University) and Ollscoil Luimnigh (University of Limerick).</P>
    <P>I commend these Bills to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the legislation and I am very impressed by the succinct way in which the Minister has put these Bills into historical context.  The last time the Minister was in this House we talked about the constitutional crusade and we both dwelt at some length on the historical background but did not agree.  Today I agree with everything the Minister says on the historical background.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first major piece of university legislation since 1908.  The status being conferred on the new universities has been very well earned and is more than merited by their performance.  Both have made outstanding contributions at third level and attained the highest standards of academic excellence.  It came as no surprise to those of us who know what has been happening in the two institutions that the report issued under Mr. <Col N="2190" /> Tom Hardiman concluded as it did.  It could have come to no other conclusion.</P>
    <P>Both new universities have also set an example to other third level institutions in forging strong, meaningful links with the wider community.  The Minister in the closing stages of her speech pointed out the need for all universities to be very aware of the communities they serve and to have strong links with all sectors of those communities.  The NIHEs have given a very good example in this area.</P>
    <P>We have seen over the years a broadening of the curriculum at these two institutions, a pioneering of new courses and a strong emphasis on the enormous interdependence of the academic community and the world of business, of agriculture, of trade unions and finance. There has also been an emphasis on the needs of the community which can be served through the extension of distance learning.  In all these ways and many others, the institutions merit the new status which is being conferred on them.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the leading role played by the respective directors of the two institutes.  Dr. Edward Walsh was first into the field.  Many people thought more than a decade and a half ago that he was attempting the impossible.  There are many who raised an eyebrow and perhaps poured a little scorn on some of his ambitions and what some would have regarded as his pretensions at that time. Today he sees his vision fulfilled.  The objectives he set himself not so many years ago are now achieving realisation in this legislation.  Under his leadership the reputation of Limerick is very well established internationally, as it is nationally.</P>
    <P>The NIHE in Dublin is, of course, more recent but it, too, has carved out for itself a very significant niche and role in the academic life of our community. Dr. Danny O'Hare is one of the most respected figures in Irish academic life and he has brought his own qualities of leadership and enthusiasm to the project which has transformed the NIHE at Glasnevin into an institution which certainly deserves the university status which will be conferred.  As somebody who <Col N="2191" /> occasionally lectures at this institution, I have always been enormously impressed by the vibrancy of the students and their sense of commitment to their college. The quality of graduates from both Limerick and Dublin has certainly been at the highest international standard.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the respective directors, soon to be presidents of the new universities. Without them and the sense of leadership and commitment which they have brought to the development of the two institutions we almost certainly would not be discussing this legislation today.  In one sense both had great opportunities. It is perhaps far more difficult to inherit the leadership of an established 100-year-old or 400-year-old university with all its vested interests and time-encrusted ways which might not always be particularly relevant.  It may well be that it is easier to establish in a greenfield situation and build from the ground up, imposing one's own vision from the earliest stage.  In the early days of these two institutions the respective presidents might not have seen it quite that way. Certainly their job has been very well done.</P>
    <P>In welcoming the Bill I have to say it is somewhat lazy in that it misses a number of opportunities.  There were some indications in the Minister's speech that some of these might be addressed, but I should like to have seen a greater sense of urgency about the overall question of the restructuring of third level education.  This Bill has missed a number of opportunities under several headings. It does not seek sufficiently to build upon the experience of the two institutions over the past few years.  The Bill takes on board the existing structures and changes them in a minimalist way.  This misses an opportunity to face up to changes in the governing structure, some of which have been pointed out by the Irish Federation of University Teachers.</P>
    <P>The Minister says this legislation may be amended in omnibus legislation dealing with the universities in future years. That may be so, but I suspect it is a long way off.  The Irish Federation of <Col N="2192" /> University Teachers welcome the fact that the Minister did concede on some of the points they made when the Bill was going into the Dáil.  The Minister has referred to this but she confined her main task to renaming the existing institutions while waiting for omnibus legislation to introduce basic restructuring.  A number of further changes could have been made by the Minister which may not now come into effect for very many years.</P>
    <P>The points made by the Irish Federation of University Teachers, with which I agree, are threefold.  There is a strong feeling that the governing bodies have a very limited representation of the academic staff of the institutions and too large a number directly appointed by the Minister.  This is somewhat at variance with the position in the existing universities. There is also concern about the role of the academic council which is not seen as having a sufficiently strong and central role in the running of the affairs of the new universities.  There is a request for a look at strengthening the central role of the academic council.  There is also concern that the Minister has the power to reject the appointment of individual members of staff.  Such a power is unusual and undesirable in the case of a university institution and it poses a very small question mark over academic freedom. It might have been worthwhile to consult a little more widely and to introduce legislation going a little further than the mere renaming of the two institutions.</P>
    <P>My main criticism today &mdash; and it is a criticism that would be made of any Minister at this stage &mdash; is the failure to really face up to the overall structure of Irish third level education.  There is no real coherence at present to the governing structures of third level education. We have, for example, the National University of Ireland with its three constituent colleges and Maynooth which lives, to a certain extent, in a world of its own, and there is Trinity, which is an almost autonomous university.  There is the National Council for Education Awards and the institutions which refer <Col N="2193" /> to it.  We now have the two new universities today.  Then there is the Higher Education Authority.  In all this there is an absence of coherence.  There is a diversity which can often lead to wasteful duplication of resources, to empire building, which can prevent third level education developing in a way which is most suited and most at one with the overall national needs.  I feel that the growth of third level structures has been <i>ad hoc,</i> it has reacted to various historical developments over the years.  The Minister probably agrees with everything I am saying about all this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>A single structure which could at least give direction to the development of third level education would be highly desirable.  I do not mean a single Government structure but a structure would be very strongly representative of the various elements in third level education which could give the sort of leadership which has been lacking in the past number of years.  We all know that the resources of this country are small by comparison with our European neighbours.  We have poured a big proportion of our resources into the development of education.  The cutbacks in third level education in the last number of years have been more savage than in any other comparable level of education.  I hope the Minister will assure us today that the time of the cutbacks in third level is over and that, election or not, we are about to see the allocation of the resources to third level which were not there over the past number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of resources is something <Col N="2194" /> that has to be addressed within the overall context.  Throwing money at problems is not the answer to solving them.  There is now a need for this overall structure.  I can tell the Minister &mdash; and I am sure she knows &mdash; that there has been a great change in attitudes in third level education over the past number of years. There is now a much greater willingness to think in developmental terms, to think in terms of how the universities themselves can increase their income without damaging academic standards.</P>
    <P>There is a much greater sense of building up a partnership with the wider community, and I do not just mean with the business community and the industrial community; I mean in terms of developments of community/university projects where the universities will go out into the community and set up what were, in the old days, the adult education courses so very well pioneered by University College Cork in the early deciades of this century.  There is a tremendous desire for access to third level education amongst many people &mdash; the unemployed, people who are working at home and people who have retired.  There is an enormous opportunity for the universities to build a real sense of partnership on that basis.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear the Minister say she will engage in discussions with the National University of Ireland on the possible restructuring of third level education. I certainly welcome that as a member of the NUI.  I was not aware of the discussions, but clearly they happened last Thursday.  I hope there will be a very full debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Just let me correct the Senator there.  We met on the matriculation examination and in the course of that discussion, in a casual way, the matter was raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Seanad for the National University of Ireland and as somebody who is very proud to have been elected by the graduates, I feel that it now must face up to major questions about its future.  There are many people who believe that the <Col N="2195" /> current structures of the National University in fact inhibit the development of the individual colleges and may very well make the taking of decisions more cumbersome and more time consuming.  Certainly the arrival of the two new universities should in a very real way have both Trinity and the National University facing up to this overall question of the future direction and future governing structures of third level education.  I will leave that point there.  I think the Minister knows the point I am making.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that whatever changes she may have in mind, whatever side of the House she will be on after the election, she will find in Fine Gael a great openness on this question.  We are convinced that there is an urgent need to take a very hard look at the overall governing structures of third level education and at the role of the Higher Education Authority because I believe that, with the best will in the world, the Higher Education Authority does not have the type of powers which would be necessary if they were to play a role as a defender of third level education and directing the way such colleges should be developed.</P>
      <P>These are some of the questions to which, when she raises them, the Minister will get a very open and informed reaction from this side of the House. There is another point which the Bill misses, and it is an important one, especially in the present context, that is, the absence of any question of representation from the graduates of the new universities in Seanad Éireann.  In one way it is very difficult to defend the whole idea of university graduates having a vote to the Houses of Parliament that non-graduates do not have.  It is very difficult to get any democratic justification for this particular part of our Constitution.  I do not see why a graduate should have two votes when a non-graduate has only one legal vote in the elections to the Houses of Parliament.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one real justification for university representation in this House and that is that the quality of our university representatives over the years has been consistently outstanding. If we were to judge the justification for university representation then the real justification is the quality of service, the quality of contribution to debate and legislation which has come from that quarter over the 60 years of the history of this House.  That alone, the sheer quality of the Senators, justifies its continuation.</P>
      <P>We have at present three types of graduates.  We have graduates of the new universities who are disenfranchised, and we have graduates of Trinity and of the National University.  There is a clear inequality, in fact, there are two types of inequality.  Those who have no vote at all are the least equal of all, but the vote of the graduates of the National University is worth about a quarter the vote of the graduates of Trinity College.  When the Minister is bringing in the omnibus legislation she is talking about I hope she will look at the question of giving the franchise to the graduates of the new universities, possibly retrospectively &mdash; I am not sure if that is possible &mdash; and also at the question of bringing about some sort of equality of representation between the two universities.  I am quite certain that if Mr. Justice Hamilton were to throw his eye over the discrepancy in the size of the constituencies there might be a constitutional could hanging over more than one election over the coming months.  I would ask the Minister to take a fairly hard look at that aspect of the legislation also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one further small point I would like to make before I conclude in regard to something which has caused concern among many members of Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, that is, the absence of any mention in the legislation of what they would see, and what I would agree with, as the general duty of the universities with respect to national aims. There is a section in the NCEA Bill which would meet their purpose, that is, that in performing its functions An tÚdarás shall <Col N="2197" /> bear constantly in mind the national aims of restoring the Irish language and preserving and developing the national culture and shall endeavour to promote the attainment of those aims.  There is a strong feeling that the legislation at some stage may reflect this ethos, or this aspiration.</P>
    <P>Otherwise, I welcome this legislation but I regret that the opportunity was not used to introduce more comprehensive legislation as it affects the new universities, and that there was not produced a White Paper on the future structure of third level education in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister will agree that there is a need to take a very hard look at the overall structure of third level education. She will find all parties receptive to fair minded proposals.  I hope that either the Minister or George Birmingham as Minister in the next Government will make that a priority.  For too long Governments have shied away from taking a hard look at third level education partly because of the absence of pressure groups and partly because it might be felt that that is a sleeping dog which is better left lying.  I urge that as a priority in the national interest, with the next Government.</P>
    <P>Once again I congratulate the two universities. I support the legislation and I congratulate the respective directors for their success in bringing their institutions to this point.</P>

Déanaim comhghairdeas leis an Aire mar gheall ar an dá Bhille a chur os comhair an tSeanaid anois agus go mór mhór an dá Bhille a chur os comhair na Dála an tseachtain seo caite i dtreo nach gcaillfí iad, agus b'fhéidir go gcaillfí iad ar feadh tamaillín mhaith.  Ar bhealach aontaím leis an Seanadóir Harte faoin mBille eile a luaigh sé ó chianaibh, an Bille um chearta na bpáistí.  Ba thrua freisin nach raibh an ceann sin os ár gcomhair chomh maith.  Ach gabhaim buíochas den Aire gur éirigh linn an dá <Col N="2198" /> Bhille seo a chur os comhair na Dála agus, dar ndóigh, tá am go leor nó beagáinín ama ar aon chuma, againn sa Seanad fós chun na cúrsaí seo a phlé.</P>
      <P>Tá sé ráite ag an Aire faoin am a caitheadh os na 1840 aidí i leith ag plé le cúrsaí ollscoile i Luimneach agus is dócha go bhféadfaimis dul níos fuide siar ná sin, go dtí an cúigiú aois nó mar sin.  It would not be relevant to back as far as the fifth century when we are talking about legislation that has been introduced now.  I welcome the two Bills and I congratulate the Minister on introducing them to the Dáil last week and to the Seanad this week, so that they would not die with the dissolution of the Dáil.  I congratulate the people in NIHE Limerick and those in NIHE Dublin on attaining university status in each case.</P>
      <P>The people of Dublin are to be particularly congratulated because it must be a record in a city the size of Dublin, that they now have, if we consider Maynooth as being in the hinterland of Dublin, four full universities which are very strategically placed, with UCD in the south, new Dublin city university in the north, Trinity in the centre and Maynooth on the western hinterland.  I congratulate Dr. O'Hare on the success he has had with the NIHE in Dublin which will now be called the Dublin City University.</P>
      <P>I have particular pleasure in congratulating Dr. Walsh and NIHE Limerick on their attainment of university status.  As one who does not give a lot of time and credence to nomenclature, the NIHE in Limerick and the NIHE in Dublin have already established their credentials in the students they have produced and in the excellence they have produced, so that the naming of these institutions as universities is really the icing on the cake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirty years ago at a meeting of the CBS past pupils union of Sexton Street in Limerick, I was the secretary and I was instructed to call a meeting of other past pupil unions to see if we could once again after many years resurrect a committee to look for a university in Limerick.  The first meeting of the combination of past pupils unions was held in Sexton Street in 1959.  I pay tribute to the two unions <Col N="2199" /> who were to the forefront in this campaign, the CBS of Sexton Street past pupils union and Mungret past pupils union.  There was support and help from other unions but these two unions had the greatest input into that campaign.  It is a pleasure for me to see the secretary of that committee who worked like a Trojan for so long, Mrs. Margaret Liddy in the distinguished visitors gallery here today.  I welcome her to the House and it is a fitting tribute that she should be here on such an historic occasion.  That committee worked very hard.  Unfortunately, its chairman, John Moloney, died only a couple of weeks ago.  However, no one was more delighted than he when the announcement of the change in status was made by the Minister when she visited NIHE in Limerick early in the year.  The Limerick University project committee was one of the best committees I have ever had the pleasure of serving on.  The committee was united for one purpose, to establish a university in Limerick.  They would not accept anything else.  We ran foul of many Ministers for Education but we all stuck together, we played as a team.  The committee united city and county, trade unionists, businessmen, professional and ordinary people.</P>
    <P>I pay a special tribute here to one organisation who helped us probably more than any other, that is the ICMSA. Being a rural organisation they saw that the establishment of a university in Limerick would not alone benefit the people of Limerick city but of the whole western region and the country generally.  The late John Feely was one of the great people who, through the good graces of Mrs. Liddy's husband, helped a lot.  It is sad to recall that looking back over a period of 30 years I mention so many people who have died without seeing their work come to fruition.  The campaign was a very intensive one.  If I could have that kind of committee reinstated in present circumstances it might be of great help to me during the next couple of days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bromell</NameTxt>
      <P>That was one of the most tremendous committees ever.  They were an energetic enthusiastic committee committed to the ideal and they would not take no for an answer.  In the context of the North, where the people are saying no all the time, I suppose we could say that Limerick would not take no for an answer to their cause.  The campaign took place throughout the mid-western region and was taken to meetings at UCD, UCG and UCC, the heartland of what, shall we say, we thought was the opposition but many of these were very helpful in their advice later.  The result of this campaign was the setting up of the Commission on Higher Education by the President, Dr. Patrick Hillery.  We were very enthusiastic about this.  Another person who was of tremendous help to us was Brother White who was the superior at Sexton Street CBS.  He became a member of that commission.</P>
      <P>However, the commission's report did not find favour with us because it proposed the establishment, and I am sure Senator Manning would agree with me on this, of a kind of second class college in Limerick.  None of the committee was prepared to accept this.  Discussions took place with the Minister for Education and it is indeed a coincidence that the announcement of the granting of university level education to Limerick in the form of the NIHE was made by the present Minister's brother, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who was then Minister for Education. On behalf of the people of Limerick and this House I would like to say that we are all delighted to see Brian faring so well at present and we hope to welcome him back very quickly to Ireland and to public affairs.  It must be unique for one Minister to have established the NIHE in Limerick and for a sister of his to be here today establishing the University of Limerick.  If there are any more Lenihans on the way one would never know what we would get in the future.</P>

      <P>The Minister's decision at that time did not find full favour with the committee.  I am sure Mrs. Liddy is listening very intensely at present but it probably was the first time that there was a little bit of dissension in the committee. Perhaps I should not say dissension, but rather &ldquo;not thoroughly satisfied&rdquo; or &ldquo;not thoroughly dissatisfied&rdquo;.  I think the words used by the then Minister at that time were that we were getting &ldquo;something better than a university&rdquo;.  Some people were sceptical about this but as it turned out I think people in Limerick would now say that we did get something better than a university.  Perhaps it is rather ambiguous that it is now being called a university but we will not go into the logic behind the phraseology.</P>
      <P>One of the best things the Higher Education Authority did at that time was to advertise for a director of the new institution.  The person appointed of course was Edward Walsh.  The Divine Spirit must have come down on the HEA because they could not have appointed a better person.  He is a person of commitment, dedication, enthusiasm, competence and innovation.  Perhaps after all that praise he will give me a vote in the election but this is sincerely meant.</P>
      <P>The NIHE in Limerick began in an office in O'Connell Street.  As a matter of fact quite a bit of post used to come to my own house as I was associated with the university project committee.  I often took some letters to Dr. Walsh at the beginning.  The office was then transferred to the site at Plassey House and Dr. Walsh was put in charge of an open field. Tremendous credit is due to him and to the planning board established at that time as well as to the staff he built up around him and to everybody involved in making the physical campus what it is today, not to talk about the excellence it has achieved in the academic world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Might I pay tribute here also to the Department of Education and in particular to the then secretary, the late Seán MacGearailt, who was followed by the <Col N="2202" /> late Seán Ó Conchubhair.  It was these people who picked a site that we in the project committee had never looked at. We had taken an option on a site near the Regional Hospital in Raheen and had our eye on a site on the Ennis Road.  We had never thought of the actual site, as far as I can recollect, on which the NIHE or the new university is now established. The tradition of helping the NIHE, as it then was, was continued by Seán Ó Conchubhair, when he became chairman of the HEA, by Dominic O'Laoire who was secretary and later chairman of the HEA, and by Liam Ó Laighin who was secretary of the Department and now current chairman of the HEA.</P>
    <P>When talking about the establishment of the NIHE in Limerick and its success it is only right that we should think of the many people and the many areas from which help came for its establishment and success.  I will not go into the success of the NIHE in Limerick.  I am sure that Dr. O'Hare will forgive me for harping so much on Limerick but there will be others who will devote most of their time to the Dublin site rather than to the Limerick site.</P>
    <P>From the beginning there was such commitment, dedication and purpose and in particular such innovation, behind the work being done in the NIHE in Limerick that it had to succeed.  It was up against the established universities and therefore it had to attract students.  This it has done.  If I recall the figures correctly, the figure this year is something around 5,000 and growing.  This will be a headache for the Minister for Education, of course, given that third level numbers are still growing but I am sure she will be able to achieve success in the same way she has achieved so many other successes during the past few years.</P>
    <P>As I said, I will not go into the academic and innovative success of the NIHE in Limerick and, correspondingly, the NIHE in Dublin but one of the tremendous things to happen at the site was the establishment of the Plassey technological park.  From the beginning Dr. Walsh, his fellow academics and governing body, which was formed following the <Col N="2203" /> introduction of legislation to establish the NIHE, set about marrying the academic life to the business and commercial life. I do not think there should be divorce in that type of marriage.  Both can live in harmony provided each side respects the other.  Academic standards must be maintained and attained.  University education or any education is not there solely to help industry and commerce, it is there to complement it.  Both sides should work together in harmony and unison for the good of the community and the country in general.</P>
    <P>I am a little bit sorry &mdash; I hope Dr. Walsh will recall this &mdash; to see the name of the National Institute of Higher Education leaving us.  I suppose it will live for a while but there was great difficulty in Limerick with regard to the name.  As I said, the university project committee wanted nothing else except a university. Many names were put up to the Higher Education Authority with regard to the name of the institution.  It was at a meeting of the Higher Education Authority with people from the NIHE in Limerick over lunch &mdash; which I suppose is the best time to think of things &mdash; that it was finally agreed that the National Institute of Higher Education would be the name. The words &ldquo;institution&rdquo; and &ldquo;institute&rdquo; had been bandied about but these did not appeal to any of the people in Limerick. Then the word &ldquo;national&rdquo; was inserted. This got over some of the difficulties.</P>
    <P>We thought, and Dr. O'Hare will forgive me for this, that there would be only one but it is only right that we do not confine progress to any particular area. It is to be welcomed that both NIHE colleges, Limerick and Dublin, are working hand in hand for the good of all.</P>
    <P>Unlike Senator Manning, I was glad that the legislation was minimal.  It took a long time to get it through the Dáil.  If it had been controversial, at this time it might not have gone through and we might have had to wait until the new Dáil assembled.  While I agree with some of the sentiments expressed by Senator Manning, it was well that the Bill got <Col N="2204" /> through.  It should be said that the Minister had come to Limerick to announce the setting up of the university long before any of us ever thought that an election was in the air, or hoped that there would or would not be an election, as the case might be.</P>
    <P>There is reference in the Bill to courses of study or instruction in such fields as the governing body may deem appropriate. That is a very wide clause.  It is welcome and gives the governing body great power to continue in their innovative way, if they see the need for courses.  I would emphasise that the university here has the power to grant degrees, diplomas or certificates.  There would be areas that would not necessarily need degree or diploma courses.  In whatever areas the governing body see fit to have more course added, they have that power.</P>
    <P>I also notice on page 3, between lines 15 and 20, that the university could grant degrees, diplomas, or certificates, or other educational awards to such other colleges or institutions as the governing body may approve.  That is a very important clause.  It opens up the question of recognising courses &mdash; although they are already recognised &mdash; of regional technical colleges.  This may be so even perhaps in places where there are no regional technical colleges.  Perhaps degree, or diploma, or certificate courses could be recognised by both universities.  The Bill for NIHE Dublin is similar to that for NIHE Limerick.  This is a very good omnibus clause which will help to establish certain courses in any area throughout the country.  I welcome this very much.</P>
    <P>I am glad also that the Minister may, on the recommendation of the governing body and after consultation with an tÚdarás, by order, assign to the institute such additional functions as the Minister thinks fit.  The important part there is &ldquo;on the recommendation of the governing body&rdquo;, which leaves the initiative to that body.  To take away initiative from any institution is to kill it.  Even though these are only amendments to the 1980 Bill, this initiative is allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>One matter on which we might be able <Col N="2205" /> to get the Minister to agree has been mentioned by Senator Manning, that is, with regard to the Irish language.  I was a little disappointed that there was no actual reference to the Irish language in the Bill.  I had taken it that it was mentioned in the NIHE Act of 1980, but it seems that I was mixing up the NCA and the NIHE Acts.  Under that paragraph &mdash; I know that it is late now for an amendment &mdash; the Minister might decide, on the recommendation of the governing body, to have inserted something like what was inserted for the NCA Act, or the Act on higher education.  The latter says that in performing its functions an tÚdarás shall bear constantly in mind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am delighted if Senator Murphy has put down such an amendment. Perhaps I am becoming cynical at this stage about the definite use of such amendments to the Irish language, but I still think that any university institution legislation should, at least, have a clause saying that the university will give due recognition to the Irish language.  I would respectfully suggest, if the clause is in line with what is in the higher education or the NCA Act, that the Minister look favourably on it.  If not, it might be possible to have it put in with reference to page 3, line 42.  In these times particularly, when people might think that there is no need to be bothered about the Irish language, or Irish culture, and that we should be more European oriented, it is only right to remember that the more Irish we are, the more European we can be.  We were never more European than when we were so Irish in the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth centuries, and in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, <Col N="2206" /> particularly, we had much more communication for political reasons, with the continent of Europe than we have today. I hope that the Minister will be able to facilitate us in this respect.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for introducing the Bill and, from the point of view of the people of Limerick, I thank her for being so conscious of the need to have university status conferred on NIHE Limerick. The Minister has been most enthusiastic and helpful in regard to the whole situation in Limerick, as I can well vouch for as registrar of another college in Limerick, Mary Immaculate College of Education.  I take this opportunity of thanking her for all the help and encouragement she has given to that institution in approving of its programme for diversification into other degree and diploma areas and so forth.  With the university and other colleges in Limerick, for example, Thomond College and my own college, Mary Immaculate College and the Limerick College of Art, Commerce and Technology, Limerick has blossomed in these days of the eighties into a place of education, of dul chun cinn, mar a déarfá, nár mheasamar a bheadh riamh ann nuair a thosnaíomar ar an mbeartas seo i dtosach ag iarraidh ollscoil a fháil do Luimneach.

I should like to congratulate the directors of NIHE Dublin and NIHE Limerick, <Col N="2207" /> who are with us today and who soon will be the presidents of their respective universities.  I also welcome the Minister's speech.  For a change, it was not the usual bland and predictable survey.  I would regard it as quite provocative in some respects.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning indicated that he was totally in agreement with the historical context. Well, I am almost in agreement. There were one or two points to which I take exception, the notable lack of any reference to the longest established seat of learning, that founded by St. Finbarr by the banks of the Lee, for which there is very strong historical evidence, going back to the 6th century.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>More seriously, in her speech the Minister executed quite a considerable <i>tour de force</i> in surveying what she rightly called the thorny problem of the university question in the 19th century and mentioning various stages, without once referring to the main characters of the drama who are, of course, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy who were determined that there would be no third level education for Catholics unless they could control it.  I congratulate the Minister there on a skilful piece of <i>omissio veri</i> which could be described as Hamlet without the bishops. Thankfully, their lordships are now restricted more or less to their proper sphere and the laity has come into its own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In another part of the Minister's speech I would, if I were sufficiently cranky, take exception to the implication that somehow the existing universities do not sufficiently take account of the interests and concerns of the communities they serve, that somehow this is something novel regarding the two institutes.  I <Col N="2208" /> would certainly resent any implication of that kind, speaking on behalf of my own university college, which has, as Senator Manning so graciously observed, been a pioneer force in adult education and which is very closely connected with the trade union and other social and economic movements in the city and community which it services.</P>
    <P>However, the elevation of status of these two institutes to that of universities is not only a matter of congratulation for themselves, but really they enhance the status of learning in the country as a whole and they enhance the respect for education in the country as a whole.  Anything that underlines and draws public attention to the importance of third level learning cannot but be a matter for rejoicing by all of us.  That is not to say that there were not some private and public discussions when the news was announced that the two NIHEs were to be universities.</P>
    <P>There was some discussion about the report of the international study group. The international study group, without any doubt at all, unequivocally recommended the status of university for the two institutes and dismissed any suggestion that the institutes could be described as technological universities.</P>
    <P>I notice with some interest that in the current prospectus for NIHE, Dublin, in an introduction by its distinguished director, there is a description of the institution as virtually a &ldquo;technological university&rdquo;. I would also say that some of the discussion in the Minister's speech about the nature of a university and what is a <i>universitas</i> is open to debate.  I do not fully accept that the traditional idea of the <i>universitas</i> being a wide range of disciplines is somehow out of date.</P>
    <P>What distinguishes a university from any other kind of third level institute is not the range of its disciplines but the spirit in which it approaches learning, the ethos of that particular institution, the pursuit of learning and the pursuit of research as fields of inquiry which do not have be justified by reference to any practical application.  I would submit that <Col N="2209" /> that is the irreducible essence of the definition of a university.</P>
    <P>To some extent one could argue once again that the humanities which, by tradition, are the premier departments of universities have rather a different priority in the NIHEs of Limerick and Dublin.  I have here a very colourful &mdash; I may say this wistfully, looking at some of our own rather drab literature &mdash; prospectus from NIHE, Limerick in which the College of Humanities is relegated to the last pages.  It is quite obvious that the College of Humanities, excellent though it is, subserves the practical and applied purpose of the institute.  That is a very significant illustration of the different ethos that characterises the national institutes from the traditional universities.</P>
    <P>These are matters of debate and argument and I do not mean to be ungracious. It is possible that the Minister and the international study group could have said to themselves, well probably the most famous third level institutes which are not technical universities in the United States &mdash; Caltec, Massachusetts Institute of Technology &mdash; lose nothing in terms of status, regard and ability to do business by not being formally called universities. That is another debatable point.</P>
    <P>However, the time for argument is past.  It would be churlish and begrudging indeed to dwell overmuch on the pros and cons and it might well be imputed to me as sour grapes to go on at some length over this.  I wish to join in the tributes paid by my colleagues to the directors and staff of the two institutes and to the work that has made this happy outcome possible.  Those of us in the traditional university sphere are extremely impressed by the work which has reached such a happy conclusion.  I am the only university Senator remaining from the far off days of 1980 when the original Bills went through the House, when the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Wilson, took the statutory provisions through the House.  Looking at my own contribution in a not, I hope, too narcissistic approach the other day &mdash; I am always taken by what I said eight years ago &mdash; I noted I <Col N="2210" /> was not the only Senator on that occasion to draw attention to what seemed to us then to be the excessive amount of ministerial interference in the formal setting up of the institutes.  The point I made was that if they are to be given formal institute status then surely it is time that the apron strings were cut and that they were given the same kind of autonomy.</P>

      <P>Their shoelaces should not have to be tied for them any more.  It was a point which we emphasised because some of us were disturbed by the prospect of the Minister interfering at every hand's turn in the proceedings of these institutes in the appointment of the staff.  I recall that the Minister could literally decide what price to charge for the admission of the public to a lecture under the auspices of the institute.  We drew attention to that kind of petty interference.  Of course we were concerned for our own future in making those reservations because we were afraid that this is what the Minister would have in mind were we to attempt any revision of our own status.  The international study group echoed some of the reservations which I expressed then and which I still feel because in chapter 6, section 3, they talked about the need for changes relating principally to the relaxation of the ministerial control in certain respects.  I see there some instance of the type of concern I am talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Manning went on to argue for reform in the nature of the academic council and reform in the composition of the governing body.  I subscribe to those views.  It is my hope that the governing body will be constituted on something like the composition of our governing body in University College, Cork, which, at first sight, looks ramshackle but works very well.  It draws a great deal of moral sanction from the fact that it does represent a wide range of community representation. It may be that my concern is <Col N="2211" /> misplaced.  It has been suggested to me that in the interim since 1980 the ministerial powers of interference, in effect, have not been operated, that the institutes have worked with virtual autonomy and that they have not complained about the degree of Government interference. I would like to think that that is so.  I take it that the directors were consulted in the drafting of these Bills and that they are reasonably satisfied that they have not experienced the kind of interference which we in 1980 were so worried about.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out some of the implications of the establishment of the new universities for the university structure in the country.  Senator Manning and the Minister referred to the discussions taking place at NUI level about the implications for the NUI of the new universities. Indeed, the Senate of the National University is to devote a special meeting to the impact of the new legislation on the fortunes of the NUI.  The Senate will be considering this as a matter of urgency.  There are two levels here: what will be the impact on the National University of Ireland, and what will the impact be on the individual colleges? University College Dublin, doubtless, must be concerned about its own self-image in the context of two other universities in the metropolitan area with the style and status of universities while UCD, the largest third level institution by far, remains a university college with all the connotations of subordination that that implies.  I am sure that that is a matter of concern for University College Dublin and I have no doubt that that will lead to agonising reappraisal by UCD of its status.</P>
    <P>In Cork, to be totally honest, we have been thinking quite a lot about the implications for us of the fact that NIHE Limerick is now to be the University of Limerick.  It would be ostrich-like on our part to pretend that that will have no impact on us.  Indeed, irrespective of the intrinsic merit of the institute in Limerick, soon to be a university, apart from its high status and its calibre, there is also <Col N="2212" /> the additional fact that it is, through its chief executive, first rate in projecting its own image.  I enviously look at the splendid prospectus and I can see students leafing through it and asking, &ldquo;why cannot the traditional universities produce something like that?&rdquo;  The publicity, some of it understandably political, surrounding the announcement of the new universities has given the new University of Limerick an image in the public mind which in itself is a challenge to us in University College Cork.  Obviously, we are a bit concerned about that.</P>
    <P>One thing that I am worried about is that all the emphasis on relevance, on application, on technology, on Europe and on satisfying markets tends to downgrade the traditional type of university, tends to make them appear dated, fuddy duddy or universities that cannot be justified because of the results of their learning are not immediately and in every case applicable.  There is a psychological climate here in which the traditional universities have had to go on the defensive. We are very much aware of that in Cork.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear, as we have done by formal resolution of our governing body, that UCC warmly congratulate its brother or sister, or whatever the neuter counterpart is, in Limerick, that we are pleased the change is taking place.  Our ideal is of close co-operation between UCC and the new University of Limerick and there should be no doubt about that.  The director is aware of that. At the same time, we must look to our laurels.  We propose to advertise the genuine wares we have.  We do not propose to allow a part of the market, let us say somewhere in the mid-province which, undoubtedly, for the moment is attracted by the glamorous prospect of the University of Limerick, to drift entirely to our new confrere and competitor. We are, while remaining extremely friendly and co-operative, determined to maintain our status, our premier status, as Munster's chief seat of learning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The tone of the debate so far has been extremely chauvinistic in the direction of Limerick. After all, Cork people have been described as people for whom an inferior complex means that they are as good as everybody else.  We are determined to point, once again, to the motto we have, lonad Bhairre Scoil na Mumhan, and make it a latter day reality.</P>
      <P>I should like to return to the emphasis on technology and so on.  I have said that all the hype nowadays tends to downgrade the traditional type of university. Part of that is to suggest that somehow the whole world of high technology and so on is something new that has been brought into existence by the new types of institutes as if the traditional universities had not pioneered these departures, as if we in UCC had not been pioneers in electrical engineering and micro-electronics.  Indeed, the distinguished Director of NIHE, Limerick, is an alumnus of that type of educational background.  I am amazed at the rapidity with which all this development has taken place.  The Government of 1967-68 were talking about a new university structure, about the break-up of the NUI and, shortly afterwards, the 1973-77 Coalition Government announced that Cork would have an independent university.  Those things were in the air so long ago and now, here we are virtually in 1992, and the NUI and UCC still maintain their traditional status.</P>
      <P>I read the other day that in my speech in 1980 I expressed the hope that there would soon be reorganisation of the NUI because, as I said then, the smell of decay was palpable in 49 Merrion Square.  If that was so in 1980 I must say we have been, like Charles II, an unconscionable time dying, because we are still there.  This is partly because the restructuring of universities has been pretty low on the Government agenda and partly because we do not know what we want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  We simply have not made up our minds about what <Col N="2214" /> we want.  The truth is that we in UCC and the NUI as a whole are afraid that any legal change in our institutions will mean a diminishing or our traditional autonomy.  We cherish very dearly our power to make statutes, for example &mdash; whether this is more apparent than real I am not sure &mdash; and we do not want the kind of university legislation which would change that, put us under the control of the Minister and so on.</P>
      <P>Back in the forties Alfred O'Rahilly &mdash; perhaps the most impressive university head of his day and he will figure very large in the history of universities in this century in Ireland &mdash; was very much against the break-up of the national university precisely for that reason.  Living in a decade where there was so much emphasis on the power of the State, so much fear of the power of the State, he was afraid that any change would be a change for the worse, any change would be a change for control by Government. We still have something of that mentality. We are reluctant to put our traditional standing at risk.  As I said already, maybe our fears are exaggerated and perhaps ministerial control is really only a dead letter.</P>
      <P>I notice that the Minister in her speech hints at forthcoming legislation.  I got the impression from reading that sentence that perhaps when the time comes to make Cork University an independent university there may be no more in question than a simple amending Bill, a change of nomenclature, which indeed this Bill is, that we can retain intact our traditional autonomy, or at least I hope so, and that only minimal amendment to the 1908 legislation could transform the university structure in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say something about the implications of these Bills for university representation in Seanad Éireann.  As the Minister will recall, in 1979 there was the Seventh Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  That provided for the replacement of the present system of three Trinity and three NUI people by six seats to be apportioned by law to graduates without any specification.  That amendment was passed without any great enthusiastic <Col N="2215" /> interest on the part of the people of Ireland and the position now is that constitutionally, as I understand it, these six seats in Seanad Éireann can, by law, be apportioned in any way the Government decide.  In 1979 during the passage through Seanad Éireann of the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution Bill, the Minister at that time, Deputy Wilson, hoped that these changes would be brought about very quickly.  In other words, instead of the present three NUI and three Dublin University seats we would have a new system of apportioning the six seats.  He thought that this should be a matter of urgency.  The date was 31 May 1979, ten years ago yesterday.</P>

      <P>Does this not recall the story of the scholars at the Celtic Congress where the Hispanist asked his Gaelic counterpart what was the Gaelic term for <i>Mañana</i> and the Gaelic scholar replied: &ldquo;I can think of several definitions in the Gaelic language for <i>Mañana</i> but none of them conveys the same sense of urgency&rdquo;.  This is our fault, and I freely concede that.  I would say that the six Senators who grace these benches are in no hurry to have their status changed but if these seats are justified at all &mdash; and Senator Manning made a fulsome apologia for our existence here, which modesty would forbid me to emulate &mdash; and we examine the Official Report of the debates of Seanad Éireann and ignore the clowning which takes place sometimes on the Order of Business, I believe there is an impressive record there, <i>si monumentum requiris, circumspice or tolle, lege</i> or whatever the phrase is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fairness I have to say there is no justification for the present situation.  The question is: is a graduate vote justifiable at all?  Senator Manning raised questions about the whole élitism of this matter &mdash; why should a graduate of the NUI or Dublin University have an additional franchise to elect to the Seanad as well as the Dáil in his capacity as an ordinary citizen?  Of course, the anomaly does not <Col N="2216" /> stop there.  If I were a county councillor, a graduate of UCC, and maybe even a graduate of TCD as well, and an outgoing Senator, then I would not only have a Dáil vote but I would have several votes for Seanad Éireann.</P>

      <P>Moreover, if I may press the point, we may be élitist but no more so than panels which are much more nominally vocational than we are.  After all, the university seats are the only part of Seanad Éireann which I believe fulfil the spirit of the original vocational intent of the Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main point I want to make is that reform is now inescapable in this matter. If university representation is to be maintained in this House then it must extend not only to the graduates of the new universities in Limerick and Dublin but to all third level graduates, regional technical colleges and so on.  I can see no justification if one is to have a vote based on some kind of alleged superior wisdom or learning then for sheer historical reasons to give it to some and to withhold it from others.  When that reform is made it will finally level the ridiculous anomaly whereby the University of Dublin has the same number of representatives as a much larger institution, particularly now <Col N="2217" /> that the Dublin University, can no longer take shelter in the outdated pretext that it has a particular type of ethos which serves the country in a certain kind of way.  Trinity College, Dublin, is now as much a national university as the NUI or the new universities in Limerick and Dublin.  Whatever special ethos it has is gone, and perhaps that is no bad thing. Certainly there is no justification for the claim that TCD should continue to have an overweighted representation in this House.  All these matters will arise sooner or later, and perhaps sooner rather than later.  It is a piece of reform which, whether or not the Minister had this in mind when these Bills were drafted, will have to be considered very soon.</P>
    <P>I shall be moving an amendment on Committee Stage &mdash; apparently Senators Manning and Bromell were unaware of that amendment &mdash; and I shall talk more about it at that stage.  Meanwhile, I want to renew my congratulations to the two universities and their distinguished directors. I welcome the Bill most warmly.</P>

      <P>I should like to welcome the Minister to the House.  I am sure her visit will be a brief one.  Having performed so outstandingly in a difficult ministry I am sure it will not be long before she is adequately rewarded for her efforts.  I am reminded that, when I was an undergraduate at UCG, the late Donogh O'Malley came down to us one evening in the <i>Aula Maxima</i> and handed us a grant; it was a large amount in those days of perhaps £0.5 million.  He had the pleasant audacity to suggest that a doctorate might be conferred on him for having done so.  Hopefully it will not be too long before some new university drops the mantle of an honorary doctorate around the Minister's delicate shoulders.</P>

      <P>Well, then, I will not refer to him.  However, I will say that, following this debate this evening and the appendage of the President's signature to the two Bills, he, like Doctor Walsh &mdash; that is, Doctor O'Hare &mdash; will be transformed from being the head of an institute to being president of a university.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on her introductory remarks and, in particular, her historical sketch on the development of universities here leading to the introduction of these two Bills.  I suppose new challenges produce new responses, that the old adage &mdash;<i>tempora mutantur nos et mutamur in illis</i>&mdash; applies as much to universities as to people.  I wish also to endorse the general welcome of these two Bills by other Members and to compliment the Minister and the Government on their introduction.</P>
      <P>These new universities, as the National Institute of Higher Education &mdash; have introduced an added dynamism to higher education.  They have helped in emphasising the importance and national youthfulness of the interaction between business and higher education, and between industry and higher education. Indeed, the international study group to which the Minister referred emphasised how important and defensible such a stance was, and is, even in academic terms in their statement:</P>
      <P>The study group takes the view that there is no inherent conflict between what is useful and what is scholarly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conferring of the university title and functions on the National Institutes of Higher Education will facilitate them in developing further this and other important elements of their remit.  Their already successful participation in the ERASMUS and COMETT programmes of the EC will be strengthened by the <Col N="2219" /> provisions of these Bills.  Their need, as National Institutes of Higher Education, to explain themselves to foreigners in universities and industries alike, will be removed.  That had been a debilitating and unnecessary burden on them.  I spoke recently to a distinguished foreign visitor who asked me what is a NIHE?  I had tremendous difficulty in explaining to him exactly what it was.  It is truly remarkable that these institutes have done so well notwithstanding their ill-understood titles.</P>
    <P>In endorsing and supporting these Bills I am conscious that we are endorsing and recognising considerable achievements in teaching and research spread over a broad range of activities and disciplines. The breadth of the National Institutes of Higher Education programmes can be misleading.  I use their full title because I do not like the abbreviated version &mdash; NIHE.  The breadth of their programmes can be misleading, in that a simple interpretation of their titles could indicate a narrowness of focus and content whereas the reality is they are extraordinarily broad.  I might cite the example of the degree in accounting and finance at the National Institute of Higher Education in Dublin.  It is a programme which, at first glance, appears quite narrow. However, on further examination, it becomes evident that it contains economics, law, my own subject, psychology, statistics, languages and sociology in addition to the other mainstream business subjects.  Indeed these and other programmes conducted at the National Institutes of Higher Education reflect Newman's view of a university curricular structures &mdash; that branches are not isolated and independent of one another but together form a whole or a system.  Not being large universities, each discipline is not represented by an individual department. That has its advantages in that the National Institutes of Higher Education have inter-disciplinary schools as a basic element of their structures, again reflecting Newman's view.  The other humanities-based degrees &mdash; European studies, <Col N="2220" /> languages and marketing, communications and journalism are further testimony to the breadth of the National Institutes of Higher Education.</P>
    <P>If I had any reservations about the Bills it might be about the names of the relevant universities.  I agree that the title &mdash; University of Limerick &mdash; is a good title for that university there because there is not one located in that city already.  But in Dublin we shall have three universities henceforth with Dublin forming part of their titles.  We will have University College, Dublin, the University of The Most Holy Trinity &mdash; often referred to as Dublin University &mdash; and now Dublin City University.  However, if everybody else is happy with those titles I will not quibble with them.</P>
    <P>It is nice to see Dublin, and the country as a whole, become a centre for learning once again with the establishment of these new universities.  Whereas we may never be an island of saints, we might perhaps be an island of scholars.</P>
    <P>As Senator Murphy was speaking, I remembered the Greek phrase  &mdash; the unexamined life is not worth living for man.  Is it not wonderful to see so many young people examining life, attending university, once again establishing our reputation for learning that might go abroad.</P>
    <P>Therefore it is for that reason I welcome and support these excellent Bills.  I wish these new universities well and hope they have bright, successful futures.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In an important international report published in 1988 entitled <i>Innovation Policy in Ireland</i> the Organisation for <Col N="2221" /> Economic Co-operation and Development stated:</P>
    <P>Modern development relies more and more on investment in brains rather than investment in fixed assets.</P>
    <P>It is in the context of that independent and objective report that I welcome the introduction of these two Bills to establish two new universities, one in Limerick and the other in Dublin, rendering them the first universities to be established since the foundation of this State.</P>
    <P>Of course it can be argued &mdash; as did the Minister for Education here this morning in the course of her introductory remarks &mdash; that the monasteries of Ireland were the precursors of the mediaeval universities as seats of learning and scholarship.  Therefore, it is not surprising &mdash; as the Minister pointed out &mdash; that attempts were made to establish a university in Dublin in the early part of the fourteenth century.  Thus the inchoate university of Saint Patrick was established by a Papal Bull of Pope Clement V in the city of Dublin.  Although there is evidence that lectures were delivered and that there was a formal conferring of degrees, there appears to be little evidence of activity on the part of that university after the year 1320.</P>
    <P>In 1465 a parliament held in Drogheda, presided over by Thomas, the Eighth Earl of Desmond, passed an Act to the effect that there be a university in the town of Drogheda.  Nothing came of that project.  In 1475 and again in 1568 there were further attempts made to establish universities in Dublin but those attempts failed to come to frution.  Notwithstanding those early unsuccessful attempts, university education in Ireland has had a distinguished history.  Ireland's oldest university &mdash; the University of Dublin or Trinity College, Dublin &mdash; was established under a Royal Charter by Queen Elizabeth I in 1592.  In 1845, Pierse Shannon, the Mayor of Limerick, led a delegation to London where they met with Sir Robert Peel and Sir James Graham and presented their case for the setting up of a university in Limerick. However, in that same year, the Queen's <Col N="2222" /> colleges were founded in Cork, Galway and Belfast and in 1854, a few year later, Cardinal Newman founded the Catholic University.  In 1882 the Catholic University was recognised as University College, Dublin.  In 1908 the Irish Universities Act established the Federal National University of Ireland with constituent colleges in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  Two years later in 1910 Saint Patrick's College, Maynooth, which was founded in 1795, became a recognised college of the National University of Ireland.  However, Limerick was not provided for in the 1908 legislation and in the following years the case for a university for Limerick was developed and was made convincingly by many organisations, leading to the establishment of the Limerick University Project Committee in that historic year of 1959.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity and to join with the other Senators, and Senator Bromell in particular, to pay tribute to that committee which was ably led by its chairman, the late Johnny Moloney and his secretary, Margaret Liddy, and a host of other people, who contributed so well and showed such vision, determination and dedication, as they advanced and promoted the idea of a university for Limerick.  Their work, of course, was rewarded in 1969 when the then Minister for Education, Deputy Brian Lenihan announced the setting up of NIHE, Limerick.</P>
    <P>In 1970 Dr. Edward Walsh was appointed director and chairman of the planning board and in that same year the campus at Plassey was purchased.  The appointment, as has been indicated by Senator Bromell, of Dr. Edward Walsh was an inspired and, I believe, a wonderful choice.  I would like to take the opportunity of joining with the other Senators in congratulating Dr. Edward Walsh and all associated with the institution in Limerick.  I also congratulate the President of NIHE, Dublin, Dr. Danny O'Hare, and all associated with that institution for all they have done over these past years in advancing the cause of third level education in Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2223" /> The planning board adopted Europe as the academic planning theme and they decided to build the academic and management structures on the North American university model.  The underlying goals and philosophies of the Limerick college are well summed up in the following extract from a recent report from that college, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The NIHE mission is similar to that of other technological universities. From the outset it was the planning board's task to create in Ireland a new kind of university institution, relevant to the times and to the nation's needs, where students would be educated to the highest levels in the application as well as in the acquisition of knowledge. The Planning Board believes that professional competence is best fostered by a coupling of teaching and research and attention to real world problems.</P>
    <P>I would have wished that Senator Murphy was here now to see the balance.  There is no downgrading of the humanities of NIHE, Limerick.  There is a coupling of the humanities with the need for technology and research.  Thus, today in the University of Limerick education and related research continue to be a central purpose with relevance to the practical world as a guiding principle.  In 1972 the then Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, officially opened NIHE, Limerick and the first 100 students were admitted.  In 1974 NIHE, Dublin was established by the Government which was led by Liam Cosgrave and it was specifically stated that NIHE, Dublin should be, and I quote:</P>
    <P>a recognised college of the National University of Ireland with a capacity to envolve into a constitutent college or to become an autonomous degree awarding institution.</P>
    <P>The first component of the phase I complex of NIHE, Limerick was planned and approved for funding by the World Bank and was officially opened by the then Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave, in 1975.  The second component of the phase I complex <Col N="2224" /> was officially opened by the then Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald in 1985.</P>
    <P>Following an assessment by an international team in 1983, the European Investment Bank decided to finance this important project.  That decision was, I believe, of particular significance because it was the first higher educational project which the bank deemed acceptable for financing anywhere in the European Communities.  Subsequently, the Commission of the European Communities announced that it would make available a European Regional Development Fund grant of £7.5 million towards the cost of this project.  NIHE courses were designed from the outset with general features new to Ireland, many of them based on successful experience in the United States, including modular-credit structures which facilitate continuous assessment.  An important ingredient of the degree programme is, of course, co-operative education, under which all students are obliged to spend periods of employment in appropriate areas of industry, business and the professions during the course of the four year bachelor degree programme.</P>
    <P>In pursuing its mission, the University of Limerick recognises &mdash; and this is important for Senator Murphy to realise &mdash; that an appropriate balance should be struck between the sciences and the humanities.  Thus, students avail of the modular-credit system to undertake a portion of their studies outside their major field and faculty recruitment and development policies are directed towards achieving an appropriate balance between the academic and the applied. Some 98 per cent of students are placed in employment during the degree programme and the University of Limerick works with over 900 employers in placing students.  Indeed, I think it is interesting to recall here today that over 96 per cent of Limerick's graduates are placed within six months after graduation, 85 per cent go directly into employment and 11 per cent go on for further study.</P>
    <P>While basic research is considered essential, so also is the application of knowledge to real world problems.  Thus, <Col N="2225" /> while education and related research are the principal functions of the University of Limerick it is recognised that the University's resources and expertise can make a special contribution to the economic and social development of the country as a whole and, indeed, particularly to the Limerick and Shannon side region.  This role is made more concrete in the establishment of the Plassey Technological Park, again a first in Ireland and a first for Limerick, which is being developed on a site of 600 acres around the University of Limerick.</P>
    <P>State and private sector organisations combine to provide the physical and support infrastructure for international investment in high-tech manufacturing, indigenous high-tech start-up companies and international service businesses.  In short, the park provides an environment of enterprise and research on and around the University of Limerick which stimulates students and supports interaction between the faculty and their counterparts in industry and business and in the professions.  Indeed, the University of Limerick has significantly contributed to the location of international investment and development and high technology industries.  Of course, we would welcome more of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, of course, of particular interest to recall today that on 4 October 1985 the then Minister for Education, Deputy Gemma Hussey, in the course of a statement made in Limerick said:</P>
      <P>I know that the NIHE in Limerick, together with its Dublin counterpart have established themselves amongst the finest third level institutions in this country.  Their reputation, both at home and abroad stands high and their graduates are widely respected.</P>
      <P>It was indeed Deputy Gemma Hussey who announced the Government initiative to appoint an internal study group to advise on the future of NIHE Limerick and NIHE Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2227" /> The unambiguous findings of that international study group have clearly established that both NIHE Limerick and NIHE Dublin operate very effectively at university level and fully justify the conferring of university status upon them, and that it would be more appropriate to establish each NIHE as an independent university with the power to award their own degrees and to perform the normal functions of a university.</P>
    <P>Of particular significance at this time in the context of 1992 and thereafter, is the department of European Integration and Administration headed by Professor Ellis.  The name and activities of this Department reflect the new emphasis being placed on European political and economic development and the aim of creating a Single European Market by 1992.  A masters degree course on European Integration has been approved by the academic council and has been submitted to the European Commission under the Erasmus scheme for inter-city agreement.  Under this proposal, it will be possible for students to spend the third term of their MA degree course in residence in one of four selected campuses in the United Kingdom, Federal Republic of Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands.</P>
    <P>Of course, we have the international linkages with Limerick which continue to grow with universities, industry and business organisations.  Many of these linkages are stimulated by the European Community programmes.  For example, the University of Limerick, the University of Sussex and the University of Trent are linked under the Comett Programme, and special agreement has been signed with Cornell University &mdash; the largest of the Ivy League universities, and with the University of Helsinki in Finland.</P>
    <P>Finally, it has been truly said that one of the surest indicators of a community's quality of life is the quality of its educational opportunity.  I have no doubt that the setting up of these two new independent universities will convey to the international community Ireland's <Col N="2228" /> seriousness about industrial development. It will serve to emphasise the importance which Ireland attaches to excellence in learning and will highlight the capability and calibre of our higher education sector.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the introduction of this legislation.  I wish these two new universities and their presidents, Dr. Edward Walsh and Dr. Danny O'Hare, every success and congratulations for the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeEogan" hpid="Professor Eogan Professor Eogan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Eogan</NameTxt>
      <P>For higher education, we are certainly living in vibrant times at present.  The establishment of one university is indeed an occasion to rejoice but for two, a very special celebration is called for.  The bringing into existence of these two new universities is a very definite recognition by the Government of the significance they attach to higher education and the important role that higher education can play in developing and improving the lifestyles of all of us, either directly or indirectly, as well as the wider contributions that the universities can make to the wellbeing of the country.</P>
      <P>It is, indeed, important that higher education be made as readily available as possible to those who wish to benefit from it.  It should not be considered as something rarefied or elitist, but as an integral part of education as a whole.  From the times of the early monasteries and the monastic schools &mdash; as the Minister has already pointed out in her introductory speech &mdash; Irish people have valued education, and it is interesting that during difficult times, such as the period of the Penal Laws, education was one of the items that was hindered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the foundation of the State, Governments have made valiant efforts to improve the system.  With regard to third level education, there has been considerable innovation since the sixties. Part of this was occasioned by the realisation that it was essential to improve the level of technological training so as to increase the number of qualified persons. The main aim was to contribute to Ireland's industrial expansion which was <Col N="2229" /> in danger of remaining in the doldrums due to lack of trained personnel.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick and the national network of regional technological colleges in the early seventies represented a firm commitment on the part of the Government to make higher technical education of the highest standard available in areas, some of which were remote from existing centres of education.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision at that time was challenged on both economic and educational grounds.  However, the success of these colleges is now generally recognised both nationally and internationally, their graduates are obtaining employment in industry and in the professions, and their student places are highly sought after.  NIHE, Dublin, more recently instituted, is already establishing themselves as a place of important studies. NIHE, Dublin, has a high reputation in the areas in which it has chosen to specialise and is achieving international recognition as a centre of academic excellence.</P>
    <P>In the general scheme of developments, the NIHEs could be considered complementary to universities, but the Bills before the House today are to enable the status of the national institutes to be enhanced by becoming universities. An Act of the Oireachtas may create a university, but really it is the university that makes itself.  A change of name will not necessarily alter the resources available, courses provided or real rather than formal status for those institutions.  As the Minister also pointed out in her opening address, the term &ldquo;university&rdquo; may mean different things to different people but in general one can say that a university should be a place of higher learning that has power to grant degrees and a body of teachers and students as well, of course, as a physical element.  In this day and age with the growth and development of subjects it may not be possible to consider, as Cardinal Newman could in the middle of the last century, university as a place of universal learning but even if <Col N="2230" /> one cannot, that concept must surely be maintained.</P>
    <P>While both the Dublin and Limerick institutes have done excellent work, the courses they offer are limited in subject choice.  The emphasis is very much on the applied aspect of the subjects.  The art subjects are almost non-existent and that is a major omission in a university.  Other Senators have referred to the question of the Irish language.  From inquiries I have made, I could find no evidence that Irish is taught as a degree subject.  I find this extraordinary in view of the fact that it is our first language.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I assume that the new universities, as is the case with the established ones, will receive funds from the Higher Education Authority.  It is therefore relevant to draw attention to the fact that the HEA have a general duty with respect to national aims.  Section 4 of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971, states:</P>
    <P>In performing its functions, An tÚdarás shall bear constantly in mind the national aims of restoring the Irish language and preserving and developing the national culture and shall endeavour to promote the attainment of those aims.</P>
    <P>I hope, therefore, that these new universities and the HEA will take due cognisance of section 4 and thereby ensure that it will contribute in practical terms to the preservation and development of our national culture and the attainment of the national aims of restoring the Irish language.</P>
    <P>However, I am glad to see that the Bill provides that one of the functions of the universities shall be to provide courses of study or instruction in such fields as the governing bodies may deem appropriate. In view of what I have already said, I therefore trust, on educational as well as other grounds, that as a matter of urgency the governing bodies of both universities, when they come into existence, will initiate degree courses in the Irish language and literature and indeed that before long a wider range of subjects dealing with Irish civilisation will be <Col N="2231" /> included.  I am not saying that for the purpose of replacing existing courses but simply because I believe there are very sound educational reasons for so doing. In short, a university without a cultural dimension is incomplete.</P>
    <P>Courses that have been offered in the institutes &mdash; for instance, applied language courses &mdash; lack, as far as I can determine, a broad cultural aspect but I hope these problems will be overcome. The solution depends on society as a whole making the necessary investment in higher education and the universities themselves having the courage to provide a pattern of teaching and research activities designed not merely to satisfy narrow demands or attempts to provide solutions to immediate economic technical problems, though such cannot be neglected, but as a means of access for our young people to the wider culture of the humanities, languages and arts, without which education is restricted in scope and our national culture impoverished.</P>
    <P>We need the engineers, designers, accountants and marketing experts which our universities and national institutes of higher education are producing, but we also need a contact between these disciplines and the humanities so that a greater awareness of environmental and cultural factors will be available to decision-makers of the future.  A traditional university environment stimulates this activity.  Let us hope that our new universities will be provided with greater resources in the humanities so that they too can fulfil a similar role.</P>
    <P>I, like other Senators, feel very optimistic about our new universities.  I believe they will develop and grow in strength.  Nevertheless, I must say that the comparative position in other places can be a cause of worry.  To see this happening we have only to go a short distance up the road &mdash; just 100 miles or so.  In Belfast the distinguished Queen's University is being run down but simultaneously developments are taking place within the New University of Ulster which is situated in Coleraine and also at other centres.  To me this is a sort of <Col N="2232" /> contradictory system.  It is a robbing Peter to pay Paul attitude and that is to be deplored.  Again, in other countries, especially in Britain, there is evidence of the establishment of several new universities about 30 years ago.  There was a great period of creating universities in Britain then and virtually every town had to have its university, but now, 20 or 30 years later, what is the position?  Some of these new universities, and also the older ones, are now virtually starved of funding and in many cases departments are being closed down.</P>
    <P>In establishing new universities we must realise that universities, like other enterprises, cost money.  Although the Irish universities have a tradition of making do with much less funding, whether it be public or private, than many of their counterparts abroad, nevertheless in order to make then viable places, courses, academic standing and so on has to be maintained.  In order to play a proper and beneficial role in society, and taking into account the overall problem of national finances, financial stability within reason must be ensured. Some of this funding will come from student fees and more from external grants and sponsorship by individuals or industry. I think in this country, whether we agree or disagree, if these universities are to be viable places, the bulk of the funding will, of necessity, have to be provided by the State.</P>
    <P>In looking through both Bills I am particularly glad that research is given its rightful place.  Indeed, it is well integrated into the overall functions of the new universities.  Research and the pursuit of learning and the advancement of knowledge is central to university development.  A university that is solely a teaching establishment is not a university at all.  Universities must pursue knowledge, but they must also create it. Otherwise their role is devalued and they can be consigned to a much more peripheral role, that is places that simply receive knowledge but do not contribute to the emergence of new knowledge.</P>
    <P>It is essential and vital that the universities of Ireland are not only facilitated <Col N="2233" /> but their staff positively encouraged to play a key role in research.  Incidentally, I was recently told by an Irish physicist currently working in Germany that some industries there spend more on research than does the average Irish university. The results of research, in other words the creation of new knowledge which can benefit society as a whole, is a major contributing factor to the high living standards, the economic success and the financial stability which is a characteristic feature of West Germany today.  Surely this is a precedent which at least in part we can follow with advantage.</P>
    <P>I have been trying to find out how extensively the other Acts, especially the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, Act of 1980, refer to such matters as the appointment of staff and so on.  Certainly I got the impression that these two universities will not be independent as such in the appointment of staff, especially academic staff, but that this will be subject to the Minister.  This to me is quite new with regard to appointments in universities in western Europe at least.  If my interpretation is correct I consider this rather unnecessary and, if I may say so, it could lead to undue State influence in matters of university appointment. Surely the State has enough to do rather than getting involved in who may be the best person for a particular job?  I hope that would not now become something of normal acceptance.  It is important that universities be given independence.  Furthermore, it is very important that universities be trusted to carry out their duties in a proper way.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly referred to the NCEA.  This body have indeed been doing a good job and it was that council who heretofore validated NIHE awards. Of course, the NCEA is now losing this role and as a result it is vital that every effort be made to ensure their continued acceptability as an award-making body as they will continue to validate the RTCs and related collegiate awards.</P>
    <P>In this regard I would like to make another point.  At present NCEA regulations facilitate transfer from RTCs to the NIHEs of suitable students which <Col N="2234" /> enables them to obtain enhanced qualifications. I hope the continued existence of such facilities can be safeguarded, assuming, of course, that the students possess the necessary qualifications.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the centuries-old commitment to education which is a feature of Ireland.  Not only had we large centres of learning away back in the early Christian times &mdash; I am sure the Minister of State, for instance, knows Clonard quite well; he passes it on his way westward &mdash; but places like Clonard numbered among its scholars and students several thousand persons.  Incidentally, and relevant to modern developments in university education, it was these monks and scholars of early Ireland who spread learning to many parts of Europe in what was the dark ages.</P>
    <P>Therefore, Ireland going into Europe, which we have heard a great deal about in recent years, did not start with the Common Market.  The older tradition of learning not only for home consumption but even for consumption abroad is something we must value.  This was so clearly set out by An Cardinéil Tomás O Fiaich in his wonderful book &ldquo;Gael Scrínte san Eoraip&rdquo; which highlights the important role Irish scholarship played in uplifting Europe out of a sort of semi-barbaric stage and moving it on to a stage of higher civilisation.</P>

      <P>This is what our current universities, whether the established ones or new ones, should be doing.</P>
      <P>Speakers have referred to the ERASMUS programme and so on.  The exchange of students is most valuable and it, too, should play an important part in the development of modern educational systems in this country.  However, again we had not just to wait for recent years to bring these sorts of exchanges into being.  The mobility of students has been something the Irish universities have always valued and they always have tried to do something about it.  In this connection, I may mention the travelling studentships of the NUI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2235" /> To return briefly to modern times, the establishment of these two universities will, I hope, be of major importance for the country as a whole.  There is one other institute I would mention incidentally in this connection as it has not been mentioned heretofore, that is the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies.  This was brought about as a result of an incredible innovative development initiated by the then Taoiseach Mr. de Valera.  It was also established in the early forties which was a very dark period.  The establishment of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies could also in its time be looked at as a vote of confidence in the future, in the same way as the present universities can be considered as marking confidence in a future which will be to the benefit of all of us.</P>
    <P>It is in this context of confidence in the future that I view the establishment of the new universities.  In bringing them about, I sincerely wish to congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State and wish them well in their work for Irish education.  I hope this event, significant as it is, is only a beginning that will lead to further meaningful developments in higher education.  That does not mean taking over universities by the State &mdash; that is a totally different thing &mdash; and interfering in appointments, but it will include stability to enable the universities to grow and educate, to advance learning as a vital component of our educational system as a whole.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to extend my hearty congratulations and good wishes to what really makes a university, that is, the staff and the students.  They are to be complimented in both Limerick and Dublin.  In complimenting the staff and students of the new universities, perhaps I may also give a pat on the back partly to myself by saying we also have to compliment the established universities and the established centres of learning who, during some very difficult times, tried to keep the flag flying and ensured that Irish students were given a high training and that Irish research was kept abreast of, and indeed was better in some cases than <Col N="2236" /> other research carried out abroad.  In this context I welcome very much the establishment of these two universities and again I congratulate the Minister.</P>

      <P>Tá cuid mhaith le rá agam faoin dá ollscoil nua atá le bunú nó le leathnú amach as an reachtaíocht atá os ár gcomhair inniu.  Déanaim comhghairdeas leis na húdaráis san dá institiúid atá, mar a déarfá, fásta suas agus atá a ligean amach chun saol neamhspleách dá gcuid féin a bheith acu.</P>
      <P>I wish these new universities well, but I have to talk about this from my own perspective.  I am an academic in the less fashionable area of third level education. While I know from my own dealings with these two institutions that it is not intentional, very often the well meaning case which has been made for giving them university status reflects quite poorly on the work of the regional technical colleges in particular and to a certain extent on the Dublin Institute of Technology. The RTCs are not universities and they have no aspiration to be such, but we have a considerable body of knowledge which challenges some of the assumptions which have underlain the campaign to have these two institutions recognised as universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I teach on a degree course in chemical engineering which is internationally recognised.  We have not run into any insuperable problem with regard to employment, research access or international recognition for our graduates.  It may sound strange coming from me of all people but the final test of any professional course is the marketplace.  I know these two institutions have been successful in the marketplace.  I know also that the other areas of non-university education have been successful in the marketplace.  It probably needs to be said that both the NIHEs and the RTCs have needed less nudging and pushing from the State than the established universities in recognising that there is a market out there, that there is a national role of development and that there is a need to identify and respond to market needs. <Col N="2237" /> The NIHEs and the RTCs have contributed to a development of a perception of education which is not a replacement of education by training but which holds that part of the function of an education is to respond to market needs.  I will come back again to what market needs are. They can often be excessively delimited in a very simplistic way which can result in a perception of the function of third level education as being to provide specific training to enable people to do a specific job.  That is not the way the world will be in the future.</P>
    <P>I am a graduate of UCD and quite proud of that institution, but the established universities have sometimes a slightly árdnósach notion of their status in society.  They are important institutes of higher education and have contributed a considerable amount but it appears that they want to have the best of both worlds. To a certain extent Senator Eoghan raised this point.  They want extensive amounts of public funding to be used to keep them moving but they also want to retain the ethos of a private institution. This is also true of a considerable number of hospitals which apparently believe they are entitled to large scale public funding but equally large scale public inability to have a say in how they operate. We need openness in all these areas. It is not a matter of whether the State should interfere.  Interference, control, regulation or attempts to determine priorities by any institution which is funded by the State should be subject to public accountability and scrutiny and need public justification.</P>
    <P>One of my consistent concerns is the excessive secrecy in the way the public service, bureaucracy and Government operate.  Many of the concerns about what State interference could mean for a university are much more to do with quiet and private interference.  I do not mean corruption but the sort of nudges and hints that are never subject to public debate but which can often be used to influence university appointments.  I am often amazed by the spectacle of the extraordinarily intensive canvassing for university appointments.  Whatever may <Col N="2238" /> be said about the nature of appointments in the system where I operate, which is often condemned for being excessively politicised, I do not believe any candidate for appointment to an academic position in a regional technical college who conducted the sort of extensive personalised lobbies that go on for university appointments would even be deemed eligible for interview.  That level of canvassing would disqualify a person.  The universities, as well as other bodies, have an obligation to put their own houses in order.  The high level of lobbying for some university appointments that generates considerable mileage in the back pages of some of our newspapers is not a very edifying spectacle or a very good indication of the academic excellence and detachment that is supposed to characterise universities.  I would hope that such lobbying would be excluded either by law or by regulation from appointments to the two new universities and also from the process of appointment in existing universities.  It does not contribute to the image of the universities and it ought to cease if the universities wish to retain the perception of independance which they value and which is extremely important.</P>
    <P>I do not share the old liberal view that State involvement necessarily involves restriction on freedom.  This is a classic old chestnut which is articulated by some people, especially by an individual who is well known for his articulation of a consistently free market position about everything, including education.  Proper regulation and proper openness can facilitate considerable freedom within the area of State control.  I, as an academic within the State sector of education, have never yet found anybody attempting to inhibit me from saying anything I wish on any subject simply because I am an employee in the State sector.  I do not subscribe to the view that there is an all embracing, big brother State about to swallow institutions simply because we believe that those who are funded heavily by the State have a duty to respond to the needs of the community as perceived in its political institutions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2239" /> Why a university?  What is it that creates this mystique that somehow it is wonderful to be made a university?  I think of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology or Caltech, the California Institute of Technology, or the poly-techniques in the United Kingdom or the Imperial College in London which do not have the word &ldquo;university&rdquo; in their title. Are we in danger of funnelling ourselves into a very traditional view of what makes excellence in third level education by believing that there is this one word which creates a standard?  If we are really looking to the future and developing certain qualities in our educated workforce which are necessary to meet the almost becliquéd challenge of 1992, do we want to have one definition of what represents the upper plateau of achievement in third level education?  I do not think we should and I do not think we do.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the two very distinguished institutions which have contributed an enormous amount to innovation in Irish third level education, for reasons that I will go into later on, should believe that the only acceptable term that will define their status is the almost elitist term &ldquo;university&rdquo;.  There are other terms, other titles, which define excellence very well and which should have been considered.  Nevertheless I would not, for a second, dream of opposing this Bill.  I have reservations about the perception that universities are something unique.  I, for one, have no perception that there is an inherent reason academic standards, research standards, international acceptance, employment opportunity etc., are somehow going to be different because we put the word &ldquo;university&rdquo; into the title of an institution.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that from the time of the setting up of the NCEA, universities have been defined as the criteria of excellence for all NCEA awards, particularly degree awards.  I was not happy with that then. I believe that the market is the place to judge it.  It is important to remember &mdash; and I am sure the Minister of State can confirm this at some stage &mdash; that the <Col N="2240" /> word &ldquo;university&rdquo; in the United States in particular does not give any guarantee of excellence, and there are a considerable number of universities in the United States of America whose graduates would not be recognised by the Minister's Department if they applied for posts in either second or third level education in the public sector here because these institutions are not recognised as universities which have met a standard of excellence. If we are to look at the wider world it is important to remember that there are universities in the United States whose standards are not just not great but which are abysmally and appallingly low, and that there is a huge spectrum of performance within the university sector in the United States of America, and that the Department of Education is intimately aware in terms of assessing the equivalence of qualifications, of the difficulty of being sure that a degree from a university in the United States means the same thing as a degree from a university perhaps in this country or the United Kingdom.  We should not be convinced that university automatically means extraordinarily high standards.  There are other criteria, the best of which is the market place.</P>
    <P>In that context, while I know this is not intended, that it is not deliberate the fact that the National Council for Educational Awards will no longer be making awards in two of our major third level institutions, the fact that it does not make such awards for the Dublin Institute of Technology in most cases, will effectively result in some downgrading of the status of the NCEA.  It is as if everybody is going to rise up through this process and then when they reach a certain critical mass, escape from the National Council for Education Awards, and it will become a step on the road to real status as a third level institution.  That of course will make it very difficult to get the public at large to accept the fact that, for instance, degree courses in third level institutions which are under the aegis of the National Council for Educational Awards are really the same as degree courses from other institutions. It may, or it may not; but it seems <Col N="2241" /> to me that it will create a problem which only the market place can determine.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I think there are philosophical issues in this debate which deserve to be talked about a little.  We need to remember first that universities are places of education and so is the whole of third level education &mdash; and education for what?  It is all too easy to see it as education to do a specific job; but it is important to remember there is no such thing any more as a specific job, that the pace of change in the whole of industry, in services etc. is that in fact what we really should be educating people for is actually to accommodate themselves to the extraordinary pace of change that is going to take place.  One cannot train people today for jobs that may not exist in five years time because we do not know what is going to happen. Things are changing so rapidly.  It is necessary, obviously, to build in a basic groundwork of theory and of practice in any professional area but we ought to be dealing also with much deeper questions like problem solving ability, not how to do the problems that we have traditionally set people in technological courses.  We need to teach how to approach a totally new problem that one has never seen before.  There is an increasing amount of literature on this issue.  I am not talking about giving people sums that are similar to the ones they did before; I am talking about giving people the skill to use the basic knowledge they have in an entirely new environment. That is a difficult thing to teach. It is very demanding for the academic staff because it means a whole new way of examining people.  For instance, one starts examining people with questions that do not have a single unique solution. All of us in academic life, particularly on the technological side, set questions that have one answer because it is much easier to correct an exam that has only one right answer.  In the area of which I know a little &mdash; I do not wish to belabour the point but it is the only one on which I can speak with reasonable authority &mdash; if I supervise a student who has a design project, as they had this year, to design a <Col N="2242" /> large plant to produce monosodium glutamate, the first thing that is true is that there is not one right answer.  There cannot be one right answer.  There is a process of judgment about a whole lot of things in that design which would mean that there is a number of equivalent answers not one of which is necessarily uniquely correct.  Our job is to make sure, not that students get some one model answer correct, but that they learn how to take intelligent decisions based on the information that is available, that they learn to think, that they learn to analyse, that they learn to reflect, that they learn to search and that they learn then to take responsibility in an organised way for making judgments about the choices they have to make, and that is a much more difficult thing to inculcate than any specific knowledge about a specific topic. That is the core, in my view, of the development of a work force that is capable and continues to be capable of responding to change and to new developments.</P>
    <P>The other area is the question of what we are educating people for, and I will come back to this.  Again this may come as a surprise as it is not the sort of thing that is associated much with me, but I think that there is an enormous emphasis still in third level education on educating or training people for employment.  I would still detect, from what I know of my own students, or students within the institution within which I work, and indeed of students I know in other institutions, an overwhelming perception among those students that what they are going to look for in the short and even in the long term is a job.  We are not really beginning to dig into the possibility of educating people for enterprise, to do things themselves.</P>
    <P>I come back now to what we need for a climate of enterprise.  My view of what we need for a climate of enterprise is quite different from that of some of the right wing idealogues who pass through certain sectors of education.  We are not creating such a a climate.  Most of our students coming out of third level institutions still see themselves as looking for <Col N="2243" /> jobs, and that is not a complete or adequate solution to the country's needs. In the area of education we also need to keep in mind that when we give people a technological education it is not something that closes people's minds down to all sorts of other areas of life.  I get very irritated by the distinction made between academic work and applied work and the idea that somehow certain areas of academic life are more applied and some more academic.  All areas of education achieve certain objectives, I, for one, would far prefer to have had the engineering training I had, because it has equipped me particularly well for many of my activities in politics, than to have had a traditional arts-based non-quantitative, descriptive but very worthwhile education.</P>
    <P>Different areas of education can equip people for quite different things than the name of the course would suggest.  The whole emphasis of an engineering course is on pragmatic approaches to problems. I have a profoud belief that problems do not necessarily have ideal solutions, but they have solutions which must have one criteria, that is that they work.  I dislike the distinction between academic and applied work, as if the academic was the somehow slightly superior cerebral, wonderful, reflector, almost philosophic, side of education, and then there were the rest of us getting our hands dirty doing applied work.  I do not accept the distinction. I do not believe that there is almost an implied pecking order of what is really third level or university education, and then the other little bit that is slipped in at the end which to a certain extent is marginalised.  It is a matter of some regret that we have yet to see somebody from the engineering area becoming the president of a university, although we are moving in that direction.</P>
    <P>In the area of technological education there are certain assumptions and ideas that deserve to be challenged.  The first is that technology and science, engineering and applied science, are somehow magnificently detached, and are value free, <Col N="2244" /> that one can teach people to be engineers and scientists, giving them a pragmatic approach to the world without any idealogical baggage.  The one area which comes immediately to mind where that sort of a pseudo-intellectual detachment does not work is in industrial relations. Most people who get a technological, business or commercial training will almost immediately come up against one very human problem based on perceptions of human values, and that is industrial relations.  If some of the stuff coming out of certain eminent academics from the universities about trade unions for instance, represents an ideological perception which is any way widely held or widely inculcated into students at technology and business, they are in for a very severe awakening when they penetrate the real world of Irish business. People need to realise that inherited American perceptions of the role of trade unions will not work here and will only create conflict.  People will have to realise that business is a community of interests. We cannot forget about difficult things like people and train engineers and technologists to make things in some sort of dehumanised industrial environment.  No culture has succeeded in creating a high level of achievement and performance while ignoring the human side of industry and business.  There are different solutions to the problem but no country has succeeded without taking the human side into account.  Anybody who is under the illusion that our nearest neighbour has been successful in an enterprise culture which is unrelated to the people involved should have a closer look at its failure to actually produce much.  The United Kingdom has not been successful as a producer of goods.  It has been successful as a manipulator of money but not in terms of industrial production.  Neither, in the world market, has the US been successful.</P>
    <P>The value free technology needs to be elaborated on, because the biggest crisis that will face anybody working in the productive sector here, throughout Europe, in North America and in Japan for the next 25 years is the environmental <Col N="2245" /> crisis.  That challenges a series of the assumptions that all of us who have been educated as engineers and technologists grew up with.  It challenges the whole concept of growth, for instance, the unchallenged acceptance of growth forever which is the basis for a huge amount of technological engineering and scientific education.  It may not be possible yet to say with certainty that future growth is impossible, but it is becoming quite clear that the presumption that growth can go on forever in the way it has for the last 50 years, is to fly in the face of the fact that we live in a finite world.  The world does not have infinite resources, either infinite raw materials or resources, to absorb the by-products of continuing industrial growth.  If China and India, for instance, were to reach the levels of consumption of the United States of America, on the present way in which the US organises itself, the world would run out of energy and the oceans would be entirely polluted.  Two billion people living at American standards would devastate the world environment beyond recall.  We cannot therefore educate engineers and technologists in such a way that they can somehow keep their heads down saying that they are working for their industry to produce.  The social responsibility of industry, whether privately or publicly owned will be more heavily underlined as the world becomes more and more concerned about its future.</P>
    <P>An implied ideology of the free market which does not get people used to the fact that industry will have to live under severe environmental regulation, with severe environmental assessment and with severe penalties for failure to operate within the environmental standards specified, is flying in the face of reality. People must be educated to know that they will have to live in a world of regulation and that there will never again be a sort of glorious free market in which industries can produce.  They will be regulated and controlled at all levels.</P>
    <P>A value free technology which ignores where the raw materials will come from and where the waste products will go, is <Col N="2246" /> not on.  We may choose to ignore it but public opinion within the next ten years will insist that those in the productive sector will not be allowed to ignore it. There is no such thing as value free technology or science.  The basis for a value free technology assumes certain things which are no longer acceptable.  One cannot assume that there will be limitless access to all materials or to places to dispose of toxic substances.  Those days are over.</P>
    <P>Seeing that these two institutions are now becoming universities, I want it on record that people who have an elevated position in education have an obligation to operate at standards of intellectual analysis, knowledge and objectivity which reflect the ethos of those institutions. We would want to be very wary of ideology masquerading under an academic cloak, particularly the sort of ideology which gives us a model of the future based on a selective image of the US.</P>
    <P>We have had a lot of talk from certain people in academic life which would lead us to believe that there is only one model for development.  It is important to remember that within the industrial world there have been a variety of ways of achieving close to full employment, high living standards and high levels of environmental protection.  Some people in academic life have presented us with an image of a failed Europe and a Gloriously successful United States.  It is not true and it is less than worthy of the standards of academic excellence one is entitled to expect from eminent academics.  People are entitled to expect high standards from the pre-eminent figures in university education.</P>
    <P>Somebody mentioned that a lot of the new ideas in the NIHEs, soon to be universities, were based on American experience.  America, across the political spectrum, now recognises that it has a major educational crisis on its hands, that the standards in many of its third level institutions are far from adequate, that the level of illiteracy among its industrial workforce is a matter of considerable <Col N="2247" /> concern, that American industrial productivity have grown slower than in Japan, in Europe or in this country, and there is a problem in the United States with industrial production, and to foolishly focus our minds on a selective image of one country when there are countries all over northern Europe which have vastly cleaner environments, higher standards of living and dramatically lower levels of unemployment than the EC, Japan or the United States is not an academic exercise but rather a political exercise. If people wish to get involved in politics, let them, but they should not dress it up under the cloak of academic objectivity.</P>
    <P>Since we are talking about the universities we ought to address some of the deficits in current third level education.  I have already referred to the fact that one of them need to develop skills that one will encourage people to be enterprising rather than to direct themselves towards employment.  A second is the extraordinary neglect within third level education for our most important industry-agriculture. I find it astonishing that one cannot get a degree in farming.  I am not talking about the people who advise those who work in agriculture but about those who work in agriculture and do not have a plethora of qualifications, supports, third level or further qualifications.  We should have people with Ph.Ds not in agricultural science but in the business of agriculture.  We should have people with primary degrees in the business of agriculture. There is a feeling that this is a mysterious dark art which can only be passed on from father to child, or from mother to child, and that we cannot conceptualise or encapsulate it within education. It is a business like any other business where a certain amount of knowledge can only be acquired through experience but for which a large body of knowledge can be acquired through training and education.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the most successful agricultural economy in the world, that of New Zealand, has the highest proportion of people working in farming who <Col N="2248" /> come from non-farming backgrounds, much higher than this country and the rest of Europe.  They have a remarkably successful agricultural industry.  It is time the idea that we give people a year or two years training in an agricultural college in the belief that this makes them fit to be farmers, was got rid of.  We need people in the productive sectors of agriculture who are of the same academic standard as those who work in the chemical, food or any other industry.  There is a need for that level of academic excellence but to date this has not been achieved.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that if we are going to create an those of education which is based on what we need, then legal education needs to be looked at.  In the area in which I have some experience, engineering, all the professional engineering institutions recognise qualifications to degree level as qualifying people to work as engineers but it is astonishing that the legal profession do not recognise any third level qualification or any degree as qualifying people to work as solicitors.  They qualify a person to train as a solicitor but then they decide whether what one has done in university is good enough to let someone become a solicitor.  It seems that we should either drop basic degrees in law in universities, as they are wasteful, and encourage people to go straight to the law societies, or we should regulate the way they attempt to filter out people they regard as not having attained the required standard. It is extraordinary that having got an honours degree in law one has to prove once more that they know something about law.  This makes no sense.  The legal profession is no more than a self-regulatory profession protecting its own interests.</P>
    <P>All the aspirations and legal innovations in the world will not get away from the fact that third level education is hopelessly underfunded and because it is underfunded two things are going to happen.  Inevitably over time standards will be diluted and reduced.  The non-availability of substantial capital investment to re-equip and modernise laboratories and so on in universities will <Col N="2249" /> result in the dilution of standards in the longer term, and the continuing increase in the scale of fees is going to restrict further access to third level education.  It will not be too long before all the doctors will be able to get their sons and daughters into medicine because they will be the only ones who will be able to pay the fees.  We are moving towards that position.  This is socially unjust and in many of the areas where we need the best skills it is also, in terms of our industrial development, profoundly shortsighted.  It is a matter of some regret that we have moved to a position where funding for third level education is being restricted.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other points I would like to make.  A number of Senators have referred to the emphasis being placed on research.  I would like to make a clear point here.  If one takes a look at the OECD figures on research we will see that there is a fairly clear correlation between the level of non-military research expenditure and economic performance in those countries.  It is no surprise that Sweden has one of the highest levels of non-military R and D investment as a proportion of gross national product in the world.  It is no surprise either that we have one of the lowest, even though we are improving. In fairness, the Government have made some efforts to extend and develop the level of funding for research and development.</P>
    <P>The second thing to remember is that virtually all funding for research and development is paid for by public funding as it is paid by the taxpayers by way of grants or a write-off against tax.  Therefore, most research in any society is funded by the public.  We cannot get away from this fact.  There was a tendency, not on the part of the present Government, but on the part of the previous Government, to concentrate more and more on obtaining private funding for research and development.  There is no great evidence to suggest that this approach works.  Those countries which have tried to go that route have not been too successful.</P>
    <P>It is also necessary to emphasise that <Col N="2250" /> research ought not just be of the applied kind.  We need a good spectrum of fundamental research because it is out of fundamental research that new ideas come.  They may not come immediately, it may be years before they come, but if we do not invest in fundamental research we will simply end up trying to catch up on others' innovations by applying what other people have learned.  Therefore, what we need to do is encourage fundamental research, particularly in areas where we have resources, so that we may become the market leaders in some areas.</P>
    <P>Denmark, which is about the same size as Ireland, the last time I checked, had about two thirds of the world market in specialised medical analysis equipment because they developed a skill in that area which no other country could match. Other small countries have done similar things.  We cannot be good at everything and we cannot be specialists in every area, but if we do not develop a corpus of basic research in a number of areas we cannot and will not be able to develop a real industrial base.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer briefly to the Bill.  One of the things I have to say is a matter of some embarrassment.  My name is attached to amendment No. 4 but, on mature reflection, I wish to make it clear that while I put my name to the amendment some days ago I will not be supporting it.  Having done some further study it is now clear to me that I would actually be opposing the guaranteed right of three students to be members of the academic council&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Two of the amendments I wish to refer to are in the name of Senator Murphy. Amendment No. 1 reads, and I quote:</P>
      <P>In performing its functions, the University shall bear constantly in mind the national aims of restoring the Irish language and preserving and developing the national culture, and shall endeavour to promote the attainment of those aims.</P>
      <P>It is extremely important, in terms of what I said earlier on how we and our technologists and engineers develop this country, that we should not attempt to become a replica on a smaller scale of some other country.  Part of maintaining that sense of a confident self-image of our own individualism is an assertion that what is different about us is important.</P>
      <P>It is important not because we are better but because we are different and we have a right to be different.  We are different from the island to which we are nearest and we are different from the rest of Europe and from North America.  We have no desire to become like anybody else.  We have a desire to develop our own way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In conclusion, the Bill is a good Bill.  It serves some useful purpose. It has some defects and we can talk about those at greater length on Committee Stage.  I compliment the Minister. I am sure that it was a difficult decision to take.  It is a considerable act of faith in institutions to give them their independence and they have to live up to it. All the other universities will be watching their performance carefully.  Their record has been a considerable one and I look <Col N="2253" /> forward to watching the developments over the next number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief in my comments.  Many aspects have been covered by previous speakers this morning in welcoming this Bill to the House. I shall be supporting it.  I congratulate the Minister for bringing it before both Houses so speedily before the election period.  It is a great step forward.  As we all know, NIHE have provided a marvellous service and have had outstanding results over the past number of years. This is an historic day in the Seanad because not since the foundation of the State, as the Minister said, has a new university been established.  We all know the importance of education.</P>
      <P>Standing here humbly, I am the first non-university Member of the Seanad to say a few words on this Bill.  As the Minister quite rightly said, the high international standards of Irish graduates is something of which we can be justifiably proud.  As we enter the post-industrial, information era, the quality of education is of strategic importance here.  As one who frequently travels all over the world I can definitely vouch for the recognition given to Irish students.  Young people going abroad nowadays get an incredible response from industrialists and from people in the commercial world in particular. The new Irish are the most sought after of English-speaking people, as far as I know, anywhere in the world.  It endorses our educational system at third level, and indeed second level.</P>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the congratulations given to everybody concerned. I compliment the speed with which this Bill has been brought before us.  A former Minister for Education, Deputy Brian Lenihan, now our Tánaiste, was mentioned in connection with the Bill.  It was a tremendous thing to see the former and the present Minister, brother and sister, being involved in this legislation.  It speaks highly for their foresight and vision.  May I wish the Tánaiste a speedy recovery and return to the next Dáil.  It is only fitting that his name should be associated with this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2254" /> The Government are conscious of the clear benefits which will be derived from the enactment of this legislation.  They treat this as serious legislation.  I hope we shall pass this Bill today.  The establishment of two new universities is a tremendous achievement.  It shows great confidence in the future.  As many speakers have said, including Senator Eogan, it would have been a tremendous achievement to propose one new university here today but to propose two calls for a double celebration.  I congratulate the Minister and her Minister of State for bringing this Bill before us and I shall support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be an unusual chorus of unanimity, which I am sure the Minister welcomes.  In extending congratulations to her on introducing this Bill, let me be the first person to remark on the fact that it is most appropriate that this Minister should introduce this Bill, not merely because her distinguished brother, the Tánaiste, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to a certain extent laid the basis of this with the establishment of the NIHE both at Limerick and Dublin, but also because the Minister is a member of what I consider to be a most honourable profession.  Like myself, she is a teacher. The Minister has a distinguished background and a great commitment to education.</P>
      <P>I welcome also the fact that the heads of the two new universities were present earlier in the day.  It would perhaps be useful, not just in terms of this debate but of other debates, where we have members of the general public who are particularly interested and especially distinguished with an expertise in the matter, if a committee system were developed which would permit them to place their views directly on the record of the House, which I understand and anticipate in this case would be very positive, indeed.  That might be a useful departure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I started by welcoming the Bill.  In one or two of the speeches of my university colleagues, there was just the slightest tinge of territoriality.  I had a feeling that <Col N="2255" /> they considered that the development of another university might perhaps threaten the regional interests.  I should like to place on record that I do not believe that at all.  I do not see myself as a Thatcherite capitalist and I am not an espouser of the free market forces, but it is observable that when you develop resources such as this, if you engender some degree of competition you stimulate an appetite rather than extinguish it. One appetite which is remarkably characteristic of the Irish people is, I am glad to say, an appetite for education.  As a representative of one of the universities of Dublin, I greatly welcome this development.  It is an appropriate recognition of the academic excellence of these two bodies.  It is not for me to say this.  It has been confirmed by a very distinguished panel of experts established by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I wish to place on the record two letters which I possessed myself of this morning from the board of Trinity College, Dublin, the first addressed to Doctor O'Hare, President NIHE (Dublin) (University Designate) and &mdash; as of this afternoon &mdash; the university in full, Glasnevin, Dublin 9.  The letter is dated 13 January 1989 and states:</P>
    <P>Dear Dr. O'Hare,</P>
    <P>I have great pleasure in conveying the warmest congratulations of the Board of Trinity College, recorded at its special meeting held today, to you and through you, the Governing Body, staff and students, of your new University on their achievement.</P>
    <P>We look forward to many more years of co-operation in serving the needs of the nation and of the city and we wish you every success in meeting the challenges which face all universities at this time.</P>
    <P>A similar letter was sent on the same date to Doctor E. Walsh, President of NIHE, Limerick, also a university designate.  It states:</P>
    <P>Dear Dr. Walsh,</P>
    <P>I have great pleasure in conveying <Col N="2256" /> the warmest congratulations of the Board of Trinity College recorded at its special meeting held today, to you and through you, to the Governing Body, staff and students, of your new university on their achievement.</P>
    <P>In common with your sister institution in Dublin, we look forward to many more years of co-operation in serving the needs of the nation and we wish you every success in meeting the challenges which face all universities at this time.</P>
    <P>It is important to place these letters on record so that there will not be any feeling that the existing universities feel specially threatened.  As a university teacher, my personal experience of both these universities, although it has been principally at the level of student rather than staff, has placed me in a position to state that they are of the very highest calibre, Particularly in regard to NIHE, Glasnevin, I have had frequent dealings with the course in journalism and communications for which I have the highest regard.</P>
    <P>Limerick is not universally regarded, for historical reasons because of the prominence of certain attitudes and events, as the most advanced city in Ireland. However, at the same time, somewhat to my surprise, about ten or more years ago when I wrote to many of the libraries enclosing booklets and asking for their response in an area relating to a growth in understanding of the social and political impact of developments in the sciences of human sexuality, I received only three positive replies, one from the library of the Royal Dublin Society, one from a library in Howth and &mdash; the best of all &mdash; from NIHE, Limerick.  That made me sit up and pay attention because they took the trouble to go through the library, to see what books they had and to write to explain that they would be grateful for information in this area.  Obviously, I was suggesting books of scientific, social and political value, nothing sensational, and that institute showed a remarkably responsible attitude which I greatly welcomed. For that reason, I am particularly <Col N="2257" /> glad to see section 6 in the Bill concerning the Dublin City University.  In the Bill concerning the University of Limerick, section 7 covers the point dealing with library facilities.  It extends the Copyright Act and this is exceedingly important.  I have a personal interest in it because I am chairperson of the Friends of the Library of Trinity College, Dublin. Among the most important resources for universities is the question of the provision of library facilities, and these sections in the two Bills extend the provision of the Copyright Act to the new universities of Limerick and Dublin.</P>
    <P>However, I draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that library facilities are expensive and there is really not much point in extending the privileges of the Copyright Act to the new universities unless she is sure that adequate funding will be made available for library resources.  I am not merely speaking of the administration of the library in terms of staff, seating arrangements and so on, but even the storage of books has become an increasingly expensive matter.  I am taking a European perspective because I do not wish it to appear that my own university is poor-mouthing all the time. I know that sometimes the operations of Copyright Acts can be almost an embarrassment because so much is published and then there is a requirement on the universities to provide adequate storage facilities as well as adequate access to the material stored.</P>
    <P>This is a historic moment as it is the first establishment of universities by this State.  I welcome the Minister's exceedingly scholarly and fascinating survey going back to very early times about the development of universities and the university idea.  I will not go through this in any extended way because it would perhaps be repetitive.  Perhaps the Minister would like to have a chat about it at another stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In the medieval period there was a university in Dublin.  It was established at Saint Patrick's Cathedral <Col N="2258" /> and this fact is acknowledged to this day because Saint Patrick's Cathedral &mdash; of which I am a parishioner &mdash; is known as the Collegiate Church of Saint Patrick's. It had a university and the capacity to confer degrees.  I am not quite sure how many it conferred or in what subjects, I imagine they were pretty remote from anything we are likely to experience today, but it has continued the academic tradition at second level.  Over the last year or so the Taoiseach opened a very fine new grammar school associated with the cathedral which has existed since the 15th century.  That is a very fine record.</P>
      <P>I speak from within the academic community and questions in some documentation I received from briefings studies from different interest groups suggest differences in emphasis and &mdash; almost &mdash; differences in quality between different kinds of universities.  This also applied to the notion about technological universities.  The contribution of what was &mdash; until this afternoon &mdash; NIHE in the technical areas has been exceedingly important but I believe that both the NIHE system and the more conventional university system are approaching each other at a fairly steady rate.  I do not think it would be a good idea to run away with the notion that universities like Trinity College, Dublin, and the National University of Ireland were liberal arts universities in their principal emphasis.</P>
      <P>Universities must pay their dues to society as well as, of course, maintaining the core idea that pure learning, without any immediately discernible practical application, must be something that can be sustained.  One of the areas dealt with in some length by a number of organisations, with which I have been in contact, and by Senator Brendan Ryan in his contribution in the capacity of engineer, was in regard to the engineering schools of universities.  I say this with some pride because engineering has been an important element in Trinity College for a very long time.  The establishment of the Chair of Engineering in that university in 1842 was among the first such chairs in the world to be established.  That is a record of which this country can be proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2259" /> I am very glad to be able to say that my university has not been at all snobbish in its approach &mdash; not just to the NIHEs but to the Dublin Institutes of Technology in Kevin Street and Bolton Street. If you look at the table of primary engineering degrees obtained in 1984, for example, you will see that University College, Dublin, conferred 169; University College, Cork, conferred 127; University College, Galway, conferred 132; Trinity College, Dublin, conferred 140; DIT conferred 210; NIHE, Dublin, conferred 27 and NIHE, Limerick, conferred 146.</P>
    <P>However, it is the University of Dublin which confers degrees for the Dublin institutes of technology.  If one takes that into account one will find that virtually one-third of the engineering degrees conferred in 1984 were conferred through the machinery of Dublin University because of the co-operation and recognition of standards by my university of the Dublin institutes of technology.  It is worth making the point that there is, perhaps, less intellectual snobbery in the university system than is sometimes perceived from outside.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that in the document I received from the Irish Federation of University Teachers there is a certain priority, a ranking given to aspects of university life.  It is interesting to me that this is echoed in the phraseology employed by the Minister.  The document refers to a reasonable balance attached to teaching, research and involvement in commercial or industrial affairs.  I am glad that that document, like the two Bill before the House today, mentioned first of all teaching.  Tribute has been paid to research and development and that is very important.  In my opinion it is important particularly in the sciences.  I happen to believe that it is less important in the Arts.  Sometimes, particularly with the American PhD system, there can be a substantial distortion of the proper approach to a work of art simply by virtue of the requirement for the awarding of this degree of special qualities of originality. Frequently, the these I am <Col N="2260" /> forced to read have more originality than the works of art upon which they are supposed to be based.  There is a substantial distortion there.</P>
    <P>As a teacher I can say that there is far too little emphasis, credit and appreciation, shown to those of us who love teaching, who enjoy teaching and who think it is at least as honourable a vocation and as efficient a method of transmitting information from one generation to another as the solitary pursuit of learning in the interests of the promotion of one's own career.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has given some degree of recognition to this, as have the Irish Federation of University Teachers. I am surprised that they did give it that recognition and I suspect that it may have been accidental but, perhaps, I may be misjudging them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, in terms of promotion within the university system almost no recognition whatever is given to the art of teaching.  I regret that but there are other methods of promoting oneself, as the Minister and I are aware as teachers and politicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan mentioned his delight at having studied engineering almost, as I understood it, to the exclusion of arts.  I would not denigrate engineering; I have spoken in glowing terms of it with regard to the Chair of Engineering in Trinity College, Dublin.  My father was an engineer and an inventor and it would ill-behove me to denigrate that profession. However, as an undergraduate I had experience of a system which has, unfortunately, passed away.  Under that system people undertaking degrees in medicine, engineering and other science subjects had to take a subsidiary course in the arts.  People taking arts degrees had to take a subsidiary course in a subject with even a remotely scientific background.  I benefited from that.  I cheated a little because the subject I took was philosophy and there is a great area for debate as to <Col N="2261" /> whether philosophy is practical, metaphysical or scientific, although we did suffer the affliction of logical calculus and all the rest.  In my view it is valuable to have a broad education.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to make one or two points about the Bills.  I notice that when some of my colleagues, and myself, say, &ldquo;in conclusion&rdquo; or &ldquo;finally&rdquo; we go on for about another 45 minutes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Senator has admitted that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to.  I believe in acknowledging my own weaknesses, particularly when I am allowed, while acknowledging those weaknesses, to acknowledge those of other people in a more emphasised fashion.  A very important point was raised by Senator Murphy in regard to the ultimate impact of this legislation.  He was perfectly correct in saying that the passing of these Bills will lead to University College, Dublin looking for an adjustment of its position within the framework of the National University of Ireland.  I could not begrudge them that.  With the development of three universities in Dublin it might be seen as inappropriate that University College, Dublin, a very distinguished university, should appear to be tied, in, in any sense subsidiary to some kind of national university framework. I could quite understand their sensitivities in regard to that.</P>
      <P>I do not believe there will be any sense of territoriality on the part of Trinity College with regard to whatever developments may take place independently with UCD.  Again, I have had very good experience of co-operation by being chairperson of the International Joyce Symposium on two occasions &mdash; I will be again in 1992 &mdash; and once more there will be full co-operation for the third time between Trinity College, Dublin and University College, Dublin in the international celebrations surrounding the works and life of James Joyce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, this raises a much more delicate question from these benches, as my colleagues Senator O'Toole and others <Col N="2262" /> have registered.  The development of two new universities, which we all welcome, we hope will mean more rather than fewer Senators.  If we have more universities surely we should make provision for more Senators.</P>

I am jealous of my own position and it is important that the distinctive representation of the different universities should be maintained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That might be an excellent outcome.  It would be a pity if the contribution of the university Senators was diluted.  Some unfortunate adjustments were considered at the time of the Seventh Amendment of the Constitution. They envisaged a kind of mega-constituency in which six seats would continue to be up for election but the constituency would be an enormous one with about 150,000 voters.  It would be worse than the elections to the European Parliament. That would make it very difficult for the differing traditions, represented by the different universities, to be properly enshrined in the Oireachtas.  I say that is a totally non-sectarian fashion.  It is not a question of registering a specific religious interest because we have had a complete change to the situation that existed when I was an undergraduate at Trinity when it was a protestant middle-class institution, and quite a small one. It has become an institution that really reflects for the first time the position in the country.  About 80 per cent of our students and probably a majority of our staff, are from the majority tradition in the country.  That is only appropriate and yet there is, perhaps because of the background, because of the ethos of Trinity <Col N="2263" /> which has positive and negative things about it, a detectable, slightly different atmosphere which allows room for manoeuvre.  That is not always the case in the other universities.  I am thinking, for example, of the development of the faculty of theology in Trinity.  When I was an undergraduate basically it was a Church of Ireland divinity school.  Whatever else it said it was, it was actually the Church of Ireland divinity school.  It is now a faculty of theology, the head of which is a very distinguished former Roman Catholic priest.  This is a very important matter.</P>
      <P>I give the Bill a very positive welcome. Before I sit down I should like to hazard the possibility of a reproof of referring to the principle of the amendment.  Like Senator Brendan Ryan, I signed it blissfully unaware, because of the speed at which events have overtaken us, of the fact that our amendment which was intended positively would make insecure the position of student representation.  I take on board the fact that the Minister in her treatment of the legislation has instituted student representation on the academic council.  This is an exceedingly good thing.  Obviously they cannot have majority representation &mdash; that would be quite wrong &mdash; but the institutionalisation of student representation in this legislation is to be welcomed.  The Minister in her speech said:</P>
      <P>I am fully committed to the concept of student involvement in all aspects of the operation of the institutions they attend.</P>
      <P>As a tutor in the University of Dublin, Trinity College, Dublin, I wholeheartedly concur with the Minister and I will certainly withdraw my support for that amendment.  I am sure the proposer will have a lot to say on this as well&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I cannot help it if this sometimes overcomes me.  I should like to end with one minor hesitation which <Col N="2264" /> in a way is impertinent of me because it is partially on behalf of University College Dublin and I have not had an opportunity to consult with them about this.  This hesitation refers to the naming of Dublin City University.  Trinity College actually confers degrees as the University of Dublin.  University College Dublin is another distinguished third level university. Now we are going to have the University of Dublin, University College Dublin and Dublin City University.  I am sure this can all be worked out and that there is no legal complication, but I fear for the sanity of the post office sorters and those in the administration of the universities who will get mail marked DCU, U of D, UCD, or DUC.  I am sure that the combinations even with three possibilities, each containing three variable letters, is infinite.  I am not good at arithmetic, it was not one of my prime subjects, but I wonder if this was the happiest choice for the recognition, by name, of the excellent work done by the National Institute of Higher Education at Glasnevin.  However, having said that I have to congratulate the Minister and say that I, like others, greatly welcome this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Minister to the House and to congratulate her on bringing forward this legislation which proposes to confer independent university status on the National Institutes for Higher Education in Limerick and Dublin.  As Senators have indicated, in the years since these institutions were established they have achieved a standing among students, parents, industry and commerce comparable with any academic institution in Ireland, or indeed overseas.  This is based on the range and quality of their courses, their interaction with industry during undergraduate placements, their contacts with other similar institutions in Ireland, Europe, the UK and the United States and their very comprehensive research programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the very high level of competition for admission to the RTCs.  I read recently that 32 per cent of <Col N="2265" /> first year students in the NIHEs had six or more Leaving Certificate honours. That is as fine a tribute as one could pay to any institution.  The Minister also referred briefly to the role of her brother, Deputy Brian Lenihan, when he was Minister for Education.  I should like also to comment on his role and vision and to make the point that his vision has proved very accurate indeed.  I should like to take this opportunity, and I know he is making very steady progress, to wish him well in the future.</P>
    <P>These new developments we are talking about here today may well have some implications for the rest of the third level sector, particularly the regional technical colleges in which I have a particular interest.  The Minister was chairperson of my local regional technical college and she took a particular interest in that institution. The NIHEs have held a significant position within the NCEA award structure as the principle institution offering degrees at all levels.  This gave a certain status to the NCEA qualifications and was supposed to provide an avenue whereby graduates from the RTCs could transfer to degree programmes.  I understand that in many cases this proposal has not worked as well as it should.  I intend to comment on this later on.</P>
    <P>Because of the changes I have referred to, I believe there is a requirement for us to look at three areas: (1) the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology; (2) the links with the university system and (3) the new role of the NCEA.  With regard to the first point, I believe the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology will be regarded as providing the second tier of third level education.  We all know this is a great success but if they are to continue to provide a fine range of services in terms of new specialised short courses for industry and research and development programmes, we will have to examine their position in greater detail.  They have been in existence for 20 years and I believe many of their laboratories, research facilities and instrumentation programmes may need to be updated.  I am pleased also &mdash; and I am <Col N="2266" /> glad to note the Minister referred to this &mdash; that there will be legislation to deal with the autonomy of the RTCs, which should still retain their links with the VEC system.  They may need an adequate management structure to reflect the importance of the RTCs and the DIT within the community.</P>
    <P>The second point I referred to were the links with third level institutions. While the idea of direct transfers from the regional technical colleges to the NIHEs was good, it did not work in some cases. The level of exemptions given in some instances to certificate and diploma holders has not been satisfactory and in many cases has not matched, as I understand it, the level of exemptions given by universities both here and in the United Kingdom.  This is reflected by the growing number of links which have developed between the regional technical colleges and universities and polytechnics in England and the very successful transfer arrangements which have been developed by them.  This is food for thought and something we might consider in the future.</P>
    <P>My third point referred to the role of the NCEA.  The Minister referred to this in her speech and paid credit, and rightly so, to the NCEA and their awards at all levels of certificates, diplomas and degrees.  However, I wonder if there is now a need to re-evaluate the role of the NCEA.  At present it has both an accreditation and award responsibility. Our colleges have matured and developed over the years and there is now no need for the same level of supervision by the NCEA.  I would be of the opinion that in the future they may well have an accreditation role only, with the colleges evaluating their courses and appointing their own external examiners. Indeed, if one examines that prospect somewhat further one may well discover that that could be done with some saving in costs to the various institutions.  Perhaps the legislation referred to could be taken on board as part of that legislative process.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the <Col N="2267" /> National Institutes of Higher Education on their fine achievements and wish them well in their new role.  At the same time I would hope we would be able to give the regional technical colleges &mdash; dear to the Minister's heart &mdash; extra help in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>In an amendment mentioned by Senator Norris there is representation on the part of the student body.  I can say positively that what the Minister is doing here is totally consistent with what she has advocated over the years.  At one stage, as chairperson of the Westmeath VEC, the Minister was responsible for implementing observer status for students attending the RTC in Athlone. Therefore, it will be clearly seen that the introduction of these two Bills is consistent with her thoughts over the years. From my experience of student representation, when I had the honour of being a member of the Governing Body of UCD for six years, I can say that student representation on that board worked very well indeed.</P>
    <P>While the provision of these Bills represent amending legislation, they are very welcome indeed.  It is my opinion that they will further serve to emphasise to the world the enormous importance this country attaches to excellence of learning and will fully highlight the importance and capability of our educational sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>As the final contributor to this debate, much of what I wanted to say has already been said. However, I want to be associated with all the congratulatory remarks in regard to the various interest groups involved.  My endorsement of those remarks can be taken as read because I understand the Minister is somewhat constrained by time.  It would be important to put on the record of the House the vigilance, concern, interest and welcome by the Irish Federation of University Teachers to this development and their input.  They appear to represent a group forgotten in the course of the discussion here earlier <Col N="2268" /> and in the various expressions of congratulations.</P>
      <P>The introduction of these two Bills represents a critical step forward, a merging of the old and the new, of the traditional and the modern, of the classical and technological, in what I consider to constitute the most exciting development to date in Irish education.  While it is a development that has taken place at third level, it impinges on education at all levels.  In so saying I want to deal with its effect on the community at large.  I was very much taken by the amendments to these Bills in the Dáil whereby trade union and educational interests were added to the provisions of particular sections.  It is more than important that that type of recognition or representation be accorded in the establishment of a university.  I have criticised colleges and universities as they have pertained to date, as having been totally remote from the community they were meant to serve.  Therefore I welcome the amendment of the Principal Act by the substitution of the following paragraph in section 3 which reads:</P>
      <P>... the pursuit of learning and the advancement of knowledge through teaching, research and collaboration with educational, business, professional, trade union, cultural and other bodies ...</P>
      <P>which represents a magnificant step forward. I want to state quite clearly that the Minister should be credited with accepting that amendment in the Dáil because it is a progressive move and I welcome it as such.  As somebody who frequently has been critical of the Minister, I give her credit where such is due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About an hour ago I was sitting listening to this debate in my office.  I am sorry Senator Cassidy is not present to defend himself because I always cringe when I hear people say: business people worldwide have tremendous respect for the high standards obtaining in Irish colleges. This development or initiative has arisen precisely because the business community in this country reneged on their responsibility to the community at large. I will develop that argument at some <Col N="2269" /> length.  What we are seeing take place today is a merging of the old, pure science with new, applied science &mdash; the old, pure science by which people pursued knowledge, which approach was considered to be the pinnacle.</P>
    <P>We established the regional technical colleges some years go with the idea of taking what people had learned by way of pure science, apply it and, in so doing, develop technology.  We were forced to do so on account of the lack of investment on the part of the business and manufacturing community here in research and development.  What we are witnessing here today &mdash; which is to their credit &mdash; is the educational sector filling the vacuum created by the abysmal performance on the part of the business sector here.  I do not want to make a large political point out of this but I do feel people should recognise that fact.  That can be ascertained from a cursory glance at the amount we spend in this country, in manufacturing industry, on research and development.  Not alone are we the worst in the European league but we are £50 per cent worse than the next in the overall league.</P>
    <P>What we are witnessing here today is a proper bridge between education and work.  When I hear people speak at management conferences and the like about creating a bridge between school and work, closing the gap between education and the jobs market I become extremely annoyed.  Such people never advert to the fact that such constitutes half the jump only.  The jump from education in order to prepare students for jobs and job creation warrants further investigation at the manufacturing level, further research and development in order to create additional jobs, again to which the educational sector can respond, and so the vicious circle continues.  Unfortunately, the business community here seek to have the educational sector subservient to their needs without at all recognising their responsibility in that area.  I should like to develop that argument at some length.  I recognise the time constraints on the Minister and shall refrain from so <Col N="2270" /> doing.  However, it is an important point to be made.</P>
    <P>I might make another point about degrees and qualifications <i>vis-á-vis</i> the National Institutes of Higher Education over the past ten years.  It has been to their credit that students leaving their colleges and their qualifications have been widely accepted.  I have never heard any comment about the qualifications or degrees from the National Institutes of Higher Education other than to the effect that they were excellent.  However, I would advocate that the cost should be borne in mind.  This may be striking a somewhat negative note.  I recognise the pressures placed on the authorities in both colleges over the past ten years in making their names.  However, the cost has meant intense pressure having been placed on their teaching and lecturing staff in order to maintain a very high, perhaps an artificially high standard.</P>
    <P>In an informal discussion I had with the Minister last year I brought to her attention the fact that I was concerned at the huge drop-out rate, when I informed her that many excellent students were not attaining the standard demanded of them by the National Institutes of Higher Education. It is my belief that that was done in an attempt to create a very high standard, placing those institutes beyond any shred of negative or critical comment.  I contend they did not need to do so, that nobody had anything but the height of respect for anything they had done. However, it has to be said that there have been casualties over the past six or seven years, which is regrettable.  In fact I have met some good people who have been casualties.  I do not know the Limerick institute that well.  I have visited the National Institute of Higher Education &mdash; that is the last time I shall refer to it as such &mdash; in Glasnevin on a number of occasions and was most impressed by everything I saw there.  It would be my hope that we can now relax somewhat, allowing students enjoy their studies there.  That is another reason I too welcome student representation.  I will explain my position in that respect more clearly on the relevant amendment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2271" /> I have said it is not just a community of scholars directed towards knowledge and truth: a university must be more than that, it must be relevant.  We have seen that here today.  We have seen a new institution in the ancient context of learning as outlined at some length and in great detail by the Minister this morning. I will not try to go through those points at present.  It is important that we recognise &mdash; as Senator Murphy said this morning &mdash; that there are not two kinds of universities.  My hope is that both the traditional university and the new university we are setting up will become closer over the years in terms of how they operate.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new development today for another reason.  It has put pressure and has created a new climate for the traditional colleges.  That is important. We have a tradition in this House not to mention the absence of people, but I must say I was less than impressed by the lack of representation from NUI both here today and in the Dáil last week.  I thought the welcome might be a little more effervescent to say the least.  I represent the NUI and I will be bringing that to their attention.  I feel somewhat embarrassed by that fact.  It also worries me that a special meeting of the Senate of the NUI was called simply to consider the impact of these colleges on the existing colleges.  What impact?  It creates more learning.  It creates more involvement. It is new, it is bubbly, it is progress and it is to be welcomed for those reasons.</P>
    <P>I am the only person being in any way negative but I am trying desperately to balance the debate.  I have difficulty with certain items in terms of the control by the Minister of appointments, particularly the appointments to influential positions within the colleges, which she still retains.  I do not think that is right. This type of academic institution should have total discretion over staffing arrangments.  I think the Minister should have discretion over the financial arrangements and the amount of money <Col N="2272" /> made available.  As an elected public representative I think it is right that the State should hold the purse strings but the discretion to make appointments should be purely within the power of the governing body.  I feel very strongly about that and I will be developing it when we come to the amendments.</P>
    <P>I also want to make mention of two other points.  The Minister mentioned the need for academic interaction &mdash; I cannot remember the precise phrase &mdash; between the colleges being set up today, the new universities, and other places abroad.  I have outlined my views at length in other areas, including the Finance Bill, that we need to have educationalists working in another environment, being subject to other systems, swapping ideas, meeting different students and subjecting themselves to different pressures, needs and demands.  That is vitally important.  I know the Minister is supportive of this idea but we have not actually done it.  I do not see teachers moving to France for a year and somebody else coming back and replacing them here.  I know this has gone through the European Parliament and that there is agreement in principle in the Council of Ministers, but it has not actually happened.  Why do we not just do it?  Why can we not organise it?  I could organise two exchanges next month if the Minister would approve them and then let somebody else find out why.  Let us do a Donagh O'Malley on it &mdash; let us agree to do it and let somebody else work out the details afterwards.</P>
    <P>I feel that the words in the speech about the need for academic interaction were aspirational.  In terms of referring to academic interaction I have noted that NIHE Limerick &mdash; as it still is, I must get the terminology right &mdash; has academic links with the Ben Gurion University in Tel Aviv.  That raises certain worries for people like myself &mdash; not that I should be worried in any sense &mdash; but I always wonder where one makes the first contact and if that reflects any particular kind of thinking.  I am telling myself that it does not.</P>
    <P>Because there is this academic connection with the Ben Gurion University <Col N="2273" /> in Tel Aviv, may I say that that type of interaction could be harnessed, utilised and directed to influence the opening of those universities in the occupied territories very close to Tel Aviv which are closed at present.  That kind of development would be very useful.  I hope we would use our missionary zeal &mdash; as we have done over the years &mdash; to get positive developments, even politically, from this academic interaction.  I have endeavoured to outline from the beginning of my short contribution that we must harness academe to represent the rest of us in political terms.  I would ask the authorities in Limerick to consider using their influence to exert some pressure on the appropriate authorities for reopening those third level academic institutions which are closed at present in the occupied territories close to Tel Aviv.</P>
    <P>The final point I should like to raise &mdash; and it is one that has been raised by all the University Senators on the broad general question of how it affects ourselves &mdash; is the representation in this beautiful building which we are all threatened with leaving at present.  In this beautiful building we have representatives from the universities.  I would like to ask the Minister a question. In the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution we changed the representation. The representation now is &ldquo;the universities mentioned above&rdquo;&mdash; the NUI and Trinity &mdash;&ldquo;and also any other institutions of higher education in the State&rdquo;. I have been pondering for months and months what exactly that means.  Does it mean that subsection (1) relates to the universities and that the next subsection relates to other institutions?  If it does, that would effectively rule out representation from the new universities, which we are creating today, and that would be nothing less than tragic.</P>
    <P>The Minister can read the language the same as I can, but I think it can be read another way &mdash;&ldquo;the universities mentioned above and any other&rdquo;&mdash; as opposed to &ldquo;universities and any other&rdquo;. Whichever way it is, I want a clear commitment from the Minister that if the interpretation of that new amendment <Col N="2274" /> should deprive graduates of the new universities from having a vote in the election of University Senators then, I think, the Constitution should be amended.</P>
    <P>I spent some years reading through rules and the like &mdash; you, a Chathaoirligh, know my interest in Standing Orders and so on.  I read language to see how it is interpreted.  The Minister will understand that this is a real concern.  The context in which that amendment was made worries me, more so because it was made precisely in order to allow the extension of the franchise to other third level institutions. They did not, at that stage, envisage other universities.  I am a little worried about that.  The Minister can do no more than give a clear commitment that if somebody foolishly interprets that as saying that we cannot extend the franchise to the graduates of the new universities, then we should change the Constitution.  There are many other third level graduates over the years who have not participated in the voting or the franchise for this House.  I would mention every national teacher who qualified through the third level colleges until 1974 &mdash; those people who have no say in the election to this House.</P>

      <P>Do you agree that the national teachers of Ireland have given more than any other group, including politicians?  Perhaps the Minister will respond to that.  I should like to make a final point.  It has often been represented to me that the university constituency is highly élitist.  Indeed, the Leader of the House said the same to me &mdash; I thought <Col N="2275" /> very detrimentally &mdash; on live radio yesterday when he mentioned the six seats at the back of the House.  We know the reason is that this is the only panel to which independent people can be elected.  In this House, six people are elected by the universities &mdash; one tenth of the membership of the House and this figure traditionally represents the percentage going through third level.  In that sense it is the appropriate level of representation. However, it is still highly élitist and those of us elected through that élitist system seek to represent those who do not have a voice in that franchise. The reason I indulge myself on this point is that the third level institutions are blossoming and I ask that not only should the franchise be extended to the new universities but beyond to the other third level institutions.  I would also ask that the Government would take in hand the possibility of amending the Constitution to create more seats for people elected through that system.</P>
      <P>Many people were credited with the genesis of these institutions which we see today.  Mention was made of Seán O'Connor and Seán MacGearailt and I would like to put on record that these were two Dingle man &mdash; like myself.  This initiative was started by two natives of Dingle and it is appropriate that I, another native of Dingle, should be the final speaker on Second Stage.</P>

      <P>This is welcome legislation I am sorry that I have not had more time to develop some of my thoughts.  It seems a bit disjointed &mdash; I had to hop from point to point, but I mentioned most of the important points.  I know the Minister is anxious to leave, so I will conclude on that note.</P>

I do not wish to patronise anybody but I found the contributions &mdash; those that I was present for, and I apologise to those whose contributions I had to miss because of the pressure of business &mdash; enormously interesting, and wide ranging.

      <P>Senator Manning welcomed the legislation and paid tribute to the various people involved.  He called it a &ldquo;lazy Bill&rdquo;, but I would have to take issue with that statement.

      <P>Indeed, it is not.  His party could take a leaf out of our book with the expeditious handling of the matter between the announcement and the production of the Bill.  Senator Manning appealed for rationalisation &mdash; which was very welcome to my ears &mdash; and spoke about empire building in the universtities.  I was fascinated by what he had to say and felt the was speaking in a populist way seeing that he is on the populist hustings as distinct from other types of hustings.  Be that as it may, I hope that I, or the person who comes after me with plans to knock the empire building and to rationalise the various facilities on offer at third level, will find Senator Maurice Manning, regardless of what hat he is wearing, just as receptive, as open hearted and as liberal as he was today, but I doubt it.  Senator Manning spoke about the NUI and referred to the fact that they demand change, but that has not been my experience, and I will say no more than that.  When we spoke about the need to abolish the matriculation examination, they did not see the point of this at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish Senator Maurice Manning well. <Col N="2277" /> He is an old friend and I hope all will go well for him.</P>
    <P>Senator Bromell welcomed the Bill in a very warm and intimate way.  He is from Limerick and has a very close association with the quest for a university for Limerick. He made the history very relevant because he spoke of it in a domestic way as distinct from the broader sweep of history.  He referred to the people in Limerick he knew intimately and what they had done to bring this quest to its conclusion. I thank him for his contribution.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Murphy for his kind comments on the historical aspects of my script.  I very much enjoyed doing it and I am glad that it found an echo in the House.  He chided me gently about the omission of St. Finbarr's in Cork.  I regret its omission and I hope he will take it now as said.  Senator Murphy also referred to various other ecclesiastical influences and he is quite right to bring forward what he likes in the debate. Senator Murphy saw that the legislation would bring the winds of change to the NUI.  He saw the legislation as an item in itself &mdash; which it is &mdash; but the follow through would be that the NUI would have to reactivate themselves and come forward with ideas, and they would be forced to do so whether they wanted to or not.  I see it very much as that.  I have said on several occasions publicly that I want the NUI to come forward with their ideas, and then they should clarify them. It is all very fine for Senator Manning to go on and on, but it is another day's work when you seek to force changes upon institutions which do not want them.  As Senator Murphy has quite rightly said, there is no need to go on the defensive as there is close co-operation, and that should be encouraged.  Perhaps the winds of change will blow ever stronger.</P>
    <P>Senator Lydon welcomed this legislation and entered a small reservation about the name of the new university, but said he would not quibble with it. Senator Kennedy, a Limerick man, welcomed the legislation and outlined the history of the project.  He felt that the two directors of the NIHEs were inspired choices.  He also referred to the Plassey <Col N="2278" /> Technological Park which is very important to NIHE, Limerick.  He paid tribute to Deputy Gemma Hussey for setting up the international study group to examine the feasibility of conferring university status on NIHEs.  Indeed, I pay tribute to her for having so done and to Deputy Cooney for having received the report.  I am very glad it was my turn &mdash; no matter what happens from here on in to have the legislation enacted.  Senator Kennedy said that the new universities will convey an international reputation on Dublin and Limerick, and indeed they will.  I regret that I missed the contributions of both Senators Kennedy and Eogan, but very detailed notes were taken for me and I wish to recognise their contributions.</P>
    <P>Senator Eogan spoke about the innovations in education since the sixties.  He said that an Act of the Oireachtas may create a university but that it is the people involved, the teacher and students, who create its status.  We want the growth of subject areas to meet Newman's idea of a university &mdash; that is, places of universal learning.  Senator Eogan was critical of the standing given to the humanities and hoped that the HEA and the new universities will take cognizance of this.  He felt that the broad cultural aspect was missing and that they would need contact between the technological and cultural traditions of a university.  He said that a large number of universities were established in the past 30 years and that perhaps some of them are in need of refurbishment.  He said universities need financial stability and they must ensure the bulk of the necessary funding will come from the State.  Senator Eogan was glad the Bill gives research its rightful place as it is central to development.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to correct Senator Eogan and others who fear that the new universities will not be independent when appointing staff and that they would be subject to ministerial approval.  They also felt that the State should not have a say in who is the best person for a particular job.  That is a misconception which was in the legislation when it was introduced in the Dáil and which I was at pains to correct then. <Col N="2279" /> It is not true.  What the Minister does is set out the number of appointments rather than who gets the position.  As the House knows, the Minister has no responsibility for appointing a particular person to a particular job.</P>
    <P>Senator Eogan said it is vital to ensure the continued acceptability of the NCEA as an awarding institution and said the new universities would be of major benefit to the country.  There was a particularly warm reference from Senator Eogan &mdash; I was not here but it was reported to me &mdash; to the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies.  In the lean and very hungry years of the early forties when life was very rigorous and very difficult, a gleam of learning, culture and hope for academic knowledge of the future was struck by Eamon de Valera when he introduced in this House the legislation to establish the DIAS and it has remained a beacon ever since.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan spoke at length.  I was here for about half his contribution and, as always, he spoke in a broad sweep.  He said that sometimes established universities can have an inflated notion of their own importance, that they must learn to live with the outside world and the outside world must learn to live with them.  He questioned the need to have &ldquo;University&rdquo; in the title.  That is one of the points of the legislation.  He said the excellence of these institutions is already well recognised.  He made a plea for funding, particularly in a replacement way, for laboratories or parts of the university which have become run down over the years through usage.  He said that due to developments in technology and science, they need to be upgraded all the time.  In the national plan we have taken cognisance of some of the matters relating to that.  Lest it would go unremarked, we were slightly castigating him because he spoke at great length on the amendments. I apologise because it was not my role to do so.  In your absence, a Chathaoirligh, we were out of control a little but all ended well.</P>
    <P>Senator Donie Cassidy from my own constituency welcomed the Bill and I <Col N="2280" /> thank him for that.  I also thank Senator David Norris for his kind remarks, particularly with regard to those engaged in the teaching profession.  I have been at pains, in the two years and three months I have been Minister for Education, on all occasions to pay tribute to teachers at whatever level of teaching they are engaged in.  What happened in the UK should never be allowed happen here. Unfortunately, in that country people in &ldquo;places of importance&rdquo; seek constantly to denigrate the role of a teacher and, in so doing, influence how the community view teachers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why we need teachers in public life to represent the opposite point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  I have never ceased to say that if one was to labour in the Dáil or the Seanad from morning till night one would never feel as physically or mentally exhausted as one would from a day's teaching.  It is a constant giving of oneself in an intimate way to a child or an adult, at whatever level one is teaching.  It is absolutely absorbing and enthralling when you like your work but absolutely exhausting and draining as well.  I thank the Senator for his open recognition of that.  We should never lose that recognition.  The status of a teacher, lecturer or professor within a community is of enormous importance to how a community view schools, places of learning, third level institutions or whatever. The value which one has on the transmission of learning and the status of teachers must be constantly stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to place on record my personal thanks and that of the Department of Education for the generous letters Senator Norris read out to us today from the Provost in Trinity College and from the board to the future presidents of the institutions, Ed Walsh and Danny O'Hare, welcoming them to the fold in a very full sense.  The letters as read out, will go down as quite historical documents. The Senator chided me gently again for leaving out St. Patrick's Cathedral which was a collegiate church <Col N="2281" /> and has reverted into a seat of learning, albeit at second level.  Indeed I am glad to recognise it as that and to also recognise that at quite an early stage Trinity established third level links with other institutions, showing that it is egalitarian in every sense of the word.  Senator Norris was concerned as to whether all the letters would get to where they were supposed to be going &mdash; to UCD, DCU, Trinity College and so on.  If they are being sent to the new Dublin City University they should be addressed to Danny O'Hare.</P>
    <P>In regard to the balanced role of humanities and technology, that has always been the quest, particularly now with new technology.  In older times it was a question of pure science and applied science and so on.  It has always been the aim of universities that they would give a balanced education and that they would offer a broad range of subjects to students.  There have been debates throughout the centuries about humanities versus the science and now humanities versus technology and so on.  I think a very correct mix has been obtained in all of our institutions, varying slightly according to their culture and their traditions, how they have developed and what they have done for their various &ldquo;constituents&rdquo; and the various communities they serve.  The old tenet holds &mdash; it is one which I hold anyway &mdash; that to be technologically educated you must first of all be educated in humanities and the arts because you cannot master what would be new formulae unless you have been first of all educated in the old formulae. It is the old formulae which lay the base for the broadening out to specific vocational areas.  That is an old educational tenet but it is no harm to put it on the record.  The balance is what matters.  Senator Norris said there is no tendency within his university to &mdash; I do not know if this is a word &mdash; territorialise, to have enclaves built around, any particular institution.  I certainly have not discerned the saying &ldquo;thus far can you go and no further&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Senator Seán Fallon from my own constituency welcomed the Bill and I thank <Col N="2282" /> him for that.  He spoke warmly of the original idea and said that we should maintain the links with the RTCs, which have been in existence for 20 years, and other third level institutions.  That is something he and I would have come across down the years at VEC committees. He spoke of the roles of the NCEA and the accreditation system. That is something that will be looked at.  The NCEA have very positive ideas about their future.  They are going to develop themselves in innovative ways and they have ideas on that.  I have met them on several occasions and I hope to pursue that matter with them.</P>
    <P>Senator Joe O'Toole welcomed the legislation and spoke of IFUT's involvement in it and their long traditional role in universities.  He said that their interests should be enshrined in this legislation. He spoke of its effect on the wider community and particularly on trade unions and welcomed the amendment put down in the Dáil, which has now been incorporated into the legislation.  He castigated a previous speaker&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for what he saw as a blinkered view of the matter.  He had the aspiration that, having now established themselves as excellent in every way, the two new universities would perhaps lower the pace a little.  I am encapsulating what he said in a few words but that is a matter for debate.  I was struck very much by a phrase which Senator O'Toole used &mdash; he called the universities new institutions in an ancient context. That is exactly what they are.  It was a very broad, generous remark.  As was said, somehow last week in the Dáil a slightly ungenerous note was beginning to creep into some of the contributions. I regretted it.  I sought to put the whole debate on a consensus footing when I began my speech in the Dáil but there were some slightly ungenerous comments. I welcome the fact that here the welcome has been warm and the points put forward have been very constructive. <Col N="2283" /> There has been no evidence whatever of &ldquo;preciousness&rdquo;, of a feeling of territory, of &ldquo;thus far can you go&rdquo;.  That is very proper and is an indication of the constructive role of this Chamber.</P>
      <P>Let me say, and I know the House will share my views, that people who say there should be no Seanad and who castigate the work of the Seanad and of Senators should read some of the debates.  That has been instructive for me.  I know from my days here how much I enjoyed the debates and how much the Seanad contributed to the overall tone of legislation and influenced it by amendment. That is only one small part of it. There is also the general thrust of debate here.  It is enormously broad and much less partisan than in the more heated political atmosphere of the Dáil Chamber. To those who would have in their manifestos &mdash; or had until they changed their colours &mdash; that there should be no Seanad I say that life is not all utilitarian. It needs the broad sweep of comment, it needs the reflective note and voice to be sounded so that people who might be caught up in the hurly-burly of life, as we all are, have time to absorb what is said. That is my defence of the Seanad Chamber.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Several of the university Senators, naturally, spoke about where they are going with regard to all this representation, how many seats there should be and how they should be divided out.  Senator O'Toole said that as a person from Dingle he was glad to be the last speaker on this <Col N="2284" /> legislation and it was Dingle people who early on had the genesis of this idea.  I made a light remark when he was speaking and I hope it will not be taken amiss.

      <P>We might not have the mountains and the valleys but we have lots of other qualities.  I want to reply in a definite way to the Seanad representation matter because I recognise it is of interest to everybody.  At present three Members of the Seanad are elected by the National University of Ireland and the University of Dublin, as Senators know.  Under the Seventh Amendment of the Constitution of 1979 provision may be made by law for the election of a total of six Members of Seanad Éireann by one or more of the following institutions, and the members may be elected by institutions grouped together or by a single institution: (i) The two universities which at present elect Members to the Seanad and (ii) any other institutions of higher education in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the constitutional amendment was to allow elections to the Seanad in the context of any future university or higher education reorganisation that might take place.  These Bills before us do not affect the issue. Since under the Constitution at present provision could be made by law for the election of a Member or Members to the Seanad by any institution of higher education in the State, representation in the Seanad for the proposed new universities or for any other institution of higher education is a wide question that would need full consideration, and the necessary legislation, since it relates to <Col N="2285" /> an electoral issue, would be a matter, therefore, for the Minister for the Environment because all electoral issues are open to him.</P>
    <P>On a final note, to go back to something Senator Murphy and Senator Norris said, this legislation really is only the beginning.  It is minimal legislation to enable the functions and the duties laid out at the beginning of my speech to happen.  I hope it will presage, because it has the potential to so do, a much broader and wider debate not alone on the whole universities legislation but on the whole third level area of activity, leading on to further university legislation.  As I mentioned, we have the colleges Bill coming in the autumn dealing with this and the RTCs.  I think we can take it that it is a very successful launching pad for that. Let me again thank all the Members for their very interesting, entertaining and most enthusiastic responses to Second Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Before we start on the amendments, I would be less than correct if I did not place the matter in context for the Senators who have put down amendments and say that I welcome the fact that they have been doing their homework. As we all know, when a Bill has been passed by the Dáil it is sent to the Senand requesting its agreement to the passing of the Bill into law.  Should amendments be made to a Bill in the Seanad, the Bill has to be sent back to the Dáil and then the Dáil in Committee considers the amendments.  The problem is, therefore, that the acceptance of any amendments by the Seanad, however innocuous, welcome and wanted, would delay the Bill; in fact, it would not get through for this year's graduates.  I feel I should put that on record.</P>

      <Col N="2287" /> I would like to say in the first instance with regard to the Minister's words of caution a moment ago, first of all they seem to me to be pre-empting the issue. Second, it is the Government's fault if they order legislation like this that is not duly processed through both Houses in proper order.  I must say it touches very closely on the dignity of this House and on the proper function of this House that it should not be deterred by the consequences of certain amendments being passed by this House.  It should not be deterred by whatever consequences follow.  On the Government's head be it. The consequence of what the Minister has been suggesting is simply that this House is a rubber stamp and that we are expected to endorse the Bills as passed by Dáil Éireann.  That is not the proper function of this House.  I want to make that clear and I know I have the support of my fellow Senators in that regard.</P>

      <P>In moving this amendment I am not concerned with paying lip service to the Irish language.  Anyone who has any acquaintance with my views will know that I would not be bothered putting down something that was meant only to be lip service.  A clause compelling the new universities to have proper regard to the Irish language and to the national aims should impose obligations on them on the campus to set up something like Bord na Gaeilge which we have in UCC, a statutory board within the university which ensures that the university will take seriously the Irish language and promote activities associated with it on campus.  I would modestly suggest that this is something we do very well in UCC.</P>
      <P>I am serious about this amendment. The demands the amendment would impose are not onerous.  We are not suggesting that the new universities should require Irish in the matriculation or that Irish should be a condition of entrance. Of course not.  We are suggesting that the universities should have a statutory obligation to promote the Irish language. That is why this amendment is very important.</P>
      <P>Daniel Corkery in his book, <i>The Fortunes of the Irish Language,</i> said that the language now has the State behind it and therefore everything has changed for it. I only wish that were true.  It is true to the extent that the Government say they are committed to the Irish language and therefore in whatever legislation is appropriate they should have due care to the promotion of the national aim.  They have failed entirely in this case, whether through negligence or hypocrisy or a combination of both.  The drafters of these Bills have totally neglected the dimension of the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the first universities to be created in the history of the State, the first since 1908.  One would imagine at that level of education that given the overwhelming importance the Constitution attaches to the Irish language concern for Irish would be an integral <Col N="2289" /> part of the legislation, particularly since the Fianna Fáil Party's commitment to the Irish language has been frequently stated, mostly in English and they still have it as their first or second national aim.</P>
    <P>I would point out that when the National University of Ireland was set up and debate was raging about whether Irish should be a compulsory subject, Limerick Corporation said they would not give scholarships to any qualifiers unless they would matriculate competently through Irish to the National University.  Historically Limerick had this commitment to the national culture which is not apparent in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am asking that the new universities should share the responsibility and the honour which other third level institutions have of paying their level proper part in the promotion of the national language and culture.  We are constantly being told that these are full universities, not just technical institutes, with apologies to my colleague, Senator Ryan.  They are full universities, which suggests a full participation in all the branches of culture. What is the point of having such a definition of &ldquo;university&rdquo; in Ireland unless its definition of culture extends to a full promotion of the Irish language?</P>
    <P>One of the great dangers of this century in the world of learning has been the fear of a dichotomy between science and the humanities, the two cultures, the suggestion that somehow you leave the high technology to one area and another area will take care of the humanities.  That idea is discredited and, being discredited, these new universities which are styled proper universities should ensure that their culture extends beyond the merely scientific and that they avoid this classic cultural dichotomy.</P>
    <P>In looking at the prospectus of the calendars in NIHE Limerick and NIHE Dublin in the past few days I was struck by the fact that there is not a single syllable of Irish in the NIHE Limerick calendar, that colourful and impressive brochure which I held up this morning. There is not a single phrase of Irish except the stylised phrase in the motto of the university, eagna chun ghnímh.  The NIHE Dublin prospectus has a quite <Col N="2290" /> lengthy réamhrá over the signature of its distinguished director.  I want to correct that kind of imbalance.</P>
    <P>All I am asking is that we put into the Bill the clause contained in my amendment, a clause which is already contained in the 1971 HEA Act and in the 1979 NCEA Act.  These two Acts have this commitment.  Surely it is only proper now that the two institutes are being removed from the supervision of the NCEA and set free that this commitment should also be enshrined in their legislation. Since there is a special ethos in these two universities and since they will have a special approach to language teaching and language study, a commitment to Irish in their case could give an additional enrichment to the study of the Irish language and to linguistic methods.  There are ways in which these two universities could serve the Irish language by means other than the traditional methods of study.  They can apply their technical expertise to the promotion of Irish which would be extremely valuable.</P>
    <P>More generally, the context in which I am placing this amendment is both an old one and a new one.  The objective of language revival has been with us for a long time but, as I said in the Minister's presence last week when talking on an Adjournment matter in regard to the junior certificate, in the last few years it seems to me that in Irish language circles there is a rejuvenation, a new renaissance of interest in the language for its own sake, for what it does for our personality, for the enrichment of our national culture, without any reference to political nationalism.  In fact, what is taking place is probably a reaction against the excesses of political nationalism.  Language is beginning to live, as Douglas Hyde wanted it to, because of its own personality and the excellence of its own culture and legacy, and that is a marvellous thing.  I hope I am not deceiving myself but I see evidence of that all around me.  The present, therefore, from that point of view, is a very important time not to let the language go in a context like this.</P>
    <P>Then there is the European context. the whole emphasis, in the genesis of <Col N="2291" /> these Bills, is Europe and the Community and how best we can gear ourselves educationally for the new Europe.  Too often we are taken to task by various public people for saying that all we want out of Europe is to fill the begging bowl and not to think about what we can give to Europe.  I am telling this House that one of the things we can give to Europe is the Irish language and the culture associated with it, and this is what Europeans deserve from us.  The obligation to restore the Irish language is no longer simply a national obligation or a cultural imperative here in Ireland.  It is a European obligation.  Europe will eventually call us to account if we let the language die.  We have a European obligation to cherish the language.  We are the only State which is in a position to cherish one of the ancient languages of Europe, the descendant of the mainstream Celtic languages of Europe.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think this clause that I am proposing here is of vital importance. Since it coincides happily with one of the main objectives of the Fianna Fáil party and of this Government, to which they are deeply committed, I have no doubt whatsoever but that they will accept my amendment enthusiastically, especially people like Senator Bromell, who indicated as much earlier on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeEogan" hpid="Professor Eogan Professor Eogan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Eogan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am also disappointed at the lack of reference to our first and national language in these Bills, I do hope that something can be done about this.  As I assume that both universities will be receiving public funds through the HEA and in view of the strong wording in section 4 of the Higher Education Authority Act of 1971, will it be legal for the HEA to allocate funds to these institutions at all?  Unless these institutions deal seriously with the question of the national language it is a serious matter.  It is not at all right in this day and age, or in any day and age, to establish new and important educational institutions that virtually, at least on paper, ignore our national language.  It is unacceptable to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there is some way around this. I believe the governing bodies will have <Col N="2292" /> to institute new courses.  I in no way wish to tell these universities what to do because it would be entirely wrong and against my general principles of dealing with universities, but I would encourage them to establish a department of Irish language and literature so that we can integrate our culture into the wider culture. Indeed modern technology is now part of our wider culture, so the whole thing will mesh.  I see no conflict whatsoever. I trust that something can be done in a serious way to integrate Irish studies and the Irish language into the universities.</P>
    <P>Already today we have heard a certain amount about the role of universities in the community and their place in the community.  We all agree with this.  Universities cannot be detached from the community but unfortunately when it comes to dealing with the Irish language they are totally and completely detached as things stand.  I would ask the Minister to find some way around the problem which is a very real one and, if I may say so, verging on a sort of anti-nationalism with regard to culture.</P>

Tá coimhlint idir an enterprise spirit, mar a dtabharfá air, agus ceisteanna cultúrtha, ceisteanna teanga agus ceisteanna fealsúnachta, agus nach féidir bheith ag súil go mbeadh eolas domhain ar na neithe sin ag daoine atá ag dul amach ag obair, ag cruthú rudaí nua agus ag caitheamh amach tuairimí nua.  Ní ghlacaim leis sin ach tá eagla orm go bhfuil fealsúnacht aon-taobhach dá leithéid á glacadh ag cuid mhaith de chóras oideachais na tíre seo, go bhfuil daoine i gcomhacht agus go bhfuil tionchar mór acu ar fhealsúnacht oideachais, agus ár ndíriú i slí a dtógfadh uainn na rudaí a shábhálann sinn ó bheith cosúil le gach éinne eile.</P>

    <P>There is, as I have said, a very fundamental question involved here.  It is <Col N="2293" /> not just the question of a ritual genuflection before the Irish language.  It is a question of an assertion of our right to be ourselves and our right to say that this is not something quaint or old fashioned but it is the most critical thing if we are to be a success in the world economically, culturally and any other way.  We will do it not by aping other people but by being ourselves.  It is an extraordinary fact that in a recent survey on tourist attitudes on continental Europe one of the negative characteristics of this country that people identified was that we were found to be bland and uninteresting.</P>

      <P>What is unique about this country is neither bland nor uninteresting; but what many people would turn us into is bland and uninteresting.  In other words, we would become a poor copy of other countries and other views instead of building ourselves on what we stand for.</P>
      <P>The second thing that needs to be said &mdash; and I said this already in Irish &mdash; is that there is an increasing tendency to portray the image of the new Ireland as a successful trusting entrepreneur.  Much has been written about this trusting entrepreneur. I have written some, I hope adequately scurillous stuff, about the image of the new entrepreneur.  I believe in enterprise but I do not believe in some sort of glorified, boorish hick who does not understand anything except 24 hour a day devotion to one single-minded, self-centred task.  We have this image of people who have no time for family, no time for home, no time for anything except the pursuit of enterprise.  I reject that image and I reject the implication that all other things are somehow peripheral.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want people who are assured of their position in society, who are confident that they are capable of matching the best in Europe and are also part of a <Col N="2294" /> very unique and distinctive society with a whole range of cultural characteristics, one of which, the most of important of which, is the Irish language.  We have a way of life, a set of values which highlight the importance of things other than work. We have values relating to what we want to do, to what we like doing and how we like to organise ourselves.  These values are uniquely our own, grounded in our history and in our culture, and at the centre of our history and culture is our language.  I do not understand why these universities which are not technological universities should not have an obligation, however carefully worded, to ensure that those who graduate from them have a sense of where they came from, of where they fit in the world and a confidence, distinct from a nationalistic jingoistic pride, in their roots in a society and culture which has a lot to be proud of.</P>
    <P>Many of the things that have happened in this country over the past 20 years have caused us considerable pain and they have created a tendency in us to apologise for anything that is distinctive about us. There is an enormous amount that is distinctive about this country which is positive. I do not understand how we could possibly develop two new universities without imposing an obligation to recognise that they are educating not technological functionaries to fit into a sort of 1984 vision of a technological world, but people who will work in this country and not in some sort of an imaginative half-way house between here and the United States of Germany, or somewhere mythological that does not really exist.  The people to be educated will live in this country, will have come from this country and they are imbued, consciously or otherwise, with a lot of what is the best in this country.  It is extremely important that no area of education should somehow drift off into some sort of intermediate culture separate from the realities of Irish life.</P>
    <P>That is why Senator Murphy's amendment is extremely important.  It states the position about the philosophical base of the education that is to be given in these two universities.  It states that these are universities based on what is unique <Col N="2295" /> about this country, on what is unique in our history, and that these two universities will educate people who are products not of an American or British culture but of what is uniquely our own small, tightly-knit and positive community. No institution should be allowed to separate itself for some reasons to do with its image or materialistic philosophy from that society or that culture.  The things that will make this country successful in the greater world are not the things we pick up from that world but the things that are uniquely our own.  If we start backing away from what is uniquely our own, we will try to copy other people doing in their own way what they can do best.  If we do not choose to do what we can do best in our way, we will never be as successful as them, we will simply be following in their wake, copying them. Part of what is best in this country is our history, our culture and our language and these things deserve to be part of the basic principles under which our new universities will operate.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I enthusiastically support the amendment.  Like Senator Murphy I cannot understand why it will not be accepted.  Must members of Fianna Fáil who have such a commitment, historically and in writing to the Irish language, have no option but to accept it.</P>

      <P>Mar a dúirt an Seanadóir, Ryan, tá fealsúnacht, meon agus dearcadh ag baint leis seo.  An taithí a bhí agam féin ag dul trí scoil, sa mheán scoil, mar shampla, ná gur fhoghlaim mé mo chuid Laidne trí Ghaeilge le téacsleabhair Béarla agus ní haon ionadh go bhfuil sórt mearú críochnaithe orm in a thaobh sin.  Mar sin féin, is é atá i gceist ag an Seanadóir Murphy ná gur cóir do na hollscoileanna in a mbunreacht tábhacht agus stádas faoi leith a thabhairt don Ghaeilge.  Tá sé sin thar a bheith tábhachtách, mar is é mo thaithí féin ar an rud seo ná go ndearnamar suirbhé san INTO cúpla bliain ó shin ar an dearcadh a bhí ag muintir na hÉireann i leith na teanga. Tá formhór muintir na hÉireann fábhrach do athbheochan agus úsáid na teanga. Mar sin, tá sé de dhualgas orainn uile <Col N="2296" /> gach tacaíocht a thabhairt di sin ionas go dtíocfaidh sí faoi bhláth.</P>
      <P>Labhair mé anseo cúpla mí ó shin ar an tábhacht atá ag baint le Raidió na Gaeltachta agus leis na ceadúnais nua go dtabharfaí ceadúnais dóibh siúd a bheadh sásta craoladh trí Ghaeilge do na Gaeltachtaí.  Mhol mé níos luaithe ná sin an tábhacht a bhain le teilifís na Gaeltachta. Is é an rud céanna atá i gceist againn anseo inniu.  Ní féidir in aon chor teanga a bheith againn i dtéacsleabhair amháin.  Caithfimid gach seans a thabhairt don teanga agus gach tacaíocht a thabhairt di.  Tá an-seans againn anois chun tá bhacht faoi leith a thabhairt dí i mbunreacht na n-ollscoileanna seo.</P>
      <P>It is not enough to have a pious aspiration. There is too much by way of aspirations in the attitude to the Irish language.  It is vitally important that we give the language its proper place.  If we are serious about a greater use of the language, we should support this amendment. The Irish language is not something that we should just see in textbooks. It should not be just confined to the primary schools.  It should be used at every stage of our life.  It should be part of the academic life of all institutes of education. This is a good opportunity for us to give it a certain position of honour and of importance in the new universities.  I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh leis an leasú seo ach tuigim go bhfuil deacracht ann freisin, mar tá seisiún seo na Dála críochnaithe.  That need not necessarily be an overwhemlingly objection because although this session of the Dáil has concluded I understand the Seanad will almost definitely be recalled in July when a new Dáil has been formed. There is no insuperable difficulty in the Minister accepting amendments at this stage because both the Seanad and the new Dáil will be in operation by July.  The amendments could be accepted without any immediate danger to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to exhaust the patience of the House but my approach is slightly different from the approach taken by Senator O'Toole, although I appreciate his reasons for taking the line he took.  I <Col N="2297" /> give a qualified support to this amendment, precisely because it is aspirational. It is important that it is there as an aspiration. If it is not an aspiration, what is it? Will it be mandatory, as Senator O'Toole said in his speech, to teach Latin through Irish?  That would be foolish and would impede the progress of learning through the university.  I would not support anything that contained that kind of coercive or compulsive element but I support this amendment because it is aspirational and is an encouragment to third level institutions to live up to the reality of those aspirations in whatever way they find appropriate, and also because it would be a shame if there was no reference to what is described as the first national language, although in terms of usage it plainly is nothing of the kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions on this amendment.  I would like to clear up any disparities that may have arisen.  Some Senators made reference to both the NCEA Act and the Higher Education Authority Act.  This institution is no longer under the aegis of the NCEA.  I am now referring to the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971. As the House is aware the HEA have an overall co-ordinating role in relation to the universities and designated institutions. In fact, the NIHEs soon to be the new universities are designated institutions under the aegis of the HEA. Therefore, they are subject to the rules and provisions of the HEA Act.  As I said, the National Council for Education Awards have a similar role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act setting up the HEA includes the exact provision being proposed by Senator Murphy.  It was not felt necessary therefore to include such a provision in the legislation setting up the institutions under the aegis of the NCEA or the HEA.  The new universities will therefore automatically be under the aegis of the Higher Education Authority.  During the years this authority have been very conscious of their statutory duties in relation to the restoration of the Irish language and the preservation and development of national culture.  They liaise constantly with Bord na Gaeilge and the institutions <Col N="2298" /> with which the authority deal in relation to those matters.  I have no doubt that the new universities, like the existing ones, will have due regard for Government policy in relation to the preservation and restoration of the Irish language and culture without the necessity for a statutory provision.  We should bear in mind that there is already a statutory provision in place.  Therefore, we do not need to insert a fresh statutory provision.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will note that under section 3 (b) of the Bill before us I would have authority on the recommendation of the governing bodies and after consultation with the HEA to assign by order to either or both of the new universities such additional functions as I think fit.  If Senators feel that the HEA will not see through their statutory duties to oversee any institutions under their aegis &mdash; I have no reason to believe they will not do so &mdash; I could, on the recommendation of the governing bodies and after consultation with the HEA, assign by order to either or both of the new universities such additional functions as I think fit.</P>
    <P>In order to allay any fears which Senator Murphy and other Senators may have I undertake following the passage of this legislation to take this matter up directly with the governing bodies and the HEA.  My purpose in doing so would be to spell out once again &mdash; I do not think this would be necessary &mdash; that they must bear constantly in mind the national aims of restoring the Irish language and preserving and developing the national culture and to endeavour to promote the attainment of those aims.  I would have to point out that all designated institutions under the aegis of the HEA have to comply with the provisions of the HEA Act.</P>
    <P>I have to come to the defence of the HEA.  In my dealings with them during the past two years and three months they have at all times scrupulously adhered to the provisions of the HEA Act.  The chairman and members of the HEA have been very punctilious in fulfilling their statutory duties.  Very often I felt they were too punctilious and too careful in fulfilling those duties and on occasion I <Col N="2299" /> had to cavil with the way in which they interpreted their statutory role but be that as it may, they have fulfilled their role very punctiliously.  It would be a slight on them if one were to say that they would not carry out their duties as laid down in the Act.</P>
    <P>The Act states that An tÚdarás shall bear constantly in mind the national aims of restoring the Irish language and preserving and developing the national culture and shall endeavour to promote the attainment of those aims.  The aims of the HEA automatically become the aims of each authority designated.  They are my aims and the aims of the Government as well as of everybody in education.  The failure of the HEA to see through their duties would have enormous implications.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the provisions of section 4 of the HEA Act concur with those proposed by Senator Murphy.  His amendment was seconded by Senator Ryan and Senators Norris and O'Toole spoke on it.  If the Senator would still want the Minister to meet with the two bodies to highlight the provisions contained in section 3 (b) and to bear in mind what has been said in the House this could be done but I would have to put on the record that the institutions under the aegis of the HEA have to comply with the provisions of the 1971 Act.  It is clearly laid out that the two new universities would have a statutory role to fulfil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I find what the Minister has just said very plausible.  I am not so sure whether it was in her mind all of the time or whether it was prompted by my amendment.  If so, I am glad.  Was it Cassius who said, &ldquo;my weak show of words has struck such fire&rdquo;?  I am not entirely convinced that this belated interpretation of the HEAs' obligations extends specifically to the institutions under their aegis.  What is the status of the Irish language, for example, in the existing institutes?  I instanced the calender of the Limerick NIHE as being entirely monolingual.  My colleague, Senator Ryan, raised the question a few moments ago as to what status the Irish language has in the existing institutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2300" /> I am reluctant to force a division on this matter.  It could have the dramatic effect of Fianna Fáil marching into the lobbies against this first national aim. Although that would afford me a certain sardonic pleasure it would be shortsighted of me because what we are at here is constructively trying to bring this matter to a close.  I do not want to do anything which would make this less than a happy occasion.  I also do not want to do anything which might start off these two institutions with less than a warm attitude towards the Irish language.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons I am inclined to accept what the Minister has said.  I would like to refer to Senator Norris's concerns and I can assure him that we do not seek the imposition of some kind of a replacement policy of forcing Irish down people's throats.  Let me say again that what I am at arises out of our own situation at UCC where we have Bord na Gaeilge, established as a statutory board under the aegis of the governing body, which compels the college to take proper notice of the place of the Irish language in the life of the college.  It does so to some considerable effect.  They meet regularly and the students are aware of the place of the Irish language in the college and so on, apart from actual courses taught in the Irish language.</P>
    <P>At the moment, for example, in NIHE, Limerick there are people of goodwill in important positions on the staff, including a former colleague of ours in this House, Senator Noel Mulcahy, who I understand is Dean of Engineering. Former colleagues will recall his commitment to the language and his frequent contributions through the language in this House.  It is obviously a very good thing that somebody like him and other colleagues with whom I am not closely acquainted in Limerick would be enthusiastic in these matters, but it is not enough.  There must be some kind of formal and statutory provision available. If I thought that the Minister would be in a position to monitor the effects of the intent of this motion and that she was satisfied that the HEA injunction would apply specifically to the two new institutes and if I thought that the powers <Col N="2301" /> that be in the new universities were equally serious in this matter and would accept the spirit of this amendment without my forcing it to a division, I would be glad to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Murphy for the generosity with which he has approached this matter while keeping the principle of his amendment intact.  I can assure him that the provisions of the HEA Act would apply in all its manifestations to the institutions under their care.  Otherwise, they have the ultimate weapon, which is the allocation of finance to such institutions.  Each of the institutions receives its finance from the HEA.</P>
      <P>On the other point raised of a monitoring role for the Minister of the day on the implementation of these principles bearing in mind that I fully believe that the HEA Act would apply to this, as a further manifestation of the importance that I put on what the Deputy has said, if this legislation is passed, I would undertake to take up this matter personally at a meeting with the two bodies, the governing body and the HEA.  My purpose in so doing would be to include, as one item on the agenda, the proposed amendment.  I would stress that discussion of the amendment had taken up quite an important part of this debate today and that we were prepared to see that such implementation would take place.</P>

      <P>Just for clarification, having spoken about the need for monitoring and the extent to which the new universities would implement the spirit of my amendment, I realise that any talk about monitoring runs totally counter to my earlier statements about the philosophy of these universities, that they should not be subject to ministerial monitoring.  What I really wanted was to ensure that the heads of the new universities &mdash; this is so important that I would appreciate the Minister's attention &mdash; would be made aware of the significance of this amendment and should take it on board and that the Minister would see to that.  I would not want continual monitoring in that sense.  I am a little worried about the implications. Senator Ryan has mentioned this also.  Is there evidence that the HEA have ever withheld money, to put it crudely, have ever closed the purse against those who are not fulfilling the national philosophy? Is it far-fetched of us to think that the HEA would do that?</P>

I would not have any details of any specific comments or interactions in that regard, but I am quite sure that both bodies will be paying careful attention to what has been said here today.  Under section 3 (b) of those Bills, I shall have authority if need be, to strengthen the existing legislative enactment by ministerial order.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 47 and 48, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) Any President appointed after the term of office of the President who holds office at the time of coming into operation of this Act shall be appointed <Col N="2303" /> for a fixed term of office to be decided by the Governing Body from time to time.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment if self-explanatory.  It is normal practice for presidents of universities as regards terms of office.  There is a seven year term of office in UCD and similar terms in other universities.  The objection here is not to people repeating their terms of office.  It is clearly stated that this does not refer to the presidents appointed at the time of coming into operation of the new legislation.  It does not refer to the present incumbents &mdash; I should like to make that quite clear.  It refers to future appointees to the presidency. It is only right that the governing bodies should have the authority to make that kind of regulation.  I do not intend going any further.  I am being very brief &mdash; I am the only one being brief here today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am brief enough myself.  The proposed amendment reflects the position adopted voluntarily by some institutions in making presidential appointments for fixed periods. Section 9 (2) of the 1980 Act leaves the governing body free to do this if they so wish.  I reflected on this in the Dáil where the same amendment was put up.  I thought about it quite a lot.  Sometimes one is accused of being too interventionist and sometimes one is accused of not intervening sufficiently.  It is difficult; it is like the humanity-science argument, how to find the correct balance.  I would prefer, on balance, to leave the matter to the discretion of the governing body. After all, we are setting them up.  One has to give them a measure of autonomy. They have all chosen their own routes in wisdom and with experience.  Having done so, matters have worked out very satisfactorily.  I have no doubt whatever that were any of the incumbents in the office to prove in some way unsuitable in the future, the governing bodies would not be long about giving them the boot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I also aim at being brief.  I should just like to place on the record the fact that my own university has altered <Col N="2304" /> its Statute.  At the beginning of the century, the provost could more or less go on forever.  I think that it was during my period as a junior lecturer that this was altered.  There is now a fixed term, even for the provost of Trinity College, a position which was at one stage almost monarchical.</P>
      <P>It is important that there should be a fixed term of office and that does not preclude the fact that a particularly excellent president of a university could be reappointed or re-elected for a second term.  However, it does mean that there is a fixed term and sometimes people have a time during which they are particularly good and their hour then passes &mdash; although they may not be as aware of it as other members of the academic community &mdash; and this provides a situation where they can be extracted from the post without the painful process of impeachment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is of interest to point out that in the National University each of the colleges has come individually to the conclusion that there should be a fixed term president.  We have done so most recently and our new president will hold the office for only ten years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Professor Mortell is the first to be a fixed term president.  The associated college, St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, does not come under this particular rubric since their president functions as it were, <i>sub specie aeternatis</i> and goes on, presumably, to be president in the next life as well.  Thinking about this since seeing the amendment in print and about the way in which each of the colleges in turn adopted this rule, it seems wiser to leave it to the particular circumstances of each college to come to this conclusion in its own right and, therefore, to leave it specially to the governing body.  I take it that the governing body has the power under the legislation to have a fixed term president?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The governing body <Col N="2305" /> has the right to decide on that matter and section 9 (2) leaves the governing body free to do so if they wish.  Senator Murphy said that they had come to that conclusion in Cork this time.  It is better to allow each institution to do this themselves rather than feeling there is a heavy hand upon them telling them how to do it.</P>

      <P>It is hard to take the comments about the heavy hand, the need for freedom and freedom of the spirit.  I could accept the remarks if they applied to the Bill but it is totally illogical to say on the one hand that a professor can be appointed if the Minister agrees but on the other to say that there should be a fixed term of office in regard to the president.  Is it true that the Minister can block an appointment?</P>

      <P>I do not think Senator O'Toole was here when I answered that question previously.  I do not have that right under the Bill, nor does any other Minister.  I cleared that question by referring to the previous Act, no Minister for Education has the right to appoint anyone to a professorship, lectureship or whatever.  A Minister may, in consultation with the Department of Finance, create a number of posts but not appoint the personnel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that in appointing a person to a position finance has to be made available by ministerial sanction to pay for it and that the Minister has control over appointments. Having said that, I see nothing interventionist about deciding that there should be a fixed term of office for the position of president which would be a very normal provision in the constitution of most bodies.  The NIHE Act, 1980, provides that the first members of the governing body shall hold office for a period of one year.  There is nothing unusual about this kind of provision and we will certainly give the Minister guidance in regard to what is too interventionist. We are merely saying that it is appropriate that there should be a fixed term of office for the future presidents of the new universities.  I have heard no reason so far for not doing that.</P>

      <P>I should like to make three brief points.  The Presidency of Ireland is limited by a statutory period of appointmen by election and what is good enough for the President should surely be good enough for &mdash; what I suppose I can best describe as &mdash; lesser mortals.</P>

      <P>It seems so but that is an illusion.  I am aware, from my own situation in Dublin University, that, for example, the present Provost has worked very hard in regard to the 400th anniversary celebrations of the college and, ironically, his term of office will cease just short of that triumphant event.  However, he does have the opportunity to present himself for re-election and this is not precluded by the amendment under consideration. My final point is one I made earlier but it is illustrated beautifully by the presence of the persons who will be heads of these distinguished universities. If we had a committee system working in this House it would be possible to seek their views directly at present.  I will not labour that point but perhaps the House might like to consider that this very clearly shows the value of a committee system although I do not want to open up a debate &mdash; and I am sure the Cathaoirleach would allow me to do so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not entirely clear as to why there could be any objection to this.  It is useful for us in the Oireachtas to learn from and to monitor the experience of other bodies.  We have watched, as Senator Murphy pointed out, the three constituent colleges of the National University come to a conclusion about which way matters should go in terms of a fixed <Col N="2307" /> term appointment of a president.  We have watched Dublin University coming to a similar conclusion and we are entitled to say that there is now a consensus among the existing universities that it is preferable to have a fixed term appointment for the president on the basis of long years of experience.  Do we have to go through a process of rediscovering the wheel? In other words, will these two new universities, who want to be universities because they like what universities are and believe that this gives them a particular role and position in education, have to go through the same process of rediscovery? Should we not nudge them in the direction of what appears to be a consensus? That is what the amendment means as it says that the present incumbents will hold them under their present contract but that their successors ought to be appointed under similar &mdash; not identical &mdash; conditions to those held by the president of all the other universities.</P>

      <P>With all due respects, is Senator Ryan not denying to the two new institutions the very process of discovery which was given to the other institutions, whereby they came to their own decision voluntarily and out of their own wisdom to limit the tenureship of the president of their college? They were allowed their own voyage of discovery and that applied to Cork on the last occasion they elected a president.  There is no reason to assume that the two new universities will not come to the same conclusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is, of course, the one which the Minister articulated in regard to intervention.  For instance, the Bill specifically requires that membership of the academic council be available to three students of the two universities.  I have already expressed my embarrassment and tried to get myself off the hook in regard to a subsequent amendment because of that.  When I was a student that was almost unheard of but we have learned and made progress. Other bodies have come to the conclusion that they are not going to wait and discover this for themselves; they have <Col N="2308" /> decided that this is now an established plateau of decision about what is acceptable. We have come to a similar position in regard to this.</P>
      <P>I would wish, and this is no reflection on the principal of my own institution, that the principalships of RTCs should be fixed term appointments.  That would create a considerable dynamic within those institutions and it would help them. However, that is another day's work.  The case has been eloquently made for the proposal before us by the decisions of the other universities and we ought not to wait until these two universities come around to that way of thinking but should nudge them in the direction that the other universities have chosen to go.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points of major importance in regard to this. Should the universities discover a method or sit back and wait for something to happen? Do we ask the new institutions to re-invent the wheel or do we tell them about the wheel? Do we tell them that they will find themselves in this position in 20 years time or do we help them along now? Do we give them the accepted wisdom of the existing institutions who agree on a term of office? The proposal before us is that we should do that.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister for clarification in regard to the other issue that was raised.  The 1980 Act states that the institute shall remove or suspend any of its officers from office but may not do so without the consent of the Minister.  It states that the institute may make certain appointments subject to the approval of the Minister and with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  The Minister is not proposing to amend that provision.  I put forward an amendment but I was told that as it had financial implications it could not be accepted.  There is a hands on interventionist position outlined in the 1980 Act in that appointments have to be approved by the Minister.  I do not disagree with that; it is a good idea but I do not think it is an argument for the Minister to say that she would be interfering too much if she required that future presidents should hold office for a fixed term.</P>

      <P>The Cathaoirleach ruled out the Deputy's amendment because of its financial implications.  I should like to reiterate that the Minister of the day does not vet a person appointed to a post.  The Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, decides on the amount of money allocated for staff positions and on the number of positions.  Obviously, and correctly, it should not be open to a Minister to appoint a person to a particular position. That is not the job of the Minister. However, the financial implications of the number of positions in an institution or a university remains the prerogative of the person who holds the purse strings and the person who distributes the money.</P>
      <P>On the question of the appointment of the president I should like to say that the new universities should be allowed to make their own decisions.  It took Cork a long time to come to their own conclusions &mdash; I do not know how long it took the other universities to do so &mdash; and the new universities should be given time to do so.  I am sure they will make a speedy decision on this issue.  To deny them the right to consider this would not be correct.  I am sure the new universities will reach a decision quickly.</P>

      <P>In page 4, between lines 1 and 2, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) the substitution for subsection (1) of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(1) There shall be an Academic Council to assist the Governing Body in the planning, co-ordination, development and overseeing of the educational work of the Institute.&rsquo;&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2310" /> I would wish to have an academic council that is not set up by a decision of the governing body.  It should have its own life and not be a creature of the governing body.  That is the motive behind the first amendment.  In amendment No. 4 we deal with the membership of the academic council.  In our view the membership should consist of the president and not fewer than 20 members.  The president is subject to a specific term of office under the main legislation.  Our amendment suggests that the governing body should make regulations from time to time to determine the methods by which the academic members of the academic council are selected.  In other words, we want the academic council to be given a life of its own.  We want them to be allowed operate without being creatures of the governing body.  I recognise that some people have basic objections to some aspects of our amendment.  Being a pragmatist that is as far as I wish to go at this stage.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the general principle that it is imperative in a university for the academic council to have its own autonomy on academic matters.  I have the honour to be a member of the academic council and of the governing body of University College, Cork.  On occasions points of tension arise between those two bodies. Sometimes, when sitting on the governing body, I have to speak for the academic council and respectfully remind the governing body that it has no business interfering in purely academic matters. I support the general principle that the academic council should not be a creature of the governing body but should be supreme in its own academic sphere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 reflects the reality of the situation in the two institutions. The majority of the members of the academic council are holders of academic appointments.  They are appointed under regulations made by the governing bodies for a period of three years and may be re-appointed.  The director, soon to be president, under Schedule II of the 1980 Act is an <i>ex-officio</i> member of the academic council <Col N="2311" /> and, therefore, it is not necessary to specify that he or she should be a member of the council.  The regulations in the institutions under which the academic council is appointed provide for a membership in excess of 20.  The Bills already provide that the majority of the members of the academic council must be the holders of academic appointments at the particular university.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to remove from the governing bodies the power to appoint the academic council.  The legislation allows for the majority of the members to be members of the academic body. Surely the governing body, in their wisdom, will see to it that some nonacademic members are appointed.  I am satisfied that the Bills provide adequate safeguards in relation to the representation on the council of the academic staff.</P>

      <P>My name was attached to amendment No. 4 but I have withdrawn it because of the absence of provision for student members.  Will the Minister explain why she has retained section 5 of the 1980 Act which states that there shall be a governing body of the institute but goes on to say that the governing body shall appoint a body of persons which will be known as the academic council? Section 5 (a) of the Bill states &ldquo;The Governing Body may by regulations made...&rdquo;.  The Minister has said there shall be an academic council, that is contained in the existing Act, but I do not understand why the composition of the academic council should not be a matter of statute as well.  The Minister's amendment to section 8 of the 1980 Act provides that &ldquo;The Governing Body may by regulations made under this section provide for the membership, of which a majority shall be holders of academic appointments...&rdquo;.  Why does the Minister not say &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo; in the amendment?  I believe that is the biggest crux in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it is a crux of different interpretations of a particular word.  With respect to Senator Ryan, how <Col N="2312" /> often does one say &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and how often does one say &ldquo;may&rdquo;? If we use too many &ldquo;shalls&rdquo; it will be likened to a dictate but if we use the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; it can be used in other ways.  I am satisfied that the Bill already provides that the majority of the members must be the holders of academic appointments and that in so doing the wishes of the legislation will be carried through.  I thank the Senators for removing the reference to the non-appointment of students.  I am satisfied that the components of the various proportions will be adequately addressed by the governing body in making appointments to the academic council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a point about the nature of the academic council. There is something very analogous to this at primary level.  At primary level there is always a difficulty with the board of management of a school getting involved in curricular matters.  That is the clearest analogy I can make.  Similarly in this case the duties of the academic council are outlined in great detail in the original legislation, and it is work which is appropriate to an academic council as opposed to a governing body.  It is a fact that under this legislation an academic council may not be appointed if the governing body so decide and they may not exist at all. That is the first point I want to make.  As Senator Ryan said, the original legislation provided that the governing body &ldquo;shall&rdquo; appoint an academic council.  So far as I am concerned we have gone two steps backwards.  First, it is no longer a requirement to have an academic council. This cannot be acceptable.  There should be an academic council to fulfil the functions which are outlined in almost a full page of the text of the 1980 Act. Therefore, it seems we will be very remiss in carrying out our duties if we do not insist that an academic council be set up.</P>
      <P>My second point is that in the setting up of an academic council we believe they should not be appointed only by dictate of the governing body but by the process outlined.  I regret that the student representation is not included but I will deal with that in another way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reiterate that <Col N="2313" /> we are dealing with section 8 (1) of the 1980 Act.  This section provides that the governing body shall &mdash; and this is the point which was raised by Senator Ryan &mdash; appoint a body to be known as the academic council.  Obviously this provision still stands.  I want to put it to the Senators that their amendment provides only for the selection of the academic members.  It is not stated how the nonacademic members should be appointed or selected.  It is concerned only with the academic members which I suppose, if we really want to go into it, is discriminatory in its own way.  Section 8 (1) of the 1980 Act provides that the governing body shall appoint a body to be known as the academic council, and the provision in that section still stands.</P>
      <P>I understand how this provision has led to a debate here, it led to a debate in the Dáil also.  As I said at the outset we are dealing with legislation of a minimalist nature.  That was accepted by me and put forward in the legislation as such.  It was accepted in spirit, and sometimes stated, by most of the Senators who contributed to the debate today that we are dealing with legislation, regardless of whether we like it now, of a minimalist nature which is a forerunner to what I hope will be wider, deeper and more comprehensive legislation dealing with third level education, legislation to be brought forward at a later date &mdash; I hope, not at a far later date.  Therefore, we are governed in the main by the provisions of the 1980 Act which provide that the governing body shall appoint a body to be known as the academic council.  We should let the governing body carry out their duties. We are giving them powers and setting them up as autonomous universities and we should not fetter every step they take.</P>

      <P>In page 4, before section 6, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;Paragraph 6 (a) and (b) of the First Schedule to the Act of 1980 is hereby amended by the deletion of subparagraph (i) respectively&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment should not take too much time.  I should like to know why Members of the Oireachtas can be members of the governing body of UCC, UCD, UCG, the boards of management of the RTCs, the board of the Dublin Institute of Technology but not members of the governing bodies of the two universities. My amendment simply attempts to delete the provision in the First Schedule of the 1980 Act which says that members of the governing body of two institutes who become Members of the Oireachtas should cease to be members of the governing body or <i>vice versa</i>.  Senator Murphy is a distinguished member of the governing body of UCC and Senator Fitzgerald of Fianna Fáil is a member of the governing body of UCD. During my time as a Member of this House I have been a member of the board of management of an RTC.  This strikes me as an anomaly, and perhaps it was an oversight, which ought to be rectified.  I left out members of the European Parliament from my amendment partly because of my view of the European Parliament and also because of the inevitable absences which result from membership of the European Parliament.  We ought not to have two ways of dealing with Members of the Oireachtas and governing bodies of similar institutions.</P>

There are, of course, cases where there would be an obvious conflict of interest and in such cases specific prohibitions should certainly be enjoined but <Col N="2315" /> there are many cases where the services of somebody are unnecessarily lost by this kind of blanket prohibition.  As Senator Ryan said, I am a member of the governing body of University College, Cork.  If there was a prohibition on me under this section, that governing body would be deprived of my sage counsel on many matters, or, conversely, Seanad Éireann and the wider nation would be deprived of my inestimable services.  I do not think that situation should obtain.</P>

      <P>There is a dual matter at stake here but, principally, a primary schools psychological service.  It is very difficult to give a rounded presentation of what I am seeking.  I will attempt in the first place to present the problem as I see it, which is that pupils and teachers in this country suffer from our having the largest class sizes in Europe.  I have mentioned that problem many times previously in this House.  There is a national consensus about the difficulties that creates.  I want to focus on one specific difficulty that arises, not because of the large class sizes &mdash; it would have arisen anyway &mdash; but which is exacerbated by them.  It is this, the fact that a teacher identifies and recognises a child with a particular learning, social or emotional difficulty and, in turn, needs the assistance of another professional in order to diagnose precisely that area of difficulty. This always tends to be a very traumatic time for the pupil concerned &mdash; sometimes the teacher &mdash; but always very definitely for the family.  Usually the next step is that the teacher has a word with the parents concerned telling them that the child is experiencing particular difficulties and the help of a psychologist in order to assess what should be the next step, what remedial action should be taken to allow the pupil develop as an individual in the way sought in the new curriculum.  The new curriculum speaks about enabling the child to live the full life of a child and to equip himself or herself to avail of further education so that he or she may go on to live a full and useful life as an adult in society.</P>
      <P>In terms of identifying pupils with particular needs, a teacher must discuss the matter with the parents and seek additional professional help in order to ascertain whether the problem is social, is psychological difficulty in learning or whatever, all the different aspects of living that need to be examined in such circumstances.  Usually on such occasions, at least initially, the most helpful person will be an educational psychologist.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2319" /> I know that the Minister agrees wholeheartedly with me in this regard and, to her credit, has said so publicly.  I am trying to draw a picture of what happens in the classroom.  The teacher having got that far decides to discuss the matter with the child's parents.  The teacher then meets the parents and discusses the matter with them.  We must remember that it is very traumatic for parents to hear that their child is experiencing a difficulty which might require the assistance of outside professional help, particularly of a psychologist.  It tends to create some tension in the home, but the vast majority of parents come to terms with that.  They look forward to having a meeting with a psychologist, to whom their child can be referred, so that they can take whatever action is recommended on that basis.</P>
    <P>The next step involves referring that child to some adequate psychological service. The problem is that that service does not exist at present.  What that means today is that any child assessed by a teacher in the classroom as needing some type of outside help must wait interminably for that psychological service. What has happened is that in this city, particularly in the western part of County Dublin, stretching from, say, Mulhuddart to Tallaght, including Clondalkin there have been schools and housing provided but no attendant infrastructural services.  I know I am speaking to the converted but it is important to get clearly on the record that the child must wait indefinitely while nothing happens.  We are talking about the most formative years of a child's life &mdash; a year lost can never be replaced.  The most worrying aspect is what has happened recently.  A teacher telephoned me about three weeks ago and said there were nine or ten pupils waiting to be assessed psychologically.  The children in this school came from the working class and the middle class; some people were reasonably well off and others were very badly off.  Some of the pupils had been waiting for the State to provide the service for over a year.  In the meantime, another child came to the notice of a teacher who felt the pupil should be <Col N="2320" /> psychologically assessed.  The teacher told the parents and said unfortunately, he did not know when the child would be assessed.  The parents asked if that meant their child would be waiting a year or a year and a half without getting the proper help or support and when they found that to be the case, they said they would pay for the services of a psychologist.  They got a psychologist and had their child assessed.  In fact, they paid the psychologist to come to the school.  The teacher was in a quandary.  In his class there were three or four pupils waiting for assessment but this pupil who had only recently arrived and needed assessment had a psychologist calling to the school and looking after him.  It is impossible for schools to work under those conditions. I know the Minister would agree with that.  It is untenable for teachers to try to operate in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>I should like to go a little further.  A number of different teachers have been in touch with me assessing the difficulties in their areas.  I refer particularly to a group of teachers in the Clondalkin area who took the pupil service by a group of 20 schools with approximately 8,500 pupils.  They found that in what is probably the only real growth area in terms of housing in Ireland at present, there is an educational psychological service in national schools, there are long delays in the assessment procedure for non-psychiatric referrals, many of the schools in the Clondalkin area are officially recognised as disadvantaged by the Department of Education and, that the basic rights of these children are being denied.  I could develop that point at great lengths but I will not do that.  I am simply stating the problem for the record and I know the Minister is aware of that fact.</P>
    <P>My own organisation, the INTO, have held discussions on this matter for more than 14 years &mdash; I have records in front of me which go back to the early seventies. The INTO have been in consultation with the Psychological Society of Ireland and both have been in contact with various Ministers and the Department of Education.  There is agreement &mdash; and this is the important point &mdash; between the Department of Education, the INTO and the Psychological Society <Col N="2321" /> of Ireland as to how such a service might be implemented and set up.  All that prework has been done.  There is also agreement that in order to get this off the ground a pilot scheme should be approved.  Everyone in the professional area of education agrees that you cannot start something and expect it to work from the first day.  It has to be assessed, modified, reassessed, changed, implemented and studied before we finally get what would be a fully working procedure.</P>
    <P>In general terms, it would mean that for a set number of schools a team of psychologists would be available; they would be based in one school and they would service a certain number of schools in whatever area, geographical or otherwise, which the Department would decide, in the same way as an inspector advises in different schools in an area. There is total agreement that this should be done.  There is also agreement that there should be one pilot scheme in a rural area and one in a urban area.  I know the Cathaoirleach will support this where there is disadvantage in the city, it gets a high profile because there are large groups in one area, but there is also rural disadvantage where there might be one exceptionally poor family living in a well off area.  They also have need of a psychological service.  Even thought poverty is not directly related to the needs of the psychological service, we find high instances of need in areas of socio-economic deprivation.  That is the reason I make that point.  It is clear that one in every ten or one in every 15 pupils would have need of some sort of remedial help outside the school, and part to that would come under a psychological service.  I could not quantify the need in that case except to say that we all agree it is there. We have costed the scheme in many different ways.  I should again like to put the case to the Minister I made last September. I want to tell the Minister how a no cost psychological service could be put together.  In the primary education system we have a redemployment panel where people wait to be reallocated jobs in another school.  By taking these people in the primary education service &mdash; there are many fully qualified teachers who also <Col N="2322" /> have a diploma in psychology &mdash; out of their schools for a year, 18 months or two years &mdash; or whatever period it takes to qualify them in a university or college of education as educational psychologists &mdash; all the Department need do is redeploy somebody from the panel; somebody who is being paid in any case and is seen by the Department as being in excess of the staffing needs in their school &mdash; I would not agree completely with that position as the Minister is well aware.  At least, this person who is being paid to do a particular job &mdash; and the Department would see him as being in excess of the needs of the school could replace the person who was studying.  So far, there is no cost to the State.  The only cost I see is for the training course.  After two years, this teacher &mdash; now a trained teacher and educational paychologist &mdash; is still on the staff of his or her school and like a shared remedial teacher he can go from one school to another, covering a number of schools in an area.  In order to take advantage of demographic trends we could set up a school psychological service at no cost.  I am simplifying the matter but life is never quite that simple. The Minister is aware of the line I am taking and knows it is possible to do what I have said by a process of in service education.</P>
    <P>Last night I spoke with a person in Tallaght, a fully qualified teacher and child educational psychologist, who is teaching in a primary school.  If the Department were prepared to take somebody like that &mdash; I am not sure how many of those people exist &mdash; they could start immediately.  In terms of costing the scheme if we had to pay salaries &mdash; in the scheme I outlined there would not be a cost on salaries &mdash; started from scratch, brought in new people and created new jobs, for one year the scheme would cost slightly over £70,000, including the salary of the senior psychologist and two psychologists on a basic staff.  The Department agree that the best way to do this is to put psychologists in teams of three because they would obviously cover a wider area than one psychologist and there would be a back-up research service.</P>
    <P>I have taken you very briefly through <Col N="2323" /> the negotiations and the level of agreement that exist with all the parties on this issue.  There is no doubt that there is need here but there is agreement on how that need should be met.  The Minister agrees that this is the way to go about it.  There is agreement on all sides that the pilot scheme should be set up.  From everything we have seen the most obvious urban area in which to set up this service would be in the west County Dublin area from Tallaght-Clondalkin to Mulhuddart, but particularly in the area from Lady's Well to Clondalkin.  The Minister knows how schools are developed in that area.  There are huge housing estates, there are huge schools and there are many other problems but it would be appreciated if that movement were made.  The Minister has agreed it should take place.  She has also indicated &mdash; in a speech earlier in the year &mdash; that this is a scheme she would wish to set up and implement.  It now seems that all that is needed is the nod to go ahead and start up the scheme.  It would be a most progressive and most welcome development. We have outlined the need for it, the agreement that there is for setting it up, how little it would cost to do it and how much it would be appreciated.  My final and most important point is that the children who are most in need would be the beneficiaries.  We talk about people in need &mdash; that has become a cant phrase in the last couple of months.  These are the people in greatest need because they are at the stage of greatest development.  It is at that age that they need most help. This is the way that they could at least be given a direction.  We might find out after setting up a pilot scheme that the State does not have the resources to meet the particular needs but at least it would help us to identify the needs and problems of pupils and allow us to go down the road to meeting those needs.  I would ask the Minister to reply generously and positively to the matter.</P>

      <P>We thought we had adjourned <i>sine die,</i> but naturally adjournment matters take precedence over any adjournment <i>sine die.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I wanted to take this debate <Col N="2324" /> myself, despite having been here all day because I am interested in it.  I had thought that there was another event to which I had to go, but the other event happened without me being there.  That having happened, I still wanted to come back to the House.  I apologise to my Minister of State for pre-emptorily removing him, having asked him to sit in but it is proof of my interest and my wish to inform myself about the matter.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator O'Toole for raising this matter on the Adjournment, the last adjournment of this Seanad.  I wish to say that, of course, I agree with the Senator. There is no quarrel between us on the need for this service.  I have said so publicly so many times that people are beginning to wear out listening to me.</P>
    <P>The need for this service was identified 14 years ago.  I have looked back over records, submissions, meetings and so forth and see that it was identified back in the early to mid-seventies.  Yet that need was ignored by successive administrations. When you think back you remember times that were better for innovative measures.  Let us not talk about that, that is what happened in the past but to put the matter in context ongoing discussioins have gone on over a great number of years.</P>
    <P>I know what Senator O'Toole means, because I taught for so many years at second level.  You greet young children of 12 and 13 in September.  When I started they were even a bit younger, only 11 perhaps, coming in to secondary school but they are now nearly all 12 years old. You saw then that many children had problems.  I used to keep on saying to myself, if only those children had been got earlier, if only their various difficulties had been ascertained and worked upon and talked through with them and with their parents and with all of the relevant professional bodies, so many of them perhaps would not have developed the various difficulties they developed because they had now reached maturation, their behavioural patterns were set and they were subject to peer pressure about various matters.  Because of puberty and all sorts of developments they were unable to get out of the spiral of deprivation and of behavioural problems <Col N="2325" /> which had started way back in their very early years in primary school.  There is no doubt of that.</P>
    <P>I have come across many rebellious teenagers but often in school you do not have the time to talk with them. However, if the opportunity arose to talk things through with them, you could often see the beginnings of where it had all happened, why it had happened and how it had happened.  It often lead me to think that it was such a grave pity that they were not got in time.  That sounds horrible, as if it was just a matter of catching them and grabbing them.  I do not mean that at all.  They just were not helped in time and there was not the professional expertise available to do it. There are not the facilities in the normal course of a school environment to do so. That is what lead me two years ago to put this item forward as a matter I wanted to do something about.  Not long after coming into office I had a series of meetings with the Psychological Society at which I openly expressed my view as distinct from some views which were being put to me.  I openly expressed the view that this programme should get underway.</P>
    <P>In the Department at present we are preparing a response to the Central Review Committee on the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which seeks to identify how the Department of Education could respond to their responsibilities in treating areas of educational disadvantage, particularly at primary level but also to all over educational disadvantage. I intend to put into that submission the need for setting up the educational psychological service on a pilot basis as outlined in this Adjournment debate.  The best way to address the matter would be to formally submit it to the social partners forum as set up under the Central Review Committee.  It would form part of the Department of Education's proposals in response to a request by that review committee.  I will be giving a direction in the next few days to the people involved in the preparation of that submission, that they include the two pilot projects; (1) urban and (2) rural-large town or small town setting.</P>
    <P>If our submission and its various other <Col N="2326" /> components receive approval in various fora we will be enabled to move ahead. When we do get to set up the projects they will, of course, have to be professionally monitored and evaluated.  The evaluative process of that would have to be enormously important because everything in a pilot project has to be evaluated. If we are starting on something which eventually will have far reaching implications for the wellbeing of young children and for their future directions, one would have to go about it the correct way.  Professional evaluation would be of huge importance in monitoring and evaluating the service.</P>
    <P>At the moment, a Chathaoirligh, just to put it succinctly, we are formulating a policy in response to how we would determine how to tackle educational disadvantage. I intend to give a direction that the consideration of the inclusion of two pilot projects be part of that submission. Hopefully we will be able to develop along the lines of the pilot project. I put it like that because there are processes yet to be gone through before that decision would finally be taken, but that is as I hope it would go.</P>
    <P>On a day which has seen at one end of the scale the conferring of university status on two fine institutions, one in Dublin and one in Limerick, perhaps it is also important and significant that it may well mark the final road to the setting up of this important service for very disadvantaged young children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I am very heartened by that response from the Minister and perhaps the Minister would indicate that I am interpreting her words properly.  She says the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> have sought a response from her on the general issue of educational disadvantage and that part of the response of the Department of Education would be a proposal that a pilot programme be set up.  I certainly cannot ask for any more than that from the Minister at this point because I know that that certainly is a significant advance. I am very grateful for that development because I also know that the Minister's Department must respond to the Central <Col N="2327" /> Review Committee in the next number of weeks.</P>
