      <P>Today is the 50th anniversary of the founding of Shannon Airport. In sending our good wishes to all those who have made it such a success and our good wishes for the future of Shannon, may I ask the Leader of the House to arrange for an early debate on the report of the Fifth Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies, that is the report on Aer Lingus and Aerlínte?  It would be useful and appropriate if we could have a fairly full debate in the House on this very important report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a small point.  In relation to the name, An Blascaod Mór National Historic Park, would it be preferable if we had the name fully in Irish and fully in English rather than the melange of the two?  Perhaps in the other House, or on Report Stage the Taoiseach might consider changing the name to one or the other, or a choice of both rather than a mixture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure the Senator that I wrestled with this for some time and eventually decided on this title.  The Irish version of the Bill, of course, will give the title completely in Irish.  My thinking was that on the island itself and, indeed, in the interpretative centre on the mainland, the notices would read &ldquo;An Blascaod Mór&rdquo; and then &ldquo;National Historic Park&rdquo;.  It should read all right, but I will think again about it.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 10, after &ldquo;Minister,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and after consultation with the Foundation,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>First, I do not want to appear to have been discourteous to the Taoiseach, but neither my watch nor the clock yet records the time as being 10.45 a.m. which is the time we agreed to resume.  I regret if the Taoiseach felt that any of us was being discourteous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill there is an understandable <Col N="1880" /> and reasonable philosophy which is that the State, through the Commissioners of Public Works, should acquire and be responsible for the well-being of An Blascaod Mór but that the Fondúireacht, or the Foundation as it is described in the Bill, would be effectively the sensitisers of what is appropriate, given the unique position An Blascaod Mór occupies in our cultural heritage.  Therefore, it is extremely important that if the commissioners are drawing up by-laws to deal with their obligations under this Bill, they should consult with the Foundation about all details of those by-laws.  Section 3 states:</P>
    <P>The Commissioners may, with the consent of the Minister, make by-laws for the care, maintenance, management, control, preservation, protection and development of the Park and the regulation of the use of the Park and the maintenance of good order therein.</P>
    <P>It is a serious omission that the Foundation should not have a statutory right to be consulted about all such by-laws.  It would be most unsatisfactory if the commissioners drew up by-laws and did not reflect the views of Fondúireacht an Bhlascaoid.  After all, the initial impetus that has brought us this far is the extraordinary energy and capacity of the people who set up Fundúireacht an Bhlascaoid.  They are the people who developed the idea and created the climate of opinion which was obviously received very favourably, in particular by the Taoiseach.  They were the people who created the climate in which this whole development has taken place.  It is important, therefore, that the Foundation should continue to play a central role in all this.  It is, therefore, an omission that they should not have a statutory right to be consulted about by-laws which would be imposed on them as well as on everybody else.  They should be consulted before any such by-laws are drawn up and that is why I move this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The question which occurs to me in this connection is this: if <Col N="1881" /> the Bill in general was drafted in cooperation with the Fondúireacht, why would the Fondúireacht not require this kind of stipulation which Senator Ryan wishes to insert?  Why did they not request that they be given an explicit statutory role, as Senator Ryan now proposes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Senators have a point.  First, the Bill was drawn up in full consultation with the Fondúireacht at every stage and they are very happy with the Bill and its provisions.  They will be fully involved in the management of the island.  In practice, the Fondúireacht will suggest to the Office of Public Works that they would like this or that by-law drawn up and, therefore, the question of consulting &mdash; as specifically suggested by the Senator &mdash; would not arise.  Of course, there will be constant consultation between the Office of Public Works, Roinn na Gaeltachta and the Fondúireacht. We visualise the Fondúirteacht as being the primary people on the ground, managing, looking after and making proposals for development and for the better management of the affairs of the island.  The Bill specifically provides that the Fondúireacht will have that responsibility.</P>
      <P>What I am about to say now applies to both of Senator Ryan's amendments.  We have to look ahead.  What we are doing here is unusual.  Normally a Bill of this kind would simply give the powers to the Office of Public Works or to a Government Department and that would be the end of the matter, but because of the situation down there and particularly because of the atmosphere Senator Ryan has described, which is absolutely correct, we want to bring the local community in on the management of the affairs of the island from here on and we want to do that through the Fondúireacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an unusual procedure to have an outside private body actually involved in the management of State property, so we are taking a bit of a leap in the dark.  It is an experiment and I am quite certain it will work very well but we have to <Col N="1882" /> proceed with some caution because we are making this departure of bringing a body, which is not responsible to this House in any way, in on the full management and indeed vesting in them the full authority for management of the island.  For that reason both the Office of Public Works and the Fondúireacht are involved it its management.</P>
    <P>The Fondúireacht are an excellent organisation but are not a statutory one. Therefore, it is quite possible and conceivable that in the course of time the excellent people who are there now will not always be there.  Indeed we have to visualise that the Fondúireacht might go out of existence, as a lot of these voluntary organisations do over a period of years.  I could not, therefore, put in a provision that they have to be consulted because they might not be there.  On the other hand, I see the Senator's point of view.  I know that both the Department and the Office of Public Works will consult on a regular, ongoing basis with the Fondúireacht but I think it would be a bit unwise to put that mandatory provision of consultation into the legislation in case future developments might create an impossible situation for us.  I can give the House the assurance that Aire na Gaeltachta will certainly ensure that the Fondúireacht are consulted, if that has not already been done, before agreeing to any particular regulation or by-law.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Senator that his concept of consultation will, of necessity, be fully adhered to.  The Bill specifically brings the Fondúireacht into the position of management and control so that consultation will have to take place but I think it would be a bit unwise to include that measure as a statutory mandatory provision.  There is also, of course, the question that some time it might be necessary to make an urgent by-law to deal with some situation that would arise and it might not be possible to go through a consultation procedure with the Fondúireacht. For example, the Office of Public Works might deem it necessary to bring in as an emergency matter some particular by-law or regulation.  I think, on the whole, it is better to leave it as <Col N="1883" /> the legislation is framed, with a solemn undertaking by me as Aire na Gaeltachta, binding on my successors, that the Minister will ensure that the Fondúireacht are consulted, if possible, before any regulations are made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no conflict of values or philosophy here but, with all respect to the Taoiseach, I am not sure that he can make a commitment, other than in law, which is binding on his successors. I accept the Taoiseach's goodwill in this matter, and I accept quite clearly that this Bill would never have come before this House with the speed it has done were it not for the fact that he has a particular interest in it, as have a considerable number of Members of this House.  As I said in my Second Stage speech, a part of his heart is in that part of the world, as is my own.  Indeed, the same goes for others.  The problem with the Office of Public Works is that they can be both remarkably good and remarkably bad.  We just have to look around here or at the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham to see how remarkably good they can be, but you can look at the new Government building which they imposed on Sullivan's Quay in Cork to see how remarkably bad they can be.  As long as the philosophical base and the attitudes are correct and as long as the inspiration is there, they will be very good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that with the present Minister for the Gaeltacht there will be no problem in the immediate future but what bothers me is that the essential vitality of this whole exercise is to retain something alive.  It is not meant to be just a memory of what used to be.  The objective of this Bill, as of an awful lot of public policy, is not just to remind us of what used to be in the Gaeltachtaí but to keep them alive and, in those living Gaeltachtaí, to preserve and sustain an alternative strand of our heritage.  The Foundation represents local sentiment, local feeling and local understanding.  I appreciate the problem of them not being a statutory body, but they are the nearest thing we have to a <Col N="1884" /> representative voice of those who are connected with that area.</P>
    <P>It seems the commissioners are being given far too much leeway and far too much capacity to act independently, particularly if there is not a firm guiding hand in a future administration to direct them.  I accept that as of now with the present Foundation, the present Minister and the present attitudes there will be no problems, but I do not accept that there could ever be such an urgency about that area that the Office of Public Works, based here in Dublin, would be entitled to make by-laws without consultation with those who are there on the ground. A fundamental issue that I cannot accept is that there can ever be a situation where a centralised metropolitan authority can have the right to make regulations about a local area without local consultation.  I do not accept that that degree of urgency can ever exist.  It is inimical to any idea of local democracy to tolerate that, especially in an area like this where we are not talking about big power politics. I regret the fact that the Taoiseach is not keen on the amendment.  I can see the problem, that the Foundation might not exist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would make one more point and that is that these by-laws will have to be laid on the Table of the House here which is another safeguard, if you like.  The Office of Public Works would not be totally untrammelled in the exercise of their jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Taoiseach has just said.  Of course they will have to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, but this is not a problem of law; it is a problem almost of philosophy. Should we write into legislation that it is the right of those who initiated this whole idea, who created the climate of opinion where it became a matter of complete consensus within the political system, to be consulted about the State making regulations about something that is essentially their project?  I think we should.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If section 5 were not there the Senator might have a point, but that section brings the Foundation, An Fondúireacht, totally into the picture and gives them a very special role in the whole management of the oileáin.  I think if the Senator keeps that in mind and keeps in mind the fact that the Office of Public Works have to have the sanction of Aire na Gaeltachta for any by-laws and that those by-laws have to be laid on the Table of this House, which would certainly give the Fondúireacht an opportunity to get in touch with deputies or Senators if that absurd situation ever arose whereby they would object to a particular by-law.  Knowing these islands fairly well, I think it is always possible that there might in some cases be an emergency.  Fondúireacht might take it on themselves to get in touch with the Office of Public Works or Aire na Gaeltachta and say: &ldquo;There is a threatening situation developing.  Somebody is behaving badly or in regard to the island is doing something which is inimical to its best interests and we want you to act quickly and make a by-law.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to pay a very sincere tribute to the Foundation who came together with a view to acquiring the main Blasket Island for the State. They have great intentions for the Blasket Island.  The Office of Public Works, in general, have always consulted the local people and people who were interested in the national monuments.  I am sure they will now do the same.  Then they have introduced the by-laws.  I served in that Department for a number of years and I have always found that the Office of Public Works do things in the right way, and in consultation with interested people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it, Senator Brendan Ryan said that the Foundation hurried the acquisition of the main Blasket Island by the State.  I remember many years ago &mdash; it was about 1979 &mdash; when my colleague on my right, Senator Tom Fitzgerald, put down a motion in Kerry County Concil &mdash; asking the State at that time to acquire the main Blasket Island <Col N="1886" /> for the State.  When I was Minister of State at the Office of Public Works I was requested by the then Taoiseach, who is now our present Taoiseach, to try to acquire the land of the Blasket Island for the State.  Indeed, we endeavoured to do that.  I am quite sure that the by-laws can be left in the hands of the Office of Public Works.  In the past they have never done anything wrong; my experience is that they always introduce by-laws after consultation with the local people and even with the local authorities and I am quite confident they can do so in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a great pity the Taoiseach would not look more favourably on this amendment.  I see it as being more necessary in the future than today, because quite honestly I believe we could be creating a white elephant. While I have no objection to a historic park on the Blasket Island, I am saddened as I have said on Second Stage of this debate that we are not providing for a living presence on the island.  I believe that pressure will come, be it in ten or 50 years time.  Whatever body replaces the Foundation will be the body who will be getting most pressure because there is bound to be some local&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended making a Second Stage speech.  We came to an arrangement last Wednesday that those who were offering would be given a two minute slot rather than a ten minute slot which our colleagues who had gone before us got.  I understood you, a Chathaoirligh, and the Leader of the House indicated we would have ample opportunity to say on Committee Stage what we had wanted to say on Second Stage.  That way my understanding.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that it is an <Col N="1887" /> important amendment and will be seen in the future to be of greater importance than it might seem today because I have a gut feeling that the pressure will come for a living village on this island.  I believe the presence of people should have been maintained on this island over the years. I am a bit frightened when the Taoiseach says that a guarantee to these people is that it would be laid before both Houses because it was inaction by the Oireachtas, the inaction of our predecessors over the years, that has the Blasket Islands without people.  To have an historic park on the Blasket Island it will be necessary to have easy access.  It will be necessary to build a pier&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>It has to do with consultation as to the future by-laws for the park.  The point I am making is that to have a national park, an historic park, it will be necessary to have easy access; otherwise what are we building the park for &mdash; the birds?  We have to get people out there.  I maintain that if we were to include in this national park, or in part of the Blasket Islands, provision for a living&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph (g) of section 2(3) is relevant to the point the Senator is making.  It gives specific power to the Office of Public Works to provide these things, to provide transport, piers and everything that is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be coming to that later.  The point I am making is that <Col N="1888" /> it is of utmost importance that we have an input from the local people, and indeed from the people who were forced off the island if there are any of them left when the time comes for making these by-laws. I ask the Taoiseach to have another look at this amendment and perhaps on Report Stage to bring in his own amendment. I do not entirely agree with the amendment that &ldquo;after consultation with the Foundation&rdquo;&mdash; the Foundation, as the Taoiseach has indicated, may not be there.  I believe there will always be a local committee and there will always be local interest until people begin to live on the island again.  I would like to see some way of permitting people to come back to the island because I believe it will come alive again when there is easy access: lack of access was the main thing that drove the people from the island in 1955.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to correct myself.  As the Bill stands at present it does not specify that the by-laws have to be laid on the Table of the Oireachtas.  I will provide for that in the Dáil.  All it does provide is that the by-laws shall be displayed in the park itself on the island. I think I can give an undertaking to the Seanad that in the Dáil we will provide that in the Bill.  My main problem is that the Fondúireacht may not be there.  I hope it will, I am sure it will, but we have to look far down the road when we are passing legislation of this kind and try to provide for all eventualities.  That is my worry.  If there is a mandatory provision here to consult with the Fondúireacht, that might get us into difficulties.  I would certainly visualise full consultation. There will have to be consultation because the Fondúireacht will be involved fully in the management of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, in response to another point made by Senator Brendan Ryan, it will not be a situation where the head office of the Office of Public Works in Dublin will be deciding things for the Blaskets. The Office of Public Works will have local people down there.  I am quite certain they will have to employ wardens or rangers and these people will be the operative people and not the bureaucrats <Col N="1889" /> in Dublin.  Having said all that, I am anxious to get all Stages passed here today.  I do not know if I can give an undertaking about Report Stage.</P>
    <P>However, I will look at this again and see if some provision could be put in which would involve consultation but which would not get us into mandatory difficulty &mdash; perhaps some phrase like &ldquo;having consulted to the extent that seems to them appropriate&rdquo; or something similar.  I might be able to do that in the Dáil, if that would satisfy the Senator.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That covers the main difficulty that I had.  In supporting the amendment, I was worried mostly by that point.  The Taoiseach has covered it in the sense that there has been consultation until now.  I had discussed the Bill with the members of the Fondúireacht and they were quite happy with the way the Bill was developing and the proposals on it.  However, the Taoiseach, in giving a commitment that will cover it by positive or negative statutory process through approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas, covers our sense of responsibility towards it.  The one issue that worries me if this provision were to go through was the response of Senator McMahon.  When I hear talk about pressures for building a village on the island, that is all the more reason that I would be very careful about the form of consultation.  Last week we talked about the fine responsible, efficient and effective work of the Office of Public Works.  In the parks that they maintain and operate and manage right through the country, the same can be said.  Any that I have seen have been most impressive.  Therefore the purpose of the amendment put forward by Senator Ryan was not in any sense to dilute their responsibility, but to include the local people.  I believe that the Taoiseach's affirmation that he would at a later stage bring in an appropriate change.  It covers all the points that have been made and in fact protects the island from pressure groups of any sort, except those who have shown their commitment to it as it stands.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(j)  the control, or prohibition of the use of any form of wireless receivers including transistor radios, cassette players, portable CD players and portable TV sets.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention of this amendment which inserts on page 4, between lines 36 and 37 the following phrase: &ldquo;the control, or prohibition of the use of any form of wireless receivers including transistor radios, cassette players, portable CD players and portable TV set.&rdquo; is clearly part of the intention of the Bill as generally framed because it recognises the value of An Blascaod Mór as an amenity. The intention of this amendment is simply to secure further the enjoyment of that amenity.  People who wish to avail of this sort of amenity would in most cases want to be protected from what I <Col N="1891" /> can describe as noise pollution.  If you go to an area of natural beauty to enjoy the scenery, you do no wish to be lifted out of it by the ill-advised use of a ghettoblaster. Many of us may be all too familiar with this in the public parks and greens even of our own city of Dublin.  It could be argued that this is not excluded from the range of provisions and it remains within the scope of the Bill for this to be added later.  The reason I put this amendment down is not that I was unaware of this possibility but that I think it is a matter of priority and that a number of us would feel there is an element of prioritisation in this and that we wish it to be clear that this specific intention of the by-laws is to enable people to have precisely the kind of enjoyment of the environment that I have spoken about.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I reiterate the point that you do not, in my opinion, go to the Blasket Islands to listen to pop music. You go to enjoy what a pop song once described as the sound of silence, the sound of waves breaking on the shore, the sound of sea birds and the sound of the wind.  I hope there will be a positive response to this amendment.</P>

      <P>I fully understand the reasons behind the amendment but I must say I can see very little merit in it. In some sense it is busybody legislation. Those who go to the Blasket Islands can, for the most part, be almost entirely depended upon to be people who would not want to interfere with the peace and quite of others.  But there can be situations &mdash; it could be a group of students on the island who would like to hear the All-Ireland Hurling or football finals or might wish to follow what is happening in the European Cup, and to have some officious official coming down and telling them that they cannot listen to the wireless is going too far and does not really merit a place in legislation.  I suspect that the sort of people who are attracted by the Blasket Islands will be people who, if they do bring a radio or a portable television with them, will probably want <Col N="1892" /> to listen to the sort of music that is appropriate to the setting they are in.  I think we are going too far to write this into the by-laws.  It is best left to the good sense of the people who are on the island.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Manning.  This is unduly restrictive on personal liberty.  You cannot stop people from bringing with them what is now part and parcel of their baggage of life, as it were.  Indeed, as Senator Manning said, they might wish to listen to some sports event, or they might want to hear, as I frequently want to hear, what goes on on Raidio na Gaeltachta.  What could be more fitting than on An Blascaodh Mór to hear the news of what is happening in Dunquin and who has come home from America, etc.  Certainly that would be valid and legitimate.  I understand Senator Norris's point.  It is an aesthetic objection he has which we all share but I do not think we can carry it to the extent of implementing it in law.  You might as well make it a requirement for a visit to the Blascaod Mór that if you feel like singing you would be allowed to sing only a sean nós.  It belongs to that kind of category of prohibition.</P>

He got very angry and said &ldquo;Ba mhaith libhse go gconódh muidne i seanmhúsaem &mdash;&ldquo;You people would like us to live in an old museum&rdquo;.  It is a living part of our heritage that we are trying to preserve.  While I accept that ghettoblasters blaring in one's ear are offensive there are ways under general regulations to deal with that without telling people that you cannot play a transistor radio under any circumstances.  The idea that the citizens of West Kerry would be told on a Sunday of an All-Ireland Football Final that they could not listen to the match if they happened to be on An Blascaod Mór seems to me to be at fundamental variance with what we are trying to do in this Bill.  I understand fully <Col N="1893" /> what Senator Norris is bothered about but I do not think this is the way to some the problem.</P>

      <P>I agree with the views of the Senators who have put down the amendment &mdash; it is hideous to go to a beach and hear blaring radios.  I think they are carrying it a step too far here because as Senator Manning said, the people who go to the Blasket Islands are not the type who will have their radios at high pitch and they will not be there in their hundreds anyway.  What we should be doing is ensuring that the legislation will do all it can to encourage people to visit and not prohibit people who may want to listen to a particular sporting game from doing so.  Even if they are on the island and there is a radio playing, I do not think it will cause too great an annoyance to the other users of the island.  In fact, the group using the radio or cassette might be the only group on the island.</P>
      <P>Last Sunday week, a fine summer's day, I took a stroll from Lough Dan in the heart of Wicklow along that beautiful volley to Lough Tay and there were literally hundreds of people walking that valley.  You cannot use your car, you are only permitted to walk the valley, and we came across two people using cassettes. It would have annoyed me if I had to stay with them, but there was ample room to move on, and there was ample room overhead for the noise to rise.  It did not annoy us or anybody else, but there were only two people using radios out of hundreds. It could have been a break to the bird song, or the silence in the valley, but it certainly did not annoy anybody.  I believe to include this amendment would be an unnecessary prohibition and indeed might discourage somebody, who might only have that particular afternoon &mdash; while his favourite hurling match was on the radio &mdash; to visit the Blaskets.  I think we should permit him to listen to his radio or cassette.</P>

      <P>As a native of Corca Dhuibhne I could not imagine west Kerry people going out on a Sunday afternoon to see the Blasket Islands without having access to a radio to hear what was going on, particularly in the football world.  On the other hand, I think the objective of Senator Norris's proposal is to control good order on the island.  This is covered in an earlier part of the Bill which says that the commission may make by-laws for the maintenance of good order.  If somebody were playing a radio or cassette so loudly that it interfered with good order under the existing regulations the commissioners could control what was going on.  There is a great sensitivity in west Kerry about attitudes towards the Gaeltacht, particularly from people outside. I know because I went to school with people who were not allowed access to English novels until they were almost at third level education.  It is something they bitterly resent.</P>
      <P>I know people from the Gaeltacht who do not speak Irish because they feel it was presented to them as the language of the oppressed, and in a similar way the tendency to reject modern developments, is something that was always resented both by the Blasket people and by west Kerry people, in general.  I feel it is unnecessary to put forward this amendment to the Bill.  There is adequate control in the Bill to do this.  As well we are asking people to go to the Blasket</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1895" /> Islands to enjoy themselves, to enjoy their day out, and we should not restrict them in any way.  It is, after all, a leisure park as well as a historic park.  It is a place where we would want people to go, not as they would approach the silence of a shrine but for leisure time activities, going to a place where they can enjoy and be a part of the environment, and perhaps even assimilating some aspects of modern life into it.</P>
    <P>To my mind, Senator Norris's proposal is covered by an earlier part of the Bill. Knowing him, I do not believe he would want to reject any developments, He is talking about the interference with other people's enjoyment of the island.  There is adequate control in the by-laws at present to do that.</P>

It is fair to assume that many people will visit the National Park.  Irish people and Europeans will visit that park and if we get perfect legislation everbyody is happy with, people will be afraid to go there. To those who have expressed fears about control and management, radios and cassettes, etc, I would invite them to see how a national park works very satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>Including Senator Manning. Honestly, it can be a terrible imposition to go into a public place or public park and have people blaring radios at you in an unrestricted fashion.  My understanding of this amendment, to which my name is added, is that this is not asking for the banning of all these things.  It is asking for the control or prohibition, and maybe it should be &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;control or prohibition&rdquo;.  Senator McGowan is right.  But it is asking for restrictions on these things because the Blasket Islands, presumably, are expected to develop a certain character and maybe a certain tranquility.  It is possible that people will go over and ruin other people's stay on the Blaskets because they have got these particular objects.  I notice that section 3 (2) (g) includes &ldquo;the regulation or prohibition of the use of vehicles or specified vehicles in the Park,&rdquo; specifically for the same sort of reason, because of noise and pollution. I cannot see why including these particular objects put down in this amendment is inconsistent with the rest of these clauses.</P>

      <P>The point has been well made at this stage that people feel there is adequate provision already within regulations to ensure that an orderly set of regulations and behaviour patterns can be established without putting it in the Bill.  It is important that we would not lose sight of the tourism dimension in this whole concept, and the Taoiseach talked on that quite substantially last week.  We are acutely aware of the significant historic value and the need to preserve that value.  It is important that we should have a significant tourism dimension to it.  The least number of constraints that are put on people the better.  Given that we appear to be satisfied that it is within the compass of the Office of Public Works to ensure that their own park rangers who will be on <Col N="1897" /> the island, this will ensure that a certain acceptable level of noise is achieved.  I do not think there is any great need to put it down in black and white.</P>
      <P>It is particularly important that we should encourage young people to go to the island and see for themselves what life was like there in the last century. Maybe it is an indication of the age gap that is in evidence in this House or that we are out of touch with young people that we should expect them to go through a whole day without listening to a radio.  It is quite unrealistic in the modern context. On behalf of the young people here I suggest that this is a bit of an overkill and we should be satisfied that the staff who will be on the island will be quite competent to ensure that an acceptable level of noise is maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no way that we could possibly include Senator Norris's amendment because he refers to &ldquo;the use of any form of wireless&rdquo;.  It is very important on any island to have a wireless of some description for transmitting and receiving.  I am sure the Taoiseach knows that you have to communicate.  That part about the prohibition of the use of any form of wireless receivers is not on. Enough is said about cutting out the use of transistor radios.  Generally people in parks, in the Zoo, or wherever, have the use of a radio and they do not go crazy. They do not play it wildly all day.  Control, yes, but prohibition no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, this is a very interesting discussion on this point.  First of all, I want to comment on the suggestion that the Blasket Island is a place of peace and quiet.  More often than not the natural surroundings and the wind and wave are such that you would not hear a transistor on the island.  The first point I want to make is that if we are going to do anything here it would certainly be better done by by-law than in the Bill itself.  There is a practice by <Col N="1898" /> the Office of Public Works of making by-laws on this matter.  In fact in the by-laws governing the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park in Killarney there is a very specific provision says:</P>
      <P>No person shall save with the permission in writing of the Commissioners and subject to such conditions as the Commissioners may prescribe conduct or take part in any musical performance whether vocal or instrumental music, dance, concert or other like entertainment in any part of the park or operate any radio, cinema, television of gramophone apparatus in the demesne section of the park.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works are certainly on the ball there in so far as the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park is concerned.</P>
      <P>I want to point out to Senators, because this is probably very relevant to some of them, that in the by-laws governing St. Stephen's Green it is stated:</P>
      <P>No person shall within the Green, without the permission of the Commissioners, engage or take part in any dancing, theatrical or musical performance, or operate any radio, cinema, television or gramophone apparatus.</P>
      <P>I want to warn Senator Norris, in particular, that he must not go dancing and tripping the light fantastic through St. Stephen's Green or he may be in trouble with their lordships in the Office of Public Works.  Those two provisions are there by way of by-law.  If anything is to be done about noise or about these things on the island, it would be better done by by-law than by actually putting it into the statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Office of Public Works can take note of what has been said here today and decide whether or not they think a by-law of some kind would be necessary. I believe it would be necessary to have a general type of by-law which would make it necessary for anybody who wanted to run a concert, for instance, or some major public event on the island to <Col N="1899" /> receive permission to do so.  That is something that it would be reasonably necessary to do.</P>
    <P>In order to display my knowledge of young people to the Senator, I want to point out that most of them, as far as I can seem use things called a Walkman whereby they can hear anything they like without intruding on anybody.  I suppose the Office of Public Works would not find it necessary to ban the use of a Walkman on the island.  It is a question of balance and commonsense.  There will probably be some provision in the by-laws to govern public occasions and events of a public nature.  Whether that would necessarily be extended to govern the use by individuals of radios or transistors is something we will have to consider.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators spoke on this matter.  I would like to say that I recall one of the most pleasant occasions of my life was when I was out on the Aran Islands one beautiful sunny Sunday afternoon sitting in a circle around a radio on the ground listening to one of the All-Ireland semi-finals, which Dublin won, and imbibing reasonable quantities of Guinness' dark brown stout.  I would be loath to prevent such an occurrence on the Blasket Island should the occasion arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I would like to make some comments beforehand.  The Taoiseach put his finger on it when he talked about balance and reasonableness. In his response he indicated that he possesses these two qualities perhaps more than some of the other speakers I may say.  My colleague Senator Ross almost literally extracted a phrase from my mouth when he said that he was astonished at the outbreak of liberalism around the House.  I am not, because I believe most of the people here are fairly liberal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amazed at the outbreak of individualism which is a slightly different thing.  I am also astonished that so few of the people who spoke so passionately on <Col N="1900" /> behalf of the rights of the individual, and so on, and as Senator O'Callaghan did about tourism, were apparently unaware of the by-laws that operate in many of the parks, as the Taoiseach has correctly indicated, throughout this country and also throughout many European and American parks.  I can assure the House that, if it is the intention of the House to attract tourists to this kind of amenity, they will not do it by encouraging the playing of ghettoblasters and so on.</P>
    <P>The reason behind the amendment which I will be withdrawing was to prevent the use of wireless and transistor sets as instruments of aggression.  This is something that does happen, I am sure Members of the House will be aware of this and it is precisely for these reasons that many parks have the kind of by-laws to which the Taoiseach referred.  I accept that it may well be that the proper place for this mechanism of control is in the by-laws rather than as a section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would also have to concur with Senator Ross when he expressed surprise that this particular amendment drew so much ire because it comes in a section that prohibits a lot of other things many people want to do.  It allows the prohibition of access to specified areas.  I am surprised we have not been treated to the views of various Senators with regard to this particular issue, if indeed, as they maintained it was such a matter of principle to them all.  Perhaps we should have been treated to their views on this restriction which is far more severe.</P>

      <P>This is a point of some substance.  As the Senators know, the Bill confers on the Office of Public Works the power to compulsorily acquire lands, except certain lands.  We are exempting from the powers of compulsion holdings which are in the possession of the original island stock.  That is what we are aiming at.  There are still a number of people living there &mdash; this relates to a point also made by Senator McMahon &mdash; who have the original houses on the Blaskets occupied by their families and it was to cater for those people in particular that we put in this exemption provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of one particular case where a descendant of an island family have their house on the island and it is preserved <Col N="1902" /> meticulously as it was in the old days.  I do not think anyone would wish that family to have to go through the procedure of having their property acquired and then maybe having to buy it or lease it back from the Office of Public Works. We decided the simplest thing is to exempt from the compulsory powers those who are in that position, either somebody who was actually living on the island at the time it was deserted in 1953 or an immediate descendant or a close relative of such a person.</P>
    <P>As the Bill was drafted there was a flaw in it to this extent.  If such a person sold his or her property after the passing of the legislation, then that property could pass into the hands of some complete stranger and would not be subject to compulsory powers by the Office of Public Works.  It was in order to correct that that this provision is made.  We want to preserve the right of the original islanders, their relatives or descendants to their property and at the same time we want to ensure that if that property is disposed of, it then becomes subject to the compulsory acquisition powers in the legislation.  That is what these two amendments are about.</P>

      <P>The Cathaoirleach will tell me if I am in order.  I want to discuss the point of distinction being made between certain kinds of lands being exempted and others being subject to a compulsory purchase order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we discussed Second Stage last week in a glow of cultural nostalgia there was, nonetheless, a feeling of unease expressed by Senator Manning, among others, about certain unresolved problems and the constitutional consequences that might follow and an interview on the programme &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; intensified that unease.  I want to ask the Taoiseach if everything has been done that could be done to resolve whatever legal problems could be foreseen with respect to 17 holdings or 25 holdings, which have been the subject of interviews with a particular person in Dingle.  Has everything been done, before drafting this Bill, that could be done to meet any possible <Col N="1903" /> unpleasant consequences of the legislation? That is my problem.  My information is that proceedings may well ensue and that the constitutionality, which we worried about last week, lies in the distinction which the Bill makes between exempting certain lands from the compulsory purchase order.  Can one, in fact, make this distinction in equity? Why apply a compulsory purchase order at all?  Why not leave it to the discretion of the Commissioner to treat particular hereditary land in a favourable way?  Will this section be challenged constitutionally?</P>
    <P>It would be very unfortunate were there to take place an unseemly, and perhaps in the end a very expensive, legal wrangle following on the serene atmosphere in which we passed Second Stage last week.  I hope that everything has been done that can be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The points made by Senator Murphy are roughly in line with the points I wanted to make.  I have one or two further points to make, one of which I raised here last week.  I did so because of what I had seen in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of that day.  I thought it was better that the matter be discussed here. As the Taoiseach said last week, the publication of the legislation clarified a number of other people's minds about coming out with particular points of view.</P>
      <P>I should like to add to Senator Murphy's points.  Clearly, compulsory purchase orders are an everyday fact of life. They are made in the common interest and for various reasons.  Are we sure in this case that it is possible, without fearing a substantial challenge in court, to distinguish between the two categories of owners on the island?  Perhaps the Taoiseach has had legal advice on this and, if so, he might elaborate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, has any attempt been made by the Department to try to talk to the people in question since the debate here last week if that is thought appropriate, and if any progress has been made in that regard?  Perhaps if the Taoiseach would think it appropriate between the passing <Col N="1904" /> of the Bill here today in the Seanad and its introduction in the Dáil, which I suppose will be in the next two, three or four weeks?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to help the House on this matter.  Firstly, continuing efforts have been made locally by the Fondúireacht and others to bring the matter to some sort of conclusion without success.  I really think this Bill was necessary as a catalyst, so that we will know where everybody stands in the situation. On that basis then we will be able to proceed.  It is certainly the firm intention of the Fondúireacht, myself and the Office of Public Works to proceed on the basis of voluntary agreement, amicable settlements if at all possible.  I am reasonably confident that will be possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we all know, in these matters, whether it is a local authority or a Government Department who are concerned, attempts are always made to arrive at some reasonable and fair settlement with the compulsory powers always in the background to push the situation on a bit and make sure that the State body or local authority have the necessary power on their side to have the matter settled.  Every local authority and Government Department would prefer to have the agreement and the settlement rather than the protracted procedures which are involved in compulsory acquisition. It is a long drawn out process that involves hearings and submissions and, very often arbitration, and takes a long time.  Therefore, everybody would prefer if the objectives could be achieved by reasonable and honourable settlements. I hope that will be the case.  It would <Col N="1905" /> certainly be my intention that it should be the case.  At the end of the day we have to have compulsory powers in the background to make sure that matters are resolved.  I assure Senator Murphy that a lot of negotiations and discussions went on and attempts were made before the legislation was introduced and that these will continue.  I hope they will come to fruition.</P>
    <P>On the constitutionality point, I do not think there is any danger there.  First in so far as individuals are concerned there is no real distinction being made.  There is some distinction being made in the case of property.  Even a person who is exempted, a member of an original island family, will only be exempted in so far as his or her residence is concerned.  All these original holdings had the rights to about 1,000 acres of the island which was commonage, farmed or looked after in common.  We are acquiring that 1,000 acres compulsorily even though some of it belongs to the original island families who are exempt.  In that regard we are not making a difference between people. It does not matter if you are a member of an original island family you can still have your commonage rights compulsorily acquired, just as residences can be compulsorily acquired.  The only distinction we are making is that a member of an original island family will be exempt from compulsory acquisition powers in so far as their actual family home is concerned. In those circumstances, I am satisfied that we will not have constitutional difficulties.</P>
    <P>I hope that common sense and reasonableness will prevail, that the compulsory acquisition powers will never have to be used and that we will be able to proceed on the basis of voluntary acquisition by the Office of Public Works &mdash; voluntary acquisition, whether it is to do with the residences or the commonage or whether it has to deal with the members of the original island families or others who have bought properties since the island was deserted.</P>
    <P>I want to point out to the Seanad that while everybody's mind is concentrated on one particular group of holdings, there <Col N="1906" /> are other holdings on the island which are in the possession of persons who are not original island families.  They, too, will be subject to compulsory acquisition, if necessary, the same as the person that most people have in their minds is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment to this section goes part of the way to meeting what I had in mind in that it would permit an islander, or a former islander, who kept his home in reasonable condition and lived in it, even if only for a day, to retain that home.  Indeed, if I understand the Taoiseach correctly, even if the house had not been lived in at all since the islander left it, so long as it has been retained by the family, it could remain the property of that family.  This will facilitate a person or a family who had the means to keep their homes.  Many of the families concerned would probably not have had the means to enable them to return to the island and see that their homes were kept in adequate repair even though those homes would have meant as much to them as would the house that was kept in good repair.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that because I am sure many of these islanders or their relatives, when conditions permit access to the island, will return there either totally or for part of the year.  This should be encouraged.  I am happier with the Bill now than I was last week because I feared that the entire island was being taken over and that the former islanders had no rights thereon.  It is not too clear, with regard to compulsory purchase of the commonage if it will be a viable proposition for the islanders to return to the island because many of them would be <Col N="1907" /> depending on the grazing of that commonage to put bread and butter on the table.  I do not know what the 1,000 acres will be used for.  Will it be a bird sanctuary or will the wildlife on the island be permitted to increase at any rate it so wishes to the exclusion of the livelihood of the islander who wishes to return?</P>
      <P>There may be many of these ruined houses which could be brought back to living conditions provided it was economically viable for the family.  I may not be on the main island when it is an historic park.  I do not know how fast things will move, but both people living here and people from abroad would visit the island if it was an historic park though they would probably never make a return visit, having seen the national park.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach may argue that this island will not be deserted by reason of it being an historic park but it is very little different from some of our islands which have been deserted in recent times, and which one visits once in a lifetime.  If you establish a village on it people will return there again.  I am sure the Taoiseach has had this experience in regard to other islands.  I would like to see greater encouragement given to the former islanders to return to their houses.</P>
      <P>With regard to the matter raised by Senator Manning and indeed he raised it last week and the Taoiseach responded to him by indicating that this Bill was flushing out the interests on the island.  I am inclined to disagree with the Taoiseach on this.  I think it is the reverse, that it is the threat of purchase of more of the properties on the island that prompted this Bill and pushed the Government into bringing forward this Bill.  There was also local pressure.  I do not disagree with that because since 1953 it was open to purchase by any interests in any part of the world for whatever reason.  I could not see a profit being made except perhaps in the future for holiday homes or something like that but it was wide open for purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While not knowing the details of the purchases that were made there by the <Col N="1908" /> people referred to in the <i>Irish Independent</i> last week, I would see them as doing something which the Government should have done in 1953 or since then. We should have been interested in the island at that stage, but successive Irish Governments have shown little or no interest in the Blasket Islands until somebody purchased property on it.  That is the way I see it.  It is the reverse to what the Taoiseach is saying.  It is the purchase of properties on the island that prompted the Government to bring forward the Bill to make it an historic park.</P>
    <P>I would like the Taoiseach to deal in a little more detail with what is going to be on this 1,000 acres or if there will be any grazing rights on it.  As I know the Blasket Islands this was one of the easier islands to live on.  That is a strange thing.  There is probably more fertile soil per acre on the Blasket Islands than there is on any of the other islands around our coast and they had a supply of fuel which they do not have on the Aran Islands which is more heavily populated.  They have to import every sod of turf and lump of coal they burn there.  They did have some supply of fuel on the Blasket Islands and they could produce cattle and sheep.  The difficulty was in getting the cattle off it, as the many photographs I have here will indicate, as they had no pier.  With a pier provided that grazing can be utilised.  I wonder if the Taoiseach has in mind the acquisition of all the grazing land and all the grazing rights on the island and then expect the islander to go back and live in his home with no means of providing his or her bread and butter.</P>

      <P>It is quite obvious on the basis of what the Taoiseach has said here this morning that inordinate lengths have been gone to to ensure that the legitimate landowners have been provided for by way of accession.  This is very welcome.  It is equally important that the 1,000 acres of commonage is being acquired.  I come from an area where there are thousands of acres of commonage and Solomon would not solve the problem of commonage between neighbours as anyone representing rural <Col N="1909" /> constituencies will know.  The only way to do it is to take it all in one fell swoop.  I have problems with Senator McMahon's idyllic concept of what he is hoping to achieve here.  It is somewhat at variance with the Office of Public Work's concept as I see it.</P>

      <P>Having given this concession to the owners who have it by way of accession, they should not be able to retard further development.  There is little point in allowing a native or the son of a native to keep the ownership of his cottage if it is going to appear as a cavity in the midst of all the others.  Obviously there are the constitutional property rights and so on but having said that I wonder if it would be an appropriate time to say, having conceded the absolute right of the owner by way of accession, as is his right under the Constitution, that he or she will not be entitled to retard the overall development of the concept by virtue of the fact that he will say: &ldquo;Look, I am sorry, I own this house and I will do what I like with it&rdquo;.  That is his right under the Constitution.  If we are hoping to achieve a certain atmosphere here, which the Bill appears to be endeavouring to do, it will be retarded by this problem of people saying: &ldquo;Look, I am sorry, I am not in a position to go on at this moment&rdquo;, &ldquo;I do not want to go on&rdquo; or &ldquo;I feel the house should be left in ruins&rdquo; or whatever. I wonder whether the Taoiseach would deem it appropriate to say: &ldquo;All things being equal and assistance being made available to the landowners, they will have to keep in step with the concept the Office of Public Works are hoping to achieve in the total context&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Coming back to the information given to us by the Taoiseach that the exemption from compulsory purchase extends only to the residences of muintir an oiléan and not to lands in a wider sense, why then does the Bill not say so specifically?  Instead of the word <Col N="1910" />&ldquo;land&rdquo; why does the Bill not say &ldquo;residences that are owned by a person&rdquo;? Would that more specific wording not make the Bill more constitutionally watertight and remove the concern we have about two different sets of landowners being treated differently?</P>

      <P>I am delighted to see that some of the former islanders who owned property on the island will be allowed to retain their property on the island.  That is only right and proper. Indeed, I must be honest and say I did not know until the Taoiseach mentioned it here this morning that all the commonage would be acquired and purchased. I spoke about the commonage on Second Stage and it is very important for all of us to realise that the commonage consists of more than three-quarters of the main Blasket Island.</P>
      <P>Senator McMahon mentioned that nobody had any interest in the main Blasket Island until quite recently.  I would like to let him know that Kerry County Council had an interest in the island.  This island is an area of &ldquo;no development&rdquo; under the county development plan which means that nobody can build on it.  Under a &ldquo;no development&rdquo; plan if a landowner or a houseowner wishes to repair or improve their house or build a house on their land, under the planning laws they can do so.  I can assure you that Kerry County Council monitored very closely the people who had land on the Blasket Islands and all the houses on the Blasket Islands were photographed by the officials of the planning authority of Kerry County Council and it is on record in the Office of Public Works.  This is important because as far as I know those photographs were not available from anybody else.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that some of the property will be left in the hands of the former islanders.  I am delighted to hear that all the commonage can be acquired and I hope that it will be acquired by agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I used the word &ldquo;residences&rdquo; but I want to make it clear that <Col N="1911" /> I do not mean just the houses but the little plots of land, sometimes two or three acres, on which the house is situated. In so far as they are owned or occupied by members of the original island families, they will be exempted.</P>
      <P>In reply to Professor Murphy's question as to why we did not put it the other way round, that is a question of drafting. This is a complex situation and this is the way the draftsman decided to do it, to have a compulsory acquisition power covering everything and then excludingout certain holdings and exempting from that exclusion-out the commonage attaching to those holdings.  It is a little complicated but this is the way the draftsman decided and I believe it is the right way to do it.  It certainly achieves what we want to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to agree with Senator O'Callaghan that Senator McMahon is being a little idyllic.  There is no way in modern circumstances that anybody could go back to live on the Blascaod Mór and be able to provide for themselves out of their holding, including the commonage.  That would not be feasible.  Even in the old days, when the people living on the island were, perhaps, a lot hardier and more robust than we are today, they found it very difficult in normal circumstances to make a living between farming and fishing and the occasional bit of salvage. Therefore, it would not be possible to visualise anybody going back there today, establishing themselves and being able to support themselves from their possessions on the island.  I would not rule out the possibility of people going back to live there; indeed, we all hope they will, either for the whole year or part of the year but we would have to accept that they would have to support themselves from some other source.  In any event, the commonage would not make much difference to them because any one holder of a residence would be entitled to one-twenty-fifth of the commonage and that would be very difficult to work out. There is really no way out of it except to acquire the whole commonage, as Senator O'Callaghan has rightly pointed <Col N="1912" /> out.  Commonages are very difficult matters to deal with and I am satisfied that the only way to deal with this commonage is to acquire the whole lot, as the legislation purports to do.  What will happen the commonage afterwards is entirely a matter for management.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out to make the Blascaod Mór into a national historic park.  Therefore, it will primarily be a national park and in that context we will have to leave it to the experts in the different disciplines to decide what is appriopriate and suitable. One would certainly visualise it being a bird sanctuary.  Whether other forms of fauna should be introduced there is a matter for consideration and decision, and people like Senator Eamon de Buitléar, I am sure, will be involved in giving advice.  That will have to be decided by the Fondúireacht and the Office of Public Works working together to decide what will be possible, feasible and desirable with the concept of the nationa park being in everybody's mind at all times.</P>
    <P>I hope that deals with the points raised by different Senators, particularly Senator McMahon.  I do not think that giving people access to the commonage would in any way contribute to people going back to live on the Blascaod Mór although, however, it is not impossible to visualise a situation where if somebody did try to do that the Office of Public Works and the Fondúireacht might consider leasing them some part of the commonage to give them a chance to have a go.  That would have to be decided by management.  I agree with Senator McMahon that it would be desirable if some descendants of the original island families re-established themselves there but we will have to wait and see what happens.</P>
    <P>Primarily, what we visualise happening is that, first, there will be an interpretative centre on the mainland which will give people the fullest possible information about the island and, secondly, that we will be in a position to provide reasonable access facilities in terms of transport to encourage as many people as possible to visit the island.  I would <Col N="1913" /> certainly visualise the principal, if not all, the houses being restored to the condition they were in when the island was lived on and then some imaginative proposals being put forward for the preservation or development of the flora and fauna.  That would have to be carefully considered and the best possible advice obtained as to how that should be done.  The possibilities are enormous.</P>
    <P>Last year a major survey of the Blasket Islands was carried out by the Irish Wildbird Conservancy on the body of the bird life and it revealed very rich results.  That is the way I would visualise things going &mdash; certainly, a bird sanctuary, the preservation of flora and, if it is possible, the introduction of new types of flora.  That is not always very desirable or very successful but it is something which can be considered.  Also, different types of animals might be introduced on the island. That is a matter for the Fondúireacht and the Office of Public Works, getting the best possible advice available to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat encouraged by the Taoiseach giving way that if there was a person or people anxious to go back and set up home again on the island that grazing would be considered. I sincerely hope that that is noted and put on the record because it goes some way to meeting the wishes of many people.  I wonder if the Taoiseach is inclined to under-estimate the people who left the Blasket Islands?  They left a home which was near and dear to them and there is still an attraction for them to get back to the Blaskets.  I do not care what the Taoiseach, Senator O'Callaghan or anybody else here says, I know many islanders and I know that they have a wish to continue the life and culture that was on that island.  They are the custodians of an Irish heritage and culture that no money that will ever come from Europe will replace if we lose it.  The Taoiseach should be looking more positively at encouraging people to go on to the island and giving them State assistance. It should not be left up to them to repair their houses and set up family on <Col N="1914" /> the island again and depend on the grazing or commonage, which was quite considerable because many photographs are available to show this.  I have one here which is on the cover of Muiris Mac Conghail's book and is a telling picture. While one cannot see the entire beast that is being loaded into the currach, it is evident from the head and shoulders that its a heavy beast that was reared on the island.  Not many heavy beasts have been reared on the islands around our coasts. I have no date for the photograph but there are 15 men loading that beast from rocks into a currach.</P>

The State should encourage the people to come back and make it a living village.  The European Commission are carrying out a survey of the islands of Europe but the islands around our coasts are not included.  I would like to know why.  Why have we been excluded from the European Commission survey of the Islands of Europe? Honestly, the first thing that should have been done here, before this Bill was brought before the Oireachtas, was to look at that survey so that we would know exactly how our islands stand.  Look at the number of islands that have been completely evacuated in our time.</P>

      <P>That culture has been lost.

That is something no Government or the EC will ever replace no matter how much money they provide.  It <Col N="1915" /> will be shame on all of us here if we allow this to happen, and we are allowing it to happen on the Blaskets.</P>
      <P>It is fine for the Taoiseach to say that if people come back and repair their homes and want to live on the island, we will consider giving them grazing rights, but you are taking everything from them. To me that is tantamount to compulsory purchase.  We are not taking your house, you can have it, but you cannot have the means to afford living in your house.  It is forcing people &mdash; like we forced the islanders to leave in 1953.  The last blow to these islanders was the closing of the school in December 1947.  They could not possibly live there any longer because education was dear to their hearts, as can be seen by the amount of literature that has emanated from this island.  I believe we are going the wrong road.  It happened in the Blaskets but I am making a plea that it should not happen on the other islands and that the Government must ensure that conditions on the islands are such that the people will no longer have to load cattle from the rocks into currachs. No wonder they had to evacuate the islands.</P>
      <P>I make a last minute plea to the Taoiseach to have a further look at this Bill to ensure in so far as is possible that any islander, whether he left in 1953 or 1945 or in 1930, or his descendant, who wants to return to the island will be facilitated and encouraged to go back.  It is pointless to tell people that if they had a house there or if they had property there they can repair the house and live in it, but that is all they will have on this island. The rest of it is the historic part.  That is no good to them.  Give them some encouragement to go back and give them State assistance.</P>

      <P>There are many people living on islands and in the west of Ireland who are not getting a living from their holding but have another income &mdash; either another job or State assistance &mdash; and I would ask the Taoiseach to have a serious look at making the old village on An Blascod Mór a living village again. That is the greatest service we can provide for the nation.  I believe we will have many more visitors to the island if there is a living village on it rather than just an historic park so far, and difficult to get to, from the mainland.</P>

      <P>I really must put on record my total disagreement with Senator McMahon.  His sentimentality, I suppose, does him credit.  Maybe it is because I am an historian that I am totally unsentimental about the past.  What is over is over.  The culture of the Blascaod Mór is now a matter for museum preservation, as it were.  This is what the Bill says.  The Bill is about a national historic park.  I do not believe people should be encouraged to come back; I think it is unrealistic anyway to think that they will. Are they going to live at a 1940 standard of living when they come back?  The thing is just sheer nostalgia.  Moreover, I submit that any encouragement to people to rebuild the Blasket Islands in living terms is a contradiction of this Bill.  You cannot, on the one hand, have a national historic park with all the elaborate things planned for it and, on the other hand, an attempt to repopulate the island.  I think Senator McMahon's obviously sincerely held view is, nonetheless, inconsistent with the spirit of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other references have been made during the debate to living heritage.  The whole point about this is that it is now a dead heritage.  I do not believe that even An Blascaod Mór relates to the Gaeltacht <Col N="1917" /> any more.  The mainland relates to the Gaeltacht and so on, but it is now a State park under State auspices for the enjoyment of the people of Ireland and its former phase is over and done with, and that is that.</P>

      <P>I remember when I first met Seán Ó Riada.  The very first thing he wanted to do was that himself and his wife and myself and my wife would go out and repopulate the Great Blasket.  But even at that time, although I felt it was quite an exciting venture I was afraid, for one thing, that I would waken up one morning and the naomhóg would be gone and so would Seán, but I did not see that it was realistic.  It was all very well to talk about An Blascaod Mór and to have all the writings that we have had.  My reason for publishing this particular book &mdash; I published it fairly recently &mdash; was to keep in our minds what these people had and to remind us of what is on the mainland, which is the Gaeltacht, which I see as being so important.  We should be taking care of the Gaeltacht islands we have at the moment and the Gaeltacht areas along our coasts.  I do understand what Senator McMahon is talking about, but I also think it is unrealistic.</P>

      <P>Senator McEllistrim is absolutely right.  The planning laws will still prevail and the Office of Public Works will now have more than adequate powers to completely control all developments of any kind, and particularly any kind of undesirable developments.  Even though we are leaving the residences in <Col N="1918" /> the possession of the original island families, or their descendants, we are not giving them the power to do anything they like with them.  They will still be very, very rigidly controlled.  In fact, one would visualize nothing happening except that the old houses will be restored to their original condition, and that will be that.  Perhaps the Office of Public Works, or the Fondúireacht, will wish to provide some basic facilities and amenities on the island for visitors, but there again, these would have to be very sensitively planned and designed and kept under the most rigid control.  I hope that deals with the Senator's point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (3), lines 17 to 21, to delete paragraph (d).</P>
      <P>Section 5 of the Bill is &mdash; the Taoiseach referred to this earlier &mdash; the most imaginative and in many ways the most inovative part of the Bill.  It is a proposal that the functions of the Commissioners, who are a statutory body, would actually be delegated to An Fondúireacht, which is actually a private body or a voluntary private organisation.  This must be quite a unique proposal.  Because of that I can understand the worries and concerns that would exist on the statutory side about how it would work.  Section 5 &mdash; and it is necessary, unfortunately, to go into the provisions of section 5 to explain the amendment &mdash; deals with the delegation of specified functions of the Commissioners under this Act and makes the appropriate omissions, particularly to do with by-laws and compulsory acquisition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My feeling about section 5 is that in an attempt to circumscribe every possible <Col N="1920" /> eventuality the section has got itself tangled up in organisational knots that could lead, in my view, to considerable confusion. For instance, subsection (3) (c) says that &ldquo;the delegation shall operate, while it is in force, to confer the function on and vest it in the Foundation&rdquo;.  It is a particular function that is given to the Office of Public Works which is then, in turn, delegated to the Foundation.  Paragraph (d) is the one I propose to have deleted, and I have to say it took me three or four readings to even figure precisely what paragraph (d) meant.  I am not in any way trying to be offensive; I had difficulty with it.  It says:</P>
    <P>The function shall, notwithstanding the delegation, continue to vest in the Commissioners but shall be so vested concurrently with the Foundation and so as to be capable of being performed by the Commissioners or the Foundation.</P>
    <P>If I was running a business organisation and was trying to persuade my management system to get involved in proper delegation of functions, I would not encourage that sort of duality, where on the one hand the function is delegated and on the other hand it is not, which is what appears to me paragraph (d) is suggesting.  While it is delegated and while it is everybody's intention at this moment that all these delegated functions should be carried out by the Foundation, at the same time it does appear under paragraph (d) that they are not really delegated, that they are only doing them as long as the Office of Public Works allow them to do them and that any of the functions could still be carried out at any time by the Office of Public Works if the Office of Public Works saw fit.</P>
    <P>It does not seem to be properly defined structured delegation of the kind that would enable a system to operate.  It seems to produce the possibility of confusion, of duality of responsibility, which is not the way, in my view, to make this work.  I can understand why it happened. It seems to me that paragraph (c), that &ldquo;the delegation shall operate, while it is <Col N="1921" /> in force, to confer the function on and vest it in the Foundation&rdquo;, is the nub of this.  The Minister may amend or invoke an order if the Foundation is not felt to be carrying out its delegated functions adequately.  This would be good management theory &mdash; that the senior authority would say: &ldquo;Right, that delegated function is not being carried out properly; we will withdraw that delegated function and give it to a higher level of decision making&rdquo;.  To leave a parallel functioning &mdash; two parallel systems with the same functions &mdash; seems to me to be a recipe for future confusion and uncertainty.</P>
    <P>All of the other provisions of section 5 make perfectly good sense but paragraph (d), which is the one I propose to delete, seems to be a recipe for duality and, as a result, in the long term for uncertainty.  I would be interested in the Taoiseach's views as to why it is necessary, because it seems to me there must have been a particularly good reason to put it in, given that it seems to be at variance with the concept of delegation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point is that we are not dealing with a business organisation, and I would fully agree with the Senator's approach if we were.  We are dealing with an unusual type of situation here, as I have already said.  First of all, we want to take this island into the possession of the State.  The island will become State property.  Normally, that has a fairly direct succession of consequences whereby the Office of Public Works takes over the property, runs it for the benefit of the public and is answerable through the Minister of State to the Dáil and the Seanad.  Here we are trying to go just a bit further than that.  If you like, we are experimenting.  We want the advantages of State acquisition, ownership and responsibility and at the same time we want local community involvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are trying if you like &mdash; I admit it &mdash; to ride two horses at the same time. We are trying to have the advantages of State acquisition and ownership and, at the same time to have community management and involvement.  Because that <Col N="1922" /> is an unusual situation we have tried to devise an unusual formula to deal with it. I am fairly confident it will work.</P>
    <P>A provision of this kind is already in our legislation, in the Ministers and Secretaries Act of 1977.  In that Act a Minister may delegate some of his functions to a Minister of State while, as the same time, exercising the right to carry out those functions if need be.  Every Minister of State is somewhat in the position that the Fondúireacht would be here.  The Minister of State is given the responsibility and authority to go and run a particular section of a Department while, at the same time, the ultimate authority is concurrently vested in the Minister of the Government.  I could visualise for instance, a situation developing where the Fondúireacht would want a reasonable type of pier installed and would not have the resources to provide it themselves. They would than go to the Commissioners and the Commissioners would step in and provide the pier; so both bodies would be concurrently involved in the provision of that amenity and that facility.  The same would perhaps arise in the case of a major visitation to the Blascaod Mór by a scientific body, either somebody investigating the flora or the fauna, a visitation which would be beyond the capacity of the Fondúireacht to organise and manage but which they would like to see taking place.  Again, they would ask the Office of Public Works to provide all the necessary arrangements and facilities for such an event.  It is an attempt to devise a formula which will basically give the day to day management of the Blascaod Mór to the Fondúireacht and at the same time not cut themselves off completely from assistance, back-up and support from the Office of Public Works when it is necessary.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Senator to leave the Bill as it is.  We have given a lot of thought.  The Fondúireacht are happy with it.  They like that particular provision and we are farily confident that it will work out satisfactorily.  It is an attempt to reconcile two opposite concepts, one being State ownership and management ultimately with responsibility to this <Col N="1923" /> House and secondly, the fullest possible level of local involvement in the management of the National Historic Park.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very good definition of modern socialism when you see the concept of State ownership under local control.  I can compliment the Taoiseach for that.  I have no desire in any way to delay the passage of the Bill.  I simply have the unfortunate slightly organised mind of an engineer and somebody who had the misfortune to do some training in management at one stage. However, if the Taoiseach is, as he appears to be, satisfied that this arrangement will not result in any confusion of functions, and if the Fondúireacht are so satisfied, that is fine.  I cannot be here giving lectures about Dublin bureaucracy and then attempting to improve on what is acceptable to the members of the Fondúireacht.</P>

      <P>On the Schedule, I refer to section 5, paragraph 2.  This is the question of compensation to be paid for lands acquired compulsorily.  One of the great difficulties in compensation under compulsory acquisition is to assess the actual market value of land.  Does the Taoiseach have any idea of the criteria that will be used in assessing the compensation value?  Obviously, in other areas it is the market value.  If you are compulsorily acquiring land in Dublin city it is the market value for land of a particular kind in a particular zone.  Since development is so restricted on An Blascaod Mór it would appear that the appropriate compensation would be the current use value, which is essentially a very basic agricultural usage.  On the other hand, if it were to be identified as being a potentially enormously lucrative commercial development in terms of holiday residences, the value of the scale of compensation could be enormous.  It is reasonable that people should be reasonably compensated, but I do not think some of the speculative adventures that people get involved in in buying up sites on an Blascaod Mór ought to be rewarded by the taxpayers by way of excessively generous compensation.  Is there anything we can do to ensure that that does not happen?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Just two points.  First, as I have already mentioned, we would hope to proceed mainly by way of voluntary acquisition.  In the event of that not succeeding, we would proceed by way of compulsory acquisition.  Even then under compulsory acquisition there can be agreement.  Only at the end of the day, with everything else having failed, does it go to arbitration.  The legislation on arbitration is fairly specific.  Indeed, there has been a lot of case law built up since the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, was passed. The statutory mechanisms to decide practically any case that might arise are fairly adequate.  The Senator is right when he says that the value of land would be very much determined or controlled by the fairly restricted uses to which the property could be put.</P>

I would not like, as Senator Brendan Ryan has already said, anybody to get the impression, because all of a sudden we are wakening up to our traditional culture on the Blaskets, that we would have a situation where people might take advantage of it.

      <P>Whatever I may have said on other occasions about the present Government, and indeed other Governments, I want to compliment them on the Bill, for the extraordinary exercise and consultation that went into it to ensure that it was acceptable, particularly to the local community, and to wish the Bill a speedy passage through the Dáil.  There are a lot of difficulties along the way.  I want to wish success to the whole endeavour when it moves out of the Oireachtas and into the world of development outside. It is something that will make a very special place in my life much more alive.

      <P>On behalf of my party I want to thank the Taoiseach for bringing <Col N="1929" /> this Bill before the House.  It is certainly recognised as a highly motivated Bill.  As a person who comes from an urban area, Cork city, I would not be <i>au fait</i> with the Blaskets.  However, the people recognise the work done by the Taoiseach on this and he is to be congratulated in proving at long last that we are aware of our culture.  If only we had people of the breed of the Blasket islanders throughout the whole country, then I think the whole world would look upon us with joy.</P>
      <P>As a person from an urban area, I have to admit that I really know very little about Irish.  It is sad to think there are so few of us who know it.  We now have an opportunity to ensure that those who know a little Irish will have the chance to speak it more often.  That is vital.  The ordinary people from all parts of the country must go and see the Blaskets.  I would be worried that the people so closely involved in the Foundation might as a result create a situation that the person from outside might not be allowed to come there.  We should not allow that to happen.  The Blaskets have a lot to give, and the history of the Blaskets should be in our soul.  It would be great, for instance if we could get a school from Cork and one from Dublin to go there together on the one day, to meet each other in this historic part of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I want to thank the Taoiseach for this Bill.  It is a Bill that is highly motivated and we would welcome more Bills of this kind.</P>

      <P>I am delighted this Bill was introduced here in the Seanad and I would like to thank the Taoiseach for having introduced it in this House.  I know he has a great interest in the main Blasket Island.  We have many different types of national parks in our country and we now have added to them this island park known as An Blascaod Mór National Historic Park.  It is the first island park we have had in the country and it is a great addition to the other national parks.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa cur leis na focail atá ráite cheana.  What we <Col N="1930" /> are doing here today is establishing a monument to an age that has gone.  The important thing about the Blaskets is that by our decision here today, by the decision to set up the National Historic Park in the Blasket Islands, we have recognised what a number of generations did, where they charted their own development from an underdeveloped stage into the modern world.  I do not know of any other community in any culture that has done that themselves. There are plenty of records by outsiders who have observed from the perspective of the objectivity of the outsider; but here we have the subjectivity of the people who are going through this period of great change, writing about it and recording it. That has been such an addition to our literature that it is totally appropriate that we establish this historic park geographically to coincide with where those people lived.</P>
      <P>Not only will we have a regular flow of visitors, but I would predict that people will travel from far and wide to see it.  I have no doubt in my mind that there is a certain draíocht ag baint leis na hoiléam sin that draws people to them from a far distance.  I have no doubt that we will have scholars and students from overseas and our own country and we will have people who are interested in cultural development and in all forms of culture. It is also going to be a huge tourism boost to that area of Ireland.  In that sense it is a tourism boost to all of Ireland, because it will be another stop for the tourist.  It will be something that is quite unique. We have spoken time and time again in this House of the need to present the uniqueness of Irish life and culture and history to the visitor.  That will certainly happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to commend the Taoiseach, not in any patronising way, but in a sense of saying that it is an innovative and progressive piece of legislation.  It has been welcomed by all sides.  I think the sincerity of people's commitment to discussion, in amendments and otherwise, has shown that there is total support for this kind of Bill.  It is a perfect example <Col N="1931" /> of consensus government.  There should be more of it.</P>

      <P>I would like to place on record my thanks, as a local person involved in the Dingle Peninsula and indeed with the Blasket Islands over a number of years, to all the people who participated in this House in bringing this Bill to fruition and indeed all the people behind the scenes. Were it not for Fondúireacht An Bhlascaoid, which was set up about three or four years ago, possibly we would not have the opportunity to debate this matter today.  In my opinion &mdash; and I am going to do a bit of boasting &mdash; it is a very historic occasion that this Bill was introduced to the House on the day this beautiful building was reopened to the Seanad and also that the Taoiseach was with us on that occasion.  I think everybody in this Chamber will remember the day the Blasket Island Bill was introduced to the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McMahon said he wanted to make this a living island.  Indeed, we can assure him that from now on it will be a living island because sons, daughters and relatives of the people who lived in the Blasket Islands, relatives of Tomás Ó Criomhthain, Muiris Ó Súilleabháin, Peig Sayers and others, will now have an opportunity of working on the island and restoring it.  Possibly as time goes by, when these buildings are restored, there will be craft shops and so on on the island. <Col N="1932" /> There will also be an island centre on the mainland.  I can assure this House that once this Bill is completed and the island is handed over to Fondúireacht An Bhlascaoid, it will be very much a living island.  With regard to compulsory acquisition, I intend to help out as best I can in achieving an amicable conclusion rather than having compulsory acquisition.  I am sure the Taoiseach has reiterated that this is what will happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivianOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief because I am sure all that needs to be said has been said already.  I would like to be associated with the passage of the Bill through the House.  While a lot has been said about the importance of this Bill and of retaining the cultural heritage of An Blascaod Mór, it is equally important that we should record the Taoiseach's own commitment to the remaining living islands off the coast. Coming from a constituency that has many inhabited islands, both Gaelic and English speaking, I would like to say that this is a spur for all other island communities as well.  As I said a little while ago, while you can be idyllic about the concept of island life, it can be a tremendously difficult life and anybody who has had occasion to live with island communities knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the Taoiseach is acutely interested in the development of all the other islands off the coast and indeed has liaised to a great degree with Comhcumann Oileánach in that development. Indeed very early in the life of this Government he came down to Cape Clear off the west Cork coast to launch a windmill development which was totally innovative in the context of Irish islands at that time.  It has proved to be tremendously successful and has subsequently ensured the development of island life there by contributing in a large way to the development of a new pier in the past few months.  While we record our appreciation of putting on the Statute Book the need to retain places like the Great Blasket Island, it is equally important that we continue to focus on the need to strive might and main to ensure that <Col N="1933" /> the remaining living island communities off the coast get every assistance.  I am quite sure, if the track record of the government to date is any indication, that will be the case.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, now that we are passing the legislation &mdash; and I have no doubt it will go through the other House with expedition as well &mdash; I hope it will become law quickly.  The tourism dimension of this debate cannot be under-stated. Senator Fitzgerald referred to the need to move on with the interpretative centre on the mainland and so on.  Another matter which has been mentioned but which I will not go into now is the need to improve transportation to the island for tourists &mdash; I am wearing my tourism hat for the moment because it has been the subject of much complaint by tourists. I would like to be associated with the expressions of appreciation to the Taoiseach this afternoon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Eogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to be associated with this Bill.  The purpose of the Bill is to establish an historic park on An Blascaod Mór.  It is a very historic occasion in view of the fact that the Blasket Islands themselves are very much a source of inspiration for our culture inheritance and for the development of that inheritance.  On the wider front the Blasket Islands too will encourage further development of a right sort in the Corca Dhuibhe area which is an extraordinary, rich and varied area.  We can think of Reask, the other great early Christian sites there, as well, of course, as the beauty of the area itself.</P>
      <P>However, to go back to the source of the Bill, I think the Government and everybody involved will learn quite a lot from initiating this whole concept.  I certainly wish it every success and I congratulate the Taoiseach for initiating and bringing the Bill forward.  Comhghairdeas don Taoiseach agus beir bua agus beannacht don obair.</P>

      <P>I want to express my deep appreciation to the Seanad for the manner in which it dealt with this legislation and for the very helpful attitude of all who participated in the debates.  I think it was a very good debates both on Second Stage and Committee Stage.  It was very helpful and illuminating, and I am deeply grateful to all the Senators who took part.  I would also like to express appreciation to the men and women in the Fondúireacht for their contribution which was crucial and essential.  Had we not had that very helpful attitude by the local community, expressed through An Fondúireacht, then the legislation would not have been possible.  I also want to thank particularly the Deputies and Senators from County Kerry &mdash; from the Kingdom &mdash; who were very forthcoming, helpful and co-operative. From the beginning I was anxious that this Bill would have all-party support, and fortunately we were able to achieve that.</P>
      <P>The Bill will now go to the Dáil where we hope it will receive the same sort of welcome that it has received here in the Seanad.  It will then be very much a matter for the Fondúireacht, and indeed for the Office of Public Works with all their experience and expertise, to make sure that the wishes of the Oireachtas in particular, but indeed the local community also, are achieved in regard to this marvellous, wonderful place, An Blascaod Mór.  Senator O'Toole has used the word &ldquo;draíocht&rdquo; to identify with it and I think that is an excellent word.</P>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I thank you for facilitating the arrangements for taking the Bill and for getting it through the Seanad so happily and so expeditiously.

      <P>This section extends stock relief for farming enterprises for a further period of two years.  The scheme will now apply to accounting periods up to 5 April 1990 for corporation tax purposes and to years of assessment up to 1990-91 for income tax purposes.  The section also provides that where stock increases occur in accounting periods ending on or after 6 April 1989, the clawback period in respect of subsequent decreases will be cut from ten to seven years.  That is an incentive to help increase the herd numbers. The stock relief provisions as they apply to the trade of farming provide relief broadly in respect of 110 per cent of the excess of the value of the stock at the end of an accounting period over the value of the opening stock period.  The cost of extending the relief is estimated at about £0.8 million in 1989 and £1 million in a full year.  A similar cost is likely in 1990.  These figures must be regarded as tentative as the cost will of course depend on the extent to which the relief is claimed.</P>

      <P>Section 12 deals with the taxation treatment in respect of motor cars.  I welcome the increase in the <Col N="1936" /> limit although one wonders if, in real terms, that figure is not very much out of line with the actual purchase price of a new car today.  I wonder how this provision is going to work.  It seems that anybody sufficiently devious, wishing to circumvent the measure or invent a loophole could have certain opportunities.  I understand the measure applies to cars provided after 25 January 1989, other than cars which were contracted for that date but supplied within 12 months of that date.  I wonder if the Minister is satisfied that the provision is watertight and not open to abuse or to the ingenuity of persons who might wish to tinker or tamper with or alter the contracts.</P>

      <P>The cars that were contracted for before 6 January are subject to the £6,000 and not the £7,000 figure.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Bulbulia in relation to the allowances &mdash; they are out of date in relation to the actual cost of a car. Prior to 1973 the allowances for tax purposes were calculated on the full cost of a car.  Unfortunately, a long number of years passed before any increases were made.  We started to close the gap last year.  I have continued it this year and I will be looking at the matter again in the context of the 1990 budget.  I agree with the Senator's sentiments, it is out of line.</P>

      <P>This section amends section 25 of the Finance Act, 1978, to prohibit a claim for industrial buildings initial allowance under Chapter 2 of Part XV of the Income Tax Act, 1967, in respect of a building where an accelerated writing down allowance has been granted in respect of the building under section 25.  Chapter 2 of Part XV of the Income Tax Act provides for an industrial buildings initial allowance in respect of capital expenditure incurred in the construction of an industrial building.  The allowance can be 10 per cent, 20 per cent or 50 per cent, depending on the category of building.  In addition, section 264 of the Act provides for an annual writing down allowance of 4 per cent or 10 per cent, depending on the category of the building.  Since 1 April 1989, this allowance may be accelerated to a level of 50 per cent as specified by the claimant.  As part of the reform of the capital allowance structured last year it was intended that a taxpayer could get only one measure of accelerated allowance which could be taken in the form of an initial allowance or a free depreciation allowance, but not both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 44 of the Finance Act, 1988, amended section 251 of the Income Tax <Col N="1938" /> Act, 1967, to provide that where industrial buildings initial allowance was granted under that section in respect of a building, free depreciation could not be granted under section 25 of the Finance Act, 1978, in respect of the same building. This section closes the circle by providing, conversely, that where free depreciation is claimed under section 25 no initial allowance may be claimed under Chapter 2 of Part XV, which includes section 251 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.</P>

The reason for that is that the Minister designated a particular area but people were involved in business in other areas and they did not get the same allowance.  I am not saying they should get the same allowance but I would ask the Minister to ensure that people in inner city areas and towns get every incentive possible.  We are talking about a write-off of up to 50 per cent in some areas.  Would the Minister be prepared to give these people the full 50 per cent instead of 10, 15 or 20 per cent.

      <P>This section deals with toll roads.  I note that relief is to be increased from 50 per cent to 100 per cent in respect of agreements entered into after 6 April 1987 for the construction of toll roads.  We are all given to understand that, given the structural funding which we are anticipating, there will be a need for the private sector to match whatever comes from Europe for the construction of such toll roads, bridges and major infrastructural developments of this nature.  There is no need to debate at any length the importance of upgrading our national infrastructure to service the economy, industry and the whole country.  I see this measure as a sort of carrot or sweetener to encourage investment which, to date, has been very slow in manifesting itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be very interested in hearing the Minister expand on and give us an idea of his thinking in this area.  Is there a potential of any significance for toll roads?  I wonder about the role of local authorities in this.  We know of one very celebrated stretch of fine road but an attempt to make it a toll road was resisted by the local authority and therefore it never came to fruition.  If something like this happens once it can happen again. That is a risk particularly when, as those of us who are members of local authorities know very well, they are strapped for cash; they are resistant to seeing any part of their bailiwick being eroded by central government and certainly to any <Col N="1940" /> funding being taken through initiatives emanating from central government.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister give us any indication when the National Roads Authority will be set up on a statutory basis?  Would he agree that we urgently need to have published and put before us the national roads plan?  Many people are thinking ahead and it is reasonable at this stage to want to know when the roads authority will be set up and when the national plan for our roads will be published.  So far in this country only one person is involved in the business of toll roads.  Is it that it is a high risk with poor return or is there any return?  Is there employment in it?  I would like the Minister to deal with the specific points I made and also to make some general observations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Begging your indulgence, I will deal very briefly with it.  With regard to toll roads, there is only one in the country.  The National Roads Authority legislation is being drafted at the moment and the tolls will be the responsibility of that authority and not of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position as I understand it but I stand to be corrected. The toll will not be levied by the local authorities but, as I understand it, by the National Roads Authority.  The <Col N="1941" /> Senator is right in referring to the neighbouring county to Dublin in relation to the problems that arose there.  The previous relief of 50 per cent expired at the end of March and that relief was never availed of by any developer.  In order to encourage private sector investment, which, I agree with the Senator, is required and will be required more in the future, and to encourage participation in toll road developments, a full write-off of expenditure will now be allowed.  I have already said that the National Roads Authority will be empowered to operate the tolls and to enter into agreements with private sector interests where those interests would be remunerated from tolls in return for their financial contribution to all or part of the construction costs of the road.</P>
      <P>There are limitations on tolls in this country.  There are many areas where the private sector would not provide funding because the amount of traffic in these areas would not be sufficient to remunerate them from toll roads.  However, as I have said, this relief was in existence since 1981 but it was never availed of. The only toll road at present is the East Link Bridge in Dublin and it is financed without recourse to section 26.  Following lengthy discussions in the context of the planned Lucan-Navan Road toll road project, under construction at the moment, the then Minister for Finance agreed in January 1985 that section 26 of the Finance Act would be amended to extend the allowance to pre-trading interest and to allow capital expenditures on a road to be written off in full, on the basis of a 50 per cent allowance in the year in which trading commenced and 10 per cent in each of the succeeding five years.  That promised extension of section 26 was conditional on full financing of the project by the development company without guarantee or other forms of comfort from any public authority, including a local authority.  The agreed amendments were to be made when the toll road project went ahead.  The assurances given by the then Minister were repeated in April 1987.</P>

    <P>An agreement under section 9 of the <Col N="1942" /> Local Government (Toll Roads) Act, 1979, for the provision of the Lucan-Navan Road toll scheme was concluded between Dublin County Council and West Link Toll Bridge Limited in October 1987.  The toll road, now known as the West Link project, is expected to be completed by mid-1990 and the amendments to section 26 are being put in place on foot of those assurances given in the past.  As West Link Limited began to incur expenditure on the project in 1987, the amended section 26 is being made effective in respect of relevant agreements, that is agreement for the provision of toll roads entered into on and after 6 April 1986.  The cost of the increased relief in the future will depend on the extent to which use is made of it or how many toll roads projects are initiated. The operational programme in relation to the development of roads in the future will be published after it has been approved in Brussels.</P>

      <P>Realistically &mdash; and the Minister is a realist &mdash; will we ever have toll roads?  We have talked about the toll bridge that has been built.  I would agree that a toll crossing rather than a toll road would be more realistic from the point of view of getting money or getting people in the private sector involved.  There are parts of the country where the National Roads Authority should favour bypasses, or short cuts as we call them in the south.  I give the example of the crossing from Waterford to Wexford.  That realistically takes about 25 minutes off the journey and it costs £4 return.  For example, on the so-called downstream tunnel crossing which is supposed to be implemented in Cork, realistically you cannot charge a toll fee.  It would be similar to the toll bridge in Dublin and the private sector can get involved.  I can see that idea working, but do not ask me to say that you must pay to by-pass Cahir. That is not on.  Nobody would agree to that.  There would be uproar.  It would not pay to invest in that as it would only knock two minutes off the journey.  If you want to by-pass Athlone will you pay to do so?  You will not.</P>

      <P>That is right.  I would see a point in a by-pass to go from Howth to the other side.  That is a long way.  Could we see that working?  Could we see anything working between the northern and southern side of the country, going from Tarbert to Clare for instance?  In areas like that you can implement shortcuts. Should the National Roads Authority have the function of a national transport authority that is to transport people from one place to another?  The private sector would get involved if it was worth so much to bring a person from one place to another.  I think crossings rather than roads are more important.</P>

The Minister for the Environment said last night that it would cost £39 million, which could be the most <Col N="1944" /> costly work per yard in any other part of the country.

      <P>Section 18 is a very complicated section.  The UCITS, the undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities, suddenly surface and I must admit to some surprise at getting to know this new creature.  The section deals with unit trusts and the taxing of these collective investment undertakings.  This was the subject of a ministerial amendment in the Dáil, I would if the Minister would indicate whether it was merely a technical drafting type of change or amendment or did he undergo some revision in his thinking from the time the Bill was first published? I also wonder if he would elaborate on the withholding tax aspect of this?  I understand there is some difference in the way in which it would affect residents of the State and non-residents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>UCITS are a new creature, a new animal.  The amendment you speak about was purely technical. What is being done here is to create a new taxation regime for UCITS.  Up to now unit trusts were taxed in the fund itself.  Now these are zero rated from the financial services centre to bring them into line and to make them competitive with similar type funds being marketed out of the member states.  In other words, we want to put ourselves on a level playing field with Luxembourg or the other countries.  At the same time you have to be careful that others out there do not sell funds into this market because with the freedom of services they will be able to do it anyway.  So we have to leave our fund managers in the same competitive position to be able to sell out or sell in. There is a possibility of tax evasion in <Col N="1945" /> this situation.  What is being done is that somebody outside selling in here has to operate through a bank or financial institution or an agency here, which in turn will have to declare who the holders of the UCITS are.  Basically what is happening is that the benefits are taxed now in the hands of the individual rather than the fund itself.  I hope that is of some help to the Senator.</P>

      <P>Under the Council Directive of the Co-ordination of Law Regulations and Administrative Provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities, better known as UCITS, a foreign UCITS which has been authorised under the terms of the Directive or under regulations to give effect to the directive will be entitled to market its units in Ireland.  This could provide considerable scope for tax evasion by providing a haven for undeclared income or for receiving income on investments which is then not declared for tax purposes. Under the exchange control notice relating to portfolio investment in foreign securities, all instructions with regard to <Col N="1946" /> transactions in foreign securities must be routed through an approved agent.  An approved agent is any bank in the State or any stockbroker licensed by the Irish Government, any solicitor in the court of justice practising in the State and any other person appointed by the Central Bank of Ireland.  In addition, Article 45 of the Directive requires the UCITS marketing its units in another member state to take the measures necessary to ensure that facilities are available in that state for making payments to unit holders, repurchasing or redeeming units and making available the information which UCITS are obliged to provide.  In effect, the section requires an approved agent under the exchange control provisions, or the person providing the facilities in the State in accordance with the Directive, to furnish information in relation to (a) investments in foreign UCITS, (b) payments to Irish unit holders of foreign UCITS and (c) the repurchase or redemption of such units.  Any information will be furnished on request in writing from the Inspector of Taxes.  If you are resident in the State the withholding tax applies and if you are non-resident it is nontaxable</P>

      <P>The aim of the section is to impose a limit on the continuing escalating costs to the State of domestic sourced section 84 loans.  In 1988 the figure was estimated at £79.4 million and I understand that the Shannon leasing company made very heavy use of these particular loans.  Will they be able to continue using these loans in order to develop and expand, if not domestic sourced loans foreign sourced ones?  I would like the point clarified?  Will this change have any adverse effect on their business? <Col N="1947" /> Were representations made to the Minister, and is he satisfied that this is not a hugely discriminatory measure against Shannon leasing companies?  Also, I would like to know how much money will accrue to the Exchequer from this measure in the current year or, since we are into the current year now, does the Minister anticipate how much will accrue to the Exchequer in the next full tax year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Domestic sourced loans for leasing companies, as described by the Senator, are being phased out but it does not affect foreign sourced section 84 loans.  The big increase in recent times in domestic sourced section 84 loans and, in fact, very high recouping on foreign-based ones, are creating a huge increase in costs to the Exchequer.  Many companies have commented on this; in fact, one of the largest leasing companies have said that they do not see this having any impact on their business.  First, they have to phase out domestic sources section 84, loans but they can continue in foreign sourced section 84 loans and some of them are so big down there that that is no real problem for them.</P>
      <P>In the smaller areas, one has to be careful where tax relief is given that the benefit is accruing to the Irish economy. In the developments that were taking place it was seen very clearly that, while the Irish taxpayer could be paying, much of the benefit was going to foreign taxpayers in certain leasing areas.  We do not see it having any impact on the major business people there.  It is being phased out.  We cannot disrupt their businesses, so we are giving them until 1991, and this restriction does not affect manufacturing industry at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no benefit this year.  We are just capping it to ensure that it does not get out of line but the benefits will flow in future years. <Col N="1948" /> There will be less cost to the Exchequer rather than a benefit flowing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not got a reliable estimate at this stage.  In 1986 section 84 loans cost £64.3 million, in 1987 they cost £94.8 million and in 1988 the figure is tentatively estimated at roughly £98 million, a sum that would have gone through before the budget. There is a levy on the yield from it, which was brought in a few years ago, and that yielded £5.1 million in 1986, £14.4 million in 1987 and £18.6 million in 1988.  We are only calculating it at the moment.  It is very difficult to estimate the yields for future years at this stage.</P>

      <P>This section amends the definition enacted in 1984 of &ldquo;computer services&rdquo;&mdash; data processing services and software development services grant-aided under the IDA's international service programme &mdash; for the purpose of the 10 per cent corporation tax scheme.  This present section is a response to developments in the computer services area since 1984.  Technical or consultancy services relating to data processing or software development, are not encompassed by the existing definition of &ldquo;computer service&rdquo;.  I want to extend the 10 per cent corporation tax to <Col N="1949" /> software services, computer services etc. That is the background to the amendment. The commencement date is 6 April 1989.  Otherwise the extension would have had effect from the date of the Finance Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some queries about this.  I note that it is specifically tied to the IDA.  Are they being given an additional role as tax ajudicators in that they will decide, to back a particular company and that company will get the benefits, whereas another young, or not so young, earnest person wishing to engage in that type of activity, not receiving the IDA backing, would be disadvantaged? I am a little concerned about this.  Could the Minister confirm if somebody benefiting from this measure has to get IDA backing and sanction?  Is there a need to impress the IDA?  The IDA are not omniscient.  They have been known to make mistakes.  They have backed some spectacular failures in addition, of course, to recognising all the very good, worthwhile and useful work which they do in attracting industry.  I know they have a function in relation to the BES but we are extending their role in this measure.  For example, the person who receives the IDA approval and sanction will only have to pay a 10 per cent rate of corporation tax on profits whereas the person who is operating in the same area but who has not got IDA backing will have to hand over a whacking 43 per cent of profits.  That bothers me.  As a public representative I have met many genuine, good solid citizens with worthwhile useful ideas who, despite all their presentations and running in and out of IDA offices, have actually failed to get the IDA backing. Taking that in the teeth, they have, nevertheless, gone on and established reasonable businesses and have been quite successful and managed to thumb their noses at the IDA and say, &ldquo;sucks to you&rdquo; and I say good for them.  But, in this area, they will find themselves fairly massively discriminated against in terms of taxation.  All IDA decisions are not perfect.  I am distinctly unhappy about extending the IDA's role in this area and <Col N="1950" /> giving them certain powers of ajudication when we recognise the fact that they are not infallible.</P>

      <P>Industrial investment is a risky business.  Inevitably there has to be some failures, but I never blame the people for the failures if we have enough successes.  It is a risk judgment area.  We are using the IDA as a vetting mechanism and not really as tax adjudicators and we have to find the mechanism by which we could extend this and still stay within the EC Directives on competition laws and rules.  We are interested in extending the export services into the two areas I talked about for export services only, and using the IDA mechanism is the only safe <i>modus operandi</i> to say within the competition laws of Europe. If we said we would do it for export services only, it could be interpreted in Europe as an aid to exports and, consequently, would fall.  This is the mechanism that has been used, not alone in this area, but in a few other areas and that is its primary purpose.  It was not to pass on the role of adjudication to the IDA.  Of course, when one talks about the wider services area one would have to be extremely careful that we would not include in the scheme banks, insurance companies etc who do technical consultancy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his explanation.  He makes distinction between viewing the IDA as a vetting mechanism in all of this rather than an adjudicating mechanism.  That is a fine distinction and one I cannot handle very well.  In effect, as I see it, the IDA will give a certain <i>imprimatur</i> or seal of approval, and presumably then the Revenue Commissioners will act on foot of that approbation from the IDA.  Is that what will happen, is that how it will work in practice?</P>

      <P>The very same system already operates in relation to international financial services in the export area where the IDA approve them and the Revenue Commissioners apply <Col N="1951" /> the 10 per cent rate of corporate tax.  It is purely extending it to those two areas on which very strong representations have been made, because they are growth areas and they are at a disadvantage with the other areas of computer services that already have been included in this 10 per cent concession since 1984.  That is all I am doing: I am using the mechanism that is there already.  We searched &mdash; I read the debate in the Dáil &mdash; high and low for any other way of doing it while still leaving themselves clear of being struck down by the competition laws in Europe, but there was no safer way to do it.  This is the experience of this Government and the previous Government.</P>

I think we should not do that too readily and too lightly, but I realise a certain weakness in my argument when I cannot suggest a better way to do it, and I am sure the Minister has applied himself to examining it to see if he, too, could come forward with anything.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give us the background to the thinking on section 24 which amends the formula introduced by section 32 of the Finance Act, 1988, for computing the amount of manufacturing tax credit for a dividend or other distribution paid by a company after 6 April 1989?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Sections 24 and 25 amend section 32 of the 1988 Finance Act in a number of ways.  Section 32 of the Finance Act 1988, changed the tax rules for distribution by companies of dividends from different types of profits. Prior to section 32, a company with a mix of profits had to pay dividends on all its post-tax 10 per cent profits first, before it could pay out dividends from its other post-tax profits.  This rule was known as the &ldquo;primary fund&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 32 abolished the &ldquo;primary fund&rdquo; and introduced new rules to take effect from 6 April 1989.  The key rule in these arrangements is proportionality, that is, the dividends are treated as coming proportionately from the mix of post-tax profits.  The new rules thus reflect the underlying commercial reality of a company with a mix of 10 per cent profits, standard rate profits and other profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to representations made after the publication of section 32 the last Minister for Finance announced last year that consideration would be given to simplifying or improving the <Col N="1953" /> detailed provisions of section 32.  Following discussions with a number of representative bodies and companies, certain changes to section 32 were decided on as proposed in sections 24 and 25 before us.  The key change is that instead of the rule that the dividends must be paid in the first instance out of the mix of profits of the immediately preceeding year, a company will now be able to pay the dividends out of the mix of profits of any one or more preceding year in the past nine years.  Where such profits are exhausted, the company can go back to earlier years.  These changes will thus give companies much more flexibility in regard to dividend distributions while maintaining their basic proportionality rule.</P>
    <P>The proportionate basis set out in sections 24 and 25 is logical and reasonable. The reality is that companies have only one pool of profits.  The new rules are designed to treat dividends as paid from this pool for the purpose of calculating the tax credits to be attached to those dividends.  This approach ensures a fair system for companies, their shareholders and the Exchequer.  It is known out there in the mad world of finance as vintaging &mdash; not that that means much more to you and me, but that is what they call it.  In other words, if you have a 43 per cent profit company 10 per cent, 25 per cent or whatever, coming into a group of companies, the dividends are distributed in relation to the profits from whichever source they come, which is what they call the &ldquo;proportionality rule.&rdquo; It was seen in the discussions that took place that confining the pool to one year put the companies the shareholders and the dividends' recipients at a disadvantage. Now all profits are put back into the pool, you distribute them in the proportion in which they come in and you can go back over nine years; and if you have not any post-tax profits for distribution, then you can go back further than that.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that everybody will be satisfied, but it is a reasonable approach from the point of view of the shareholders, the dividend holders, the <Col N="1954" /> Exchequer and most companies.  You will find not all companies will agree with me, but I cannot please all of them all of the time.</P>

      <P>Section 28 is the section covering film production.  It amends section 35 of the Finance Act, 1987, to increase the present ceiling on relief for investment in film production.  It is, in fact, a tax based incentive and is to be welcomed.  What I cannot really understand is that there is a scheme already in place but it has not been taken up or acted on and, presumably, the idea is to sweeten it even more and to make it more attractive in the hope that we will encourage potential film makers to come in.  I understand that in Canada and in Australia, where they have very successful film making activity, the tax based incentive packaging has worked, and worked very well, so presumably, we are hoping to imitate and encourage this fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to bemoan, as I did when it was abolished, the passing of Bord Scannán na hÉireann, the Irish Film Board, which we debated at one stage extensively in this House.  I still do not think it was a good idea to abolish it. There has been a certain hiatus in the Irish film industry since its abolition and a certain uncertainly and unhappiness on the part of those who are engaged in this area.  I think we have tremendous potential here for film making.  It is labour intensive and after all our priority is the creation of jobs.  I hope that this very generous incentive of doubling the offer in fact works, and I think the phasing of <Col N="1955" /> it is reasonable in the context of film making.

      <P>Section 33 provides for the exemption from capital gains tax of Bord Fáilte and the specified regional and local tourism organisations.  I would like to express my pleasure at seeing this section in the Bill.  It is a practical encouragement of development in tourism which, again, is linked to the creation of employment and the generation of income.  I would particularly like to refer to the inclusion of Tramore Fáilte.  The Minister, I hope, will indicate his awareness of what is happening down there and the fact that there is a joint venture scheme in progress which has tremendous potential for revitalising the resort.  In fact, some seven major projects have been announced, a leisure health complex, a conference business centre, a major heritage attraction, an indoor entertainments complex, and outdoor recreation area, development of the lake and tourist accommodation and accommodation related to the health complex and an indoor-outdoor aquatic centre. From that listing the Minister will have an indication of the expanionist nature of the project and the fact that Shoreline have been enticed, invited or encouraged to take up an option and to become interested in a joint venture fashion on these proposals with Tramore Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tramore, of course, is a traditional seaside resort known to everybody in the country but in recent years it has been generally recognised that it has become a bit faded and has an air of genteel <Col N="1956" /> elegance but needs a certain shot in the arm.  The exemption from capital gains tax of Tramore Fáilte will be of assistance to them in their brave and adventurous attempt to follow through the Brady, Shipman Martin Report on the development of Tramore and to commence this phased programme.  I would like the Minister to indicate to me that he is aware of what is happening there and if the good work of Tramore Fáilte under their manager, Jim Toohey and its board of which at one stage I was proud to be a member.</P>

Is the actual revenue yield from tobacco increasing or is it decreasing?

      <P>I did not go off them yet.  With regard to the law of diminishing returns, I will give the Senator some idea. In 1986 the total excise receipts were £301 million; in 1987, £303 million; in 1988, £312 million.  It seems, from what I read somewhere recently, that there is an increase, to what extent I cannot define, in the number of women who are smoking while there seems to be a decrease in the number of males smoking.  Maybe the Senator can answer that one, I do not know.  Maybe they are under more stress than the males in this regard.  I have not given up the habit yet.  I have not found myself with enough willpower.  We all have our failings somewhere along the way.  Despite all the banning on advertising, the campaigns and the health warnings there is still an increase in excise receipts and, therefore, in the number of people who are smoking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>This deals with an increase in excise duty on petrol.  I have to express my unhappiness with this and to contrast this measure with what in fact was the Minister's speech on budget night when he introduced the budgetary measures, to which this Finance Bill gives legislative effect.  On budget night the Minister, to the delight of the nation, announced that there would be a reduction at the pumps which would compensate for the increase in excise duty. There was a certain understandable pleasure at hearing that announcement because everybody welcomes a reduction in price.  There was a reduction and the reduction lasted for precisely 12 days.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, too, gave a commitment that prices at the pump would reduce when he was moving the financial resolutions on budget night.  I expect that both he and the Minister for Finance feel somewhat foolish in the light of what transpired.  I know the Minister could not produce a crystal ball and see the evolving scenario.  I am sure he wished that it was possible for him to do that the way things turned out.</P>
      <P>It is true to say that politics, and a very unpleasant and distasteful kind of politics, has been played with petrol prices over the last few weeks.  One is aware of the imminence of at least two elections, the Euro election and the SligoLeitrim by-election.  At least those two are on the cards.  It is not particularly my comment but independent commentators and people who write editorials in various newspapers said that what was going on was in fact a most cynical exercise in vote buying.  It is hard not to see it that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in the price of petrol of just under 12p per gallon includes a huge State subsidy to the motorist.  The effects of this are serious, give rise for concern and bring into question the responsibility of the Government in dealing with what was a very difficult problem for them.  I do not like the way they dealt with it and <Col N="1959" /> I do not believe that the public like it either.  They weakened, practically took the legs from under the Irish National Petroleum Company.  They weakened or indeed worsened the relationships between the Government and the oil companies and they totally confused the general public.</P>
    <P>The Irish National Petroleum Company are forced to trade at a loss.  They face losses of £2 million per month of £100,000 per day.  The Minister for Energy has &mdash; I will be very interested in knowing why &mdash; expressly excluded the INPC from the petrol study undertaken by the fair Trade Commission.  Maybe the Minister will give us a clue as to the thinking there.  I want to know how the INPC can now function on a viable commercial basis.  We want them to do that, we expect them to do that.  We tell them to do that and then, in one fell swoop to save political bacon, we cut the legs from under them.  We have to remember what they are currently engaged in doing.  They are attempting to upgrade the refinery and they are also engaged in negotiating a joint venture with an oil producing country.</P>
    <P>I suspect the Minister for Energy was aided and abetted by his Cabinet colleagues, not least the Minister for Finance. He was engaged in gambling on a slide in petrol prices.  We are now in a situation where petrol is back on a monthly price review basis.</P>
    <P>In passing, I would like to say I welcome the fact that the gift schemes were abolished.  I always thought they were an absolute nonsense and did nothing to contribute to regularising the real cost of petrol.  Most people would have wished to see fewer stamps, freebies and giveaways and a proper economic price put on petrol.  Have the Government considered offsetting oil price incrases with a straightforward reduction in excise duty. That would have been one way to go about it in an intelligent manner.  The Minister should give an indication how he sees matters developing because we are now in a situation where the dollar is strengthening.  This will have an effect on <Col N="1960" /> oil prices.  We are moving inexorably, towards 1992 and we have to be in a position to make tax harmonisation plans.  I want to know what will happen when the tax barriers have gone in the area of tax on petrol.  What preparations have been made?  What studies are going on?  What is the general thinking of the Minister in this area?</P>
    <P>Representations have been made to me by customs officers.  People representing a union of custom officers visited me and voiced their major worries and concerns about how their livelihood and jobs would be affected in the light of 1992.  Most of them anticipate that their jobs have a certain mobility.  All who visited me have lived in various parts of the country, but many of them were reaching an age where their children are in secondary schools and the wished more stability in their lives.  Apart from that, they wished to have some sort of certainty. Will they be redeployed?  Will they be made redundant?  The Minister owes it to this valuable section of our public service to indicate what will happen to them in a 1992 context.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to welcome the increase in excise duty differential in favour of unleaded petrol.  That is good.  That is environmentally sensitive and healthy.  In passing I would like to say that I welcome the increased publicity drive by the Minister for the Environment in relation to this.  Obviously there is a liaison between the Departments of the Environment and Finance that sees this measure introduced in the Finance Bill.  Those of us who spoke on the Finance Bill last year and the year before, were loud in calling for that kind of positive promotion of an anti-pollution measure in the Finance Bill.  I am glad to see it here.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take on board my criticisms as well as my commendations. Both are sincerely meant. While my criticisms are overtly political in tone they are nevertheless, I believe, reflected in the reality we have seen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the four points raised by the Senator, the increase in the price of petrol on budget <Col N="1961" /> day, subsequent situations as I see them, harmonising of taxes and customs officers.  As the Senator knows the five pence increase was taken in excise and there was no increase on the pumps. Petrol prices are decided by the Minister for Industry and Commerce after a review of each month in the early part of the next month, normally around 5, 6 or 7 of the following month.  We can all be good decision makers with hindsight, but if the Senator looks back at that period she will realise there were no indications that an increase was in prospect.  If anything, the indications were that oil prices were likely to either hold or come down. Things turned out totally different.  A couple of weeks later the first dispute arose between the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the oil companies.  It is important to remember what that was about.  They were seeking a 5p increase at that time, which was some four or five weeks after the budget.</P>
      <P>The view taken by the Government and by my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, at the time was that gifts were costing the consumer at least that much.  Rather than increase petrol prices by 5p a gallon, he put it to the companies to either disband the gift system and save that increase being imposed on the consumer or he would legislate to disband the gifts system.  The companies agreed to voluntarily suspend the gifts and that 5p was neutralised.</P>
      <P>Now we come to the next month.  It is important to recall what happened in the intervening period.  There was the incident of the ship going aground in Alaska with ten million barrels of oil on board. The loss of that oil would not cause any great problems in the world supply of oil, but what it did to the pipeline coming from Alaska to America caused the problem &mdash; it cut out that huge distribution channel for four days.  That in turn created a major scarcity of petrol in the American market.  They then turned to Europe, put pressure on the supplies in Europe and inevitably pushed up the price of petrol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the beginning of April each year the oil companies begin to stock more <Col N="1962" /> petrol and less oil, but their stocking method went out of equilibrium because of a mild winter and they were left with large stocks of oil and small stocks of petrol.  As I said because of the pressure from America to make up the shortfall in supply over there, inevitably supply and demand forces came into play and up went the price.  If one compares that with the basic price of oil at that time, the relativity did not hold because supply and demand forces came in and up went the price of oil.  In relation to INPC the Government look at their trading operations over a 12 months period and not over a month or two period.  They are a State company.  Nobody judges their business on a monthly basis.  There are plenty of companies who lose money for three or six months of the year but make money at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The best long-term view taken by international analysts is that in the second part of this year crude oil prices will drop again.  We have seen that already.  It was more than $20 per barrel, I do not know what it is today, I do not watch it every day but I would say it is well below that, probably somewhere in the region of $19 dollars per barrel, or even be $18.50.  The dollar is strengthening.  I am not clairvoyant on exchange rates either, but fundamentally it is difficult to see the economic logic of the dollar strengthening. Money is going into the dollar at the moment from the yen and the deutschmark.  If Senators watch graphs and exchange rates they will see that this happens and if anyone can tell me the logic of it I would be glad to hear it.  The deficits and the fundamental problems of the American economy are there.  Nevertheless the market perceive the dollar as a good bet at the moment and money is going into it.  My personal view is that I do not think it will last.  For the second half of the year we expect different situations to emerge.  That is precisely the view we took.</P>
    <P>Harmonisation of taxes is very topical at the moment.  Only yesterday evening in Brussels a new set of proposals were announced by Commissioner Schrivener. I will be in Spain tomorrow, Saturday <Col N="1963" /> and Sunday at a special meeting of Ministers for Finance to discuss them.  On the face of it, I can tell Senators that I will be rejecting them out of hand.  I will not, under any circumstances, accept those set of proposals.  The old set of proposals were there for quite a number of years and they created problems for many member states, including ourselves, Demark and others.  I do not see the present set of proposals doing anything for us; in fact, they make our situation worse.  They seem to relieve the situation in Britain but what they do for other member states I have not had time to evaluate yet.  I will hear it all tomorrow and Saturday.  As far as Ireland is concerned, I will be rejecting them out of hand as totally inappropriate to meet our Exchequer situation which has been well documented in Brussels.  On the one hand, we have one part of the Commission telling us to get our financial house in order, to get our borrowing requirements down, and we have another part of the Commission putting up that set of proposals which, in my view, are unrealistic and unacceptable to me and the Government.  I cannot go into any more detail because I have not had time to evaluate them, but on face value I will be rejecting them tomorrow.</P>
    <P>I did not proceed with harmonisation steps in the 1989 budget for the very good reason that I like to know where I am going before I start along that road.  As I said, I do not know where we are going, and nobody knows that yet.  It may be some time before agreement is reached because I have a veto, like every other member state, and that is the final position. However, the Government fully subscribe to the principle of harmonisation of taxes but not at an unacceptable price and not at an unrealistic proposition that cannot be taken on board with the fiscal adjustments that have to take place within our Exchequer, not alone now but for many years to come.</P>
    <P>In relation to the customs officers situation, they are tied up, in the harmonisation of taxes, with the removal of <Col N="1964" /> frontiers, but the frontiers do not come down until we get some agreement within the 12 member states on harmonisation. The customs officers have performed a very useful function in the State.  I have given them more powers in different sections of this Bill in relation to petrol retailers so that they will have power to go in and do all the things they could not do up to now.  I am also introducing a new dye and stamping in relation to oil. We are nearing a solution to try and combat the smuggling of petrol as well as oil.  We are quite satisfied from all the tests carried out on the dye that it will not be possible for smugglers, by using chemicals, to return to its original state.</P>
    <P>I will not say any more in relation to petrol except that we have a plan, too, to attack petrol smuggling, an activity which I believe to be costing the Exchequer millions of pounds.  There are different estimates in this regard but I would say, probably conservatively, that we are talking in the region of up to £25 million.  We will certainly bear the customs officers' future in mind but there is no immediate problem with them.  Their future will be decided in relation to the harmonisation of taxes.</P>
    <P>There are also other areas.  When we talk about removing frontiers, we have to take into consideration what will happen in relation to the control of drugs, the movement of drugs.  I do not see customs officers being out of work or out of business immediately.  There are a lot of other areas that have to be dealt with. If one takes one aspect of the proposal today, practically I cannot see how it works, but it must be something in relation to the different rates of duty that exist in the United States across various state borders where they find a system of charging extra or stamping a bottle of liquor with something extra if you buy it in a certain State.  It may be some system like that they have in mind in the Commission. I do not know.  Although the specific job the customs officers are doing at the moment will go, there are plenty of other opportunities for them within the public service.</P>

      <P>With regard to duty particularly on petrol and drink, while I appreciate that so much money can be taken every year into the Revenue in that way, though we all know that duty is a tax &mdash; unfortunately, when one speaks to the person on the street about duty, he says &ldquo;what is it, I am paying this duty but I do not know why I am paying it.  I have to pay duty before I pay tax and then I have to pay VAT on that&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Is it possible, or am I up in the clouds in asking, to have duty on drink and oils taken on a percentage basis?  In other words if one is paying VAT at 25 per cent, why can duty not be taken on a percentage basis?  It is easy for the Minister to be able to say that we are taking 5p extra in the budget, but when somebody buys a gallon of petrol, the person selling gets so much money.  He has to pay VAT on sales.  The Government should be able to work it out so that a percentage amount comes to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am saying this now because I am involved in the drink trade. Did we not have a lot of trouble with small businesses unfortunately getting into trouble with Revenue?  We would like to see small people in business in particular being able to continue to operate. I asked the Minister in the previous Government about the idea of VAT not being charged on the purchase of drink. In other words there should be a total charge by the Government.  For instance, if you are buying a keg for £80, which is inclusive of VAT and duty, the full charge should be made on it as regards the VAT on sales.  If the person buys the keg for £80 and sells it for £100, he still has to pay the VAT on £20 again which is £5. What is wrong with the Government, rather than having all small business people paying VAT having the charge imposed first, instead of on £80, £83 or £82.50 or whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would pay the Government to collect the money the first day.  They would have the money in before the drink was sold at all and they would not be waiting for <Col N="1966" /> returns on the VAT.  With regard to the duty on oil and petrol why is the percentage amount not mentioned rather than the amount asked by the Minister in every budget?  That could be a financial problem now.  I do not see why we should be saying to people, &ldquo;you are entitled to take 10p&rdquo; and come the budget the Minister says: &ldquo;I am taking another 5p, that is 5p on to the amount that I have already got&rdquo;.  What percentage amount is it?  With the reduction and the increase in the price of petrol from one end of the year to the other that is most unfair to the consumer and particularly to the people in business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Senator the bad news.  We cannot touch it until the harmonisation structure is decided one way or the other.  I listened with interest to what the Senator said. Excise was there before VAT and this is the way the structure developed.  In the present transition period of the harmonisation of taxes or approximation of taxes as it is called now, we would not be able to change the structure.  I heard something recently along the lines the Senator is talking about and I would see some merit in it if it was possible administratively and within the structure, and would see it as an anti-smuggling device.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is well aware that over the last two or three years &mdash; certainly up to two years ago &mdash; we had a big problem regarding draught drink coming in from the North.  Because of the VAT situation, it paid people to do that.  The Minister should be stopping that and he should create the incentive whereby there would be no need for that. A person might bring in, say, 20 kegs at a time.  The point I am trying to make is that by creating the one charge, the Minister blows out the person who is <Col N="1967" /> coming in illegally and not paying VAT on the beer.  This sort of activity harms particularly publicans in such places as the towns of Monaghan and Cavan.  It is unfair to people in family businesses, husbands and wives, widowers or whatever whom the Minister literally frightens the life out of.</P>
      <P>At the moment we have VAT on purchases, and VAT on sales and there might be reduced VAT on, say, brushes and soap.  That is just stupidity so far as a business in the £1,000 to £2,000 a week bracket is concerned.  People do not want to stay in business that way.  To simplify it there should be one charge.  The Government do not have to apologise to anyone.  They can simply say that a certain rate is the duty.  It is a Government charge of so much on every pint or on every keg.  Likewise on petrol.  If it can be done in the drink trade it can be done in the petrol trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly explore it within the context of the harmonisation negotiations going on.  I am interested in it from a couple of different angles.  We are all well aware of drink being smuggled in, of lorries going out delivering five kegs of Guinness and when they got back to collect the empties, there were 15 there.  Now we have the latest development of the kegs &mdash; we thought we were on to something for a while &mdash; being crushed in an operation just on the Border itself.  I am not too far away from it so I have a good idea of what is going on.</P>
      <P>One other point about suggestions being made in relation to moving up and down revenue as prices go up and down; I do not have available to me the regulation that was there under the 1957 Act, that was put down by the High Court, whereby you could make a ministerial regulation on a weekly or monthly basis to move VAT up or down so we are stuck with the present arrangement.  Every change has to be legislated.</P>

At the same time we know we have got to proceed and that 1992 is going to call on all our skill to adapt, to cope, to harmonise and to regularise.  I understand the Minister is going to say no.  He reminds us of his power of veto in all of this, but maybe he is keeping his cards very close to his chest.  He is not giving us an indication of Governmental thinking or departmental thinking in the area. Are we going to seek massive derogations on every front?  Are we going to move in a phased fashion towards certain harmonisations? I want to know more and I hope the Minister is in a position to give a better indication of Government thinking in the area.</P>

      <P>If it would help the Senator, I will say this much.  I have already stated Government policy in relation to it.  We support in principle tax harmonisation and tax co-ordination.  I said in Brussels at the last meeting of ECOFIN that I am seeking solutions within a Community context outside of derogation.  I am already on the record as saying that.  That is our principal stance at the table but when you are faced with the reality of the situation where they say on a very quick calculation £650 million, you must be realistic&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It just cannot be done.  There is no point putting on kid gloves and talking about it.  That is the <Col N="1969" /> reality; it just cannot be done.  I do not know how the Commission can line that up with a financial division in the Commission, saying &ldquo;you are on the right track getting your economy right,&rdquo; and then expect you to take £650 million on board.  It simply is not on.  There is no point in being nice about it: you just have to say it straight out.  That is it.  We will continue to pursue in negotiations a Community solution, but the present proposals, as I read them this morning &mdash; and I have not had time to get a full evaluation of them &mdash; are, I repeat, totally unacceptable.  On behalf of the Government I will state that quite rigidly tomorrow in Spain and see if the Community can find a solution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree.  I would like to explore another element which I raised already and that is the matter of the customs officers.  I understand what the Minister said in his reply.  I assume he is aware of their uncertainty and their anxiety and that he would feel that is unfortunate in the present circumstances &mdash; I see him nodding &mdash; and that their fate is linked to decisions on harmonisation; but decisions on harmonisation will have to be made within a given period.  Would the Minister confirm that the decisions within a European context, which is a lovely &ldquo;Yes, Minister&rdquo; kind of approach to telling us something without telling us anything&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>Right.  I support that and I certainly wish you well in what are <Col N="1970" /> terribly important deliberations for our economy.  I just wonder if you can indicate when decisions will be made &mdash; I mean must they be made by 1992?  I am assuming that they must.  Or does the Minister see some sort of run-on situation, where we will be on 1 January 1993 without these decisions having been made?  Must the anxiety, concern, uncertainty and difficulty among the customs officers, which is linked to the harmonisation, be perpetuated well into the 1990s?  Can the Minister tell us when they will be let off the hook, put out of their misery, or when they will have a more coherent idea of what fate holds in store for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully share the concern expressed by the Senator in relation to the customs officers and their wives and families.  It is an uncertain situation for them and it is linked to the decisions on harmonisation.  It is hypothetical to try to speculate when final acceptance or agreement can be reached.  The last proposals were around for a number of years and they did not find any great measure of agreement within all the member states.  Various states had different problems with them.  As I said, these proposals only came out yesterday evening and I did not have much time to study them.  The initial meeting is taking place at the weekend.  I would not hazard a guess at this stage, without the benefit of having one meeting around the table to try to assess the various reactions of member states to them.  I would not hazard a guess, but I can tell you that I will take the customs officers' uncertainly away at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>They were allowed to do it up to now but the Senator will know, if he knows any of them, they would not have the financial muscle to be able to do it.  I have seen studies published and submitted to me about what the gross margin is in the bookie business.  By paying the 10 per cent your margin is down so low that there is no way you would even pay your overheads.  It is quite clear to me that it is a device to grab market share.  The margin left would not be sufficient to pay your overheads. So if the man in your town, whoever he is, does not have the financial muscle to be able to stay the pace on a very low margin, he would have to go out of business. Therefore, I am giving him a chance to survive.  It is up to him after that.</P>

He puts a few quid on a horse, then he gets his ticket.  Eventually, he will go back and check to see if it was recorded.  That is exactly how they are caught.  They have been very successful in recent times.  In fact with the on-course people there was a big swoop at Tralee Races the last day.

The Minister has done that and legally we are working quite well now.

      <P>The Minister is putting the onus on the punter.  The person who is doing the business is the bookie.  If he makes the money and you still get your 50p, you are happy.  For instance, a punter makes a £5 bet and the bookie is prepared to say he will pay the tax.  The punter gets his docket which says that 50p tax was paid.  It must state on the docket that the 50p tax was paid.  Then the customs officer can say: &ldquo;Fine, that is grand, the tax is paid&rdquo;.  That is his duty, <Col N="1977" /> but how can you put the onus on the punter to pay the 10p?</P>

I understood that the &ldquo;ballroom of romance&rdquo; as such was a vanishing commodity and was being relegated to the myths of the 1950s and 1960s along with dancing at the crossroads on a raised platform. Does the increase in duties attach itself to what is the modern day &ldquo;ballroom of romance&rdquo;, the discotheque, and that type of activity?

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Provisions relating to the licensing of private brewers are designed to ensure that revenue receipts from beer are not adversely affected by a switch from the consumption of commercially brewed beer to privately <Col N="1980" /> brewed product.  These provisions require a private brewer to take out an excise licence.  However, depending on the valuation of the house occupied by him, the licence may be a free licence, not subject to excise duty, and the beer brewed may not be liable to duty.  There are no private brewers' licences on record at the moment and private brewing is no longer popular.  After some initial growth in the importation of materials for home brew kits in the early 1980s, activity has fallen off significantly.  Official control of persons brewing beer for their own domestic purposes is no longer considered necessary.  The provisions of the present section are designed to achieve this.  The prohibition on the brewing of beer by a private brewer other than for his own domestice use is considered essential and is designed to safeguard the revenue position in the absence of a licencing system.  The penalty of £1,000 provided for breach of this prohibition is the standard penalty provided for breaches of excise laws generally.</P>

      <P>I also welcome the ten-year driving licence.  I can see the method in the Minister for Finance's madness. However, I was driving around Cork the other day and pulled into a business premises.  While I was paying for my stuff I saw identity cards on the table &mdash;&ldquo;Make sure you use a passport photograph.  You will have a number and you shall always have it on you.&rdquo;  I was not aware that such a notice could be put up in public places.  I am not in favour of that, and I will tell you why.  The Irish are a people who do not like being numbered.  We are now part of Europe, and other people there ask for identity cards.  We have not agreed here that a person should be able to display the kind of notice I have referred to.  I do not want to go any further than that because I do not want to embarrass anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the ten-year licence. Seeing that the Minister is getting the money in beforehand, he should be able to provide a type of licence which would not be as cumbersome as those we have already.  They look quite well and there are other things you can hold in them. I do not carry one with me; and the recommendation is that you are not supposed to in case you lose it.  What type of licence is envisaged?  Are we saying it should be computerised?  Are we saying it should be made of PVC and that it would never wear?  Should it have an identity number and the person's photograph? Should we not take the first step and say that at least the person who has the licence should be photographed? Should it be an identity card, or should it only be a driving licence?  I do not want to mention the words &ldquo;identity cards.&rdquo; We must recognise that because of our <Col N="1982" /> political situation, we are asked to identify ourselves in other countries, unfortunately. Could I have the Minister's views on that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>On that same issue, those of us who come from very near the Border and drive in the Border counties would find there is nothing new in this requirement.  All of the driving licences issued in the North contain a photograph. It is not an unreasonable requirement in the situation we find ourselves today. Identification of the individual is of some importance.  I would not be as reluctant as my colleague from Cork, although I would resent having a number tag on my back as well.  However, in the world in which we are living, those of us who travel around cannot afford the luxury of having a slip of paper showing the name and address of the licence holder and the date of the licence.  The licence should contain information that identifies the person because these days it is very easy to use somebody else's driving licence. These are all factors which must be considered.</P>
      <P>We are very well aware that there is computer control registration and this has to be done, not because you have to be licensed to drive but because of the overall development and undesirable progress we are making in Europe and, unfortunately, in Ireland.  There is a need to have a driving licence with a photograph and sufficient identification so that it cannot be altered, swopped or abused.</P>

      <P>This section restores at least part of what we called the flat VAT rate for farmers.  Up to two years ago it was 2.7 per cent.  This year the Minister took a positive step in increasing it from 1.4 to 2 per cent.  I regret the Minister has not gone all the way and restored it to what it was.  I would contend that it should be greater than 2.7 per cent.  This refund to farmers was something that was specifically targeted at small farmers who were not registered for VAT and who <Col N="1984" /> were compensated for their purchases on inputs.  At the time of sale to a mart, a meat factory or whatever they got this flat VAT refund of 2.7 per cent and it was very unfair to reduce it two years ago to 1.3 per cent.  It was increased slightly last year and has been increased again this year.  This is a tax and an imposition on small farmers.  The number of farmers who are actually registered for VAT in this country is around 1,500 and they are, by definition, the larger and the better off farmers.  Those farmers can claim back from the Revenue Commissioners VAT paid on all inputs as long as they produce their receipts and invoices, etc.  Because these are larger farmers they have larger sales and get the credit of the flat VAT refund.  I find that an anomaly.  It is regrettable that the Minister has not seen fit to restore the refund to what it was just over two years ago or indeed to increase it beyond that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason it was reduced in earlier years was simply that there were so much levies due to the Exchequer.  My predecessor, Mr. MacSharry, at the time gave a commitment that when the levies were paid up he would increase it again to a reasonable level.  During the amnesty quite a considerable amount of levies came in but there is still approximately £9 million outstanding.  Mr. MacSharry gave a commitment to increase it to only 1.7 per cent.  I increased it to 2.7 per cent and I will review the position again, before next year's budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister accepts that this is a small concession made to small farmers who do not qualify for VAT refunds since they are not registered. There were outstanding dues to the Government on health charges and so on but the health boards should have their own collection services for those matters. Farmers who were paying their dues suffered the loss through the reduction of this fund.  They should not be punished. In effect, they were paying for the actions of others and surely that was not fair. <Col N="1985" /> The point I am making is that it was a very bad reason to introduce this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>This is really about the VAT reduction on arts sales and is to be widely welcomed.  Indeed, several groups in the fine art business have gone on record as expressing pleasure and satisfaction at seeing this measure introduced in the Finance Bill, 1989.  The proposal is to reduce from 25 per cent to 10 per cent the rate of VAT levied at sales and auctions and on works of arts being brought into the country.  I welcome the decision not to confine the lower VAT rate to paintings over 100 years of age only.  The absence of an age threshold will benefit modern works of art.  We must remember we have a thriving development in the area of modern art, paintings, sculpture and general creative activity and anything that will encourage, support and underpin that is to be welcomed. We are all concerned about the volume of paintings and works of art which are being exported and which are <Col N="1987" /> denuding this country of so much of its heritage and its richness.  This measure will go a long way towards balancing the outflow and for that reason it is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister consider subsequently broadening the legislation to include other works of art, in addition to the ones covered in the Bill?  At the moment the 10 per cent VAT rate applies to paintings, drawings, or pastels, lithographs, sculptures, statuary and articles of furniture, silver, glass or porcelain. Does the Minister consider that that list could be expanded?  I hope the reduction in the VAT will encourage the return of works of art to this country.  I would like the Minister to clarify if this provision will have an effect on the little sale that takes place in a private house as opposed to an auction gallery.  I understand that changes have been made that will put a private sale, conducted by a regular auctioneer, on a par with the auctioneer who conducts a sale in his centre of operation. I think I heard the Minister refer to that in a radio interview, but I am not very clear about it.</P>

      <P>I would like to welcome this section.  We discussed it and the Minister replied on Second Stage in the House yesterday.  As somebody who is privileged to be in this House on the basis of having a nomination from the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland, I would like to place on record that that society, and indeed the Irish Wheelchair Association and many other organisations and societies representing the disabled, have for a long time been knocking on the door and waiting to see a more realistic, compassionate and broadly-based provision which gives recognition of their disability in the area of taxation.  I know the Minister ably defended my charge that it was Deputy Ivan Yates who had, in fact, highlighted this matter in a timely fashion prior to the publication of the Finance Bill.  I am sure he will be generous enough to accede that Deputy Yates and, indeed, many other Deputies of all parties over the years have been lobbying on behalf of the disabled.  There was one particularly poignant case where the actual nonsense, that was the regulation, was exposed for what it was and on foot of that the Minister brought in this provision which should meet the needs and requirements of severely and permanently disabled people.  It is a welcome, humane, compassionate and sensitive provision and I congratulate him on it.  I am very pleased to see it.  I hope that particular additional handicap which was endured by disabled people will no longer have to feature in debates in this House or, indeed, any other House and that the matter, once and for all, is put to bed.</P>

      <P>This section relates to prize bonds.  I am interested to know &mdash; I do not know whether the Minister can tell me about it &mdash; what impact the national lottery has had on the sale of prize bonds.  Can the Minister give an indication whether sales of prize bonds are declining?  It is all about the dream machine and people living in the expectation of their number being pulled out of the hat or coming up to the lotto board. I suspect that the sale of prize bonds may have been in some way affected by the national lottery.</P>

      <P>I do not have that information but I will get it and send it on to the Senator.  As she may be aware, we are transferring the management of the prize bounds from the Bank of Ireland to a joint venture between a small private company in Kerry and An Post.  I have not got the details but I will send them to the Senator.</P>

      <P>As I entered the Chamber the debate was under way.  I would like to welcome section 4.  It is timely and surprisingly imaginative coming from the Department of Finance where one does not expect to find great imagination and creativity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps.  I was complimenting the Minister and his Department on their imagination and creativity. To go back to aesthetics and the finely titled editorial anything that stimulates and encourages people to bring life back into inner cities is to be welcomed.  There has been a disturbing amount of dereliction and decay in inner cities and some very fine buildings have visibly crumbled in front of people because the costs of restoring them have been prohibitive and extremely off-putting.  Only certain valiant stalwarts like our good colleague, Senator Norris, to whom the Minister paid tribute in his Second Stage speech, and some others have taken the bit between their teeth and done magnificent jobs of restoration which are to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am concerned from a tax reform point of view.  The Minister has not been too warm or welcoming to the whole notion of tax reform, preferring to interpret it, on the part of those who seek it, as being a wish to see tax cuts rather than a root and branch reform of the system.  I could debate that on another <Col N="1991" /> occasion.  Which I welcome this measure, it concerns me from the tax reform point of view because it is a subsidy and just complicates an already extremely intricate and complicated code.  It would have been better as a tax credit than a tax subsidy.  I would also like to enter a caveat, particularly in relation to Dublin, that the roads plan does not obviate some of the advantages that are part and parcel of this measure because if a major road is built through an old established, historic part of the city, it will not encourage <Col N="1992" /> people to purchase properties on the edge of a highway and to restore them.  That is something of concern and could undo some of the good that is part and parcel of this provision.  On the whole, I welcome it.  It is one of the more redeeming features of this lack lustre Finance Bill.</P>
