      <P>I have notice from Senator John A. Murphy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Department of the Taoiseach to help maintain in existence the Irish National Ballet and the Dublin Contemporary Dance Group, especially in view of recent public investment in the Firkin Crane in Cork as a home for the Irish National Ballet, and the forthcoming role of Dublin as the EC cultural capital.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator David Norris of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Taoiseach as Minister with responsibility for the Arts to intervene to ensure the survival of the Irish National Ballet.</P>
      <P>I regret I have to rule that both matters are not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the ground of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>

      <P>Before I call the Leader of the House I want to clear a <Col N="1322" /> point on which there seems to be confusion. I wish to inform Senators that the Office of Public Works has reported that the Seanad Chamber will be ready for the sitting on next Wednesday, 10 May.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, you will recall that last week you had occasion in your judgment to have me suspended from the House.  I have been looking at the Standing Order since then. I am seeking a ruling &mdash; I am not raising the issue of last week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is intended to take Items Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 today.  We will take all Stages of Items Nos. 1 and 2.  It is proposed to take Item No. 4 from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m.  Item No. 3 will be concluded today, irrespective of the time of the ending of the sitting; in other words, we may go on later than 8 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Ordering of Business.  It seems to me, and it was perhaps hinted at in the Cathaoirleach's own question, it would make more sense to take Item No. 3 first before moving on to more substative business.  May I offer two suggestions on the ordering of business generally and I do so in an entirely non-contentious spirit?</P>
      <P>Arising out of last week's unfortunate proceedings, it seems to me that two points might be kept in mind by the Leader of the House in future.  One is that although he is perfectly within his rights in proposing the Order of Business without any further elaboration, nonetheless it might make for a less acrimonious atmosphere were he, whenever it happens that an item is widely expected to be discussed, to explain why it is not being discussed.  I think that instead of a discussion having to take place subsequently we are entitled to the maximum information at the beginning.</P>
      <P>The other point again arises from last week.  It seems to me to be now perfectly obvious that it is very inappropriate that a Minister who is to take the next piece of business should not sit in the ministerial chair in the course of the discussion on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to suggest also that we would agree, if the Leader of the House agrees, that we would take Item No. 3 first.  There is unanimous agreement among all of us, and indeed, in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, that this would take place.  The televising of the opening of the new Seanad Chamber can only take place if there is the agreement of the House.  I know the Leader of the House has suggested that we would work late tonight to get that agreement but it would be more practical to take it now at the earlier stage of our proceedings and, hopefully, to agree on it.  I welcome the fact that it has appeared on our Order Paper and it is being <Col N="1324" /> ordered.  I welcome the fact that you used your influence to ensure that the House was given its proper status at the reopening and that we will be the first House of the Oireachtas to avail of the facility of television broadcasting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support my colleagues in suggesting that the Leader of the House might consider altering the Order of Business so that we take Item No. 3 first.  That suggestion has a lot of merit.</P>
      <P>I am sure also, a Chathaoirligh, that you will consider it appropriate that this House should send its best wishes, Godspeed and a quick recovery to a Member of the other House, the Tánaiste, Brian Lenihan.  He is universally popular across the party boundaries.  We all wish him a safe journey, good and appropriate medical treatment and a quick return to health.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask your guidance also, a Chathaoirligh, on a matter on which I do not wish to be contentious.  You will recall that on your advice I referred a matter that was concerning me about what I considered to be misleading of the House to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I have heard nothing back about that except indirectly&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish to get your guidance in asking a question of the Leader of the House: when can I raise a matter in the House on the application <Col N="1325" /> of the Standing Orders of the House?  I have now come to the conclusion that the bias which is used in the quick dispatch, as you said yourself, of decisions in this House is leading to difficulties.  I certainly have serious difficulty.  Rulings are being made in a biased fashion, and I wish to query it.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business &mdash; and this is about the fifth time I have raised this matter &mdash; I would like you to indicate to me when an issue that has been before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges &mdash; the extraordinary, peculiar way in which allocation of space is made for press conference in this House &mdash; will be dealt with.  I am sick to death of having an officer of this House, who is not an elected Member of either House of the Oireachtas, deciding what is and is not appropriate for Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is your job, a Chathaoirligh, to defend my rights and the rights of Members of this House to use the Houses of the Oireachtas according to some sort of agreed standard and procedure.  I raised that matter here. Senator Norris has tried to raise it with <Col N="1326" /> the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. You said matters are dealt with quickly.  I do not understand why this matter has not been decided on in six months.  It is outrageous that an officer of this House should tell us what we should do in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sympathy with the request that Item No. 3 be taken first on the Order of Business, but it is not possible.  It is essential that Government business be taken first.  The Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1988 is a Bill that has to be dealt with in this House as a matter of urgency.  The Bord na gCapall (Dissolution) Bill, 1988 is a Government matter which is of importance as well.</P>
      <P>Item No. 3 created a certain amount of contention last week which was not of my making.  Unfortunately, when I arrived in Dublin last Wednesday I was met with rumour, innuendo and various other problems associated with taking Item No. 3.  I had to clear in my own mind that these rumours and the innuendo were incorrect.  As I said last week, the matter would be left on the Order Paper and it was left on the Order Paper. It is unfortunate that people get involved in spreading rumours or reacting to rumours and I sincerely hope this House does not fall into that trap again.  We will take Item No. 3 at the earliest possible time today, but it is essential that Government business takes precedence.</P>
      <P>Some of the questions raised had nothing to do with the Order of Business. They are matters which were raised by Members and which were addressed to the Cathaoirleach and I do not intend to react to them.</P>
      <P>I think we all agree that best wishes be sent to the Tánaiste and his family.  As a former very distinguished Member of this House it is utterly appropriate that we should do so.  Senator Murphy raised a point but somebody else was talking at the time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a point made to the Chair.  It does not refer to the Order of Business.  The Order of Business will be Items Nos. 1, 2 and 3 and Item No. 4 which will be taken from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m.  If necessary we will take Item No. 3 to its conclusion this evening, whether it be after 8 p.m. or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Leader of the House obviously also noticed the Minister making an interjection&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Beartaítear leis an mBille seo an dlí a leasú i dtreo is go mbeidh sé ar ár gcumas na toghcháin d'Údarás na Gaeltachta a chur ar siúl ar an lá atá socruithe cheana féin le haghaidh na dtoghchán do Phárlaimint na hEorpa.  Mar is eol do Sheanadóirí, déanfar an vótaíocht sna toghcháin Eorpacha ar an 15 lá de mhí Mheithimh.  Faoi réir forálacha an Acht Um Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1979, ní foláir na toghcháin don Údarás a chur ar siúl roimh lár mí Dheireadh Fómhair seo chughainn. Meastar go mba ciallmhar an rud é an vótaíocht san da thoghchán a thógaint ar an lá céanna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this short technical Bill, therefore, is to allow for the holding of the elections to Údarás na Gaeltachta on the same day as the European Parliament elections.  The Bill will bring the elections to Údarás na Gaeltachta within the scope of section 91 of the Electoral Act, 1963 <Col N="1328" /> which provides for the taking of two or more polls on the same day.</P>
    <P>Under section 91, as it now stands two or more polls in relation to Presidential, Dáil, European Parliament or local elections or referenda may be taken together but the provision does not extend to Údarás elections which are governed by a separate code.  This Bill, when enacted, will bring Údarás elections into line with the other types of elections in this regard. It will be a permanent provision which may be used to combine any future Údarás elections with any other national or local poll.</P>
    <P>Two or more polls have been taken together on a number of occasions in recent years.  Combining polls in this way can result in cost savings, obviate the necessity for repeated closing of schools for election purposes and make for greater convenience for the electors.</P>
    <P>The European election date has already been set for 15 June and, in accordance with the law, Údarás elections must be held not later than 17 October of this year.  I think the Seanad will agree that the sensible course is to have the two elections run concurrently.  Given the strong local interest generated in relation to Údarás elections, the selection of strong candidates and the keenness of the contest, I am satisfied that there is no danger that the Údarás elections will be overshadowed by the European campaign.</P>
    <P>Section 91 of the Electoral Act, 1963 provides for detailed matters in relation to the holding of two or more polls together, such as the use of the same official mark on ballot papers for each poll, the use of different coloured ballot papers, and the possibility of using the same, or different, ballot boxes for each poll.</P>
    <P>The section also gives the Minister power to provide, by direction, order or regulation, for such matters as he considers necessary to facilitate the holding of the polls together.  A direction, order, or regulation made under section 91 may define the powers and duties of returning officers and of any person employed in connection with the polls, and may make <Col N="1329" /> such modifications in Acts, orders or regulations relating to the taking of the polls or the counting of votes as may be necessary to facilitate the taking of the polls on the same day.</P>
    <P>Section 91 also provides for the apportionment of costs where these fall to be borne by different agencies.  As we know, the costs of Presidential, Dáil and European elections are met by the Central Fund; local election costs are defrayed by the local authorities concerned and the cost of Údarás elections by Aire na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Mar is eol do Sheanadóirí bunaíodh Údarás na Gaeltachta d'fhonn caomhnú agus leathadh na Gaeilge mar phríomhmheán cumarsáide sa Ghaeltacht a spreagadh agus chun forbairt na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn.  Trí chomhalta dhéag atá ar an Údarás.  Toghann pobal na Gaeltachta seachtar agus ceapann Aire na Gaeltachta seisear eile ar a n-áirítear an Cathaoirleach.  Is mar seo a leanas a bhíonn na hionadaithe do na limistéir Ghaeltachta sna contaetha éagsúla: beirt do Dhún na nGall; triúr do Ghaillimh, do Mhaigh Eo agus don Mhí le chéile; agus beirt do Chiarraí, do Chorcaigh agus do Phort Láirge le chéile.</P>
    <P>Is ar 17 Deireadh Fómhair, 1984, a bhí an toghchán is déanaí ann don Údarás agus faoin Acht um Udarás na Gaeltachta, 1979, ní foláir toghcháin a chur ar siúl i gceann tréimhsí nach giorra ná ceithre bliana ná nach faide ná cúig bliana.  Mar sin ní mór an chéad toghchán eile a chur ar siúl idir seo agus lár mí Dheireadh Fómhair seo chugainn.  Faoi mar dúradh is é atá beartaithe ná an toghchán don Údarás a chur ar siúl ar an lá céanna le Toghcháin na hEorpa, sé sin ar 15 Meitheamh seo chugainn.  Ach an Bille seo a bheith rite déanfaidh Aire na Gaeltachta ordú a shocróidh an lá sin mar an lá vótaíochta le haghaidh toghchán Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Is toghchán tabhachtach é seo do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, go mór mhór do mhuintir na Gaeltachta i gConnamara, Contae na Gaillimhe.  The reason for this Bill is to facilitate the holding of the Údarás election on the <Col N="1330" /> same day as the Euro-election.  Senator Ryan asked the Minister if this was a possibility.  It is important that this be clarified.  Perhaps we could agree to hold the Údarás election on the same day as the Euro election, even though I have reservations about that which I will deal with in a moment.  Since this amended Bill was passed in the Dáil certain events, rumours, facts and statements by the Taoiseach seem to indicate that we might have a third election on 15 June.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a bit concerned about a general election.  I am looking forward very much to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot of other people are.  I do not want to know the reasons.  We will deal with the election we have before us, not a general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>It is relevant that the people of the Gaeltacht be asked to vote in the Údarás election, the Euro election and the general election if they were to be held on the same day.  Perhaps the Minister of State could clarify this.  It could have very serious repercussions for the people of the Gaeltacht area, particularly for the Gaeltacht area of Galway. It would be bad enough to have two elections on the same day without having a third.  Since the Bill was passed in the Dáil events seem to have changed. Therefore, I would like clarification from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Údarás na Gaeltachta elections can be held any time between four and five years of the previous elections, so 15 June would fit into that time scale.  From that point of view we cannot object to it. The Minister in his speech stated &mdash; and I would like clarification of this also &mdash; that there seems to be provision in law for the holding of any other election or dual elections on the same day, but there seems to be no provision in law for the <Col N="1331" /> Údarás election.  If we give permission on this occasion, would such permission be confined only to the Údarás election for this year or would it include all future Údarás elections?</P>
    <P>If we are to concede to have the Údarás election on the same day as the European elections this year it is important to know whether it is only for this election.  If it is only for this election, I would have fewer reservations about it than if &mdash; as the Minister's speech seems to suggest &mdash; it ties us into future Údarás elections. Could we cater this time for the Údarás election together with the European election? God knows what this Administration or some future Administration might wish to tie the Údarás elections in with.  This might not be beneficial to the people of the Gaeltacht areas and to the voters in the Údarás election.</P>
    <P>The people of the genuine Gaeltacht areas take this election more seriously than they take the European election and more seriously than they take any other election.  For the people of the Gaeltacht areas the Údarás election will be the most important election they will be voting in, irrespective of whether it is linked with the European election or not.</P>
    <P>According to the 1986 census figures there is a total population of 83,430 in the Gaeltacht areas.  Of course, that is a fairly scattered area.  To bring it into perspective, it is equivalent to a four seater Dáil constituency.  We are not talking about a small, minor election.  We are talking about a widespread election dealing with the rights of over 83,000 people.  I note that the population of the Galway Gaeltacht is 29,614 according to the 1986 census figures.  I know that when the Cathaoirleach hears the relevance of the two points I made she will excuse my earlier mention of the dreaded general election.</P>
    <P>Again, according to the 1986 census figures, roughly 8,000 of the 29,614 people in the Galway Gaeltacht reside in the built&mdash;up area of Galway Borough, in Ballinfoyle Park, Tirellan Heights, Monaleen Heights, part of Castlelawn Heights and other urban areas that have <Col N="1332" /> now been built up and are now part of Galway City Borough.  The relevance of this is that at the last Údarás election there was a lesser population in those areas and, secondly, the people in those areas had no great interest in the Údarás election.  There are very few people living in those areas who came from Gaeltacht areas.  Those who either planned to live there or are accidentally living there would be only one out of every 200 or 300 houses.</P>
    <P>There is to be a European election and the possibility of a general election, and some of those people, whether they like it or not, will be going to the polling booths and getting an Údarás ballot paper for the first time ever.  The electorate of the Galway Gaeltacht area is roughly 20,000, and of the urban city area is roughly 6,000.  Therefore, over one-quarter of the people eligible to vote in the Údarás elections are now living in the built-up areas of Galway city, which was never intended to be the case.  It was never intended that those people would have an undue influence on the result of the Údarás election.  The Galway-Mayo-Meath electoral area is only a three-seater. Therefore, having those people voting on the day of the Údarás election could have an undue influence on who will be elected to represent the Gaeltacht areas on the Údarás.  We must guard against this.  I would have no fears about it if the Údarás election was taking place on a day by itself.  It would have no influence then because only those people genuinely interested in Gaeltacht affairs would vote.  I know that from past experience.</P>
    <P>We must also take into account that since the 1986 census figures were taken wholesale emigration has taken place from Gaeltacht areas and this distorts the picture even more.  Entire families, as well as young members of families, have emigrated from Gaeltacht areas whereas emigration to that extent, or practically to any extent, has not taken place from the newly built-up areas of Galway city. Therefore, the picture is more out of proportion than even the figures &mdash; and <Col N="1333" /> I can only go by the census figures of 1986 &mdash; suggest because I would estimate that out of the real Gaeltacht anything up to 2,000 or 3,000 people may have emigrated since, and possibly more.  I have no means of putting a figure on this since I am using the 1986 census.  That is now three years ago and there has been a serious drain on the Gaeltacht areas over that period with regard to emigration. That drain has not taken place in the urban built-up areas where, by an accident now, the people find themselves with the same voting rights as the genuine persons living in the real Gaeltacht.  It is an anomaly that must be put right.  I know it cannot be put right before the Údarás election, but I am at least entitled to point out the danger of having a national election on the same day as the Údarás election from the point of view that it could distort the result.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister of State what is the situation regarding the present Údarás na Gaeltachta board?  The appointed members of that board, I understand, have anything up to two years to serve.  Is it the intention of the Minister, as soon as the election is over, to abolish the old appointed board and reappoint a new board or, is it the policy of the Minister to let the people on the old board serve out their duly allotted time which is 18 months or two years away?  Again, this may have an influence on the election from the point of view that at least the people in that position would, I feel, be entitled to know where they stand.  In other words, are they going to be left on the board to serve out their unexpired time?  If not, I think they should be told, because those people, of course, would have the option of standing for election in the Údarás election.  It is an option some of them may wish to take up and others may not wish to take up because some of them are non-political people.  At least they should be in the position to know where they stand as regards whether the board is to be abolished immediately after the election and a complete new board set up or whether they will serve out their time.</P>
    <P>I just want clarification on this point: <Col N="1334" /> does the fact that those people or anybody appointed to a State board would be standing for election automatically disqualify them from continuing membership of the board?  I know this happens in the case of Oireachtas elections because I was in a similar position myself when I stood for the Seanad.  I happened to be just previously appointed to a State board and in order to contest the Seanad election, I had to resign my directorship of the board, irrespective of the result of the election.  Does the same thing apply in the case of Údarás na Gaeltachta?</P>
    <P>I would further ask the Minister of State to convey to the Taoiseach or the relevant Minister my feelings on the situation as regards the appointment of members to the Údarás na Gaeltachta board, whether it be at the end of the term of the people appointed at present or whether at an earlier time.  I think there would be a very strong case to be made for somebody from the Gaeltacht islands off our coast to be appointed, because electorally those people have practically no chance of being elected.  In other words, I have in mind particularly the Aran Islands off the Galway coast which is part of the Gaeltacht.  It would be very difficult, indeed practically impossible, for a person from there to get elected.  Yet I think it is something the Minister should bear in mind when he is reappointing his ministerial nominees to the board, that somebody from the islands should be appointed.  If I am not able to make a recommendation, perhaps my good colleague Senator Ó Conchubhair would be well able to make a suitable recommendation in that regard.  He knows those people slightly better than I.</P>
    <P>I will conclude with that remark.  I view very seriously the difficulty that is going to arise.  I know Galway is only one of the constituencies concerned.  We have the Donegal constituency and the Kerry-Waterford constituency as well; Galway, Mayo and Meath being part of the one constituency in this election.  The matter is going to arise seriously in the Galway, Mayo, Meath electoral areas from that point of view.  I know the Minister <Col N="1335" /> appreciates the point I am making that a vast majority of those people who will have the same vote as anybody else really have no interest or nothing in common with the people.  Most of them came in the Headford or Oranmore roads from outside Galway city and county.  They are very welcome in Galway.  One third of the population &mdash; I learned in the final details of the census &mdash; of Galway city is now made up of people who came from outside Galway city and county.  It is a relevant point and I will reserve my position on this Bill until the Minister is able to give me some assurances.</P>
    <P>I would tolerate the European elections because they are not taking the European elections that seriously but if it comes to a third election, I would find it very hard to accept the three being held on the one day, not from the point of view of the European or general elections but solely from the point of view of the Údarás election.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáiltiú roimh an mBille seo.  Fáiltím freisin roimh an Aire Stáit go dtí an Teach.  Tá ciall leis an mBille seo, mar bhí sé i gceist i mbliana toghcháin na hEorpa a bheith againn ar dtús agus ansin toghchán do Údarás na Gaeltachta amach ag deireadh na bliana.  Mar atá a fhios ag Seanadóirí bhí toghchán an Údaráis againn na blianta siar, agus toghcháin na hEorpa, agus bhí sé sách deacair daoine a mhealladh amach go dtí toghcháin na hEorpa.  I mo thuairim féin, an t-am seo tabharfaidh toghchán Údarás na Gaeltachta aghaidh níos fear ar thoghcháin na hEorpa, agus chomh maith céanna músclóidh sé níos mó suime i muintir na Gaeltachta san Údarás féin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ó bunaíodh Údarás na Gaeltachta roinnt blianta siar, caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil go leor obair iontach déanta acu ar son mhuintir na Gaeltachta, agus is iontach an rud é le rá go bhfuil muintir na Gaeltachta in ann seasamh mar iarrthóirí le haghaidh an bhoird seo.  Tá siad in ann a rogha féin a dhéanamh, daoine a thoghadh as na Gaeltachtaí éagsúla trasna na tíre.  B'fhéidir gur féidir a rá go <Col N="1336" /> bhfuil Gaeltachtaí ann atá lag ó thaobh vótála agus nach bhfuil aon ionadaí acu. Ach fad is a fheicim, ionadaithe a toghadh ó na ceantair atá ceangailte leo, tugann siad cúnamh do mhuintir na gceantar sin, ní amháin in gContae na Mí ach i bPort Láirge chomh maith céanna.</P>
    <P>San Údarás deiridh bhí go leor trioblóidí ann, bhí go leor raiceanna ann, agus ag an am bhí imní ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta go gcuirfí deireadh leis.  Ach caithfidh mé a rá gur shocraigh an bord síos, agus an bord atá anois acu, rinne siad a ndícheall ar son mhuintir na Gaeltachta, agus chomh fada is a fheicim féin tháinig feabhas ar chúrsaí tionsclaíochta sa Ghaeltacht.  Má thógaimid feilméireacht éisc, mheall Údarás na Gaeltachta isteach Carrolls Industries, agus tá beagnach fiche milliún punt infheistithe ag Carrolls in gConamara, agus tá gar do chéad go leith jab in áit nach raibh jab ar bith.  Is é Údarás na Gaeltachta an chéad dream a lean ar aghaidh le feilméireacht éisc.  Agus murach iad tá mé ag ceapadh nach mbeadh mórán cainte ar fheilméireacht éisc, mórán áiteacha eile sa tír.  Ar an mbealach sin tá an buíochas ag dul dóibh, mar lean siad ar aghaidh leis nuair nach raibh an faisean sin ann.  Ní raibh an faisean ann airgead a chur isteach ann, agus rinne an tÚdarás infheistíocht ann. Rinne siad go leor trialacha ann agus, cinnte, fuair siad go leor cúnaimh ó Carrolls agus a leithéid.  Ní amháin sin ach tá neart cúnaimh le fáil ag muintir na háite féin, agus tá roinnt fheilméireacht éisc ann ag daoine as an áit, cé go bhuil sé an-chostasach na feilméireachtaí éisc seo a bhunú, mar tógann sé an t-uafás airgid.</P>
    <P>Mar sin, ag leanacht ar aghaidh leis sin, an t-aon rud amháin a d'iarrfainn ar an Aire ná go gcinnteodh Údarás na Gaeltachta go ndéanfaidh Carrolls agus na comhlachtaí eile go bhfuil feilméirachtaí eisc acu an phróiseáil sa Ghaeltacht féin, ar thaobh na farraige a dtugtar an t-iasc amach aisti.  Mar i ndeireadh na dála is ansin atá na jabanna. Tá jabanna próiseála ann agus jabanna eile, agus ba cheart an tionscal a bhrú ar aghaidh.  Tá rud amháin a ba mhaith liom a iarraidh ar an Aire dá bhféadfadh sé: tá go leor cainte faoi thurasóireacht i <Col N="1337" /> gceantair Ghaeltachta le roinnt blianta anuas.  I mo thuairim phearsanta féin, agus anseo i gContae na Gaillimhe go mórmhór, mar níl mise ag trácht ar na Gaeltachtaí eile, níl Bord Fáilte ag déanamh a gcion ar son na nGaeltachtaí.  Má thógann tú Conamara, tá Conamara ina dhá leath.  Tá an Ghaeltacht ann agus tá an Ghalltacht ann.  Mar sin, d'iarrfainn go gcuirfí brú ar Bord Fáilte nó ar a laghad, b'fhéidir, an chumhacht sin a thabhairt do Roinn na Gaeltachta féin. Mar tá feidhmeannaigh ansin ag Roinn na Gaeltachta atá ag plé le comharchumainn, atá ag plé leis na daoine áitiúla agus cleachtadh maith acu air sin.</P>
    <P>Maidir le cúrsaí oideachais chomh maith céanna, tugadh cúnamh mór le roinnt blianta anuas, go mórmhór do mhuintir an oileáin, agus lean an tAire ar aghaidh leis sin.  Le gairid cuireadh os cionn céad míle punt isteach do mhuintir an oileáin chun cead a thabhairt do ghasúir óga timpeall an oileáin oideachas a fháil ó trí bliana amach, rud nach raibh ar fáil cheana.  Cuireadh go leor naiscoileanna ar bun ar fud Ghaeltacht Chonamara, go mórmhór i gceantar an oileáin, agus tá an rud seo á leathnú amach ag muintir an oileáin, ní amháin i gceantar an oileáin ach i gceantar Chonamara frína chéile.  Agus sa mhéid sin tá an buíochas arís ag dul do Údarás na Gaeltachta, mar is iad a mheall isteach Van Leer le hinfheistíocht mhór le roinnt blianta anuas, agus tá an infheistíocht sin ag leanacht ar aghaidh bliain i ndiaidh bliana.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an Seanadóir McCormack daoine ag imeacht as an tír le dhá bhliain.  Nuair a chloiseann tú daoine ag caint shílfeá gur imigh gach uile dhuine as an tír seo le dhá bhliain.  Tá an deacracht seo againne lena seacht nó ocht mbliana.  Tá daoine ag imeacht as an tír seo le deich mbliana.  Ó tháinig an Rialtas seo isteach, ar a laghad tá dóchas ag na daoine.  Tá dóchas ag muintir na Gaeltachta go bhfuil rud éigin ag tarlú.  Go dtí seo bhí an dóchas agus an croí imithe as na daoine agus trí chúnamh ó Údarás na Gaeltachta tá an croí ag teacht ar ais sna daoine arís.  Tá sé ag teacht ar ais sna tionscail.  Mar a chonaic tú le gairid, tá <Col N="1338" /> Telemara ar an gCeathrú Rua.  Tá beagnach dhá chéad daoine ag obair ann, daoine a rugadh agus a tógadh sa cheantar. Is tionscal é sin den chéad scoth, tionscal a bhfuil baint ag an oiread sin i nGaillimh leis, agus is tionscal é a sheasfaidh agus is tionscal é nach rachfaidh isteach i dtrualliú ná a leithéidí.  Bíonn go leor cainte agus a leithéid de sin maidir leis an bhfeilméireacht éisc.  mar sin, ba mhaith an tAire a mholadh as an méid atá déanta ag Údarás na Gaeltachta le roinnt blianta, agus an cúnamh sin freisin ó Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Tá mé ag ceapadh go n-oibríonn an dá dhream chomh maith agus is féidir ar son mhuintir na Gaeltachta, agus táimid buíoch díobh.</P>

      <P>Táimse i gcoinne an Bhille seo, in ainneoin na gcúiseanna atá tugtha dúinn ag an Aire.  Tuigim go bhfuil rudaí le rá ar thaobh an Bhille, go mbeidh níos mó daoine ag teacht amach, deirtear, má bhíonn an dá thoghchán ar an lá céanna, agus is maith an rud é sin. Faoi mar a thuigim, ní raibh ach thart timpeall ar chaoga faoin gcéad ag vótáil an t-am deireanach.  Glacaim leis sin mar phointe.</P>
      <P>Táim níos amhrasaí maidir leis an bpointe ar chostais.  Ní thuigim cad iad na costais atá i gceist.  An bhfuil aon chuntas fíor déanta ar na costais?  An bhféadfadh an tAire figiúir a thabhairt dúinn?  Agus in aon chás, faoi mar a aontóidh an tAire, ní féidir praghas a chur ar an daonlathas.  I mo thuairimse, dá mhinice a vótálann daoine is ea is fearr. Dá mhinice a tharlaíonn toghchán is ea is fearr.  Mar is iad na toghcháin fuil agus croí an daonlathais.</P>
      <P>Tá pointe eile luaite ansin ag an Aire maidir le scoileanna.  Dá mbeadh an dá thoghchán ar an lá céanna b'ionann sin agus a rá nach mbeadh aon ghá leis na scoileanna a dhúnadh do lá faoi leith. Ach nach mbeadh laethanta saoire an tsamhraidh ag teacht isteach go luath in aon chás, agus nach mbeadh go leor ama idir mí Meithimh agus mí Meán Fómhair, abraimis, chun úsáid a bhaint as na scoileanna agus iad a bheith folamh ag an am sin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pé scéal é, na cúiseanna go léir á gcur <Col N="1339" /> le chéile ní théann siad go mór i bhfeidhm ormsa mar chúiseanna i gcomparáid leis na cúiseanna atá le ríomh i gcoinne an Bhille, dar liom.  Mar is é an rud is mó a chuireann isteach ormsa ná go bhfuil gach seans, má bhíonn an dá thoghchán ann ar an lá céanna, go gcaillfear ar fad cúrsaí na Gaeltachta i gcomhthéacs na díospóireachta níos leithne ar thoghcháin na hEorpa.  In ainneoin na lochtanna atá ar an Údarás, agus is cuimhin liom go maith nuair a bunaíodh an tÚdarás agus nuair a bhí an Bille ag dul tríd an Teach seo idir an dá linn, go raibh díomá orainn maidir le hoibriú an Údaráis, agus nílimid róshásta le ballraíocht an Údaráis agus mar sin de, ach é sin go léir a bheith ráite, tá an tÚdarás tábhachtach; tá na toghcháin seo an-tábhachtach.  i mo thuairimse tá na toghcháin seo i bhfad Éireann níos tábhachtaí ná na toghcháin a bheidh ar siúl do Pharlaimint na hEorpa, nó sin a deir Bunreacht na hÉireann ach go háirithe, go bhfuil an Ghaeilge agus cúrsaí na Gaeltachta níos tábhachtaí ná cúrsaí Pharlaimint na hEorpa.</P>
    <P>Ní bheidh seans dá laghad ag muintir na Gaeltachta féin na ceisteanna seo a phlé i gceart má bhíonn siad gafa ag an am céanna leis na ceisteanna Eorpacha. Tá a fhios againn féin agus tá a fhios ag an saol Fodhla gur chóir fadhbanna na Gaeltachta a phlé díreach ag an am seo, mar is am práinneach é don Ghaeltacht. Tá an Ghaeltacht in am an ghátair.  Tá géarchéim sa Ghaeltacht, agus ní aon áibhéil a rá go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht i mbaol báis.  Tá an Ghaeltacht cráite ag an imirce, ag an dífhostaíocht, agus tá labhairt na teanga féin ag imeacht go tapa, faoi mar is eol do gach éinne.  Tá deacrachtaí eile ann chomh maith, deacrachtaí eile a bhaineann le drochbhóithre agus fadhbanna tionsclaíochta.</P>
    <P>Ceist mhór na laethanta seo ná ceist Theilfís na Gaeltachta, ceist a d'ardaigh an Taoiseach féin agus ceist a bhaineann go dlúth le todhchaí na Gaeltachta. Ansin, faoi mar atá ráite ag an mbeirt Seanadóirí a chuaigh romham, tá ceisteanna faoi leith ag baint leis na hoileáin, oileáin na Gaeltachta.  Mar sin, tríd is tríd <Col N="1340" /> is é atá i gceist anseo, sa bhliain seo 1989, ná todhchaí na Gaeltachta ar fad.  Cad tá i ndán don Ghaeltacht?  Sin í an cheist mhór.  Ní bheidh seans dá laghad ag muintir na Gaeltachta na ceisteanna práinneacha sin a phlé, mar a deirim, má tá ualach mór poiblíochta na toghcháin Eorpacha ag brú orthu ag an am céanna. Ní hé amháin gurb iad muintir na Gaeltachta a bheidh thíos leis an socrú seo, má chuirtear an Bille seo i bhfeidhm, ach muintir na hÉireann trí chéile.  Mar baineann an Ghaeltacht, cúrsaí na Gaeltachta agus leas na Gaeltachta leis an bpobal chomh maith.  Arís, ní bheidh seans ag muintir na hÉireann éisteacht leis an díospóireacht, mar ní bheidh spás sna nuachtáin, ní bheidh am ar an raidió nó ar an teilifís, chun na cúrsaí seo a phlé. Mar sin, a Chathaoirligh, deirim gur céim síos don Ghaeltacht, céim síos don Ghaeilge, agus buille don daonlathas áitiúil an Bille seo, agus táim go láidir ar fad ina choinne.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá ar an ábhar seo.  Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille gearr seo atá againn ach Bille tábhachtach chomh maith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My contribution will be a very brief one.  I am prompted to speak for two reasons.  First of all, I come from County Meath and even if Meath is only part of a constitutency comprising also Galway and Mayo, nevertheless I think it is an important one and I am glad and proud also that we have in the Gaeltacht area in Rathcarn, County Meath, and also in Baile Gib a considerable number of people for whom the Irish language is the daily spoken language.  I have said before in this House that in colloquial terms the Irish language is a dead duck.  On reflection I think perhaps I exaggerated slightly.  The Irish language may not be a corpse but it is only saved from being a corpse by virtue of the fact that over a long period and on many occasions artificial respiration has been applied.  I have no doubt &mdash; and it pains me to say this &mdash; that the life support machine will not be disconnected at any time.  Unfortunately, we do not have the <Col N="1341" /> kind of language we would want; it is not widespread; it is not spoken; we have a considerable number of enthusiastic people who work hard and make sacrifices for it but beyond that the best anyone can hope for is a bilingual situation where Irish will be spoken in conjunction with English.  I doubt if we will ever reach that stage.</P>
    <P>By and large, all this has arisen because of mistakes in the past.  There was enthusiasm; there was the foundation to build on and I think it was abused.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to make up for lost time.  I am not a prophet and I hope I am wrong.  I have a great love for the Irish language and the Irish culture.</P>
    <P>There are many areas on which we could speak on this Bill.  It is sensible to combine the polls in the way that it is being done under this Bill.  Regarding the question Senator McCormack asked, I think the Minister has stated that this will apply to future Údarás elections also, not just to this particular one.</P>
    <P>In his contribution the Minister stated that in section 91 of the principal Act there is a saving of costs.  This is important. It is not and should not be the primary consideration.  In this regard there are many people who would point out and have pointed out over the years that if it were simply a question of keeping down costs the unemployed should be brought more into play at election times. It is unfortuante that this has not been done.</P>
    <P>The Gaeltacht Industries Act was passed in 1957 and Gaeltarra Éireann came into being on 1 April 1958.  The Gaeltacht (Amendment) Bill was passed in 1971.  The Údarás na Gaeltachta Act was passed in 1979 and Údarás was established on 1 January 1980.  Its primary objective was to give employment in Gaeltacht areas, to build on the culture and crafts of the indigenous Gaeltacht areas and to some extent this has been a success.  Like Senator McCormack and Senator O'Connor, the people of Connemara would be in a better position to deal with that than I would be.</P>
    <P>An tÚdarás includes 13 members and the chairman and five others are <Col N="1342" /> appointed by the Minister, so that seven members are elected.  In reality it seems to me that we are talking here about the election of seven members, seven important members, I agree.  Considerable funds have been advanced to Gaeltarra Éireann and to an Údarás. They own a considerable area of land and also industrial floor space.  They have given employment over the years to many thousands of people.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Irish language, my primary concern in this situation is that the direct costs associated with the Irish language development in the period 1980-84 were £377,814, inclusive, or £4.3 for every £1,000 of total funds received in that period.  This is an appropriate time for someone to say that perhaps more funds should be allocated to the Irish language because while I feel it is important that the culture would be preserved with the indigenous industries and crafts of those areas, this can only be done in conjunction with the preservation of the Irish language.  As I have said, the Irish language is dying.  Until recently I had been optimistic that because of the interest of so many people and because of the importance of the Irish language we would make progress, but I have no doubt that we are going backwards.  I feel that more money could be allocated to it. I would make a plea that, in conjunction with anything that is done for the Gaeltacht areas, funds would be allocated to help dedicated people to save the Irish language.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to say that while I am most pessimistic with regard to the Irish language I hope that the future will prove me wrong.  I welcome this short but important Bill.</P>

    <P>I will speak only in Irish on this Bill fully aware of the fact that that guarantees that not a word of what I say will pass beyond this Chamber to the public. I will do it as a protest against the absence of simultaneous translation services in this House, an absence which underlines <Col N="1343" /> the extraordinary ambivalence &mdash; and I use ambivalence so as not to use the word hypocrisy &mdash; about the Irish language, that it is impossible to speak in this House in the first official language without excluding the vast majority of those who listen.</P>

Agus bhíodh na &ldquo;fisheries systems&rdquo; agus na &ldquo;fisheries markets&rdquo; is mó san Eoraip againn.  Tá siad tugtha againn do dhaoine eile mar phraghas dúinn dul isteach sa Chómhargadh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sin ceann de na fáthanna go bhfuil orainn anois brath ar fheirmeoireacht éisc chun déanamh suas a dhéanamh ara bhfuil caillte againn agus a bhfuil caite siar againn agus a bhfuil caite uainn.  Tá a leithéid agus a mhéad sin seafóide ar siúl faoi Ghaeltacht agus faoi Ghaeilge sa tír seo agus nach gcuirfeadh an Bille seo mórán de ionadh orm.  Ní chuireann sé ionadh orm go bhféadfadh le hAire <Col N="1344" /> Rialtais a bhaineann le páirtí a dhéanann a mhéad sin cainte faoi Ghaeilge agus faoi Ghaeltacht Bille a chur isteach mar seo agus gan tuiscint dá laghad a bheith aige faoin damáiste a d'fhéadfadh an Bille seo a dhéanamh do fhéin-aitheantas mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Nach mbeidh an píosta beag dá chuid féin sa saol atá bainte amach acu le blianta beaga anuas tríd an Údarás, nach mbeidh sé sin ar fáil acu, ach go bpléascfaí é ar fad agus go gcailfí é ar fad faoi lasta mór cainte, lasta mór focal, toghchán amháin eile agus b'fhéidir dhá thogchán eile.  Seans go mbeidh toghchán ginearálta, toghchán na hEorpa agus toghchán do Údarás na Gaeltachta ar siúl ag an am céanna.  Nach náireach an rud é gur mar sin a chaillfí todhchaí na Gaeltachta, deacrachtaí na Gaeltachta, muintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Ní hé sin le rá go bhfuil gach rud faoi Údarás na Gaeltachta i gceart.  Ach ní chabhraítear le todhchaí na Gaeltachta, le bród agus dínit mhuintir na Gaeltachta, ós rud é nach bhfuil Aire na Gaeltachta, an tAire Rialtais atá freagrach as an nGaeltacht, sin é an Taoiseach féin, sásta fiú ceist amháin as Gaeilge a fhreagairt sa Dáil ó thosaigh an Dáil seo.  Sin masla mór do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ó dhuine a bhíonn ag rá agus ag ligean air cé chomh mór is atá spéis aige i gceist na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta.  Is mór an trua é nach mbeidh an seans ag muintir na Gaeltachta na ceisteanna seo a phlé ina n-aonar gan iad a bheith ceangailte suas le ceistenna eile faoi impiriúlachas na hEorpa sa tír seo.</P>
    <P>Tá rudaí eile a chaithfear a rá.  Níor mhaith liom go mbeimis ag ligean orainn go bhfuil Udarás na Gaeltachta rómhaith nó ró-thábhachtach.  Is é atá ag teastáil sa Ghaeltacht ná féinrialú, feinrialú taobh istigh den tír seo.  Ní píosa beag de fhéinrialtas faoi fhorbairt thionsclaíochta agus cúpla rud eile, ach féinrialú ar fad ina scriosfaí Roinn na Gaeltachta agus go ndéanfaí as Rialtas na Gaeltachta státseirbhís do fhéinrialtas na Gaeltachta. Níl cead ag muintir na Gaeltachta smacht a bheith acu ar cheisteanna pleanála, mar shampla.  Cuid de na Gaeltachtaí go speisialta, i gCiarraí, mar a <Col N="1345" /> bhfuil muintir na Gaeltachta ina mionlach beag sa chontae, is beag tionchar atá ag muintir na Gaeltachta ar cheisteanna pleanála an chontae.  Tá siad caite amach, beagnach, ar imeall an chontae, gan mórán tionchair acu, gan ach trí nó ceithre cinn de bhaill ar Chomhairle Chontae Chiarraí, agus na rudaí is tábhachtaí, na rudaí is mó a thugann &ldquo;identity&rdquo; do Ghaeltacht Chiarraí, ní fhéadfadh comhairle chontae chomh mór le Comhairle Chontae Chiarraí aird agus aire agus tábhacht, agus an tábhacht atá ag teastáil uathu siúd, a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ansin.</P>
    <P>Mar sin, ó thaobh cheisteanna pleanála, pleanáil ó thaobh thógáil tithe, pleanáil ó thaobh thithe ósta agus na ceisteanna pleanála a thagann trí na hAchtanna Pleanála, ba chóir gur faoi stiúradh mhuintir na Gaeltachta amháin a bheadh na rudaí siúd, agus go mbeadh ar an mBord Pleanála fealsúnacht agus dearcadh mhuintir na Gaeltachta a thabhairt chun cinn dá mba rud é go raibh siad ag éisteacht le hachainí agus gearáin faoi shocruithe pleanála.  Níl sé acu faoi láthair. Níl féinrialtas ag muintir na Gaeltachta faoin gceist sin.  Mar an gcéanna, níl aon smacht acu ar chaighdeán na mbóithre sna Gaeltachtaí.  Níl éinne dáiríre ag éisteacht le gearán mhuintir na Gaeltachta le beagnach fiche bliain anuas faoi cheisteanna chaighdeán na mbóithre sna Gaeltachtaí ar fad.  Tá an &ldquo;bumpersticker&rdquo; le feiceáil ar fud Chonamara: &ldquo;Scriosadh an carr seo ar bhóithre Chonamara&rdquo;, agus níl ansin ach an fhírinne ar fad.  Scriosadh na mílte carranna ar bhóithre Chonamara, agus scriosfar a thuilleadh carranna ar bhóithre Chonamara, os rud é go bhfuil na poill sna bóithre ag dul i méid i gcónaí agus na bóithre beagnach imithe ar fad, agus gan ach amháin líontan poll ón nGaillimh go dtí an Cheathrú Rua, meascán ar fad de phoill sna bóithre agus gan mórán bóithre fágtha ann.  Agus tá sé mar an gcéanna i gCiarraí, agus dá mba rud é gur faoi mhuintir na Gaeltachta a bhí an cheist sin, ní ghlacfaí leis.</P>
    <P>Dá mba rud é gur tugadh an deontas airgid do fhéinrialtas na Gaeltachta, chomh mór leis an méid airgid a thugtar <Col N="1346" /> do Údarás na Gaeltachta agus an chuid sin de chaiteachas airgid na gcomhairlí contae a bheadh oiriúnach do na Gaeltachtaí, agus féinrialtas do na Gaeltachtaí a thabhairt faoi, bheadh i bhfad níos mó ar siúl acu.  Tá sé náireach gurb as Baile Átha Cliath atá córas oideachais na Gaeilge sna Gaeltachtaí á stiuradh.  Ba chóir gur faoi mhuintir na Gaeltachta amháin a bheadh na socruithe siúd faoi oideachas dá bpáistí féin.  Is iad muintir na Gaeltachta a thuigeann fadhbanna na Gaeltachta, a thuigeann a bhfuil ag teastáil i gcomhair fhorbairt na Gaeltachta, a thuigeann cén saghas caighdeán múinte Béarla a bheadh ag teastáil do leanaí Gaeltachta agus cén saghas caighdeán múinte Gaeilge a bheadh ag teastáil ó leanaí Gaeltachta chomh maith.  An dearcadh i mBaile Átha Cliath gurbh ionann leanbh Gaeltachta agus leanbh Galltachta ó thaobh an churaclam Gaeilge agus Béarla, is dearcadh é atá ag déanamh an t-uafás damáiste do oideachas sna Gaeltachtaí agus sa Ghalltacht.  Ba chóir go mbeadh an córas oideachais sna Gaeltachtaí faoi smacht agus faoi chumhacht mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Ba chóir, mar a dúras, go mbeadh féinrialú ag muintir na Gaeltachta.  Ba chóir go mbeadh sé mar an gcéanna ó thaobh chúrsaí sláinte, go mbeadh siad siúd faoi smacht mhuintir na Gaeltachta, go mbeadh rialtas dá gcuid féin acu a bheadh freagrach do mhuintir na Gaeltachta as todhchaí na nGaeltachtaí.</P>
    <P>Tá forbairt thionsclaíochta faoi smacht ag Údarás na Gaeltachta, agus tá sé ráite ag cuid mhaith daoine go bhfuil jab réasúnta maith ar siúl ag an Údarás sa bhealach sin.  Ach tá na rudaí eile tábhachtach chomh maith, mar ní eacnamaíocht atá sa Ghaeltacht ach pobal, pobal faoi leith atá ina mhionlach sa tír seo agus nach bhfuil aon chearta dá gcuid féin dáiríre acu.  Ba chóir go mbeadh cúrsaí craolacháin do na Gaeltachtaí faoi smacht ag muintir na Gaeltachta agus ní faoi stiúradh ag Radió Teilifís Bhaile Átha Cliath a thugann Radió Telefís Éireann orthu féin.  Ní ceart é sin, agus ní cóir é sin do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Níl aon fhianaise sa tír seo gur féidir le rialtas lárnach, rialtas tofa nó rialtas &ldquo;bureaucracy&rdquo;, <Col N="1347" /> cearta atá ag teastáil ó mhionlaigh imeallacha i dtír ar bith a thabhairt dóibh.</P>
    <P>Tá dílárnú ag teastáil sa tír seo, agus b'é an áit ab fhearr tosú le dílárnú, mar sin, ná sna Gaeltachtaí, an mionlach is éascaí a aithint ná muintir na Gaeltachta sna Gaeltachtaí siúd a labhraíonn Gaeilge, agus, mar a dúras féin, bheadh sé thar a bheith simplí státseirbhís a thabhairt nó seirbhís riaracháin a thabhairt do fhéinrialtas mar sin, trí Roinn na Gaeltachta a dhúnadh agus na státseirbhísigh atá i Roinn na Gaeltachta a chur ar fáil do Rialtas na Gaeltachta mar chóras riaracháin is córas státseirbhíse.  Ach ina ionad sin, is é atá ar siúl sa Bhille seo ná an smacht lárnach ar Údarás na Gaeltachta agus ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta a leathnú ar fad.  Ní bheidh cead, agus níl cead ag muintir na Gaeltachta nó ag Údarás na Gaeltachta ceisteanna faoi thoghcháin sna Gaeltachtaí a shocrú dóibh féin.</P>
    <P>Is é an tAire Comhshaoil anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath &mdash; agus níl mé ag caint faoin Aire Comhshaoil faoi láthair, ach cuid mhaith de na hAirí Comhshaoil a bhíodh ann, ní raibh siad riamh sna Gaeltachtaí&mdash;a bheidh ag stiúradh toghchán do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Beidh an tAire ag éisteacht, b'fhéidir, le státseirbhíseach, am nó dhó, a thuigeann ceist na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta, ach is Aire Rialtais nach dtuigeann ceisteanna na Gaeltachta is mó a bheidh freagrach as toghchán don Údarás lag atá ag muintir na Gaeltachta faoi láthair.  Is é atá ann ná ceisteanna Gaeilge agus ceisteanna Gaeltachta a bhrú anuas sa chaoi is go gcaillfí ceisteanna Gaeilge agus ceisteanna Gaeltachta agus ceisteanna agus príomhachtaí phobal na Gaeltachta a chur á mbrú anuas agus iad a chailliúint faoi lasta mór cainte faoin Eoraip agus, b'fhéidir, faoin Dáil chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Más rud é nach dtuigeann an Rialtas nó, mar a bhí sé sa Dáil, Fine Gael chomh maith, cad tá ar siúl do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, caithfear a thuiscint nach d'aon ghnó a tharla sé gur mar sin atá sé.  Caithfimid a thuiscint go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht briste suas i dtrí pháirt anois.  Tá an FhíorGhaeltacht ann, agus tá sí beag go leor <Col N="1348" /> anois.  Tá an Bhreac-Ghaeltacht ann.  Tá, chomh maith leis sin, tá an BhréagGhaeltacht ann, tá sí ann i mbailte beaga a thugann Gaeltachtaí orthu féin, nach labhraítear Gaeilge iontu in aon chor. Ceann amhain, cóngarach go leor do Chorcaigh, a thugann Gaeltacht air féin, agus mar atá a fhios agam, chuaigh ball tofa de Údarás na Gaeltachta chun cainte ann.  Labhair sé as Gaeilge agus iarradh air labhairt as Béarla, os rud é go raibh daoine i láthair i gceartlár na Gaeltachta nár thuig Gaeilge, agus tugann na daoine siúd muintir agus pobal Gaeltachta orthu féin.  Is iad pobal na Bréag-Ghaeltachta siúd a bheidh ag dul amach ag vótáil i dtoghcháin na hEorpa nó i dtoghchán ginearálta má tá an dá thoghchán ar siúl le chéile, agus beidh siad ag caitheamh vótaí ar son páirtithe.  Ina measc siúd beidh an toghchán taibhseach seo do Údarás na Gaeltachta caillte ar fad, dofheicthe ar fad, gan ceist na mbóithre, droch-bhóithre, gnáthchúraimí ghnáthmhuintir na Gaeltachta, caillte ar fad sa tuile mhór focal a chloisfear nuair atá an dá thoghchán, más dhá thoghchán atá le bheith ann, ar siúl.  Caillfear muintir na Gaeltachta agus caillfear tábhacht na Gaeltachta ina measc sin.</P>
    <P>Caithfidh mé a rá go gceapaim nach éascaíocht riaracháin atá taobh thiar de seo, nó ceist an airgid.  Is é atá taobh thiar de ná go bhfuil na páirtithe móra, idir Fhianna Fáil agus Fhine Gael, scanraithe roimh mhuintir na Gaeltachta, os rud é go bhfuil a thuilleadh eolais i gcónaí ag teacht chugainn nach bhfuil muintir na Gaeltachta sásta vótáil, de ghnáth, ar son na bpáirtithe móra.  Tá muintir Chonamara tar éis fear mór láidir a thoghadh nach bhfuil baint aige le páirtí ar bith. Dhein muintir na Mumhan iarracht an rud céanna a dhéanamh, agus cé nár lean mo sheanchara mar a cheapas féin bá chóir dó leanúint, toghadh é mar ionadaí neamhspleách.  Is é mo thuairim go bhfuil duine mar an gcéanna i dTír Chonaill chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Ní thaitníonn sin leis na páirtithe móra, go meadh gnáthmhuintir na Gaeltachta ag éirí beagáinín, mar a déarfá as Béarla, &ldquo;stroppy&rdquo; faoin todhchaí atá ann do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus ag rá go <Col N="1349" /> bhfuil sé níos tábhachtaí go mbeadh daoine ann atá sásta seasamh ar son mhuintir na Gaeltachta, ná daoine atá sásta seasamh ar son páirtí amháin nó páirtí eile.  Agus nílim ag lochtú nó ag maslú na ndaoine eile atá ar Údarás na Gaeltachta. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil daoine ar Údarás na Gaeltachta ó na páirtithe, atá sásta obair, agus obair go dian, ar son na Gaeltachta, ach tá sé soiléir go bhfuil muintir na Gaeltachta ag smaoineamh faoi dhaoine neamhspleácha, daoine atá bunaithe sna Gaeltachtaí, gurb é an t-aon suim atá acu ná forbairt na Gaeltachta mar ionadaithe at Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Is í an tslí is fusa chun daoine mar siúd a choimeád amach ná an toghchán do Údarás na Gaeltachta a mheascadh le toghchán eile ina mbeidh ceisteanna páirtithe chomh fada chun cinn agus go gcaillfear gnáthcheisteanna forbartha Gaeltachta agus Gaeilge as sin.  Sin an fáth go bhfuil an Bille seo náireach.  Tá sé náireach os rud é go dtaispeánann sé cé chomh caillte is atá fealsúnacht an Rialtais seo faoi fhéinrialtas do phobal ar bith, faoi dhaonlathas áitiúil go speisialta. Cén fáth, mar sin, nach dtógaimid na toghcháin go léir le chéile agus go mbíonn toghcháin na h-Eorpa, toghchán ginearálta agus tochchán Údarás na Gaeltachta agus toghchán don rialtas áitiúil ar siúl ag an am céanna?  Bheadh sé i bhfad níos éascaí, bheadh sé i bhfad níos éifeachtaí, ach ní bheadh sé ró-dhaonlathach, mar go gcaillfí ceisteanna áitiúla idir ceisteanna tíre agus ceisteanna Eorpacha.  Sin an fáth go ndéantar iarracht, de ghnáth, toghcháin a scaradh óna chéile sa chaoi is go mbeidh daoine ábalta smaoineamh faoi cheisteanna faoi leith gan a bheith ceangailte suas lena lán ceisteanna eile.</P>
    <P>Is é atá ar siúl anseo na gach rud a tharraingt le chéile agus gach rud a mheascadh suas.  Is é a tharlóidh as ná truailliú an Údaráis féin leis an mbealach is measa agus an taobh is measa de pholaitíocht pháirtí.  Níl aon rud agam i mo fhealsúnacht pholaitíochta atá i gcoinne pháirtithe polaitíochta, ach tá áiteacha agus tá áiteacha ann nach n-oireann do ghnáth-pholaitíocht pháirtithe.  Is ceann amháin díobh siúd Údarás na Gaeltachta <Col N="1350" /> agus de ghnáth, i mo thuairimse, cuid mhaith de ghnáth-rialtais áitiúla.</P>
    <P>Is náiriú an phobail a rá le muintir na Gaeltachta nach bhfuil siad sách tábhachtach chun toghchán dá gcuid féin a bheith acu, a phléifí sa tír ar fad i gcaoi is go mbeadh ceist na Gaeilge agus ceist na Gaeltachta á bplé ar na meáin chumarsáide agus sna meáin chumarsáide.  Ina ionad sin, caillfear ceist na Gaeilge agus ceist na Gaeltachta sna toghcháin eile. Taispeánann sé neamhshuim an Rialtais agus Fhine Gael mar a sheas siad agus gur ghlac siad leis an mBille seo sa Dáil faoi cheist na Gaeilge agus faoi cheist na Gaeltachta.  Ag an deireadh is é atá taobh thiar de ná go bhfuil siad scanraithe roimh mhuintir na Gaeltachta, agus iad ag taispeáint go bhfuil siad ag éirí neamhspleách ó shean-smacht na bpáirtithe móra agus go bhfuil siad ag iarraidh deireadh a chur leis.  Tá mé i gcoinne an Bhille seo, agus beidh mé ag vótáil ina choinne.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Chathaoirleach, I am sad to say that my six months in the Ballymoney Technical College studying the Irish language does not qualify me to speak on this Bill with the same eloquence in the idiom which would be appropriate to it, as does Senator Brendan Ryan.  Nevertheless, I feel it is important to say a few brief words from the standpoint that I would represent in this House with regard to what I see as the value of the Gaeltacht and the value of treasuring the very precious things that are preserved in our heritage through the medium of the Gaelic or Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A year ago I was travelling the road beyond Cashla in Connemara and I picked up two very delightful young people who lived on a nearby island.  I was saddened when they told me, not so very many years ago when they visited Galway speaking the only language which they knew at that time, their own ancient Gaelic language they felt people looked down on them as primitive.  Rather the same way as recently in my own hospital when I tried to get some well water to replace the stuff that comes out of the taps in our town, a nurse told me that not so many years ago when she was a child <Col N="1351" /> she would not have dared mention at school that she got water from a well because they would have thought she was living in a primitive way.</P>
    <P>We have moved beyond that, and have moved very rapidly, because we realise there is something precious in preserving what has been marginalised by the forces of centralism and gigantism.  It is particularly for that reason that I see marginal and minority languages and cultures are of vital importance in a world where, because of our new technology, there is a great tendency to trample on the feelings and endeavours of those who are different, and to try to create a uniformity of expression, of concept and of people. That spells disaster because, as anyone knows, the essence and one of the great central features of a healthy society is the preservation of difference.  It is in that context, therefore, that I feel the preservation and the development of the Gaelic language as something that relates us not only to our local roots but also to our remote past and is, in fact, the link with that very remote past that we need to treasure, to respect and to understand its significance.</P>
    <P>One of the problems of course is that we have tried to politicise the language and have tried to ram it down people's throats for all sorts of different reasons. It is natural that there has been a reaction to what has happened to the Irish language in the early part of the last century. At this juncture one should at least acknowledge that Daniel O'Connell who has often been blamed for what has happened was, in effect, trying to do the Irish people a service in trying to better them by ensuring that they would at least have a language with which they could relate to a wider world and be able to advance themselves in that world.  The mistake was the failure to make a distinction between the need to have a local language as well as a global language &mdash; a local language to ensure that we are confident in our own culture and a global language to ensure that we can enrich our own culture by interaction with that of others.</P>
    <P>The Gaeltacht is a very precious part <Col N="1352" /> of the Irish inheritance.  The tragedy of it is that it is, in fact, a certificate in many ways of what was hoped for it.  That has been largely due to the very strong cultural penetration from without and also the inability to make the language live as something that is enjoyed for its own sake by the people.  Fortunately, there is a revival of an approach to the language which, hopefully, spells out some hope for the future.</P>
    <P>No more is that true than in Northern Ireland today where people, because of strife, struggle and conflict and because of the need to look back to roots and to establish a new sense of security and a new understanding of where we come from, how we could relate to and what we have in common, not only in the minority community but even in the majority community, are seeking a knowledge of the ancient language and trying to see how that relates us to our roots, and they are not all in Ireland.  As everyone knows, the Celtic language that came from Ireland crossed the Irish sea both to the Isle of Man and the west coast of Scotland.</P>
    <P>We have a right to be different, particularly as we move into the new Europe. The new Europe will be a disaster if it is at best a confederation of nation state capitals and at worst a new form of centralism where all is controlled through the Commission in Brussels.  The new Europe offers an exciting prospect if we see it as a federation of autonomous regions and the way in whch we can recognise those regions most clearly is in their history, customs, culture and, above all, in what is preserved in all of these through their ancient languages.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see a Bill concerned with the Gaeltacht.  I would just question, in the context of what is happening in regard to the steamroller effect of centralism and gigantism, if we have all these elections on the one day, are we in any way diminishing the importance and the impact of an election in the Gaeltacht itself?  With that question I will leave the Minister to respond.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Ag éisteacht leis an méid a bhí le rá ag an Seanadóir Robb. <Col N="1353" /> Caithfidh mé a rá nach n-aontaím in aon chor leis.  Even though I understand very clearly the very point that he might make he, is not from the Gaeltacht, and I do not say that in a patronising way. The Minister, like myself, being from that area of the country knows better.  I would have to say to the Minister that the statement &ldquo;I am satisfied that there is no danger that the Údarás elections will be overshadowed by the European campaign&rdquo; is the greatest understatement I have heard since I came into this House. It is the greatest cynical misuse of language that I have dealt with.  May I assure my colleague, Senator Robb, there is not the slightest danger that the Údarás election will be overshadowed by the European election; the whole reasoning behind this Bill is just a cynical exercise to get the people of the Gaeltacht out to vote on that day because they are interested in the Údarás election and in the local elections and they will come out and vote.</P>
      <P>Of course, Fianna Fáil are hoping that people who will be coming to the ballot boxes anyway will also cast their votes in the European election.  It is reverse logic. this is an attempt to build a European campaign on the back of local politics and that is disgraceful.</P>
      <P>However, ceapaim go bhfuil taithí agus tuiscint mhaith ag an Aire agus ag an rialtas ar an méid atá ar siúl sna Gaeltachtaí. Ag an am céanna, nuair a bhíonn muintir na nGaeltachtaí ag iarraidh acmhainní ón Stát, go bhfuil an-ghanntanas tacaíochta ón Rialtas dóibh, agus nach bhfuil mé sásta go bhfuil aon rójab déanta ag an Taoiseach mar Aire Gaeltachta le cúpla bliain anuas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Táimse féin chun féachaint ar chúpla gné de shaol na Gaeltachta agus de ghnáthshaol na ndaoine, agus tá cúpla rud ráite agam le cúpla bliain anuas sa Teach seo, agus ba mhaith liom cúpla ceann díobh seo a athlua anois.  Mar shampla, anuraidh bhí an tAcht Craolacháin, an Wireless and Telegraphy Bill, againn sa Teach seo, agus ag an bpointe sin séard a bhí ar siúl againn agus séard a bhí a phlé againn ná an ceart ag an Rialtas chun ceadúnas a chur ar fáil dóibh <Col N="1354" /> siúd a bheadh sásta craolachán teilifíse agus raidió a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na tíre.  Ag an bpointe sin mhol mé leasú don Bhille, agus ba é an leasú a chuir mé os comhair an Tí an uair sin ná gur chóir don authority or whatever, that they should take into account, agus iad ag tabhairt amach ceadúnas, céatadán nó an codán sin den daonra a bhí sna Gaeltachtaí. Is é an rud a bhí i gceist agam ná gur chóir go mbeadh rogha ag muintir na nGaeltachtaí chomh maith agus a bheadh ag aon dream eile sa tír.  Nílim sásta go ndearnadh sin.  Táim sásta nach ndearnadh sin, agus tá an seanscéal arís againn, an scéal nach bhfuil a rogha ag muintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>I want to revert to English at this point, to deal also with the point raised by my colleague, Senator Robb, for the best of reasons.  I do not know if people in this House understand what it is like to be raised in the Irish language and then to find oneself in a milieu where Irish is not the spoken language, and to be made to feel inferior.  I went to school in such an area, in a breac Gaeltacht where half of my classmates were raised completely in Irish and the others in a mixture of English and Irish.  I know people from the Gaeltachtaí, who feel that they got a very raw deal from the State.  One friend of mine claims he never read an English novel until he went to third level education, because one was never put in front of him.  He bitterly resents that that part of his development was ignored.  I see the Senator from Galway finds this amusing. Senators from Galway should well understand that it is directed at people from big cities on the edges of Gaeltachtaí.</P>

      <P>In dealing with the type of problems that muintir na nGaeltachtaí have, caithfidh mé a rá anois gur bhuail mé leis an dearcadh sin dhá uair i mo shaol, nuair a chuaigh mé den chéad uair go dtí Valentia i mo chontae féin i gCiarraí, agus ar mo chéad turas go dtí Clifden i gConamara.  Ní dóigh liom gur bhuail mé riamh le dhá áit sa tír a bhí chomh gallda.  Cén fáth go bhfuil siad chomh gallda sin?  Tá siad chomh gallda sin, mar nuair a bhí an Ghaeilge mar ghnáth-theanga ag muintir na n-áiteacha sin they spoke English on a day-to-day basis, but the people who had money in Valentia and the people who were looked up to in the local community, were those English speakers in charge of bringing in the transatlantic cable and the telegraphy system there.  The same applies to Clifden. Mar sin, tá sé de shean-nós againn sa tír seo gurb iad lucht an airgeadais is mó a mbíonn tionchar acu ar ghnáthdhaoine. An rud atá i gceist agam agus an rud atá á phlé anseo agam ná gurb é sin an tábhacht a bhaineann le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta agus gurb é sin an tábhacht a bhaineann leis an obair atá ar siúl ag baill Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Táim anois chun píosa a thógáil as an Tuarascáil agus Cuntas do Údarás na Gaeltachta 1986:</P>
      <P>Tá contúirt áirithe don Ghaeilge, áfach, mar thoradh ar fhorbairt tionscail sa Ghaeltacht.  Aithnítear sin go soiléir agus tá céimeanna a nglacadh chun úsáid na teanga a láidriú sa tionscal agus spreagadh a thabhairt do na rudaí éagsúla a mbeidh tionchar dearfach acu ar thoil an phobail ina leith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are fine words.  I ndáiríre, if we look at the position of muintir na Gaeltachta; if we look at the whole milieu and background from which they come, cúrsaí tithíochta, mar shampla, tá feabhas ag teacht ar chúrsaí tithíochta sa Ghaeltacht le blianta beaga anuas anois, go mórmhór leis na deontais atá ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Ach ní thuigeann muintir na tíre go hiomlan, nó níor thuig siad, an gá a bhí i gcónaí ann le deontais mar sin a bheith ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, agus nuair a scríobhann daoine ar nós Frank McDonald agus <Col N="1356" /> daoine mar sin ar an gcóras tithíochta agus ar an nganntanas pleanála i gConamara agus in áiteacha mar sin ní thuigeann siad, go minic, an sórt rogha a bhí ag na daoine an uair sin.  Bhí an rogha acu fanacht sa chaoi ina rabhadar nó teach éigin nua a chur ar fáil dóibh féin. Is fíor, b'fhéidir, do Frank agus daoine mar sin nach bhfuil na tithe is áille sa tír sna Gaeltachtaí, agus níl siad sna Gaeltachtaí mar nach bhfuil airgead ag na daoine chun iad a thógáil.  Sin an fáth gur chóir dúinn gach tacaíocht a thabhairt do mhuintir na nGaeltachtaí.</P>
    <P>D'fhéadfainn an argóint sin faoi thithe do mhuintir na Gaeltachta a fhorbairt, ach tá i bhfad níos mó ná sin ann.  Tá gnéithe eile de shaol na Gaeltachta, cúrsaí oideachais, mar shampla.  Chuaigh mé féin ar scoil sa Bhreac-Ghaeltacht is dócha.  Chuaigh mé le daoine, mar a dúirt mé cheana, a tháining ón nGaeltacht. Ach sa dara leibhéal nó an tríú leibhéal, ní dóigh liom go raibh riamh agam téacsleabhar as Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>I learned Latin through Irish from an English textbook.  That is what we are asking people from the Gaeltacht to do. The public perception is that people living in the Gaeltacht get all sorts of grants and support but people from the Gaeltacht cannot even be educated through Irish.  They have difficulty finding some place where they can carry on their normal educative process through Irish. It is just not available.  Certainly, at third level, I did not have any Irish textbook, except for the Irish language.  Certainly the first part of my third level education was through Irish.  Physics, chemistry, Latin, or whatever it happened to be, was all done through Irish, working on English, Latin or English chemistry textbooks. That is still the case and it should be noted that that is still the case.  Agus ag tagairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus don ghá go mbeadh tacaíocht ann dóibh, níl tacaíocht acu do rudaí mar sin.</P>
    <P>Béarfaidh mé sampla eile don Aire. Tá an-fhorbairt timpeall na tíre faoi láthair do scoileanna lán-Ghaeilge.  Tá sé de riail ag an Roinn Oideachais múinteoir thar an ngnáth a thabhairt do na scoileanna sin tríd an tír i ngach áit ach sna <Col N="1357" /> Gaeltachtaí.  Na Gaeltachtaí atá ag iarraidh Gaeilge a fhorbairt agus a chur ar aghaidh, níl an seans céanna ag na scoileanna ansin is atá ag na scoileanna lán-Ghaeilge sa Ghalltacht.  An sórt tuisceana nó an sórt loighce a thugtar chun é sin a mhíniú ná go bhfuil Gaeilge ag muintir na Gaeltachta and that children from the Gaeltacht, coming to the local national school go bhfuil leor Gaeilge acu.  I make it my business to visit Gaeltacht schools quite regularly, and what I hear time and time again from teachers there, is how few of the four or five year olds coming to school nowadays have Gaeilge.  In other words, the school in the Gaeltacht atá ag iarraidh Gaeilge a chur ar fáil agus a chur ar aghaidh tá an jab céanna acu is atá ag na múinteoirí sa Ghalltacht.  What happens when the child comes home from school in the evening and turns on television?  An bhfuilimid dáiríre mar gheall ar chúrsaí Gaeilge?  An bhfuilimid dáiríre nuair atá sé á rá againn gur féidir leo filleadh abhaile agus go mbeadh sórt chomharsancht Ghaeilge nó Ghaeltachta nó Gaelach, ní fheadar cé acu sórt focail is fearr a úsáid ansin, nuair nach bhfuil, mar shampla, Teilifís na Gaeltachta ann.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil an argóint déanta agam ar son Teilifís na Gaeltachta cúpla uair cheana féin sa Teach, agus nílim ag dur tríd arís.</P>
    <P>It is important to underline yet again the way in which the people of the Gaeltacht have been betrayed by the Government on this issue.  I propose that when the local broadcasting licences are being given out if they are servicing a Gaeltacht area at least there should be a requirement that if there was a third of the population in the broadcasting area of the Gaeltacht a third of the broadcasting being done by that station should be in Irish or else allow for an alternative radio na Gaeltachta also.  That is not to say that I am not happy with the service provided by Radio na Gaeltachta.  Tá mé thar a bheith sásta leis.  Tá sé go hiontach ar fad an méid atá curtha ar fáil acu.  Ach an argóint atá á cur i láthair agam ná gur chóir go mbeadh an rogha ag muintir na Gaeltachta mar atá ag gach duine eile. <Col N="1358" /> We have denied them that right.  Caithfidh mé a rá nach pribhléid é ach ceart. Is mór an trua é, ach gach tacaíocht a thugtar do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, breathnaítear i gcónaí, agus tá an dearcadh ag muintir na Gaeltachta, go bhfuil sort pribhléide acu nach bhfuil ag daoine eile.  It is not a privilege: it is a right.  It is a right for them if we want them to develop in a cultúr Gaeltachta nó cultúr Gaeilge go mbeadh teilifís agus raidio Gaeltachta acu, oideachas trí Ghaeilge acu agus ar uile.</P>
    <P>Gan amhras, níos mó ná aon rud eile, is tábhachtach go mbeadh, féinmhuinín ag muintir na Gaeltachta, féinmhuinín acu chun for bairt, chun dul ar aghaidh, nach mbeadh an saol atá acu mar bhac orthu, agus nach mbeadh siad faoi aon mhíbhuntáiste toisc go raibh cónaí orthu sa Ghaeltacht.  Sin an deacracht atá ann agus a bhí ann i gcónaí.  D'fhéadfainn argóint den saghas céanna a chur ar aghaidh mar gheall ar chúrsaí sláinte, cúrsaí fostaíochta agus cúrsaí chaitheamh aimsire.  Bhí mé sa Daingean le déanaí, i gContae Chiarraí, agus, gan amhras, ag caint le daoine ansin chuala mé an seanscéal. Níl daoine óga fágtha san áit.  Tá siad imithe as an áit.  Sin an fáth go bhfuil antábhacht ar fad ag baint le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta, chun jabanna a chur ar fáil sna Gaeltachtaí.</P>
    <P>Bhí mé, trí seachtainí ó shin, i gcontae an Aire féin, ar an bhFál Carrah, ag labhairt ar an imirce, agus an fad is a bhí mé ann chonaic mé na busanna ag fágáil an bhaile sin agus iad ar a mbealach go Londain, go Manchúin agus áiteacha eile mar sin.  Bhí mé ar Leitir Móir le déanaí, mar a bhfuil col ceathrar liom féin, Peadar Ó Tuathail, ina bhall de Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Dúirt Peadar liom, &ldquo;Tá níos mó ná dhá Jumbos de dhaoine imithe ón áit seo le cúpla bliain ar imirce.&rdquo;  Agus sin mar atá.  Tá slad déanta ar na Gaeltachtaí, agus sin an fáth nach maith liom go mbeadh an Rialtas anois ag iarraidh sásamh éigin a bhaint as toghcháin an Údaráis and to try to build up the European elections on the backs of the Údarás elections.  It is not good enough and does not appeal to me.</P>
    <P>In the European elections, táimid ag <Col N="1359" /> baint le tíortha eile nach bhfuil in aon slí cosúil linn féin, go mórmhór ó thaobh an tslí a bhfuil an daonra roinnte tríd an tír. The distribution of the population in this country is different from that of any other country in Europe.  We know that to our cost when it comes to providing health, education, transport and other services. It is the only country where one can drive through the country side and see houses dotted all over the place, on top of hills, on the sides of mountains, down valleys etc.  It is the way our country developed because of our history.  It is different from any other European country in that way. That is costly to us.  Nowhere is that more obvious than in the Gaeltacht areas. Therefore, nowhere is it more necessary to put money into the infrastructural services than in the Gaeltachtaí, and those services are just not there.</P>
    <P>Tá go leor ráite mar gheall ar bhóithre na nGaeltachtaí.  Tá eolas againn ar an méid sin.  Ach níamháin sin.  Mar a dúras, cúrsaí sláinte, cúrsaí oideachais, cúrsaí craolacháin, i ngach sórt slí the people of the Gaeltacht are disadvantaged in regard to housing, education, health services, jobs, and they are the ones suffering most from emigration.  For that reason the last thing we should be doing in this House or in either House is to demean in importance the elections to Údarás na Gaeltachta.  For that reason I believe the Government are following a very cynical exercise here in trying to mount a European campaign on the backs of Údarás elections.  I regret that the Government find it necessary to do this.  Is it a reflection on their candidates or on their policies?  I am not quite sure. I would prefer if the Government took a greater interest in developing the Údarás by giving them the support and resources to do the job they would want to do. Fágfaidh mé é mar sin faoin Aire.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Seanadóirí, iad siúd a tháinig isteach anseo agus iad siúd a labhair i nGaeilge nói mBéarla.  Bhí an tsuim acu sa Ghaeltacht <Col N="1360" /> agus i dtoghchán Udarás na Gaeltachta chun teacht anseo agus a bheith páirteach sa díospóireacht seo.  Gabhaim buíochas ó mo chroí leis na Seanadóirí go léir as ucht an chaoi in ar glacadh leis an mBille beag seo agus déanfaidh mé mo dhícheall freagra a thabhairt ar na ceisteanna a chuir siad maidir le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Ní díospóireacht í seo ar Roinn na Gaeltachta nó an Roinn Oideachais.  Mar a dúirt mé i dtosach, is é an cuspóir atá leis an mBille ná foráil a dhéanamh i dtreo is go mbeidh sé ar ár gcumas toghcháin do Pharlaimint na hEorpa agus toghchán do Údarás na Gaeltachta a chur ar siúl ar an lá céanna.  Tá sé socraithe cheana féin go mbeidh an vótáil do thoghcháin na hEorpa ar siúl ar an gcúigiú lá déag de mhí an Mheithimh, agus, ag féachaint ar an dlí mar atá sé faoi láthair, caithfear an toghchán don Údarás a thionscnamh roimh lár mhí Dheireadh Fómhair.  Mar sin, caithfear an toghchán seo a bheith againn idir é seo agus lár mí Dheireadh Fómhair.</P>
      <P>Ceapaim féin go bhfuil sé anchiallmhar é a bheith againn ag an am seo, agus caithfidh mé a rá, mar fhear as an mBreac-Ghaeltacht, nó, mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Ryan as an nGaeltacht bhréige, b'fhéidir, duine ar bith a tháinig isteach anseo inniu agus a bhí i gcoinne toghchán ar an lá céanna, ní raibh siadsan ag caint thar ceann mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Ní dóigh liomsa go bhfuil an méid sin spéise acusan sa Ghaeltacht.  Níor chaith siad mórán ama sa Ghaeltacht, cúpla seachtain nó cúpla mí, b'fhéidir. Níl duine ar bith sa Ghaeltacht atá i gcoinne an toghcháin seo ar an lá céanna.  Tá a leath de mo Dháilcheantar sa Ghaeltacht, agus caithimse go leor deireadh seachtaine ag freastal ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta, agus caithfear a rá go fírinneach agus ó mo chroí nach raibh duine ar bith sa Ghaeltacht, cibé polaitíocht a bhí acu nó atá acu, a bhí i gcoinne é seo.  Tá mé cinnte &mdash; ag deireadh an lae, gcaithfimid fanacht go dtí go bhfeicfimid &mdash; go n-aontaíonn an tromlach mór de na Seanadóirí gur ciallmhar an rud é an dá thoghchán a thabhairt le chéile.  Mar a dúirt mé, má dhéantar amhlaidh sábhálfar airgead poiblí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1361" /> Chuir and Senadóir Ryan ceist, nó an Seanadóir Murphy &mdash; níl fhios agam cé acu &mdash; an féidir praghas a chur ar dhaonlathas. Níl muintir na Gaeltachta i gcoinne na dtoghchán ar an lá céanna. Tá a fhios ag muintir na Gaeltachta go bhfaighfidh siad an phoiblíocht chéanna is a bheadh ar fáil mura mbeadh toghchán na hEorpa ann an lá céanna.  Tá a fhios ag an dá Sheanadóir atá i gcoinne é seo, is cuma an mbeidh an toghchán sin ann nó nach mbeidh, an t-aon phoiblíocht a gheobhaidh muintir na Gaeltachta, ná na páipéir áitiúla agus Raidió na Gaeltachta. Ba cheart dul ar ais go dtí toghchán Údarás na Gaeltachta i mí Dheireadh Fómhair 1984; cén phoiblíocht a fuair muidne?  Cén phoiblíocht a fuair muid go náisiúnta, ó RTÉ ná ó Radio Telefís Eireann?  Fuair muid an phoiblíocht a fuair muintir na Gaeltachta agus iad siúd a ghlac páirt sa toghchán sin ó Raidió na Gaeltachta agus ó na páipéir áitiúla.  Sin an dóigh a mbeidh sé agus ní mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Ryan.</P>
    <P>Bhí mé ag éisteacht nuair a bhí mé amuigh.  Bhí an Seanadóir ag caint faoi aitheantas don Ghaeltacht.  Tá mise cinnte de go bhfaighfidh sibh an phoiblíocht chéanna.  Beidh muidne agus beidh mise ag obair go crua sa toghchán, agus geallaim go mbeidh gach uile dhuine a bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeltacht, atá ina gcónaí gar don Ghaeltacht, nó fán Ghaeltacht, ag cur fadhbanna na Gaeltachta san aon áit ar féidir sin a dhéanamh, agus sin fo háitiúil.</P>
    <P>Leabhair an Seanadóir O'Toole i mBéarla sular tháinig mé isteach.  Dúirt sé &ldquo;Caithfear labhairt i mBéarla mar nach bhfaighidh mé poiblíocht ar bith má labhraítear Gaeilge&rdquo;.  Chuir sé áthas orm a bheith ag éisteacht taobh amuigh den Teach nuair a dúirt an Cathaoirleach, an Seanadóir Uí hÓnáin, go mbeidh córas aistriúcháin comhaimseartha sa Seanad istigh anseo roimh dheireadh na bliana. Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an ráiteas sin ón Chathaoirleach.  Ansin beidh gach duine ábalta, iad siúd, na tuairisceoirí, iad siúd nach bhfuil Gaeilge acu an díosporeacht a thuiscint.  Mura bhfuil aistriúchán ann níl seans ar bith poiblíocht a thabhairt.  Ach sa Ghaeltacht <Col N="1362" /> í féin, is iad na dreamanna a thugann poiblíocht don Ghaeltacht agus don Ghaeilge ná páipéir áitiúla agus Raidió na Gaeltachta.  Braitheann sé ar rudaí eile.  Má tá scannal ar bith ann beidh go leor poiblíochta le fáil sa Ghaeltacht, ach nuair atá ceist ar bith eile ann ní dóigh liom go bhfaigheann an Ghaeltacht mórán, ní amháin sa Teach seo, ní amháin sna páipéir, ach fiú amháin sa Teach eile.  Caithfidh mise a rá nach aon rud nua é an dá thoghchán nó b'fhéidir trí thoghchán a bheith ann an lá céanna.</P>

Beidh trí thoghchán sa tír ag an am céanna.  Táimid cinnte faoi sin.  Níor mhothaigh mise mórán cainte faoi chúpla toghchán a bheith ar an lá céanna i 1979.

      <P>Tá a fhios agamsa gur an fhírinne atá ann, agus mura bhfuil tusa sásta éisteacht leis an fhírinne is trua é.  Ní féidir liomsa rud ar bith a dhéanamh fá dtaobh de.  Bhí go leor Seanadóirí eile, agus labhair an Seanadóir Nioclás Ó Conchubhair agus dúirt sé, agus chun a bheith cothrom don Seanadóir McCormack, dúirt sé nach bhfuil a intinn déanta suas aige go fóill fá dtaobh de seo.  Ach tá mise cinnte fá dtaobh de rud amháin, go gcuirfeadh sé isteach níos mó ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta mura mbeadh an toghchán seo ar an lá céanna.  Fiú amháin i 1984 is cuimhin liom é go raibh toghchán an t-am a bhfuair an Teachta Dála bás i gContae Uíbh Fhailí, Ber Cowan, go ndéana Dia trócaire air, bhí fo-thoghchán ann an lá céanna.  Bhí cupla reifreann againn ar an lá céanna, na blianta ó shin, agus, mar a dúirt mé, sa bhliain 1984 cuireadh reifreann agus fo-thoghchán agus na toghcháin do Pharlaimint na hEorpa ar siúl ar an lá céanna.  Mar sin, ní haon rud nua é atá i gceist anois.  Aontaím go hiomlán leis na Seanadóirí a dúirt go bhfuil tábhacht ar leith ag baint le toghchán do Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Ócáid antábhachtach í do phobal na Gaeltachta, agus tá a fhios agam go bhfuil an-suim sa toghchán sin go dtí seo.  Agus an chaint faoin daonlathas, nach iontach an rud é gurb é mo pháirtí féin é a thug an daonlathas sin do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Bhí Gaeltarra Éireann ansin ar feadh tamaill fhada.  Bhí Comhrialtas ann idir 1973 agus 1977 agus is é Donncha Ó Gallchobhair, mar Aire na Gaeltachta, a thug seans do mhuintir na Gaeltachta baill tofa a bheith acu, agus a thug seans do mhuintir na Gaeltachta daoine a chur ar an Údarás ionas go mbeadh guth mhuintir na Gaeltachta ar Bhord Udarás na Gaeltachta. Roimhe sin ní raibh an deis sin acu.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé liomsa agus le mo pháirtí féin, beidh iarrthóirí fiúntacha sa choimhlint againn, agus beidh feachtas toghcháin éifeachtach <Col N="1364" /> neamhspleách á reachtáil againn.  Geallaim dóibh agus dóibh siúd a bhfuil comhartha ceiste fá dtaobh de shuim atá againn-ne sa Ghaeltacht, agus i dtoghchán Udarás na Gaeltachta, geallaim daoibh, agus tugaim barúil phearsanta, go mbeidh níos mó suime i dtoghchán Údarás na Gaeltachta ná i dtoghchán na hEorpa.  Agus ní dóigh liom, mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Ryan nó Seanadóir eile, go mbáithfidh toghchán na hEorpa toghchán Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Ní dóigh liom go dtarlóidh sin, agus tá súil agam i leith gach páirtí eile agus gach duine neamhspleách a bheas ina sheasamh le haghaidh an toghcháin seo, go mbeidh toghchán éifeachtach á reachtáil acusan chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Chuir an Seanadóir McCormack ceist fá dtaobh de olltoghchán.  Ní gá domsa a chur i gcuimhne do dhuine ar bith anseo nach pribhléid an Rialtas é, ná pribhléid an Tí seo, ná an Tí eile é.  Is é pribhléid an Taoisigh é sin, ach cad faoin toghchán eile?</P>

Tá a fhios agam agus ní gá do Sheanadóir ar bith a bheith ag cur ceist ghlic mar sin, tá a fhios acu nach bhfuil a fhios ag éinne ar bith ach an Taoiseach. Tá gach páirtí eile ag rith agus eagla orthu agus fearg orthu go mbeidh toghchán ar an lá céanna.  Sin mo fhreagra ar an cheist sin.  Is é pribhléid an Taoisigh é, agus is é and Taoiseach a ghlaofaidh olltoghchán. Mura raibh a fhios sin agat roimhe tá brón orm nach raibh a fhios sin agat.  A Chathaoirligh, tá mise breá sásta fanacht anseo le haghaidh an tráthnóna agus iarracht mo dhíchill a dhéanamh chun freagra a thabhairt ar cheisteanna, gan daoine a bheith ag teacht isteach le &ldquo;glic comments&rdquo; mar sin.  Mura bhfuil sibh sásta éisteacht, níl mise ábalta cuidiú.</P>

    <P>Ceapaimse go bhfuil an díospóireacht seo tábhachtach don Ghaeltacht agus ní as an Ghaeltacht mé féin ach ceapaim gur cheart an rud é, chomh fada agus is féidir, díospóireacht a bheith againn in ár <Col N="1365" /> dteanga dhúchais.  Chuir sé gliondar croí ormsa nuair a tháinig an Seanadóir John Robb isteach anseo, agus cé gur labhair sé i mBéarla, fear nach bhfuil mórán Gaeilge aige, thaispeáin sé sin an tsuim atá aige sa Ghaeltacht, fear a chaitheann a laethanta saoire sa Ghaeltacht agus an-suim aige sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá sé sin cosúil le go leor daoine i dTuaisceart na hÉireann, agus, ar ndóigh, tá an Ghaeilge beo bríomhar sa taobh sin tíre, agus ní bhfaigheann siad an deis chéanna is a fhaigheann go leor daoine, agus déanaimse comhghairdeas leis an Seanadóir Robb.  Beidh mé á mholadh, os rud é go gcaitheann sé oiread sin ama sa Ghaeltacht agus gur thóg sé páirt sa díospóireacht seo, fiú amháin má bhí sé i mBearla.</P>
    <P>Chuir an Seanadóir McCormack ceist fá dtaobh den toghchán seo nó an toghchán amach anseo sa bhliain 1994 nó 1999.  &ldquo;Enabling legislation&rdquo; is ea an Bille seo agus tugann sé deis don Aire amach anseo.  Níl seo á rá go gcaithfear toghchán Údarás na Gaeltachta a bheith againn ar an lá céanna le toghcháin na hEorpa, ach tá an reachtaíocht seo ann anois ionas go mbeidh an tAire, nó cibé Aire a bheas ann, ábalta an toghchán do Údarás na Gaeltachta a bheith againn an lá céanna. Níl mise ag rá go mbeidh sé ar an lá céanna amach anseo sa bhliain 1994 nó 1999.  Mhol mé an Cathaoirleach nuair a labhair an Seanadóir Ryan fá dtaobh den chóras aistriúcháin, agus tá súil agam go mbeidh an deis ag gach duine a theacht isteach agus díospóireacht mar seo ar siúl go mbeidh an córas aistriúcháin nua-aimseartha acu agus go mbeidh siad ábalta éisteacht leis nuair atá sé aistrithe go Béarla.</P>
    <P>Ní cheapaim, os rud é go mbeidh an dá thoghchán ar an lá céanna, gur neamhshuim atá againn sa Ghaeltacht.  Ceapaim féin nach éascaíocht riaracháin atá i gceist anseo, an toghchán eile a bheith againn, ach cuir ceist ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta, cuir ceist ar na hionadaithe poiblí atá ag obair sa Ghaeltacht, agus tabharfaidh said an freagra duit go bhfuil muintir na Gaeltachta agus iad siúd atá ag obair sa Ghaeltacht sásta é a bheith acu ar an lá céanna.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1366" /> Chuir sé iontas orm, agus ceapaim féin gur masla é, nuair a dúirt an Seanadóir O'Toole nach bhfuil na tithe is áille sa Ghaeltacht.  Bhí sé i nDún na nGall, agus tá aithne mhaith air sa Ghaeltacht.  Ceapaimse nach raibh sé dáiríre nuair a dúirt sé nach raibh na tithe is áille sa Ghaeltacht. Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil baint ar bith aige seo leis an reachtaíocht seo nó leis an Bhille seo, ach caithfear a rá nach bhfuil sé sin fíor ar chor ar bith.  Tá na tithe sa Ghaeltacht chomh maith le teach ar bith eile, ní amháin sa tír seo ach in áit ar bith sa domhan.  B'fhéidir nach bhfuil go leor acu ann.  Thóg muintir na Gaeltachta a dtithe.  Níl mórán &ldquo;housing schemes&rdquo; sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá níos lú de na tithe sin sa Ghaeltacht ná in áit ar bith eile sa tír.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh ceist fá dtaobh de iad siúd atá ina mbaill ainmnithe agus iad siúd atá ar an Údarás faoi láthair.  Tá an tAcht um Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1979, agam, agus deir an tAcht sin, &ldquo;I gcás a ndéanfar comhalta (seachas comhalta tofa) den Údarás a ainmniú lena thoghadh chun ceachtar Tí den Oireachtas, nó mar chomhalta de Sheanad Éireann, scoirfidh sé air sin de bheith ina chomhalta den Údarás&rdquo;.  Tá sé chomh simplí sin.  Deir sé sin, duine ar bith atá ainmnithe, ní gá dó Bord an Údaráis a fhágáil.  Mar a déarfá i mBéarla, &ldquo;good sense must prevail&rdquo;. Ní dóigh liom féin go dtarlaíonn sé seo. Nuair a scrios an t-iar-Aire den Chomhrialtas daoine ionraice cosúil le Máire Mhic Niallais as mo dháilcheantar féin agus daoine eile, daoine ionraice a scrios an t-iar-Aire Gaeltachta as a bpost ag an am sin, sin an chéad uair a tharla sé. Scrios sé iad, ach ní dóigh liom go dtarlaíonn sé seo.  Nuair a ainmníodh na daoine seo ag an iar-Aire, daoine &ldquo;apolotical&rdquo;, mar a déarfá, a bhí iontu, agus cad chuige a mbeadh deacrachtaí ar bith againn nuair atá daoine atá &ldquo;apolitical&rdquo; ag iarraidh seasamh sa toghchán?  Ní dóigh go dtarlaíonn sé seo, agus mar a dúirt mé, tá súil agam go mbeidh ciall ag daoine.  Chomh maith leis sin, an mbeadh sé cothrom, cuir i gcás, dá mbeadh daoine sa Teach seo, a d'ainmneodh an Taoiseach agus chomh luath agus a bhí olltoghchán ann nó cúpla seachtain ina dhiaidh <Col N="1367" /> sin, go mbeadh daoine ábalta a theacht isteach go dtí an Dáil a bheadh ina dTeachtaí Dála nó ina Seanadóirí, agus daoine eile nach iad?  Ceapaim féin gur ceist hypothetical atá ann agus nach mbeadh deacracht ar bith ansin.  Tá súil agam, duine ar bith atá ina bhall ainmnithe ag an Rialtas agus má tásuim acu seasamh sa toghchán, ba cheart go mbeadh gach duine ag tosú ón phointe céanna.  Beidh cuid acu a bheidh ábalta dul isteach chuig an Údarás agus freagraí a fháil ar cheisteanna, agus beidh daoine eile nach mbeidh ábalta dul isteach agus eolas a fháil.</P>
    <P>Caithfear ceist a chur ansin, cad faoin <Col N="1368" /> daonlathas ansin?  Cuir i gcás, ag deireadh an lae, mar a dúirt an Seanadóir McCormack, go bhfuil na baill ainmnithe atá ansin, ní gá do na daoine sin an tÚdarás a fhágáil go dtí 1991.  Chuir sé ceist cad é a tharlóidh tar éis an toghcháin.  Sin arís pribhléid Aire na Gaeltachta agus pribhléid an Rialtais, agus níl a fhios agam cad é an dóigh a bhfuil siadsan ag smaoineamh. Ceapaim féin gur ceart fanacht go dtí go mbíonn an toghchán thart.  Tá súil agam, cibé rud a dhéanfar, go ndéanfar an rud ceart don Údarás, don Ghaeltacht agus do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to repeal the <Col N="1369" /> Horse Industry Act, 1970, and to wind up the affairs of Bord na gCapall.  Part III of the 1970 Act dealing with the licensing of riding establishments was never brought into force.  A voluntary registration scheme is now run by the Association of Irish Riding Establishments and has proved very successful.</P>
      <P>In the context of the 1987 budget the then Government decided to abolish Bord na gCapall because continued expenditure on the board could not be justified in the current financial situation. The essential functions of the Board, that is the maintenance of the Irish Horse Register and the list of approved stallions, have since been carried out by the Department of Agriculture and Food. The Register is the stud book for non-thoroughbred horses and its maintenance is fundamental for continued breed improvement in the industry.</P>
      <P>In 1966 a survey team established by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries recommended the establishment of an Irish Horse Board to co-ordinate the activities of the various associations dealing with equestrian matters and to set up a national training centre for riders and instructors.  Bord na gCapall was established with high hopes following enactment of the Horse Industry Act, 1970. It was anticipated that it would be the beginning of a well organised and properly motivated programme to promote and develop the non-thoroughbred horse industry.</P>
      <P>One of the board's earliest achievements was the setting up of a farriery apprenticeship scheme under which a number of young people became qualified farriers.  The Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association and other interests have now organised a new farriery apprenticeship scheme.  This move is welcomed and it is hoped that it can be further developed to meet the demands both of the thoroughbred and non-thoroughbred industries.  Under the board's tutelage a number of people were prepared for and passed their Equestrian Science examinations.  This function has now been taken over by Teagasc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1370" /> The board's most important and significant achievement, however, was the foundation of the Irish Horse Register in 1974.  This incorporated the approval of stallions for breeding and was essential for maintaining the high standard of the Irish sport horse.  During the board's existence the number of sport horses increased by 50 per cent (21,000 to 34,000) and the value of exports reached £4 million in 1988.</P>
    <P>This is not to say that the board's story was one of unending success.  Indeed had it achieved the goals for which it had been set up we would not now be proposing its abolition.  I do not wish to hold up the House alluding to the failures of the board, facts which are common knowledge to all concerned.</P>
    <P>In 1983, following considerable adverse publicity, the Bord was restructured and staffing levels were reduced from 34 to 15.  Following the then Government's decision to abolish the Bord, these remaining staff received redundancy payments in April-May 1987 and provision was made for preservation of their pension entitlements.</P>
    <P>Yet, while acknowledging the fact that there were problems over the years, tribute should be paid to those board members and staff who selflessly sought and worked for the advancement of the industry.  It was through no fault of theirs that the expectations at the time the Bord was established were not realised.</P>
    <P>In October 1987 a new board was appointed, comprising of three civil servants from the Department of Agriculture and Food, to wind-up the Bord's affairs.  Considerable progress has been made and the remaining tasks include the disposal of the Bord's leased stallions, its main assets.  The existing lessees have been given first option to purchase them but if no agreement can be reached it is intended that the stallions will be offered for sale by public tender.  In that event the lessees will, of course, be free to compete in the sale.</P>
    <P>Conscious of the need to restore confidence and a sense of direction to the industry but aware that the present economic climate limits the scope for financial <Col N="1371" /> incentives, the Minister launched a new national programme for this sector in November of last year.  For the benefit of this House I would like to mention again the objectives of the programme which are: to maximise output and exports by exploiting to the full our national resources in breeding stock, soil, climate, expertise and reputation; to maximise returns to breeders and to develop further the equestrian and leisure side of the industry.</P>
    <P>The principal features of the programme include the conservation of the Irish draught breed.  Many of the qualities and much of the international reputation of the Irish sport horse derive from the breeding system whereby Irish draught and Irish draught-type horses are crossed with thoroughbreds.  The complementarity of traits between the Irish draught and thoroughbred and the associated hybrid vigour result in horses having strength, courage, stamina and good temperament. The continued breeding and production of such horse is dependent on the maintenance of a viable nucleus of the Irish draught population.  However, the future of the breed may be endangered if insufficient numbers of mares are pure bred to maintain population size and to enable selection within the breed for quality improvement.</P>
    <P>A scheme, therefore, was introduced under which a grant of £400 will be paid to the breeder of each pure bred Irish draught foal registered in the Irish Horse Register.  Indeed, you may have seen advertisements to this effect in the national press recently.  This grant will compensate for the difference in value between pure bred Irish draught and thoroughbred crosses.  The scheme will operate for a five-year period commencing next year.  Application forms and conditions are now available from the Department of Agriculture and Food.  In association with the Irish Draught Horse Society, initiatives will also be taken to increase the number of progeny by top mares and to conserve rare blood lines utilising artificial insemination and embryo transfer technology.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1372" /> Beginning this year, headage payments will be made in respect of eligible registered mares in all disadvantaged areas in which cattle headage grants are paid at an increased rate of £70 per head for up to eight mares and £66 for the next 22 mares.  These payments will be calculated separately from any other headage payments to which the producer may be entitled.</P>
    <P>As part of the new western package, the Department of Agriculture and Food are finalising a new scheme to provide incentives in less favoured areas of the country towards the cost of providing facilities which will enable them to diversify into alternative farm enterprises.  It is intended that this scheme will include for the first time grant-aid towards the cost of basic housing for non-thoroughbred sport horses.</P>
    <P>In addition, last week the Minister announced a scheme to encourage agritourism, also in the western package areas, which would include grant-aid for farmers investing in facilities for leisure activities, such as pony-trekking and horse riding.</P>
    <P>The Irish Horse Register will now be administered on a permanent basis by the Department of Agriculture and Food and has, in fact, had new modern computer facilities installed to ensure its efficient operation.</P>
    <P>Accurate identification of individual animals and complete, accurate recording and registration of pedigree and performance data are fundamental to successful breed improvement, marketing and trade.  The operation of the Register by the Department should ensure that: (a) standards and procedures will be followed for the registration and documentation of horses which will allow the Register to be approved under proposed EC zootechnical legislation; (b) a reliable basis is available for payment of grants.  The requirement that the grants should be paid only on registered animals will have the very beneficial indirect effect of increasing the proportion of horses registered.  The result will be a widening of the base for genetic improvement and an increase in the range of Irish <Col N="1373" /> sport horses for marketing; (c) a reliable data base will be built up for objective evaluation of the breeding merit of animals which is a prerequisite for constructive breeding programmes; (d) the Connemara and other Irish pony societies who currently maintain non-computerised stud books will be encouraged to join the Irish Horse Register; (e) the Register will be the authentic source of all genealogical and zootechnical information included in the passports of all Irish sport horses and ponies.</P>
    <P>Selection and approval of stallions to sire animals for registration in the Irish Horse Register and the publication of their pedigree and breeding value in the Register of Approved Stallions are also crucial for breed improvement of Irish sport horses.  This task, which will also be undertaken by the Department of Agriculture and Food, will involve: the organisation of centres for carrying out inspections and suitable riding/jumping tests, in association with industry representatives; ensuring that best estimates of breeding values, based on all available progeny and performance test data, are used in selection; investigating, in association with the industry, how some proven National Hunt thoroughbred stallions might be approved for inclusion in the Irish Horse Register.</P>
    <P>Given the progress made in the development of artificial insemination and embryo transfer technology and the potential of these techniques for genetic improvement, conservation of rare blood lines and eradication of sexually transmitted diseases, it is intended to sponsor new legislation to facilitate their development and application in the non-thoroughbred horse industry.  Although only available on a limited scale at present, the industry should be encouraged to utilise these techniques.  EC legislation on animal health, zootechnical and genealogical conditions governing intra-Community trade in horses is currently being drafted.  The objective is to liberalise trade in horses, horse semen and embryos.  Close liaison with the relevant interests will be maintained in relation to these matters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1374" /> In association with the horse industry and Teagasc, initiatives will be taken to develop advisory and training programmes to improve fertility, artificial reproductive techniques, breeding merit, feeding and husbandry of sport horses. Teagasc also has responsibility for awarding the Irish Certificate and Diploma in Equestrian Science.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the single European market in 1992 will bring increased opportunities.  However, effective marketing will be required if the horse industry is to take advantage of the opportunities opened to it when barriers to free trade are removed.  In the horse industry marketing encompasses a wide range of activities from the production of the foal, through schooling and training of the animal, to the sale of the finished riding horse for export.  It is envisaged that the establishment, with national and EC aid, of a small number of equestrian centres, strategically located, so as to provide high quality facilities for the final preparation, evaluation and marketing of sport horses should result in more foreign buyers thus increasing exports; promotion, publicity and the orderly development of markets; greater awareness by producers of the requirements of the market-place; greater opportunity for breeders to reap a high proportion of the final value of sport horses.</P>
    <P>The activities of Córas Tráchtála Teoranta and Bord Fáilte in promoting the sport and leisure horse area are invaluable to the industry.  Both organisations have been asked to review the scale and intensity of their marketing and promotion of the sector.</P>
    <P>A feature of the non-thoroughbred horse industry in Ireland is the large number of representative bodies catering for the various interests.  It is proposed to forge stronger links between the Department of Agriculture and Food and these interests through an advisory committee whose terms of reference will be to advise the Minister on policy and on planning and co-ordination of the different elements in the national programme which I have just outlined.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1375" /> It is proposed to ask the committee to report to the Minister for Agriculture and Food as soon as possible on the following important areas: the operation and management of the Irish Horse Register; the identification for registration purposes of animals produced by artificial reproductive techniques; the most suitable method of selecting stallions and the development of progeny and performance testing and the problem of weeding out inferior stallions which are presently causing damage to the quality of our breeding stock.</P>
    <P>The setting up of this committee is now in train and I expect it will be in action in a few weeks.  It will be self-selected to the extent that the main bodies involved in the industry have been requested to nominate one representative each.  The Minister has expressly asked for nominations only of people who are fully conversant with all aspect of the non-thoroughbred industry and who can be expected to make a positive contribution to the development of the industry.  These will be supplemented by representatives from the Department of Agriculture and Food and others whom the Minister considers appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Minister believes that the new national programme for the development of the non-thoroughbred horse industry will prove effective.  Any programme on its own, however, cannot succeed without the full co-operation and commitment of everyone involved in the industry.  This is a labour-intensive industry with potential for expanding employment. Our traditional affection for and skill with horses can be harnessed into a worthwhile and profitable enterprise. Now is the right time to put this industry in readiness to meet the challenges and opportunities of the 1990s.</P>
    <P>I would like to take the opportunity as well to compliment national organisations. Recently Bord Bainne, the national body for the export of dairy products, agreed to sponsor the Irish Horse Show in Dublin for a considerable number of years.  I would urge a number of substantial commercial organisations <Col N="1376" /> to put money into the horse industry.  It is a tremendously effective way of merchandising not alone the horse industry but Ireland itself.  The return on it would be a very good investment, indeed.  I would certainly like to see many more commercial organisations putting substantial amounts of money into the Irish horse industry.  The price alone which people get and the prize money available for various competitions would never compensate the owners.  We need to increase the amount of money involved.</P>
    <P>I also want to compliment the University College, Dublin.  They have an equine studies course in their Agricultural Faculty.  It is producing some very good young people who are coming onstream into the industry.  It is fair to say that there is tremendous confidence and very high morale in the non-thoroughbred horse industry in Ireland. I am very pleased with the response to this development programme.</P>
    <P>I have great pleasure in commending this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no difficulty with this legislation to formally bring to a close the affairs of Bord na gCapall. The fact is that this State-sponsored board rarely functioned in the 16 or 17 years of its existence.  Essentially, it has gone out of existence since 1987.  That is a major contributing factor to its demise. Rarely, since its inception in 1970 did it fulfil the role set down for it under the Horse Industry Act enacted that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know a lot about horses or equestrianism, but I read some of the debates on the Horse Industry Bill, 1970 and the speeches then were full of hope as to what this board would do for the horse industry which was deemed to be in trouble at that time.  The Minister referred to this and to the genesis of that particular legislation, which arose from a special committee set up by the then Minister for Agriculture and Food in 1966, Deputy Haughey.  It is true it had its achievements.  One of them was the establishment of the Irish Horse Register, which was the first central horse register of approved mares and stallions <Col N="1377" /> in the long history of the industry in this country.  That, in itself, was a major breakthrough.</P>
    <P>I might mention, too, that in its time it established an apprenticeship scheme for young farriers.  That was a very enlightened and, indeed, successful step. That almost ancient art or skill of the farrier or the blacksmith had almost disappeared from the landscape in Ireland. I am delighted to learn &mdash; and the Minister has confirmed this &mdash; that there is now such a thing as a qualified farrier with approved qualification papers to show and prove his or her efficiency in the skill.</P>
    <P>There was very public wrangling and rows within the board which went on for years.  All kinds of internal shenanigans were reported.  Some of them were very well detailed for us by Deputy Avril Doyle in an excellent contribution on this Bill when it was before the other House. Deputy Austin Deasy did his best to reform matters by establishing a new, trimmed-down board in 1983, but leadership and the necessary drive never came.  The malaise continued, culminating in the revelations about the purchase of less than well-endowed stallions in 1987.  This Gilbertian episode put an effective end to the board and delivered its affairs into the hands of the Department. All the evidence since, I must say, suggests that the unit within the Department charged with the interim handling of the affairs of the horse industry has worked quite well.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggests he intends to broaden the administrative structure by the establishment of an advisory board to advise on policy development.  I welcome this.  Please, Minister, ensure that this advisory board is a competent one above all else, and not another quango for political supporters.  One of the major factors that discredited Bord na gCapall was the appointment to it of what I would discribe most charitably as inappropriate people.  Deputy Martin Gibbons made a very telling point on that particular question in his contribution in the Dáil.  I submit he would be in a very good position to know all about that, given the <Col N="1378" /> political history of his family.  I have heard of a case where votes in an election to this Seanad were elicited and promised on the basis that if the vote were delivered and the candidate succeeded the elector could expect a seat on Bord na gCapall. We want to see an end to that kind of wheeling and dealing in the establishment of the new advisory board.</P>
    <P>One must welcome the grants announced last November, that is, £400 for each pure bred Irish draught foal bred and registered in the Irish Horse Register. The headage scheme has been extended, I understand, to all registered mares on farms in the disadvantaged areas.  I did not quite hear what the Minister said.  There is some confusion in my mind on this question.  Certainly, the Minister said in the Dáil that the headage payment on horses would only be paid in areas that qualified for cattle headage. Cattle headage is not paid for all cattle in disadvantaged areas; it is only paid on bovine livestock in the severely handicapped areas.  If the equine headage is confined to those areas, as defined at present, then the scope of the concession will be quite limited.</P>
    <P>Another limitation will be that eligibility will only cover areas where there is a poor tradition of horse breeding and horse keeping.  Small, fragmented, mostly uneconomic, holdings typical of what one finds in the severely handicapped areas eke out their existence on the mainstream lines of agriculture like dairying and beef.  The keeping of a breeding horse or horses is largely unknown on such farms.</P>
    <P>If it is not the case, I urge that the equine headage be paid for all eligible mares in the disadvantaged areas, as opposed to the severely handicapped areas.  In that way the incentive will work. It will be a cheap incentive also, since the EC will pick up 70 per cent of the cost. With regard to those areas that are not now and probably never will be classified as disadvantaged areas because of land quality, average farm size and so on and bearing in mind that these are the areas with the best reputation and indeed, the other wherewithal for the breeding of <Col N="1379" /> horses &mdash; might I suggest that the special grant of £400 for each pure bred Irish draught foal be increased to £600.  This is the only incentive they will get as they are outside, and likely to remain outside the disadvantaged areas which means they can never qualify for the equine headage incentive.</P>
    <P>If I could return to the people in the Department who will have the responsibility for the horse industry, this unit must have adequate staff and if I may say so, it must have the appropriate staff. Written or unwritten, they should not be constrained by the usual suffocating constraints of the Civil Service.  The people in charge will in a real way be trying to provide the dynamic to an industry with tremendous potential in terms of contribution to the national income.  If someone in there has a good innovative idea, I hope it will not have to be written down or recorded 100 times, being passed up and down the pecking order before it is put into practice, as is usual in Civil Service procedures.  The last thing this unit and the advisory committee who will be advising need is an overlay of bureaucracy and red tape.  They need the freedom to act when a good opportunity presents itself.  Imagination and inventiveness will have to be given more rein in that unit.</P>
    <P>The Irish horse industry has tremendous potential for export expansion. Exports of horses from this country have declined just as dramatically as the size of the national horse herd has done in the past 40 years.  The value of exports in the past two years has risen slightly, but it was a money increase only and not a volume increase.</P>
    <P>Irish sport horses are among the most sought after sport animals in the world. If the supply was there and the markets properly developed, we could be exporting 30,000 horses per year with a value perhaps of £16 million per year and not an export of 1,800 horses per year as at present with a money value of approximately £4 million.</P>
    <P>The role of Teagasc in a new drive to expand the size of the industry is of absolute importance.  There must be a <Col N="1380" /> hands-on policy by the Department's advisory service in promoting the horse on the Irish farm.  As an alternative enterprise, it should not and will not have quotas or restrictions.  Such phrases have become almost synonymous with the mainstream enterprises in agriculture in this country nowadays.</P>
    <P>Cuts in the advisory services or in their resources that are devoted to the promotion of the horse would be criminal, given the financial incentives in place or about to be put in place.  Sadly, in the disadvantaged areas, with the greatest potential to expand and where the introduction of an alternative enterprise like horse breeding would have the greatest income impact, we find the advisory services so decimated by cuts as to be almost irrelevant to the growth and development of any life in the industry, let alone to the development of the horse industry.</P>
    <P>We ask the Minister to provide Teagasc with the necessary resources to recruit people who are qualified in the equestrian sciences.  I use the word &ldquo;sciences&rdquo; here very broadly since I am talking about promotion, marketing, breeding, husbandry and anything else that is relevant to the real developmental role of the industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister has promised to introduce new legislation that will give wider use in the ever-developing, technical areas of artificial insemination, embryo transfers and equine genetic engineering. These practices, properly developed and used, will keep alive rare and highly valuable blood lines that could become extinct.  There would be valuable semen banks within easy reach of most horse breeders and potential breeders.  It would also address the problem of low fertility in many of our breeding draught mares. I talked about bringing valuable semen banks within reach of breeders.  I do not mean within reach distance-wise, I mean within financial reach of small breeders or people starting to work in the industry.</P>
    <P>I am always fascinated by the astronomical service fees charged for thoroughbred stallions, figures out of the reach of the general run of breeders.  The introduction of an AI service, using the <Col N="1381" /> best thoroughbreds, must reduce these charges.  I urge the Minister to press ahead for these changes.  If he has to take on the powerful vested interests in the industry, who do not want to see these developments come onstream, then let him take them on.  The national interest demands the most widespread development of a well bred horse industry.  That can only take place with full utilisation of modern techniques and technology like AI, embryo transfer and the use of the latest techniques in genetic improvement.</P>
    <P>Finally, may we wish the Minister luck in this initiative.  This legislation must pass.  Bord na gCapall lost its direction. Towards its end it whiled away its time more like a comic opera farce than a State-sponsored body with a serious duty to an important industry and to the public.  The amazing thing was that the parent Department &mdash; the Department of Agriculture and Food &mdash; did not intervene much earlier to arrest its degeneration into comedy, but not a comedy to generate laughter because the shenanigans spoken about, particularly by Deputy Doyle in her contribution in the other House was no laughing matter.</P>
    <P>We acknowledge the Minister's initiatives in this area.  They are all along the right lines.  Our criticism of some of them might be that they may not go far enough in terms of disadvantaged areas.  Generally speaking, the Minister may be surprised to hear me say this, given some of the criticisms I have made of him and his Department in the past.  What he is doing is very much along the right lines and we wish him luck.</P>
    <P>The horse is very much part of the image of Ireland.  We have a duty to ensure that this industry is developed.  It has tremendous potential.  It is an industry that has become run-down over several generations in this country.  The horse has been identified with the Irish rural scene but nevertheless the Irish draught horse itself is a unique Irish animal.  It had almost become extinct. The measures the Minister is taking and, indeed, the measure taken here today of abolishing an organisation that should <Col N="1382" /> have done more than it actually did &mdash; although it did have its success, too &mdash; are all steps in the right direction.  My party have no difficulty about it.  We support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill we are now discussing repeals the Horse Industry Bill, 1970 and winds up the affairs of Bord na gCapall.  Indeed, it is rather sad to see the demise of Bord na gCapall.  It was set up to promote and develop the non-throughbred horse industry and to advise the Minister on matters relating to the breeding, sale and export of horses.  This was a very wide brief for the new board. One would imagine given the neglected state of the industry at that time that the board had an excellent opportunity of putting the half-bred horse industry on a firm ground and promoting the Irish horse on the world market.  However, for various reasons that did not happen.</P>
      <P>The hopes of the people who set up Bord na gCapall have not been realised. That, of course, is not to say that the board did not have many successes.  They certainly did.  Over the years there were many people involved with the board who were passionately committed to the advancement of the non-thoroughbred horse industry.  They can be thanked especially for setting up a farrier apprenticeship scheme under which over 70 young people became qualified farriers. Indeed, I had occasion a couple of times to present certificates to those people. This, of course, was very timely because the number of farriers was declining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has pointed out that the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders' Association and other interests have organised a new apprenticeship scheme which can be developed to meet the needs both of the thoroughbred and non-thoroughbred horse industry.  Over the years, too, a number of people under the board's guidance were prepared for and passed the equestrian sciences examination.  Of course the board's most important and significant achievement was the foundation of the Irish Horse Register in 1974. This ensured maintaining the highest standards because stallions had to be <Col N="1383" /> approved for breeding.  During the lifetime of the board I noticed that the number of sports horses increased by 50 per cent from 21,000 to 34,000 and the value of exports reached £3 million. Indeed it is heartening to note also that the value of these exports has continued to rise to £4 million in 1988, and long may this trend continue.</P>
    <P>The national programme for development announced by the Minister last November has very admirable objectives. I am sure that with the goodwill on all sides those objectives can be achieved, that breeders can maximise the return and the equestrian and leisure side of the industry can be developed.  The grant of £400 to be paid to the breeder of each pure Irish draught foal registered in the Irish Horse Register is an earnest of the Government's commitment to the industry and will, of course, be an incentive to farmers to become involved and enhance their farm incomes.</P>
    <P>The payment of headage grants for eligible registered mares in all disadvantaged areas in which cattle headage payments are paid is also a very important development.  The grants of £70 per head for the first eight mares and £66 for the next 22 I consider to be very generous.  It will, of course, again enhance agricultural incomes in those disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister in connection with that if the headage payments for non-thoroughbred mares are payable in the less severely handicapped areas as well as the severely handicapped areas.  I would like to know also if the means test applies to those grants as in the case of cattle headage grants because, if it does, I feel it is going to eliminate quite a number of breeders who might be interested but who might be employed in some part-time or full-time work and who would be anxious to keep a mare or two. They might very well be precluded from qualifying for those grants if that means test applies to them as well as to people who get cattle headage grants.</P>
    <P>The grant aid for farmers investing in facilities for leisure activities such as <Col N="1384" /> pony-trekking and horse riding is very welcome.  Because of our love for the horse there is great potential in this area and it will also boost the tourism potential in some areas.  I wish the Minister well in the setting up of an advisory committee to advise on policy planning and co-ordination of the different elements in the national programme.  I hope the people selected will be chosen because of their interest in and commitment to the horse industry and for no other reason.  We have learned a lesson from the board we are now dissolving where, unfortunately, self-advancement by some members of the board has been a contributory factor in the decision to wind up the board's affairs.</P>
    <P>We have a product we can sell to the world.  The Irish horse is renowned worldwide and whether it be wealthy sheikhs in the Far East or millionaires from Texas they have sought out and purchased Irish horses.  The responsibility for this great national asset now lies with the Department of Agriculture and Food.  I hope that priority will be given to the establishment of performance centres and testing centres.  It is also important that marketing centres be set up and that essential guarantees be given to the breeder, the owner and the potential purchaser.</P>
    <P>Overall, I think there is a great future for the non-thoroughbred horse industry. We must be cautious at all times to ensure that the high standards expected of Irish horses are maintained.  If there are problems in the industry they should be identified. There is no better time to do that than now when we are making a new beginning.  Corrective action should be taken to protect and foster this great national asset.  I wish the Minister every success in what he proposes doing.  As I said, I hope we have learned from the mistakes made in the past and that we can continue to promote the Irish horse industry that has made its name on the world stage for so many years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMagnier" hpid="Mr. Magnier Mr. Magnier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magnier</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to debate the important non-thoroughbred sector of the Irish horse <Col N="1385" /> industry.  I know we all share in an enormous sense of pride when Irish participants in international events in this area achieve success.  However, we seem to have far fewer opportunities to celebrate now than we did years ago.  For example, who could forget how we were all glued to our television sets about 20 years ago looking at Dundrum's sparkling performances?  With all the different channels we have now we seem to have no horses to look at.  There is no doubt we are looking at an industry that is in decline.</P>
      <P>Ireland and the Irish people have a long history at the forefront of developments in the international bloodstock industry.  When Bord na gCapall was launched in 1970 it was welcomed nationally. Its establishment was considered enlightened thinking.  Worldwide it was regarded enviously.  Unfortunately, the momentum with which it started off was not maintained and, like a moderate horse, it trained off fairly quickly.  There is no point in dwelling now on the failings of the past.  There were some good moments also.  In the meantime, other countries have not stood still; Holland, Belgium and Denmark, for example, which only began breeding during the sixties using modern methods are now among the most respected producers of performance horses in Europe.  Only last week in Florida, the World Cup for show jumping was won by a Belgian-bred horse and a Dutch-sired animal was runner-up. A major factor in the success of these countries relates to their investment in modern breeding programmes and techniques in the fields of genetics and reproduction.  So far in this country, we have failed to follow suit.  Now, however, we have a new opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish horse is famous worldwide but this heritage is not something which we have a divine right to.  We have to work hard at keeping it; there are others who are trying very hard to take it away from us.  Once it has gone it will be very difficult to recover.  At present we only have the tradition; to maintain it is our responsibility.  It is well recognised that the Irish people and horses work well <Col N="1386" /> together.  All over the world Irish people, trained in Ireland, are running horse farms and training centres.  These people had to go abroad for work.  They go to Australia, the United States and mainland Europe simply because they are the investment areas.  If the investment was here that is where the work would be. We cannot reap where we do not sow.</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i> of 15 April carried two articles of equine note; one highlighted that great Irishman, Thady Ryan, who has emigrated to New Zealand and is crossing Irish draught horses with the New Zealand thoroughbred, demonstrating, if it were necessary, just how popular is the Irish horse.  It is not necessary to have this done in Ireland.  In other words, it can be done in any part of the world where the environment is right and where Irish people are located.  We should try to keep as many of them as possible at home.  We do not have a divine right to this industry. If our people go abroad they seem to do very well doing the same thing, but abroad, unfortunately.</P>
    <P>The second article related to another uniquely Irish breed, the Connemara pony, telling of a western Canadian newspaper with a front cover picture of a Connemara pony, demonstrating the worldwide interest in this native breed and illustrating horse breeding as a noble form of agriculture which blends so wonderfully well with the Irish way of life, with no quotas and limited only by our own ability to produce.  The Minister should ask Teagasc to play a leading role here in making farmers aware of the possibilities that exist.</P>
    <P>The only way forward is a modern scientific approach.  The Minister has announced the setting up of an advisory committee.  This is a most welcome move. We are fortunate that there are people with proven ability in the country who could serve on such a committee. However, it is important that this committee be an effective one, limited to as few people as possible and to people with the right experience.  This committee should include the Irish National Stud which has proven ability and expertise in <Col N="1387" /> the handling and management of stallions and which is not involved in any sectional interest in the half bred industry which was a problem the last time.  The National Stud has all the facilities and infrastructure necessary.  This is a formula which has worked very successfully in France.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be entrusted with the selecting of the committee which I suggest be structured as follows: three members of the National Stud Board, who are his nominees in any event; three members the industry itself would elect and who would be subject to Ministerial approval; and three members the Minister himself would appoint.  The National Stud would then be very involved in the selection and purchasing of stallions and monitoring the stallion programme. These stallions could be based at the stud. They could be farmed out to different areas of the country each year for the breeding season and brought back to the National Stud at the end of each season as this is not a busy time at the stud.  In fact, finding work on a stallion stud in the off-season can be a big problem.  The funding, advising and locating of the stallion programme and the administration and policing of the register could be achieved without disrupting the thoroughbred enterprise at the stud by the relocation of the necessary personnel. It is essential to get this absolutely right. The stallions are half of the herd.  If the semen bank is top class much of the rest will follow.</P>
    <P>Not only would this be an important benefit to the half bred industry but a more vibrant National Stud would create an important asset to the agri-tourism sector which should not be underestimated. There is also an obligation from the point of view of people in the thoroughbred industry to encourage the half bred industry.  Many of the future players and investors in racing start off at the shows or in the half bred industry. The two should mix very well.</P>
    <P>It would also create a vehicle through which people who wish to donate horses to the National Stud could do so.  There <Col N="1388" /> are some people who do very well with certain types of horses in Ireland who may like to give something to the country.  This happens in France and should easily happen in Ireland also. Properly managed, this could very quickly become a world centre of top-class semen.  Imagine the beneficial effect if Michael Osborne had an eye on the half bred industry during his term at the National Stud.  It would have been the difference between success and failure in my opinion.  Registration is an essential part; without it the stock is worthless. The &ldquo;what do you want him to be by&rdquo; pedigree is bad for the national image, not to mention the horse industry.</P>
    <P>The integrity of the register must be kept above suspicion.  The Minister, to his credit, very obviously recognises this and has moved the computerised registration to his own Department. However, if we are to create a centre for the industry I suggest that registration be based at the National Stud where the employees, who are already in the employment of the Department of Agriculture and Food, are specialised horse people.  In other words, they understand the game.  You would get a better result by having the horse people deal with horse people.  The Department would be working in the right environment to get the job done.</P>
    <P>In order to eliminate the abuses I suggest that every horse issued with a passport should be parentage-tested and that no horse be allowed to leave the country unless it is in possession of a passport. The Irish Equine Centre founded by voluntary subscription by the thoroughbred industry is well qualified to handle this testing.  This is an area which could be grant-aided, thus dispelling any fear that may be caused by the use of AI.  Foals whose parentage is proven could be tattooed with a registration number as in the United States or branded as is done in Australia.</P>
    <P>In the thoroughbred industry the use of artificial insemination is rightly prohibited by the International Stud Book Authority.  However, there are no such <Col N="1389" /> controls in the half bred industry.  Artificial insemination is very successfuly used in equivalent breeds in other countries. In the standard bred in the United States it is the accepted method of running the industry and attains a fertility rate which is acceptable alongside the natural method.  Thady Ryan, for example, in New Zealand is quoting a fertility rate of 90 per cent.  It is hard to believe that the industry can survive on a fertility rate of between 50 per cent and 60 per cent.  There is no reason it should not be 80 or 90 per cent.  It would make a huge difference.</P>
    <P>I suggest, therefore, that the use of artificial insemination is essential.  If this is co-ordinated from and managed by the National Stud it would be more professional. The most obvious way to distribute the semen would be through the existing AI network.  The Irish Army Equitation School, founded in 1926, was an instant success.  Reopened after the war in 1945, it has become, through the efforts of its officers and men, much more than a mere ambassador for the country it represents.  In a fledgling nation with no large navy to fly the flag in distant harbours of the world these men have done much more; they have shown what is best in Ireland, demonstrating that Ireland can breed and prepare horses for world-class competition.  One can only speculate as to how much trade they have brought to our shores as a result.</P>
    <P>In a thriving industry this school has an important role to play.  Progeny testing is the equivalent of the race course test for thoroughbreds.  Let the progeny of the selected sires and mares be sent to the Equitation School to be tested and culled where necessary.  It is important not to lose sight of the added value of each horse in training at this point.  The school can help to show the way on how best to achieve this.  I agree there are some other locations in Ireland that do a very good job but the Equitation School could be a blueprint as to how things could be done.</P>
    <P>There are world-class men in this country with great exprience in this industry; to name but a few &mdash; Eddie Macken, Paul Darragh and Noel C. Duggan.  They <Col N="1390" /> could be involved.  I got some information and help from people such as Dermot Forde and others.</P>
    <P>What I really detected was the knowledge and enthusiasm that exists regarding this industry if we can involve the right people.  This is very important.  This programme could very well be linked to a management school or training programme for young people interested in developing skills by using existing facilities to a greater advantage.  This would not cost the earth and it could become a more effectively organised, high quality operation.  Again, this is like the duplication of the National Stud without interfering with the thoroughbred industry.</P>
    <P>Many of us regret the passing of the Presidential Mounted Escort, founded in 1931, expanded in 1945 and disbanded in 1948.  It carried out escort duties for the President on State occasions, employing personnel for the purpose from the Equitation School.  I suggest we look at the possibility of re-establishing it under the auspices of the Equitation School.  It could be used on State occasions and for State pageants.  This would provide a spectacle which could give the industry world-wide attention and, in addition, it would be a boost to the industry at home. It would present an ideal opportunity for honouring and entertaining visiting Heads of State and would be more Irish than showing barefoot children in a make-believe Victorian school.  In contrast, if one could imagine Mrs. Haughey and Mrs. Gorbachev going around Bunratty in something like we see on the television, the Budweiser shires, and the publicity that would have got around the world as opposed to the barefoot children.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by wishing the new programme for the industry well.  The Irish have always had a great love for the horse.  It can justly be called a great natural resource, cherished by all the people in both rural and urban areas.  I support and encourage the measures announced by the Minister to develop the non-thoroughbred horse industry.  I would also like to pay tribute to the Minister for Agriculture and Food for his great <Col N="1391" /> commitment to and knowledge of all parts of this industry.  I recognise, as an example, the sponsorship by Bord Bainne of the Horse Show.  The industry appreciate this and all they have done for it since they have come into office. Despite everything, we still have just about all it takes for a successful non-thoroughbred industry.  What it needs is to have everything and everyone pull together.  I wish the Minister well in getting an effective advisory committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation for the dissolution of Bord na gCapall.  We have gone through what I regard as a period of vagueness and indecision over a number of years.  Breeders have had some difficulty getting a replacement organisation for dealing with registration, inspection, stallion returns and foal marking, etc.  We are fortunate to have a number of breeders who keep non-thoroughbred stock, Irish draught mares for breeding and good show jumpers.  They do this for the love of the animal, they are steeped in tradition and are expert judges in that field. I want this type of breeder protected and given every help to ensure that they stay in the job of breeding.</P>
      <P>There is also a large number of stallion owners who have given a lifetime to the industry, two and three generations of them.  They also must be protected.  Since the number of mares had dropped considerably, it is not a very remunerative business to be in, but their expertise is invaluable.</P>
      <P>Senator Magnier spoke about the introduction of an AI system which could be operated through the AI stations.  If that had to be introduced every stallion owner I know throughout the country would go by the board immediately and with them would go the expertise they have inherited from their fathers and forefathers.  That expertise cannot be taken from a shelf or read from a book; it is something one has or has not.  One is brought up with it from childhood and I want it cherished and preserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to fertility, mating of mares <Col N="1392" /> is a very sensitive operation, indeed, the preparation of a brood mare is a very sensitive operation not alone at the time of mating but in the previous year.  There are times when conception can be easily achieved, and there are times when it is impossible to obtain the type of conception that one would require to ensure that the small farmers of Ireland and the people who have kept the Irish draught mares alive, will be kept in business in the future.  The fertility rate at the moment is in the region of 50 to 55 but if an artificial insemination system is introduced &mdash; and we do not like anything that is artificial &mdash; I think the fertility rate will drop considerably. The expertise, which is not easy to find, of bringing a mare to a stallion at the proper time and ensuring that repeats are checked, is a technique about which I know a little.  It is not easy to ensure that a mare has a foal every year; one is lucky if she has a foal every second year.  I cannot see artificial mating bringing about what might be regarded as increased production and increased fertility.  However, we have to protect the stallion owners who have a long tradition. If any type of embryo or artificial insemination is introduced, it will have to be monitored and curtailed.  I do not disagree with the setting up of a semen bank of high-performance tested animals provided it is utilised in the right way, but we must consider the overall position of the people who have been in the trade and industry for many, many years.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food were responsible for running the horse industry for years and did a very good job in a conservative way.  The numbers were greater in those days and the standard was very high.  Much weeding out was done on nomination day in every town in the country.  There was a very high class team of horse vets and judges and only the best got through in the selection by those men, and hence a good type of animal was chosen for nomination breeding.  I understand there are rumours &mdash; I believe they are more than just rumours &mdash; that the Licensing Act of 1944 may be abolished in the not too distant future.  I would recommend that it be <Col N="1393" /> updated.  Stallions presented for inspection and failing the inspection are allowed, under this Licensing Act, to go back to the farms without any monitoring as to whether they are castrated.</P>
    <P>In the olden days when one presented an animal to be selected as a stallion and it was not chosen, the local sergeant would be notified by the Department and a visit would ensue to ensure that that stallion was castrated at an early date.  It is safe to do this type of work when they are outdoors in April or September but there are times of the year when it is not safe.  If the Licensing Act, 1944, is abolished, a breeder who produces an animal, which in his view might make a good stallion, but who does not pass the selection team test will continue to breed animals without any control and you are back to the days of the scrub bull that we tried to get rid of.  Abolition of the Licensing Act will encourage that type of breeding.</P>
    <P>Blood typing has not taken place over the last two years.  My information is that no stallion has been blood typed in the last two years.  If that is the case, then the type of animals I have referred to which may have good conformation, good bone and good height but which did not meet the requirements of the examination team, will be able to serve animals and their progeny will have to be recorded at a later date.  If there is not continuous blood typing, many animals will come on stream that will have no identification at all.</P>
    <P>There was such a thing as an appendix register.  Where the breeding of the female animal was not known in the Irish draught register, they stitched on an appendix register.  That appendix register was introduced by Bord na gCapall with the Irish Draught Society to give the Anglo-Irish Draught Society and the Northern Ireland breeders an opportunity to set up an Irish draught breed in Great Britain.  That society in now in operation in Great Britain and is known as the Anglo-Irish Draught Society.  The mare if registered on the appendix register, does not have to have any records. <Col N="1394" /> For that reason, when a colt is born it cannot be submitted for examination for a stallion because its breeding is unknown.  It was on that basis that the Anglo-Irish Draught Society was set up. They came to this country &mdash; the capitalists in Britain &mdash; and bought most of our very good Irish stallions and good Irish brood mares and have set up a society on their own.  It has not got the true Irish draught breeding that we have in this country.  I would say to the Department that we must maintain that as we did in the olden days.  In 1918-22 there was a breakdown in the Irish horse register and it is not true to say that Bord na gCapall was the foundation of the Irish horse register.  Of course not.  The Irish horse register was with the Department from the beginning of the century.</P>
    <P>There were dangers involved in the trouble times.  From 1918 up to the truce in 1922, the register was not kept.  In 1925, there was a review of the Irish draught breed because of the inadequacy of the register.  The Irish draught breed at that time needed something to be done about it.  At that time there was a full review of the Irish draught mare.  In 1934 there was another review because the bone in the Irish draught mare went less than nine inches, down to eight and a half to eight inches, which was not in keeping with the tradition of the Irish draught animal.  In 1945, there was another review of the standards of the Irish draught.  It is not true to say that the Department in the olden days did nothing to maintain the Irish draught breed as we know it.  A great deal of credit must be given to the Department for the way they handled the Irish draught breed, which is the foundation of all the equestrian eventers and show jumpers in this country.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Magnier, I shall not criticise Bord na gCapall.  They had their ups and downs and they had their good times and bad times, maybe through no fault of their own.  It is important that we look at the position at the moment.  There is a need for a good job to be done by way of injection of capital and to help to stimulate and revive the breed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1395" /> The setting up of an advisory board to look after the industry is of utmost importance.  I would appeal to the Minister to get the best possible people on the board.  I would not go as far as Senator Magnier's suggestion that they should be chosen from the National Stud or other areas.  The members must be individually selected from the trade and from the industry, from people who know the job. There is nobody fit for the army but the soldier.  A Friesian breeder, a county manager, mart manager or indeed a coop manager should not be selected to look after the Irish horse industry.  It is imperative that we get the people with the necessary expertise.  I would welcome the best possible people on the board. There is plenty of talent available.  There are persons who have been tried and tested and who know what is required to restore confidence in the industry.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is anxious to get this Bill through the House and I will not in any way hold him up.  There is a lot more I could say on the horse industry but I do not think that is necessary.  This is a Bill to abolish Bord na gCapall and that is about the size of it.  I thought I would avail of the opportunity to say something relevant to the trade.  The Irish horse draught is the base and bedrock of all the non-throughbred horse industry and I would appeal to the Minister to ensure that it is protected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it is not a case of having a look at the waterjump, trying to jump it and landing in the middle of it; but I felt that I could not let the opportunity pass without saying a few words, particularly after listening to the interesting contributions from Senator O'Toole and Senator Magnier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that what Senator Magnier said is taken very much to heart, that we are facing up to an industry which he described as one in decline.  If that registers with people at large, as it has obviously registered within the Minister's Department because of the trouble he has taken to try to plan the way ahead or to point the road ahead, then one is <Col N="1396" /> starting from rock bottom and is trying to look at all sorts of new possibilities and new opportunities.  Perhaps it is too much to say &ldquo;rock bottom&rdquo; because we have also heard of the very good work that has been done in the past.</P>
    <P>I would just like to say briefly that I hope that in this discussion about the thoroughbred industry and the refinement of genetic strains, we do not lose sight &mdash; and, in fact, we have not altogether, but there could be a danger &mdash; of the great potential of the Irish horse industry to meet the needs of a changing society.</P>
    <P>In the area of ourdoor activities for young people, there are many schemes to test their endeavour, courage, fitness and endurance but they are confined to the sea, to hill walking, climbing, and trekking on their feet.  There are opportunities to trek on ponies but in the adventure programmes which are increasingly coming into play for youth &mdash; in my own part of the country the Duke of Edinburgh's award comes to mind &mdash; there is, as far as I am aware, no emphasis on the use of the horse or the understanding between man and women and horse as part of the young person's development.</P>
    <P>There are many pony clubs.  These clubs have developed considerably in the North of Ireland in recent years.  Through that form of activity one can gain experience of the equine world and the different perspectives one gets in relation to the physical environment through exercise on the horse and through the relationship with the horse.</P>
    <P>Another point I would like to raise is as a word of warning; when one is emphasising so strongly the need to have the best possible strains in the thoroughbred world, we must not lose sight of randomisation.  While genetic engineering is an important aspect of the new scientific world we are embarking upon, at the same time we can lose a lot of strength and vigour whether we are talking about plant life, human life or animal life, if we forget the value of randomisation in the evolution of the species, the health of the species and its inter-relationship <Col N="1397" /> with its environment.  Do not forget that if you find an old nag that does not look too well and does not meet all the demands of the judge, it may be carrying a lot of recessive genes which have not been expressed but which will be lost forever to the pool of genetic material if we eliminate those that do not meet what we have qualified in our terms at our time in the business as the best.  That is one note of caution.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise what has already been said here, that the composition of the advisory committee seems to be all important.  It goes without saying that one must have the experience of those who work in the National Stud on that advisory committee.  Because of the type of industry it is and its importance and credibility, we must have people of unquestionable integrity.  That goes without saying.  It is necessary to consider the extent of activity that should be increasingly involved if the horse industry in Ireland is to flourish, develop and become a multi-faceted concept.  That will inevitably involve bringing in, if not on the advisory committee, people coopted for the purposes of advising the committee on a whole range of areas which have to do with the horse.</P>
    <P>I am certain that tourism is important and those who are interested in the development of outdoor pursuits are just as important as people who have expertise in showjumping, breeding and so on. How you can use this wider range of interests in the world of the horse and what the horse can represent for society and, at the same time, have an effective advisory committee is something the Minister's Department must address itself to.  One does not ever want to have too big an advisory committee but the committee should be open to receive advice from a range of people who have something to offer to this industry, which has such great potential for the country. The ecologists have something to say about the randomisation of genetics.  The geneticist has a role to play, as are the people who are involved directly in the horse industry.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that we <Col N="1398" /> have 32 counties in this island and not to lose sight of the fact that there is an interest in the horse north of the Border.  I have been informed during the course of the afternoon that if the situation is chaotic here, it is even more chaotic north of the Border.  I would appeal to the Minister to consider the possibility of searching in the North for talent which might be incorporated in this advisory board so that the industry may be expanded beyond the limitations of the Twenty-six Counties.</P>

    <Title>Nobel Peace Prize for UN Peace-keeping Forces: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann offers its congratulations to the UNIFIL forces on receiving the Nobel Peace Prize and particularly notes the contribution of the Irish Defence Forces towards maintaining that peace in many parts of the world for the last 13 years.</P>
      <P>The motion is in error in two places.  It should read &ldquo;congratulations to the United Nations Peace-keeping Forces&rdquo; because they, in fact, and not the UNIFIL forces, were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Secondly, the contribution of the Irish forces has been going on for 30 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for putting down this motion is basically to offer congratulations to our soldiers who, over a period of 30 years have been involved in many parts of the world in a peace-keeping role.  One must immediately ask why Irish soldiers are involved so much? It stems from our neutral position and from the fact that we are a relatively young country, obtaining our independence in 1921.  We, therefore, know the problems that similar countries have and are continuing to have.  If one looks at where these services have been given, <Col N="1399" /> one will see that it is to emerging countries, who are gaining their independence with all the resultant problems.</P>
    <P>Since the Irish peace-keeping forces began service in June 1958, with the United Nations Observer Group in Lebanon, known as UNOGIL, members of the Permanent Defence Forces have contributed almost 32,000 tours of duty to 12 different missions worldwide.  In that 30-year period Irish personnel with the United Nations have lost their lives on four missions: in the Congo where 26 people lost their lives, 16 in action; in Cyprus, where nine people lost their lives; in Palestine two were killed in action; in Lebanon 30 people have been killed, eight killed in action, and one is missing, presumed dead.  Of those killed in Lebanon, five were from the 28th Infantry Battalion which is located in my own county.  They were Private Philip Grogan who died on 10 July 1979, Private Hugh Doherty who died on 27 April 1981, Corporal Dermot McLoughlin who died on 10 January 1987, and most recently on 21 April 1989 Private Arm-strong and Private Walsh.  Also dead from another battalion is Corporal Heneghan from Galway.</P>
    <P>The general perception of our soldiers perhaps is that in a country like Ireland they do not have much to do as soldiers, but they have a vital role to play.  In our country, if necessary, they can be called on to maintain peace.  They are working, particularly those stationed in my own area along the Border, on an ongoing basis.  Only recently, I realised that where we might have one garda at a checkpoint, we require four soldiers, not because it takes four soldiers to protect one garda but because one armed soldier could be easily accosted and perhaps lose the weapon, so it takes one to watch the other.  They are playing a vital role along the Border, a role that all of us would wish would go away, but which is not going away, as yet.</P>
    <P>There have been various ways of acknowledging the contribution made by our soldiers.  This motion is just another one of those ways, that this House would <Col N="1400" /> recognise the contribution of those soldiers. The United Nations has issued various medals from time to time in recognition of service with the United Nations.  The medal which Irish personnel have received for United Nations service has been of one design, that is a medal round in form bearing on the obverse the UN emblem and the letters &ldquo;UN&rdquo; and on the reverse the inscription &ldquo;In the Service of Peace&rdquo;.  The distinguishing feature in United Nations medals from mission to mission has been not the medal itself, which is uniform, but the suspension ribbon.  These specifications are setermined by the Secretary General.  The description of medal ribbons for United Nations peace-keeping missions in which Irish personnel have served is set out in the magazine <i>An Cosantóir</i> of 8 October 1988 and is as follows:</P>
    <P>United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation in Palestine (UNTSO) &mdash; blue background, two narrow white stripes &mdash; UN colours.</P>
    <P>United Nations Military Observation Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) &mdash; varying shades of green to indicate the Himalayan Range and Kashmir Valley with a white stripe to represent the snow-capped mountains. The UN is represented by a UN blue stripe on either side.</P>
    <P>United Nations Observer Group in Lebanon (UNOGIL) &mdash; as for the UNTSO ribbon.  The United Nations medal awarded for serving in the Congo was issued with a blue and white ribbon and Congo bar.  However, in 1963, it was decided that a distinctive ribbon for service with ONUC be issued and a blue and green ribbon with a narrow white stripe was decided on.</P>
    <P>There is the United Nations Temporary Executive Authority in West New Guinea (UNTEA) &mdash; the United Nations Force in Cyprus, United Nations India-Pakistan Observer Mission and the United Nations Emergency Force Middle East medals.  There is also the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, the United Nations Headquarters in New <Col N="1401" /> York, the United Nations Good Offices Mission in Afghanistan and Pakistan and the United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group.  These are uniform medals given by the United Nations but thieir distinguishing mark is the various suspension ribbons that are designed in some way to reflect the areas in which the service was given and for which the medals were awarded.</P>
    <P>The Government have awarded medals to 85 personnel of the Defence Forces in recognition of acts of gallantry and distinguished service associated with the United Nations service.  I quote further from <i>An Cosantóir</i> dated 8 October 1988:</P>
    <P>An Bonn Míleata Calmachte (BMC), the Military Medal for Gallantry, was instituted in 1948 and can be awarded in three classes.</P>
    <P>The medal &ldquo;may be awarded in recognition of the performance of any act of exceptional bravery or gallantry (other than one performed on war service) arising out of, or associated with, military service and involving risk to life or limb&rdquo;.  To date, seven awards of this medal have been made, six 2nd Class and one 3rd Class.  All but one were as a result of incidents associated with United Nations service.</P>
    <P>The Distinguished Service Medal, was instituted in 1964 and can also be awarded in three classes.  This medal &ldquo;may be awarded in recognition of individual or associated acts of bravery, courage, leadership, resource or devotion to duty (other than any such acts or duty performed on war service) arising out of, or associated with, service in the Defence Forces and not meriting the award of An Bonn Míleata Calmachta&rdquo;.  One hundred and two awards of this medal have been made. Eighty of these awards were as a result of United Nations service.  As the time limit for this medal to be awarded is four years from the time of the incident to recommendation, it is possible for the entire Congo mission to be reviewed in the making of the awards.</P>
    <P>Service with five separate United Nations Missions resulted in awards of medals for gallantry and distinguished service as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1402" /> ONUC &mdash; One 2nd Class Military Medal for Gallantry; Four 1st Class Distinguished Service Medals (DSM); Thirty 2nd Class DSMs; Thirty-one 3rd Class DSMs.</P>
    <P>UNFICYP &mdash; One 1st Class DSM; One 2nd Class DSM.</P>
    <P>UNTSO &mdash; One 2nd Class Military Medal fo Gallantry; One 2nd Class DSM.</P>
    <P>UNEF &mdash; One 2nd Class DSM &mdash; this medal was awarded for services with UNTSO also.</P>
    <P>UNIFIL &mdash; Four 2nd Class Military Medals for Gallantry; Two 1st Class DSMs; Six 2nd Class DSMs; Three 3rd Class DSMs.</P>
    <P>The award of the Military Medal for Gallantry to Tropper Anthony Browne is perhaps the most &ldquo;famous&rdquo; of all these awards.  It was awarded in recognition of his exceptional bravery which resulted in his death at Niemba, Republic of the Congo on 8 November, 1960.  The citation to the award was:</P>
    <P>
      <i>&ldquo;he endeavoured to create an opportunity to allow an injured comrade to escape by firing his Gustaf thereby drawing attention to his own position which he must have been aware would endanger his life; he had a reasonable opportunity of escaping because he was NOT wounded but chose to remain with an injured comrade.&rdquo;</i>
    </P>
    <P>The medal was presented to Trooper Brown's father, Mr. John Browne, by the then Taoiseach Mr. Sean Lemass, TD at a ceremony in Collins Barracks on the first anniversary of the Niemba Ambush, 8 November, 1961.</P>
    <P>My reason for saying all of these things is that these are various ways that recognition has been given to soldiers for their work, by the United Nations and by the Government.</P>
    <P>On Wednesday, 12 October 1988 at the Ministerial review of the 64th Infantry Battalion, 57th Unit of the Defence Forces to serve overseas with the United Nations peace-keeping force, the Minister for Defence announced the Government's decision to award a medal for peace-keeping service with the United <Col N="1403" /> Nations.  All personnel who have qualified for the United Nations medal will become eligible for this new medal which will be entitled the Service Medal for peace-keeping with the United Nations. The timing of this announcement, following closely on the award for the Nobel Peace Prize for 1988, has enhanced official recognition of members of the Permanent Defence Force in their contribution to peace-keeping duties with the United Nations worldwide.</P>
    <P>The award of the first service medal for peace-keeping duties with the United Nations is still some six to nine months away.  The necessary regulations and procedures had to be drawn up and the medal design will shortly be going out to tender for manufacture.  At present there are some 8,000 serving personnel who are eligible for the medal and it is likely that approximately an additional 300 personnel will become eligible each year on having completed their first tour of duty with the United Nations.  The medal should be awarded only once to an individual as it is deemed to be the national recognition of those on peace keeping service with the United Nations regardless of the number of tours of duty and the number of different missions he might serve with.  As of now, it is not known how many ex-members of the Defence forces qualify for the medal as there is sizeable duplication in the tours of duty. There is the added difficulty of a change of home address.  In the case of deceased personnel, it is intended to give the medal to the next of kin.  The Minister has now decided to award medals to people who are serving with the United Nations. Therefore, all in all, the services of our peace keeping forces abroad are being officially recognised.  The Taoiseach, in a letter dated 5 October 1988, to Lieutenant General T. O'Neill, the Chief of Staff, said:</P>
    <P>I wish to convey to you and, through you, to all personnel of our Defence Forces my warmest congratulations on the announcement of the award of the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations Peace-Keeping Forces.</P>
    <P>The members of the Defence Forces <Col N="1404" /> who participated in UN missions down the years have shown bravery, integrity and dedication.  Some have laid down their lives in the cause of peace.  They share in the honour of this Nobel Peace Prize awarded to the UN forces in which they have served with distinction for almost 30 years.  The country is justly proud of them.</P>
    <P>The Government are deeply appreciative of all the Defence Forces have done to advance the cause of peace and the standing of Ireland throughout the world.  Please convey our best wishes to all members of the Defence Forces at present on UN service and to their comrades at home who have served with the UN in the past.</P>

        <i>An Cosantóir</i> dated October 1988.  Our motion seeks to offer congratulations to all of these people, past and present.  The United Nations have their own medals as a method of honouring the forces.  The Government have distinguished gallantry medals, the present Minister has instituted new medals and the Taoiseach has offered letters of congratulations.  All of these honours are very poor recognition, if we cannot honour our soldiers here and now by offering them decent terms of employment.</P>

For example, I wonder do many people know that when a soldier completes his service, unlike other <Col N="1405" /> groups he does not receive one and a half times his salary as gratuity, and that he can get as little as £7,000 or £8,000.</P>

All I am going to say is that it is sad that soldiers who have given up to 40 years service to the Army, at home and on peace-keeping duty in many parts of the world &mdash; 32,000 tours of duty in 12 different missions &mdash; find that their retirement pension can be as low as £70 a week and that the gratuity can be as low as £6,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion before us.  When I saw the motion I was a little suspicious of the motives of those who brought it before this House.  I was not going to mention what happened in this House on 4 October, but I am afraid that Senator Loughrey has whetted my appetite for a debate on this particular matter.  I now quote from what I said on the Order of Business of 4 October 1988:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1407" /> Before we go into the business for today, I think it would be appropriate that we should pass to the Minister for Defence and to the Chief of Staff of the Army our sincere congratulations to the United Nations peacekeeping troops on gaining the signal honour of having presented to them the Nobel Prize for peace.  I think it was an inspired choice.</P>
    <P>I went on from there.  That motion of congratulations was seconded by Senator Hogan from Fine Gael and he joined with me in passing the vote of congratulations to the UNIFIL troops.  Senator Loughrey has attempted to bring into this congratulatory motion something which I think is not appropriate to this House.  I do not think it is appropriate that on a motion of congratulations with which this House has already agreed that a note of contention should be brought in which is not relevant to the debate before the House.  If Senator Loughrey had wanted to have a debate on Army pay and conditions we would have accommodated him here and we would have had to answer some of the questions and queries raised.  It would appear from the final comments of Senator Loughrey that the motion was not brought in to congratulate but as a means of going into other areas of the status and the conditions of the Army.</P>
    <P>The UNIFIL force is not an Irish Army force; it is a United Nations force.  The Irish personnel are seconded from the Army.  They are paid for by the United Nations.  They are paid by the Army and, in addition, get United Nations service pay.  They remain members of the Irish Army.  Having criticised to a degree some of the things that have been said by Senator Loughrey, I would have to join with him in congratulating the Irish troops who are serving with UNIFIL, and indeed all the other troops who have served in Lebanon.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the use of UNIFIL troops was an inspired choice.  I have seen the UNIFIL troops at work.  I have been in southern Lebanon on a number of occasions and have seen that in the area where UNIFIL troops are based there is normality in life that is not present in any <Col N="1408" /> other part of that desperately war-torn country.  You see new houses being built, children playing in the streets, people walking on the lanes and streets at night. It does not happen anymore in other parts of Lebanon.</P>
    <P>It did not come about by anything other than the dedication of troops from many nations who are willing to be a buffer between the state of Israel and Lebanon. Of course, one of the problems is that they are in a no-win situation.  Their mandate from the United Nations suggested that they were to be on the border between Israel and Lebanon and, unfortunately, because of the intransigence of the Israeli State they are not allowed to fulfil their mandate.  There is what the Israelis would like to call a buffer zone between the United Nations legal borders of the State of Israel and Lebanon &mdash; the buffer zone extends about 17 to 20 kilometres into Lebanon and it is at the end of this 17 or 20 kilometres range that the UNIFIL force is basically serving.  It is a peace-keeping and peace enforcing force.  These are difficult concepts.</P>
    <P>What is the difference between peace enforcement and peace-keeping?  The UNIFIL troops have attempted at all times to be a peace enforcement and peace-keeping body.  They have been under extreme pressure for many years, in particular, from the Israeli Defence Forces and the LAUI, Lebanese armed and uniformed by Israel.  They have also been under severe pressure from Lahad, the SLA and every type of gangster who was allowed to be brought in and paid for by the Israelis.</P>
    <P>Where I was staying in Tibnin, one evening I asked somebody to give me a call at 5 a.m. the next morning and I was told their would be no need to give me a call because the IDF would come through with their water carriers for the LAUI and the IDF and would start spraying the wadi.  I thought that when they were coming through with water trucks they would be spraying the wadi with water but they were spraying it with machineguns and anything they had on their water carriers and tanks.  They considered that by spraying the sides of the hills, it gave them a certain protection, which protection they did not need.  They were <Col N="1409" /> doing this very early in the morning in an area where the planting of tobacco is extremely important.  Tobacco has to be planted in these areas early in the morning when there is a dew on the ground. It is the only time the tobacco plantations can be worked and spraying them meant spraying with bullets.  Unfortunately many people were killed in this operation.</P>
    <P>The troops who have gone from Ireland to serve in UNIFIL are a credit to this country.  They are a credit to the training they have got in the Army.  They are a credit to themselves and their families. The Israelis do not like the Irish troops and the reason is that the Irish troops do their job very professionally. They are doing their job as far as is possible according to what was set up by the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The motion also congratulates the Forces for maintaining peace in many parts of the world.  In recent times &mdash; within the last six weeks &mdash; I have had talks with Irish troops serving the peace-keeping mission between Iran and Iraq. On the borders between Iran and Iraq there is a peace but it could evaporate overnight.  They are working extremely hard.  I was in the Kurdish area of Iraq &mdash; in Sulamineya &mdash; six weeks ago and there is absolutely no doubt but that they are maintaining observation of the very delicate peace that has come about between Iran and Iraq.  The Irish force is extremely well thought of in that area, as they have been in other areas.</P>
    <P>The United Nations troops on border duty on the Iranian side of the border are not getting the degree of co-operation from the Iranian Government that they should.  It is in the interest of Iran just as much as of Iraq that peace be maintained.  The United Nations Forces are in the area to observe, to report on incidents and whether these incidents are caused by one side or the other.  Friends of mine have served in Afghanistan.  The Irish Army troops in Afghanistan have been well received. They are well trained and are a credit to the United Nations efforts in support of peace.  Unfortunately, over the past 30 years a large number of our Irish troops were killed in an attempt to maintain <Col N="1410" /> peace.  Whether they served in the Congo, Cyprus, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Iraq or Iran, they have acquitted themselves extremely well.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, a large number of families in this country have lost dear ones often in causes they cannot understand. Recently when Mr. Jack Heneghan from County Mayo expressed his regret and sorrow at the death of his son, he queried the reason that our troops were in Lebanon.  He had a right to query it and it was natural for him to do so.  I would say to him and to the other families who have been so tragically bereaved that the Irish troops serving with the United Nations forces for peace have been exemplary and have protected many thousands, and it may run into millions, of people who might otherwise have found themselves in a conflagration or in worse war conditions than they have had to put up with.</P>
    <P>We still have an Irishman serving as an observer in what is probably one of the worst cities for violence in the world at present, Beirut.  We wish him and the other Irish soldiers serving the cause of peace continued success.  I sincerely hope the Irish nation remains proud of the service that has been given by members of the Defence Forces in the cause of peace.  I think at this stage we should also congratulate the members of the Garda Síochána who have gone out to Namibia and wish them every success in their difficult mission.</P>
    <P>Service with UNIFIL is the main reason the United Nations troops got the Nobel Peace Prize, and I think we should ask countries that have an influence with Lebanon to cease to supply war materials to warring factions within the borders of Lebanon.  It is a magnificent country made up of Sunni, Muslim, Maronite, Catholic, whether they be Roman, Greek, Orthodox, or people of no religion.  Lebanon is a founder member country of the United Nations and in this very difficult situation, I think it should get every support possible from the community of nations, so that it will survive as a member of the community of nations, the United Nations.  We appeal here this evening to the countries who are supplying arms and materials for war <Col N="1411" /> to cease doing so, to let the Lebanese decide their own future.  If that happens the efforts of UNIFIL over the past number of years will have been a success.</P>
    <P>We, of course, support the motion before the House this evening.</P>

      <P>Mheas mé go rabhamar ar ais in áit éigin eile ar feadh tamaillín ansin.  Tá an-áthas orm an deis a bheith agam cuidiú leis an rún atá os comhair an Tí, an rún comhghairdis le fórsaí agus trúpaí na Násiún Aontaithe as Duais Nobel a ghnóthú.  Is iontach an rud é go bhfuair na trúpaí, an grúpa daoine sin atá ag iarraidh an tsíocháin a choinneáil ar fud an domhain, an Duais seo agus an pháirt ghníomhach a bhí ag ár muintir, inár bhfórsaí cosanta féin, leis na trúpaí sin.  Sin, b'fhéidir, an chuid is tábhachtaí den rún, ar bhealach, an bhaint atá ag ár bhfórsaí cosanta féin leo, ní hé, ceapaim, le trí bliana déag anuas; it must have been a mistake, or perhaps I misheard Senator Loughrey say 13 years, because I think it must be nearer to 30 years since we first became involved with the United Nations troops.  I remember the tragedy in the Congo.  I remember coming up to Dublin to see the victims of the Niemba ambush the very day they were buried.</P>
      <P>I welcome the motion of congratulations before the House even though, as Senator Lanigan has said, such a congratulatory message was sent previously. It is a good thing that we take cognisance of the importance of the UNIFIL troops, and more especially of the part played for nearly 30 years by our own troops in the forces.  It is important that we take a certain pride in their achievements.  We see the Army's role at times as standing at banks and guarding money being transferred from one place to the other.  We should see them in a different image and light&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bromell</NameTxt>
      <P>I know you are a very strict, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, and I will keep strictly to the motion.  In UNIFIL, we see our Army at work, work at which they are proficient and professional.  We take <Col N="1412" /> a pride in it.  The whole nation takes pride in our forces abroad.  It is perhaps the training, the discipline and the professionalism of our troops that has won the admiration of the other troops with whom they serve and the commanders by whom they are led.  We should add that several commanders from Ireland have been in charge of UN troops abroad.</P>
      <P>As I said previously on a motion on our neutrality, the fact that we are a neutral country gives us an image and a standing in world affairs far above what we could aspire to having regard to our size.  The fact that we are a neutral country gives our Defence Forces and the people we send to UNIFIL a certain standing and they are appreciated much more on that account.  We passed unanimously a motion on neutrality and I think that helps us and our forces abroad.</P>
      <P>It is important that we realise the type of mission to which our forces are sent when they become part of the UNIFIL. They are there on a peace mission, keeping the peace in war areas, in circumstances which are probably unbelievably hard, maybe incapable of solution, something that would remind us of that other area in our own country that seems almost incapable of solution at present.  It is important that they are recognised in these countries as a non-confrontational and a non-colonising force.</P>
      <P>It is recognised that we are the only State in the European Community that was not a colonial force and that we suffered from colonialism.  This is very important in our international role abroad, and particularly in our role outside the European Community.  It is important as well that these forces are not seen as an occupying force but as helping the people in whatever area they are sent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most important things that our Defence Forces have done in UNIFIL is that they have established a liaison with the local people.  This has come across very much, especially in Lebanon at present.  When things get difficult, all the reports show that they have established a relationship with the local people who look to them for protection, and see them as their protectors.  This is <Col N="1413" /> very important for our own forces and reflects credit on them and the nation in general.</P>
    <P>When I see the work being done by our forces abroad as part of UNIFIL the thought sometimes strikes me, as I am sure it strikes many others also, as to what might have happened had we been successful in the late sixties and the early seventies, especially when the present President of our country, Dr. Hillery, was Minister for Foreign Affairs and appealed to the United Nations for a UN force in the North.  The &ldquo;might have beens&rdquo; of history are things we can never bring to a conclusion.  Would the situation today in the North be at least somewhat better had there been a force such as the forces we send out to other difficult spots in the world brought into the North 20 years ago?  The question again arises, since we have been so efficient in sending our people out to these other troubled spots, is it perhaps time to ask the British not to use the old cliché that it is an internal problem?  Our own army would not be involved, but should we again ask the United Nations to provide a force in the North which might help bring about peace and reconstruction there?</P>

    <Title>Bord na gCapall (Dissolution) Bill, 1988: Second Stage (Resumed) and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Senators who contributed to the debate on this Bill.  There was unanimity on all sides of the House about the desirability of establishing a development programme for the non-thoroughbred horse industry.  There were very positive contributions by all Senators concerned.  Apart from the overall development, there were some suggestions with a great deal of flair attached to them.  I mention in particular Senator Magnier, who suggested that the presidential escort be re-established and <Col N="1414" /> that the colour provided by this escort and the trappings surrounding it would not alone show off the country to good effect but would be a great advertisement for the Irish horse.  I will bring the suggestions and recommendations made by the various Senators to the attention of the Minister and the officials in the Department.</P>
      <P>There was a genuine concern for the non-thoroughbred horse industry.  It was realised that the industry had gone into decline, and particularly the foundation stock of the Irish draught sector.  The number of foals last year, for example, was less than 100.  That is getting very near extinction for a long established and traditional breed in Ireland.  It is the foundation stock for our whole sport horse industry.  It is about time we put a development programme in place, not alone to resuscitate this industry but to get it on a very sound footing.</P>
      <P>The point was made by several speakers that the Irish horse is much more than just a sector of Irish agriculture and a natural resource industry.  It reflects well on the country.  It is one of the few distinctly Irish assets we have that we can be proud of internationally.  We perform well in international arenas with the Irish horse.  I know from travelling to other countries on industrial and food matters that often in the managing director's office I am asked: &ldquo;Tell me about The King of Diamonds.  Is there much of that strain left in the country?&rdquo; Often they would have more knowledge than myself of the attributes of the King of Diamonds and other very famous stallions and bloodlines in Ireland.  That is particularly true in the United States, the UK and in Germany.  In Germany they have the highest regard for the various attributes of the Irish horse and are very familiar with it.  It does a tremendous amount of good for Ireland's reputation as a country taking its place in the international arena. I want to assure Senators that I will have full regard to their contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concern was expressed by Senator Connor and a number of others in the House in relation to the advisory committee and the horse industry.  Rightly, it was pointed out that this should not be a <Col N="1415" /> committee for party hacks, county managers, county librarians or anybody like that but should be composed of people who had made a contribution to that particular industry, people who are renowned not alone in Ireland but internationally for their expertise and the knowledge they have built up over generations as practitioners in the various sectors of the sport horse industry. Regard will be paid to that.  I mentioned that in my speech, that they will be people of the very highest calibre.</P>
    <P>There are a number of interests in the sport horse industry in Ireland.  Those interests &mdash; about seven or eight of them altogether between riding schools, Irish draughts and various other organisations &mdash; have been asked to nominate a suitable person or persons for the Minister's appointment.  It is envisaged that the Minister will make a number of other appointments, including somebody from the Department of Agriculture and Food itself.</P>
    <P>The suggestion made by Senator Robb that we should have a look at somebody from the north of Ireland will be brought to the Minister's attention by me.  At the Horse Show here each year, and indeed at various shows around the country, breeders from the North participate and are long-established participants.  In fact, the Irish Horse Register is maintained jointly by the Department of Agriculture here and the Department of Agriculture in the north of Ireland.  There is therefore already a tremendous amount of interaction between both Departments and both areas.  Veterinary surgeons from the North take part in the inspection of stallions for the approved stallion list.  There is therefore a lot of liaison between north and south.  It is a worthy suggestion that we think about someone from that area to represent on the advisory committee the people concerned.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey was concerned about headage payments.  One of the things done in the development programme is to make headage payments available not alone in the severely handicapped areas but in all the disadvantaged areas where the beef cow scheme applies.  That is at the £70 higher rate for all disadvantaged <Col N="1416" /> areas, including severely handicapped and less favoured areas.  I am not quite certain what the position is in relation to the off-farm income.  I tried to make contact with Castlebar where they deal with the off-farm income matter, but it was too late in the evening.  There is no reference in my notes to off-farm income, but I will communicate with the various Senators who contributed in relation to that matter.</P>
    <P>The committee will have sub-committees to advise the Minister on matters like inspection.  Senator M. O'Toole expressed grave reservations about the abolition of the 1934 Horse Breeding Act.  He was fearful of the fact that animals that would not be up to standard in relation to conformation and other physical attributes would, having failed the inspection, return to their farms and become part of the reproduction system. One needs quality in whatever area of activity one is involved in.  Certainly in the horse industry people are not interested in poor quality hacks of any kind.  We need to have superior quality in Ireland.  The advisory committee will be asked to address that problem urgently.  The Bill has made progress through the Dáil and will be coming to the Seanad very shortly.  Senators will therefore have another opportunity to contribute on that matter very shortly.</P>
    <P>Reverting again to Senator Magnier's suggestion in relation to the composition of the advisory committee, he made suggestions in relation to the National Stud.  That matter has not been addressed so far.  The merits or otherwise of having the National Stud represented on the advisory committee is something that I will bring to the attention of the Minister and the Department.</P>
    <P>I think that covers most of the matters raised.  There was unanimity in relation to the development of the horse industry. The opportunity was taken in this debate on the dissolution of Bord na gCapall to have those expressions of views made. There was also a suggestion that the Army should become involved to a greater extent through the Army Equitation School.  I will bring that matter to the attention of the Minister <Col N="1417" /> for Defence, whose responsibility it is in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>
    <P>Bill put through Committee, reported without amendment, received for final consideration and passed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) the proceedings of the Seanad of Wednesday, 10th May, 1989, be televised in edited form by Radio Telefís Éireann under the same conditions (in so far as they are applicable) in operation for sound broadcasting as laid down in the resolution of the House of the 8th July, 1987,</P>
      <P>(ii) the resolution of the House of the 8th July, 1987, providing for the edited sound broadcasting of the proceedings of the Seanad and Oireachtas Committees by Radio Telefís Éireann be extended for the lifetime of this Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this motion I would like to give an explanation to the House about what happened last week.  It was suggested that I was withdrawing this motion because certain people outside this House did not want this motion to appear and that there were difficulties about it.  My difficulty last week was that when I came to Dublin I was approached by people from the media &mdash; radio, television and newspapers &mdash; suggesting that there were certain rumours going around the House as to the attitude of various people towards the televising of the opening of the new Chamber and the business on that particular day.  I felt it was necessary, because of the innuendo and rumours that were being spread, that I should have a look at the facts.  I felt that my authority, as Leader of the House, would <Col N="1418" /> have been totally undermined if there had been any truth in those stories.</P>
    <P>As I said on that day, the motion would appear and remain on the Order of Business. It is before us this evening.  On examination I found that, unfortunately, rumours breed rumours and that we should never do anything but discount them.  They do nothing for the credibility of the people who spread them or for the people who try to extend them.  The purpose of the motion is twofold.  It is to authorise the edited televising by RTE of the Seanad proceedings on Wednesday, 10 May, the first day's sitting in the reconstructed Seanad Chamber.  It is an exciting day for the House.  It is a day we have all been waiting for for some time. Equally, we wish to extend the lifetime of existing arrangements for radio broadcasting to the end of this Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>And that we will all be there for a long time without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no worries that we will all be here for quite a long time. In regard to televising, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges felt that televising on 10 May was an appropriate way to honour our return to the Seanad Chamber.  It is a once off event.  It is specifically to commemorate our first day's sitting in the new Chamber.  It is a separate matter altogether from whatever arrangements are finally agreed as to the permanent televising of the Seanad proceedings which, in all probability, will be in conjunction with the Dáil and Oireachtas Committees.</P>
      <P>The Committee on Procedure and Privileges are favourably disposed to televising the Seanad on a permanent basis but we are not discussing that here this evening.  We are discussing a once-off televising event.  Hopefully, this once off televising of an ordinary day in the Seanad, even though it be in our rebuilt Chamber, will give a lot of our detractors cause to rethink.  For that reason alone, I particularly welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The televising of the proceedings of 10 May is an historic first.  Up to now any special events, such as an address to both Houses by a visiting Head of State or <Col N="1419" /> visiting Prime Minister, have been televised. These occasions have been few and far between &mdash; four in all.  The televising of proceedings represents a unique opportunity for the Seand to put its best face forward.  I am not speaking about &ldquo;best faces&rdquo; in terms of what people can do in getting rid of 5 o'clock shadow or whatever.  We must do so to take on the critics who say, usually out of ignorance, that the Seanad should be abolished, and to redress the imbalance where for too long, the Upper House has been regarded as the poor cousin of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for the sitting of 10 May are to be finalised shortly between the group leaders and the Whips.  They have already met.  The technical details so far as possible have been arranged from our side.  Unfortunately, I do not know exactly what arrangements have been made from the television side because we have had no communication from them.  I presume they will do an excellent job as has been done by RTE each week in &ldquo;Today in the Oireachtas.&rdquo; The programme format will essentially be the same as the existing radio broadcasts. The same restrictions will apply to the latter as apply to the future use by RTE in rebroadcasts.  Nobody need worry that film or sound which might be produced here next Wednesday could be used in an inconsequential way.  There will be inconveniences for Members next week but I do not think they will be of any significance.  At least there will not be the same inconvenience for not alone the Members but for staff that there was over the past number of months.</P>
    <P>I have great pleasure in moving this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to support this motion.  At the outset, I thank the Leader of the House for giving us a full explanation of what happened last week.  Indeed, there were strange rumours floating around the House why the motion was not moved last week.  I am very happy &mdash; and I was at the time &mdash; to accept as I always would, the assurances of the Leader of the House that the situation was as he said.  I am <Col N="1420" /> glad that particular item was cleared up very speedily after the Order of Business last week.  We now all know that what happened was one of those accidents caused by a breakdown in communications at some level rather than anything sinister on anybody's part.  I suppose, in the slightly jittery atmosphere of these times, that this may have slightly pre-dated the slight case of jitters around at the moment.  These things can happen in a House like this or in the Joint Houses. There is no greater place in Ireland for rumours of various sorts than this complex of Houses.  Sometimes one needs to be away from these environs to get an objective view of things.</P>
      <P>I have great pleasure in welcoming the substance of the two parts of the motion here this evening.  First, it is a matter of great relief and joy to all of us that we will be leaving this ante Chamber which has housed us now for two or three years. We have operated in very cramped conditions in an atmosphere which is not, and was not, conducive to what is the second House of a national Parliament. All of us &mdash; the Cathaoirleach, the staff, reporters and Members &mdash; have shown great patience over the last two and a half to three years putting up with our conditions.  Those of us who have seen the restored Chamber know that the wait was probably worthwhile.  The Chamber we are going back to next week is, as we will see next week, a great credit to all who are involved with its restoration.  It is entirely appropriate that our first day back should be televised and that the Irish public should be given an opportunity to see the Seanad Chamber and also to participate in the activities of the Seanad on that historic day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly hope that the move to have the proceedings of both Houses broadcast regularly on television is not very far away.  The attitude that radio and television should not have access to Parliament is very much an outdated one. The Parliament is open to the public. Technology has made it possible for the proceedings of Parliament to be heard and seen almost as they happen throughout the country.  It is a very real extension of democracy that we are now moving in <Col N="1421" /> this direction, and I hope we move in this direction with great speed.</P>
    <P>As the Leader said, it is a one-off day next week.  I certainly hope that on that day, we will show the best side of the Seanad.  The group leaders have met.  We have drawn up the procedures for the day.  I am sure they will be adhered to and that the public will get a view of the type of constructive work that makes up most of the timetable of this House.</P>
    <P>I am glad it is the Seanad that is the first House to be televised.  We were the first in terms of radio broadcasting.  We always &mdash; this is not in any way an invidious remark &mdash; have been a bit more open, adventurous and enlightened than those in the other House on matters of this kind.  I look forward to a time in the near future when the proceedings of both Houses will be broadcast on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>On the question in the second part of the motion to continue with the sound broadcasting of proceedings here, I would like to pay a tribute to the editorial staff in RTE who carry out this work on a daily basis.  There were many people in the early stages who were suspicious that there would be editorial bias, that there would not be fair play, that there might be favouritism or there might be distortions of some kind in the editorial control of broadcasting.  I have to say, and I think everybody would agree with me, that the editorial staff in RTE have been scrupulously fair in the way in which they have edited and presented the proceedings of this House.  My only complaint &mdash; it is a strong complaint but it is not the fault of the editorial staff of RTE &mdash; is that the broadcasts are too short; that there is not enough time given and that the proceedings in this House can be relegated to a point which their substance might not always warrant.</P>
    <P>I hope as we move into the era of a greater number of radio stations we may have a situation where the proceedings of both Houses will be broadcast in full. That happens in other countries.  There would be a market for it; it would not be very expensive and it would greatly extend the right of access of the public to what is happening in the Houses of <Col N="1422" /> Parliament.  I hope we are coming to that stage.  I believe there would be a ready market for that type of broadcasting and it certainly would not be expensive.</P>
    <P>On the question of coverage of this House generally, I have to note the disappointment that has been expressed by the Leader of the House on a number of occasions about the absence of coverage of this House in <i>The Irish Press</i>, the small amount of coverage in the <i>Irish Independent.</i> Conversely, may I pay tribute both to <i>The Cork Examiner</i> and <i>The Irish Times,</i> both of which are very diligent in their coverage of the activities of this House.  They are diligent, accurate and they deserve to be commended for the effort they put into ensuring that the activities here are reported.</P>
    <P>I am very happy to be associated with the motion proposed by the Leader of the House and to report also that there was general agreement as to the rules and regulations for next week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to get an opportunity very briefly to welcome this motion.  I am also very pleased that we are moving back to the other Chamber because it has been very difficult for everybody in this room, for the Cathoirleach, for the Members, for the Clerk and his Assistant and indeed the members of the press.  It is marvellous that this move coincides with the first televising of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to pay tribute to the excellent job which was done by Radio Éireann in editing the reports.  I ask myself with regard to the sound broadcasting and the televising if it brings any benefit to the House, and I am sure that it does.  I believe the public have to know what is going on here.  The broadcasting will enhance the reputation of this House. It must do that, but Standing Orders and the proceedings in this House do not lend themselves to what I would regard as modern television programmes.  Other Members have spoken about this in the past.  For example, with regard to Second Stage debates, it should be possible to come in more than once.  Very often in the course of the debates a Member makes a point which is worthy of following up but if somebody has already spoken on that <Col N="1423" /> Stage he or she cannot come in again. That should be looked at, even to the extent that perhaps the time might be reduced.  Also, it should be possible that Members of the Seanad should get information as in the Dáil.</P>

I am simply saying that at this stage when we are moving into the era of television it is time to take a look at this House and see if the rules are outdated. I believe they are.  Matters of an urgent nature could be taken up in this House but it is not possible to do so at the moment.  I simply want to make that point and I feel that it is relevant.  All of us in this House would want to feel that the image projected would be a proper one.  What I am saying is that it would take tremendous editing of long speeches to extract what is considered best for transmission.  It would be desirable that at this stage stage, or very shortly, we would be able to take a look at the procedures in this House.  It may be a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges but at least we could make a recommendation to them.  In doing that it would not alone result in good television but it would also help the workings of this House.  I welcome the motion.</P>

      <P>I would also like to be associated with many of the remarks that have been passed with regard to the assistance of the staff in having us settle into this Chamber.  Certainly, it has been far from comfortable for any of us, the staff, ourselves as elected Members and the press.  More particularly, my greatest regret over the past couple of years is that we have had many schoolchildren visit the Houses of the Oireachtas and it was a source of great disappointment to the teachers and to the students that they were unable to visit and witness the Seanad proceedings during the time we have been out of the Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has never been easy for school groups to visit the Seanad because they have to come right through the House from the Dáil Chamber and into the Seanad Chamber but at least a percentage of <Col N="1424" /> them could be facilitated when we were in the other Chamber.  I have no doubt that there is still the same public gallery in the new Chamber.  I have not seen it but I am sure it is still there, and I hope that every effort will be made to have as many school groups as possible visit the Seanad when it is sitting.  We are not always sitting, of course, when school groups visit Leinster House and I have been at the receiving end when these children were disappointed they could not visit the Seanad Chamber.  I hope many more of them will be able to visit in the future.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word of appreciation to the Cathaoirleach for keeping us fully informed of all the proceedings.  There were big partitions in position and we did not seem to be able to get on the other side of them but the Cathaoirleach kept us fully informed as to what was happening on that side.  I am glad we are all here to witness our return to the Chamber and that the move was possible in the lifetime of this Seanad.  It is inevitable that some Senators will not be members of the next Seanad so I hope we will be in our new Chamber for some time to come and that will not be out on the hustings too quickly.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
