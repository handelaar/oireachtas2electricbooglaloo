      <P>I have notice from Senator Donie Cassidy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>the need for the Minister for the Environment to make moneys available for a new treatment plant for Castlepollard, County Westmeath as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator David Norris of the following matter:</P>
      <P>the need for the Minister for Education to fulfil her commitment to the development of a new school in Waterford Street, Dublin 1.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Joe Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>the urgent need for the Minister for Education to clarify the position in regard to the reconstruction of the Primary Model School in the grounds of the Department of Education, Marlborough Street, Dublin, in view of the long delay in providing permanent accommodation for the school children of the parish of the Pro-Cathedral.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Cassidy, Norris and Costello as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matter raised by Senator Cassidy and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Norris and Costello may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended that we take Item Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 today and <Col N="69" /> it is intended that we take all Stages of Item No. 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise one or two issues for information on the Order of Business.  First, can the Leader of the House indicate to us that Private Members' Time will be on the Order Paper next week?  Secondly, can he as a matter of urgency move to have the Committee on Procedure and Privileges put in place as soon as possible as there is a backlog of outstanding business to be tackled?  Thirdly, is he able to indicate to us that there will be a meeting of the Whips and that these meetings will take place on a regular basis so that the orderly planning of the business of the House can be proceeded with?  Can he, as soon as possible, give us some indication of the programme of legislation which he intends to bring before the House during the course of this session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Following on a number of the issues, first of all, I want to ask again, as I asked last week, that the Leader of the House would indicate to us the programme of legislation which it is intended to be taken by the House over this period.  To anticipate his response, I know he does not have a duty on the Order of Business to lay out a programme for the next number of months but in terms of the orderly planning of business it was common for him on previous occasions to give some indication at least as to what legislation we might expect.</P>
      <P>I would also like to query why it is that there is not any Private Members' Time this afternoon.  Traditionally between 6.30 p.m. and 8 p.m. on Wednesday afternoon there was Private Members' Time.  Perhaps for some reason it is forgotten about this afternoon and we can immediately address it but I would like to hear the response of the Leader of the House on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, circulated with the Order Paper we have got a supplementary Order Paper which includes Items 4a and 4b which I take it will be taken after the Children Bill.  Is that the intention?  I would like to get clarification as to why <Col N="70" /> membership of the Committee of Selection does not include a member of the Independent group.  Perhaps these are all things which could be dealt with but rather than create a row and in the interests of good order I just raise the matters at this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>As you can see from Senator O'Toole's conciliatory speech, it is not the intention of the Independents to start this session in an adversarial way.  I also do not wish to do that.  I would like, first of all, to reiterate that point about Private Members' Business.  It is very strange that we have not got one and a half hours as we always had in the form of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or Independent motions.  I hope this is not a precedent. Maybe the Leader of the House could answer that for me.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he would consider taking Item No. 11 today.  It is a Bill which was put down in my name and other Independent Senators about the abolition of the death penalty.  As it is part of the Programme for Government and the Progressive Democrats who are now Members of this House are so enthusiastic about it, perhaps the Leader of the House could give us a date when that particular Bill will be taken.  Otherwise I shall be proposing that it be taken but I do not wish to do that today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my voice to that of Senator Ross in urging that an indication be given when the Bill removing the death penalty will be taken because this is a matter on which there would be very general agreement.  It has been the subject of an international conference here recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like also to say I am sorry there is not an opportunity provided on the Order Paper &mdash; perhaps this can be looked at during the afternoon, I will certainly seek to raise the matter under Standing Order 29 &mdash; to discuss the industrial dispute that is complicating the affairs of the House.  It is most important that an opportunity of some kind should be provided.  I see the Cathaoirleach <Col N="71" /> beginning the facial process that will lead towards extinguishing my contribution but I will confine myself to saying that I hope to raise the matter under Standing Order 29.  It is very important that we look into it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Many questions have been raised.  There is nothing subterfuge about the fact that we do not have Private Members' Time today.  It is because we have to deal with emergency legislation which is of grave importance.  We will revert to the normal practice of having Private Members' Time each week from now on.</P>
      <P>As far as the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is concerned, the supplementary Order Paper to enable the setting up of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges has been circulated but, due to an error, the name of Senator O'Toole has been omitted from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a grievous error.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a certain mental block in certain places when Senator O'Toole's name has to appear on paper. I certainly agree with the Leader of the Opposition in this House that regular meetings of the Whips should take place. This is very necessary for the orderly running of business in the House.  As far as is possible, if the Leader of the Opposition here and myself can meet on a regular basis as well, that would be of benefit to the ordering of business in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to a programme of legislation, there are a number of Bills which have not yet come from the other House which we will be taking.  There is a problem in that a number of Bills which we dealt with here are going through the other House.  If Senators give me a week I will come back on this.  I will not suggest at this stage, or at any other stage, that I will give a programme of legislation that will continue over a month or six weeks <Col N="72" /> period.  It is not possible to have that done and it will not be done.  I make no promises on that, solemn or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I have covered the points raised by Senators Manning, O'Toole and Ross except for Item No. 11.  Senator O'Toole and Senator Norris raised that point and I will discuss that with them later.  We are meeting tomorrow.  I wish to inform the House that we will be taking Item Nos. 6 and 7 tomorrow, the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Regulations, 1989 and Report No. 88 from the National and Economic Social Council.</P>

    <Title>Broadcasting of Seanad Proceedings: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the following arrangements for the sound broadcasting of the proceedings of the Seanad, and which were in operation in the last Seanad, be adopted:-</P>
      <P> (1)  that Radio Telefís Éireann be authorised to recommence broadcasting of the proceedings of the Seanad and Oireachtas Committees on a pilot basis for a further period of 12 months, provided that such broadcasting proves satisfactory throughout that period;</P>
      <P>(2) that such broadcasting be reviewed on an on-going basis by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges;</P>
      <P>(3) that such broadcasting be in any of the following forms:</P>
      <P> (i) in edited form in Radio and Television News bulletins and current affairs programmes,</P>
      <P>(ii) in edited form in a &ldquo;Today in the Seanad/Oireachtas&rdquo; type programme,</P>
      <P>(iii) in edited form in a &ldquo;This week in the Committees&rdquo; type programme,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> (iv) occasional live broadcasts of major debates of events in the Seanad or in Committees subject in each case to the prior approval of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges;  </P>
    <P>(4)  that recordings should not be used in programmes of light entertainment, political satire or in party political broadcasts;</P>
    <P>(5) that copyright of the material be retained by the Houses of the Oireachtas;</P>
    <P>(6)  that Radio Telefís Éireann archive material in accordance with their usual practice;</P>
    <P>(7)  that Radio Telefís Éireann be empowered to sell the recordings to foreign broadcasting stations at an appropriate charge subject to a formal agreement between Radio Telefís Éireann and such foreign broadcasting stations that the recordings shall not be used in programmes of light entertainment, political satire or in party political broadcasts;</P>
    <P>(8)  that Radio Telefís Éireann devote a proportion of broadcast coverage to proceedings of Oireachtas Committees; and</P>
    <P>(9)  that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges monitor progress of the arrangements and be the body to consider any complaints from Senators about material broadcast. </P>
    <P>It gives me pleasure to propose this motion.  I will not delay the House by making a long speech on it but I feel that the programme edited by RTE over the past number of years has been of an exceptional nature.  There are very few in this House who could complain about the lack of proper coverage on it.  It is a programme that has a wide audience.  It is amazing the number of people who listen to it in the evenings and there is also programmes at the weekend.  It gives me great pleasure to propose the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>An amendment has <Col N="74" /> been tabled to Item No. 1 by Senator Joe O'Toole and Senator Brendan Ryan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In the second line to delete the word &ldquo;sound.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not do this lightly but there are obvious reasons why it is important.  One is in order to facilitate the televising of the proceedings of this House.  The last time we discussed this matter we fell into disorder.  I would like to make a few points.  The broadcasting of Oireachtas proceedings some years ago was an initiative taken by the Upper House. That initiative was taken some time after quite a lot of disagreement from the Lower House which for some reason is tied into it.  The present arrangement for the televising of the proceedings of the Oireachtas is left completely in the hands of the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I want to stress that point because many Members of this House do not realise that and have been misled on the issue.</P>
      <P>Some Senators believe that there is a representation from this House in the decisions that are being taken to broadcast the proceedings of the Oireachtas.  I want to put it on the record that that is not true.  The outgoing Committee on Procedure and privileges endeavoured to have a representative of this House on the committee but it was not allowed for the superficial reason that it would slow down proceedings.  That was a bit difficult to take considering that we had made the running on this and that we already had a decision of the previous Committee on Procedure and Privileges to facilitate the televising of the proceedings of this House.  We met representatives of RTE and discussed the matter, as members of the outgoing Committee on Procedure and Privileges will be well aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite all that, having taken a decision at an earlier time that we would go ahead with televising the proceedings of this House, somebody from the other House intervened and we had some difficulties which led to a lot of hassle.  In <Col N="75" /> order to stop that happening in the future, I now wish, precisely along the lines indicated by the motion, to leave this matter to this House to decide for itself.  If there is to be any kind of a joint decision between both Houses then it should be done by some form of joint committee of both Houses which is quite acceptable.</P>
    <P>At the moment, as I understand it, on some occasions the Clerk of the Seanad can be present at some of the meetings of the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privileges who are dealing with this.  That is my understanding.  I do not wish to involve the Clerk of the House in the business.  We do not have an input.  As an autonomous decision making House about our own business I would ask that this be taken on board.</P>
    <P>It is a very serious amendment.  It is an amendment that in a sense allows us to assert our rights to make decisions about the recording and the televising of our own proceedings.  I am sorry there was not more notice of the amendment but there was some confusion as we did not have the normal meeting about the business to be taken.  This is something which would, first of all, put pressure on movement on this issue, secondly, it would give the kind of access which we discussed before and, thirdly, it would bring this House into the forefront of public debate on legislation and other issues.</P>
    <P>This amendment does not in any sense commit the House to doing anything.  It is not a decision to televise proceedings. It merely facilitates the discussion and the decisions on this particular issues and allows the Committee on Procedure and Privileges under the terms of the motion to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I welcome the Cathaoirleach on his first day of ordinary business.  I have considerable enthusiasm in supporting Senator O'Toole's amendment, not just because I agree with him on this specific issue but because this motion could do with a considerable and more dramatic amendment.  I would <Col N="76" /> invite the Members to think of how it would read if we had substituted newspapers for sound broadcasting and the restrictions we would be imposing on them.</P>
      <P>This motion even as amended &mdash; I am quite happy to support the amendment &mdash; is the sort of thing that guarantees that we are taking ourselves too seriously. Why should our proceedings be used in satire?  If we generate the sort of things that create satire, why should it not be used in light entertainment?  What sort of precious species are we that we cannot survive with the public sense of humour? I cannot understand what is so precious about us.</P>
      <P>It is not because of the prestige of this House that I believe it should be televised but because it is time that politicians and parties recognise the realities of modern communications which is that television exists.  It is not that we should let it in here but that it is part of the world.  The more we keep ourselves away from it the more we give an impression, whether it be this House or the other House, that we are not part of the world that, as I said earlier, we are some sort of precious species in danger of eradication, who cannot stand the light either of television publicity or the collective public sense of humour.  It is time to cop ourselves on and realise what era we live in.</P>

      <P>I certainly welcome this motion as one of the Senators who attended the first meeting in 1981.  I recall in 1983-87 when I chaired the sub-committee there were not many people enthusiastic about what was said in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am a strong supporter of the broadcasting of the Houses.  If there is a wrong image given of this House and the other House at times some people serving in them should take a look at themselves and wonder why there is the wrong image of themselves outside the Houses.</P>

      <P>It was meant for the Senators.  In recent times the Seanad, <Col N="77" /> which to me is absolute and sacred, has been given the wrong impression outside. Broadcasting has done quite a lot for this House.  I was saddened by a comment made as recent as last week about this House and what was not achieved in previous Seanaid.  A close colleague of mine whose opinion I valued, the former Senator Mary Robinson saw reform of this House as essential.  Everybody here, whether we decided to vote with the former Senator Robinson or not, appreciated her opinion.  In recent times because of broadcasting the people have become aware of some of what goes on here. I make an appeal here this evening in supporting this motion, that after the new Committee on Proceedures and Privileges is set up, an all-party group should meet RTE and see if we can get longer broadcasting time.  Local radio has brought the Seanad closer to the people and we deserve more time.</P>
      <P>I realise the other House takes most legislation.  In the last Seanad two of the most powerful pieces of legislation processed through the Oireachtas were initiated here, the Companies Bill and the Insurance Bill.  It was a little unfair the small amount of braodcasting time those two Bills got on RTE because we had two Ministers who came in here when both very important Bills were being amended.  The role of the Seanad in those pieces of legislation was not made clear.</P>

      <P>I am only asking for something in the future to improve this House.  We should ask RTE if they could give us a little more broadcasting time. Somebody made a suggestion when this <Col N="78" /> was discussed here before, that maybe it was the wrong time for people to hear what was going on in the Dáil and in the Seanad.  We have people outside who are not elected to any body judging the Houses and our workload.  These people get more time on radio and more publicity generally than this House.  I do not have to name any individual.</P>
      <P>I ask for the co-operation of the other parties that in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges we should try to take this a step further and try to get more time for the Seanad.  I feel the people in the other House are well able to look after themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very straight-forward motion and, of course, we are happy to support it.  I agree with virtually everything Senator O'Toole and Senator Honan have said.  I do not see how the amendment from the independent group will bring us that much closer to the objective outlined by Senator O'Toole. Perhaps he could explain to me what the amendment would achieve, I would be happy enough to support it but I am not clear at this stage.  My own feeling is that this is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
      <P>I, too, am very concerend that the plans for the regular televising of the Houses of the Oireachtas have to a certain extent been hijacked by the other House, that in spite of very strong representations made by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, backed by all parties and groups in the last Seanad, that we have fallen behind.  My own feeling is that there is all-party agreement on this. I would ask that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges take this up as a matter of urgency and get clarification. That certainly would make me happy on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to RTE for the very fair editing of the proceedings of this House.  There have been no complaints from any side.  People may feel that what they have to say is too short, that they do not get sufficient airing. Nonetheless, the fairness of RTE is not in question.  What is in question is that <Col N="79" /> the proceedings of this House can be unnecessarily squeezed out even when there are Bills of major importance before this House or when there are Private Members' debates on matters of great topicality.  I appeal to RTE to give a longer period of time for the reports from the Oireachtas, especially when there are matters of major importance being discussed.</P>
    <P>I want to raise the absence of any mention of the independent radio stations in the motion.  I assume that the independent radio stations have a right of access to all of this material.  The question is do they have to go through RTE?  Have RTE the right to refuse or have the other stations a right, as legally constituted stations, to the material in the same way as RTE?</P>
    <P>I would like, indeed, to encourage the new radio stations and especially the national station &mdash; though also the local stations &mdash; to take a greater interest in the proceedings of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The lead in this might well come from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which might consider inviting in some of the new radio stations just to see what is possible.  It is in all our interests that we reach as wide an audience as possible.</P>
    <P>I welcome the motion.  I subscribe totally to the objectives of Senator O'Toole. My own feeling is that they would be better attained through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to make some brief comments about this motion and to endorse the contributions from my colleagues on all sides of the House in congratulating RTE for the manner in which they have carried out their duties under the orders that have been placed before this House previously. I would also like to support Senator Manning when he refers to the question of local radio, because the motion is very narrow in that respect. It refers only to Radio Telefís Éireann. <Col N="80" /> Perhaps that is something for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges because it is a technical matter.</P>
      <P>The whole concept of broadcasting the House has been touched on by the Independent Members.  We are living in a new era.  I have been in this House only since 1987 but I sometimes think that Members of both Houses become over-protective of the procedures and of the debates that go on in them.  They somehow feel, perhaps, that the general public should not be privy to what goes on within the Houses.  I do not know about any other Member but I always have a feeling of inadequacy watching news broadcasts from the more repressive regimes in eastern Europe.  I am astonished at the &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Like you, Senator, I welcome the recent developments in that area of the world.  I am always pleasantly surprised that television cameras are in their various parliaments, be they rubber stamp organisations or otherwise. Increasingly they are becoming more relevant. The concept of broadcasting is what I am talking about.  This motion deals with the authority or permission of this House to be given to a broadcasting organisation to broadcast.  The point I am trying to make is that it is not all that long ago that newspapers were looked upon with some degree of suspicion by parliament. They were not allowed into the Houses of Parliament.  Political correspondents were not allowed to have their own gallery or to report verbatim on proceedings.  We are living in a new era.  We are living probably the most exciting period of technological advancement this century.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges of this House should proceed without any undue delay to ensure that there will be televised broadcasting of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, I am a little curious as to why Senator O'Toole was asking about the omission of sound broadcasting.  I presume it is symbolic, as well as to prove a point.  I would ask how can one have <Col N="81" /> broadcasting without sound?  In the context of this motion somehow it seems not to be fully in keeping with the spirit of the motion.</P>
    <P>Regarding the editing of the programmes by RTE, I have felt that this House has suffered somewhat from the deliberations of the other House.  Whenever there has been anything of major interest in the other House this House tends to suffer.  While I would, of course, support the idea of more time being given on RTE to proceedings of the Oireachtas, as someone who has more than a tenuous connection with the organisation I am a little bit more aware than most of the demands on the schedules in RTE, specifically on Radio 1.  Perhaps if there was to be an extension of time given to RTE and if they were given the wavelengths they are seeking there might be an opportunity for more time to be given to proceedings of this House.</P>
    <P>In the context of this motion it is not enough for it to come before this House at the beginning of a session and to be passed, and then that everything continues as before.  In passing the motion allowing broadcasting of the proceedings of the House, this House also has an obligation to look at itself, at its procedures and at the manner in which it conducts its business.  Quite frankly, as someone who is in the broadcasting arena as well as being a listener, I would not be at all surprised at the reaction of people to more broadcasting of the proceedings of this House as it is currently constituted. On occasions &mdash; I mean this with the greatest respect to my colleagues &mdash; it can sound downright boring.  Consequently, the Committee on Procedures and Privileges in the context of the development of the broadcasting of this House along the lines of television particularly would also need to make their decisions in tandem with decisions about reforming the procedures of this House. They should be that little bit more relevant and more disciplined in the time given to speeches and in the time given to Bills being introduced, etc.</P>
    <P>I hope the Committee on Procedures and Privileges would look at the twin <Col N="82" /> aims of proceeding without undue delay to televise the proceedings of this House but also to bring forward sensible proposals for the reform of the procedures of the House in keeping with television proceedings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the general outlines of this motion although I would have to say that I support strongly the amendment proposed by Senator O'Toole.  It does seem that the use of the phrase &ldquo;sound broadcasting&rdquo; is clearly an attempt to limit the broadcasting simply to sound.  I would also like to be a little bit uncharitable and point out, as nobody else has, that it is rather a pity that this motion was not introduced on the first day of the Seanad; then we could have had the Seanad broadcasts last week.  I hope that omission will not occur again. I recognise it is slightly uncharitable of me, but I think one has to be honest in this House as well as charitable.</P>
      <P>In a democracy it is vital that the majority of the people are given the greatest possible access to the fora of public debate.  For that reason I think every reasonable person of a democratic disposition will welcome the broadcasting precisely because the kind of access of which I am speaking is limited already. It is limited in terms of physical access. The public do have a right to enter this Chamber under certain conditions.  If this House was televised this afternoon I have no doubt a camera would pan across to my left hand and indicate that an entire seating area is vacant because of the strike that is currently affecting this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also limited because of the limitations on the coverage in the print media which, I have to say, is patchy.  It is important that RTE, the broadcasting networks which are a national State concern, should make up the deficiencies. I do not say this to attack journalists. Certainly from a number of the newspapers &mdash; it would, perhaps, be invidious to name them &mdash; we get reasonably good treatment, but there are clearly some papers which make a policy of ignoring the existence of this House altogether. <Col N="83" /> I would like to say that I deplore this practice.</P>
    <P>It is also aggravating to all sections of the House to find that when we do solid hard work we are ignored.  Unlike Senator Mooney, I do not mind greatly if somebody is boring because technical aspects of legislation unquestionably can be boring.  One of the dangers in broadcasting could be that we would turn this simply into an entertainment.  We could decide that we were going to package the proceedings of the House in order to compete in TAM ratings.  I do not think that would be at all appropriate.  It is galling when hard work is done, when measures are passed, when results are gained through this House that no attention whatever is paid even when these successes are remarked upon in the public media.  I believe that broadcasting would help to balance that out.  I do not want this to be construed as an attack on newspapers, some of which have provided a very good service to this House.</P>
    <P>I am also, like other Members, prepared to suck up a certain amount to RTE but there is a limit to the grovelling that I am prepared to do, particularly with regard to paragraph No. 6.  I would like to express my reservations about this. I sincerely hope that Radio Telefís Éireann do not archive material in accordance with their usual practice because if they do a lot of the best material will be wiped.  It is regrettable that some of the best performances of people like Marie Keane and other of our greatest artists have been wiped because of the lack of a proper archive policy in RTE.  We ought to know this before we put our heads on the block by paying undue deference to the archival policy of RTE, which I hope has been improved since those lamentable days.</P>
    <P>I also agree strongly with Senator Brendan Ryan.  In relation to the framing of this although there may be some legal requirements for us to do so, particularly with regard to the image of Ireland abroad, where I would certainly be more sensitive &mdash; I have no objection whatever to being pilloried in Ireland, but I believe <Col N="84" /> that we all try to maintain as much unity as we possibly can abroad &mdash; but we are a little fastidious in relation to satire.  I have witnessed intellectual somersaults occurring in this Chamber that would require the combined genius of Jonathan Swift, Brendan Behan and James Joyce to satirise.  I am not convinced that any additional external operations of the satirical intellect would be required to make the House, on occasion, look inconsistent or, indeed, foolish.  The reason for this is simply that we are not gods and goddesses. We are fallible, mortal people and we do, occasionally, make fools of ourselves.  If we do, it should be exposed and we should be corrected by the operation of what your friend, fellow Senators, a Chathaoirleach and mine, Mrs Margaret Thatcher, would probably call the operation of free market forces in the intellectual arena.  I am satisfied that this House can stand the test of satire as well as any other institution in this State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you, a Chathaoirligh, on your selection to the position of Cathaoirleach and to wish you well in that position and, indeed, a lengthy period therein as well.  I know you will treat the House fairly and equitably and I look forward to participation therein.</P>
      <P>I have no problems with the tenor of the motion.  It is absolutely essential that there should be full broadcasting of the proceedings of this House.  I agree, however, with the amendment that has been presented by Senator O'Toole that the word &ldquo;sound&rdquo; should be deleted.  On reading the text initially I wondered what the meaning was and whether it meant good sound broadcasting, until I looked across at the Irish version which said &ldquo;fhuaim-chraoladh&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, we should have the full range of broadcasting from RTE.  RTE operate both in the sound and in the visual area.  In this time there is a television set in virtually every home in the country and the proceedings of this <Col N="85" /> House should be relevant to the entire country.</P>
    <P>We have spoken about the need for the authority and the functions of this House to be heeded more and greater weight to be put on them.  In recent times we have seen criticism of the workings of the Oireachtas in the media and, indeed, the sound media as well.  What better way is there is to ensure that the public at large see the work that is being done in this House and its effectiveness than having available to them broadcasting to which every citizen has access.  It should be access to the best form of broadcasting, which is both visual and sound.</P>
    <P>In relation to paragraph No. 4 &mdash; that recording should not be used in programmes of light entertainment, political satire or in party political broadcasts &mdash; I can see the need for a certain caution there, but I would prefer that the fairness and the editing of RTE itself be respected in relation to these matters.  We can &mdash; and certainly appear to be &mdash; over-protective by specifying and by restricting areas where broadcasting is not to take place.  We do not have anything to hide. If the work of this House is the work that we want to do and if the reforms that we are looking for are implemented, then the useful programme of legislative work and other work that comes before this House is worth broadcasting in full and in the best possible manner.</P>
    <P>Of course there is an anomaly in that the public enter the House daily, the print media are in the House daily and there is no censorship of what the print media may take out of the House and use in a satirical fashion or in the form of light entertainment.  Therefore, we have an anomalous situation and we should address that rather than leave it.  That would give rise to the belief publicly that we are seeking to protect ourselves and, indeed, to protect ourselves unnecessarily. We should be outgoing and generous rather than restrictive and protective.</P>
    <P>While I support the tenor and, indeed, the substance of the motion, it would be worthwhile to accept the amendment as proposed by Senator O'Toole.  In the <Col N="86" /> committee on Procedure and Privileges we could look further into paragraph No. 4 and see to what extent and where we can further allow broadcasting to operate in this House.</P>

Anois, déanann sé sin an-deacair domsa é, mar Sheanadóir, agus do dhaoine eile, agus cuireann sé alltacht ormsa go bhfuil mé ag seasamh anseo inniu, ar mo chéad ócáid sa Teach seo agus má leanaimse ag caint ar fad i nGaeilge ar feadh deich nóiméad eile nach mbeidh duine ar bith anseo, go mbeidh gach uile dhuine imithe amach.</P>

Ach tá mise ag rá, cibé seans ata ag David Norris, níl seans dá laghad ag mo <Col N="87" /> leithéidse má labhraímse i nGaeilge, mar nach mbeidh focal dá laghad le feiceáil nó le cloisteáil in áit ar bith.  Mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Treas Honan ar ball, tá dínit ag baint leis an Teach seo agus dá bhrí sin, tá an Ghaeilge ar cheann de na fórsaí is fearr agus is mó go mba chóir go mbeimis ag cur chun tosaigh, mar Theach, mar dhaoine atá inár mbaill den Teach Uachtarach seo.</P>

Tuigim, nuair a bhí an Seanad ina shuí cheana, go ndearnadh socrú éigin ach nár leanadh riamh é, agus nach bhfuil sé ann.  Nuair a bhí mé féin i mo bhall de Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe sé bliana ó shin d'éirigh linn, an t-am sin, rún a chur tríd le córas den chineál sin a chur ar Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe.  Ach, faraor géar, níor aontaigh an Chomhairle lena dhéanamh, agus tá súil agam nach bhfuil an leithscéal céanna ag an Teach Uachtarach seo nó nach mbeidh sé le rá acu nach bhfuilimid in ann córas aistriúcháin a chur ar fáil.</P>

Táimid ag iarraidh, de réir mar a thuigimse é, go mbeadh muintir na hÉireann in ann muidne a chloisteáil agus go mbeadh ár dtuairimí le cloisteáil acu.  Mar dhuine a dhéanann mo chuid gnóthaí trí Ghaeilge ar gach uile bhealach, ba bhreá liom a bheith in ann é sin a dhéanamh, agus tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Teach seo na céimeanna a thógáil sa chaoi is go mbeidh <Col N="88" /> sé sin indéanta agus go mbeidh an Teach seo níos saibhre dá bharr.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the points I wish to cover have already been dealt with.  I welcome this motion.  I agree with all the speakers who said that the Seanad was not getting a fair proportion of coverage compared to the other House.  It would be very fair coverage to give the Seanad one-third of the broadcasting time and the Dáil two-thirds of broadcasting time. I came from the communications world before I entered the Seanad seven and a half years ago and it was always a major problem to get coverage for my particular fields of interest.  I do not find any problem in getting coverage on anything worthwhile in the political world on the national radio or television station.</P>
      <P>I want to congratulate RTE on their great contribution towards the broadcasting of both Houses but, while saying that, I want to see more broadcasting of this House.  That is only a fair request. With the level of debate I have witnessed during my time in this House, we can all proceed with confidence.  We are answerable to those who elect us.  Most of the contributions here are very constructive and definitely in the best interests of the people who elect us.  They measure up to what society asks of us as legislators.</P>
      <P>I must agree with those who asked that the new national radio station and local radio should be included.  They should be made very welcome to the House to cover our proceedings.  Most of those stations that come on air are reaching the younger listeners in particular.  They have a big part to play in bringing the news of the Legislature to the youth of our country. From that point of view I call on RTE while they are recording and editing to make these broadcasts of our proceedings free of charge and easily available to the local radios and to the other national radio channel in particular.  The local radio stations, which will cover local affairs in health boards and at county council meetings can, in turn, play a part and come back eventually to RTE with topical events of their latest news bulletins or broadcasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="89" /> In relation to the sound aspect, I am not satisfied with the sound arrangements which exist here in our own House.  We have two small miniature speakers &mdash; one going to the Press Gallery and one going to the Visitors' Gallery but absolutely nothing coming down here to the body of the Chamber.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion as introduced.  It would be fair to say that in the past number of years there has been a revolution in the area of communications. It is interesting to note that the one area of business probably throughout the world that has been most affected by that is the business of politics. It has irrevocably changed forever how that business is conducted.  I was surprised in looking at the programmes that RTE have done over the last number of years in &ldquo;Today in the Oireachtas&rdquo; to see the number of people who actually listen to those programmes.  I would never have thought so many people listened.</P>
      <P>The one big advantage is that it enables people to identify politicians in the country and it makes them more relevant to the people.  For instance, many of the changes that are taking place in eastern Europe today would probably not have occurred without modern communications. We ourselves in this Chamber and in the other House of the Oireachtas should have all the facilities of modern communications.  It is somewhat of an anomaly at present that we are only involved in the area of sound broadcasting.  If my memory serves me correctly, the Committee on Procedure and Privilege are looking at the possibility of introducing the cameras into this House.  There has been much travelling and looking at other Houses of Parliament already to see their broadcasting systems in operation.  While not pushing the matter today, this is certainly something the Progressive Democrats would like to see introduced during the life of this House.  The public have a right not just to hear but also to see their Parliamentary Chambers and their politicians at work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="90" /> The new national broadcasting networks, both in television and in radio, should have access to the Houses of the Oireachtas as well.  The criteria of their licensing is that there must be some proportion of their time devoted to current affairs.  I would invite them to look at the Houses of the Oireachtas as an area they would find of use.  They would, indeed, give them an instant audience.  RTE have set very high standards and have done an excellent job in the way in which they present the programmes.  They may be hamstrung in some ways by some of the conditions that are laid down for them. In any change or updating of the way in which the regulations govern the broadcasting of both Houses it should be taken into account that those regulations could be broadened.  They should help our national broadcasting corporation and, indeed, the independent stations to broadcast at a national level.  They should help some of the very successful local radio stations, including that of WLR in my own constituency in Waterford.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats are very happy to support the motion, but they will be anxious in the future to see the broadcasting of both Houses of the Oireachtas expanded to include television as well.</P>

      <P>First, I wish to support Senator Ó Foighil's demand for a translation service.  There are those of us who, not very happily, admit their Irish is not adequate to understand a fluent Irish speech in this House and I cannot understand why that facility should be available in the Dáil and not available in this House.  It certainly does not encourage people to speak Irish if that is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the motion before the House, I do not quite understand what all the fuss is about.  I do not know how many motions of a similar sort have gone through this House in the last few years but I would like to see the day when we do not have any motions of this sort any more.  It seems to me that we are making small concessions to the broadcasting media one by one as though it is some great privilege for them to come in to film us <Col N="91" /> or to broadcast us and for the people of Ireland, at arm's length, to hear an edited version of what we have to say.</P>
    <P>I want to see the day when this House is available and open to the television cameras and the broadcasters at all times, that it is taken out of our power to give that concession to the broadcasting services around the country and to the particular broadcasting organisations, and that includes the independents.  I do not think we should be debating this motion year after year.  We should be putting through a motion giving them that power and access once and for all.</P>
    <P>Of course, having said that, I support Senator O'Toole's amendment but I hope it will be the last time this matter will be put to this House.</P>
    <P>May I remind Senators that during the early months of this year this House did have television cameras in and we were honoured not only to have television cameras in but to have the Taoiseach in here also.  I do not know whether the Taoiseach was in here because the television cameras were here, or the television cameras were in because the Taoiseach was here.  But it did seem to me that it was not totally coincidental that the Taoiseach was here when the television cameras were in here.  If bringing in television cameras and giving more open access to this House to them and to other broadcasting units, means that we get the Taoiseach here and we get more attention and more governmental attention &mdash; and it is always open to question whether Governments take the Seanad seriously &mdash; then I would certainly welcome them in.  The visual effect would have a dramatic effect on the perception of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I do not, of course, agree with the Progressive Democrats' point of view on the Seanad, but it would expose the &ldquo;warts&rdquo; which are not seen by the public. We would then see exactly how many people were in the Chamber for various debates.  It is not a matter of great pride to anybody in this House &mdash; and I include myself &mdash; that the attendance at this House for many debates is far from what <Col N="92" /> we would like it to be.  If the television cameras meant &mdash; and sound cannot convey this &mdash; that the attendance in this House was better and greater, so be it; that should be welcomed.  We should stop debating this.  We should stop making this concession.  We should stop regarding the press and the cameras and sound as some sort of a threat to us.  We should welcome them with open arms because we have absolutely nothing to fear.</P>

      <P>I, too, would like to support this motion and I would like to endorse in particular what Senator Manning said and ask Radio Telefís Éireann to allow at least the same amount of time to broadcasting the proceedings of this House as is given to those of the Dáil. The producers of the programme, if they listen carefully, will find that there are at least the same number of sparkling witticisms and dazzling asides and interesting innuendoes in this House as there are from the Members of the other House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much. Radio must not be merely informative but must be entertaining and having listened to some of the contributions from Senator Ross from time to time I think the radio producers would be well entertained. If they listen carefully they will find that the articulation, pronunciation and enunciation of most of the Senators are at least on a par with those of the Members of the other House.  The final point I would like to make is that the contributions in this House are more carefully thought out and certainly well researched and therefore it would behove them to give us at least as much time.  I support Senator Manning in this.</P>
      <P>I would also like to support Senator Cassidy's request that independent radio and television, and new stations in particular, when the time arises, would be allowed access to the House also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Senator Norris.  I do not think we should be afraid to allow any radio or <Col N="93" /> television into this House.  We should not be afraid of a little satire now and again. A little joke at ourselves is something that we can all take.  Thank you.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a long discussion on the motion and my intervention will be brief.  I am rising to extract, if I can, from the leader of the House as clear clarification as he can give to the House in relation to the position of local commercial radio stations and independent radio and television, as the case may arise.  This matter has been raised by quite a number of Senators and the view is generally shared that there should be availability of the material to local radio stations.  The motion before us is silent on their position and because it is silent I have to take it that they are excluded.  I would be delighted to find that my assessment on that point is wrong but I am sure the Leader of the House will deal with this.  The fact, as I said, that the motion is silent with regard to the position of local radio stations means that I have to take it that they are not included.</P>
      <P>Senator Cassidy said that we should encourage Radio Telefís Éireann to make this material available to local stations.  I am concerned at the fact that the decision as to whether or not this material will be made available to local radio stations would be within the power of RTE.  This House must have the discretion and the authority to deal with the availability or otherwise of that material to local radio stations.  I want to raise the question of copyright.  Paragraph (5) provides that the copyright of the material be retained by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The copyright is being retained by the Houses of the Oireachtas but if the actual material on which the proceedings are recorded remained the property of RTE, the value of the copyright in these circumstances, and especially in relation to making the material available to local radio stations, is questionable.  I want as much clarification as possible in relation to the position of local radio stations broadcasting Seanad debates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am rather intrigued to see that under <Col N="94" /> paragraph (7) Radio Telefís Éireann are empowered to sell the recordings to foreign radio stations.  Has the Leader of the House any indication of how substantial or otherwise the demand from foreign radio stations would be?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>First, may I take the opportunity of congratulating you, as a Connaught man particularly, in assuming the position of Cathaoirleach of this House and wishing you well during your tenure there.</P>
      <P>I question the necessity for this motion being on the Order Paper at all, in the sense that it is a matter for Procedure and Privileges and since these issues have already been debated then it should not be necessary to debate them here.  I find myself also very much in sympathy with Senator O'Toole's amendment because it seems to me absolutely unnecessary to insert the words &ldquo;sound broadcasting&rdquo; into this motion.  The way in which the motion is phrased is rather absurd in the sense that paragraph (3) provides &ldquo;that such broadcasting... (i) edited form in Radio and Television News bulletins...&rdquo; In other words, we are going to put it onto television news but it will be an intermediary reporter in Radio Telefís Éireann who will convey in sound to a television audience what we have being saying in this House.  Senator Conroy referred to the fact that already the broadcasting by radio of debates in this House was having an impact and was putting a tangible face on politicians.  I can see radio putting a tangible voice on politicians but I cannot see anything less than television putting a tangible face on us.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Mooney's observations that information technology is running apace and there is a tendency in this country for many aspects of modern technology to run years ahead of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We are the last to introduce modern technology and I agree with him completely in that particular view.  For those reasons I think that television as well as radio should be an option that the broadcasting services should have in relation to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="95" /> I would say there would be as much entertainment in the best sense of the word in this House in television broadcasting than there would be in the vast proportion of the imported soap operas on Irish television every night of the week.  For those reasons I support the amendment.  I think it should be the sentiment of this House to move in that direction by deleting the word &ldquo;sound&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to ask one question and I will not delay the House.  Somebody asked me why there was pressure to have this matter dealt with.  It might help the House if we could get it clear. The reason I suggested &mdash; I do not know if it is correct &mdash; was that the proceedings here to-day will go out tonight.  Therefore there could be a little bit of pressure to have the matter dealt with.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points have been raised on the motion before the House.  May I say at the beginning that it is a very narrow motion and it is doing nothing except to continue what was happening up to now in the House; it does not change the arrangements and it does not give any exclusivity to RTE.  It is just maintaining an arrangement that was there.  I do not know &mdash; maybe somebody else does know &mdash; whether there has been a demand from the other radio stations to broadcast the proceedings of this House.  I am not too sure whether that is or is not the case.  I presume if an application comes from any of the other radio stations it will go before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and a motion can come before the House to deal with the demand or the opportunity that might arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, in terms of the questions asked about the televising of the House, this matter has been raised in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on a number of occasions.  I think there was a mutual agreement in the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges that television should be allowed into the House and I believe that negotiations are at a very advanced stage to have the proceedings <Col N="96" /> of both Houses televised.  Anybody who sees the two little holes on both sides of the Chamber might imagine they are for spying purposes but they are not.  In fact, they will hold the television cameras when they are installed, as they will be in a very short time.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go too far into this debate.  This is a very narrow motion.  It is specifically to allow RTE to continue to broadcast the proceedings of the House and, as I say, it does not take from any other station the opportunity to apply here.  Possibly the word &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; should be taken out of paragraph (7) and the word &ldquo;other&rdquo; inserted and I propose an appropriate amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">

      <P>I propose that the matters raised by various speakers be taken up at an early stage in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and that this House push for the amendments in relation to broadcasting that have been proposed here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In proposing Senator Naughten I would like to refer for a few moments to his background in Irish politics.  He has <Col N="97" /> had wide experience of politics both at national and regional level.  He was first elected to Roscommon County Council in 1974 and he was subsequently appointed a member of the Western Health Board in 1979.  He was elected to the Seanad in 1981 and has spent some time here and has experience of the institutions of this House.  He was elected to the Dáil in 1982.  He was a member of the Public Accounts Committee of the Oireachtas for about seven years and, this should be very relevant in relation to the appointment we are discussing today, he was one of the joint deputy chairmen in the Dáil for a number of years.  He comes from County Roscommon, like you, a Chathaoirligh, he is a family man from the heart of rural Ireland and I submit to you that he has the integrity to Chair impartially any issues that may arise in this House.</P>
    <P>A Chathaoirligh, your county for a number of years has played a pivotal role in Irish politics.  I would hope that, if my proposal goes through, County Roscommon will have a further major role to play and perhaps in future years we will have a meeting of this Seanad in Roscommon County Council.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Senator Jack Harte be elected Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="98" /> I am pleased, honoured and proud to propose the name of Senator Jack Harte for the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad.  Those of you who have been in the Seanad for a number of years know this very well.  There are a few brief items I would like to mention in support of his nomination.</P>
    <P>Jack Harte came up the hard way in this world.  He was born into a family of 11 in Dublin's inner city.  He was born at a time when those areas were referred to as very, very poor and sometimes were called slums.  At the age of 12 he had to go out and work to support his family. As young as nine, he was out helping a local carpenter with his work.  At the age of 16, he departed to the Middle East and spent the next ten years out of this country.  During his stay overseas he was given a number of positions of leadership. In that period he took up boxing both at amateur and professional level and, unlike many people who are involved in that sport, he has lived to tell the tale. He has also provided support and help for other ex-boxers many of whom have finished up in very poor circumstances.</P>
    <P>He returned to Ireland in 1946 and became involved in the Labour Movement both at trade union and Labour Party levels.  He is still active and it is now 43 years later.  Throughout that period, Jack Harte has been loyal to those movements and it is one of his outstanding characteristics that he does not seek or covet the position for himself. Throughout his long career his first priorities have been the development of both those movements.</P>
    <P>Jack Harte was the national organiser for our party for many years; he was the national director of elections for our party for many years.  All of those tasks were taken in an entirely voluntary capacity; Jack Harte got no payment for that work.  The fact that our party is now as strong as it is, to a fair extent, a reflection of and a tribute to the work that Jack Harte has put into it on a voluntary basis over all those years.</P>
    <P>In the Trade Union Movement he has served as shop steward for 600 men.  He was a branch chairman of a union branch <Col N="99" /> which consisted of 3,500 people.  He was a member of his union's national executive, that is, the Federated Workers' Union, a union of which, I am happy to say, I am also a member.  He has been a delegate to its annual conferences.  He acted as mediator to try to seek a solution when splits arose in the trade union movement.  In Irish politics, Jack Harte is a healer, a man who seeks out solutions rather than one who provokes rows.</P>
    <P>He worked in the trade union movement as a union official; for 11 years he acted as branch secretary for his union in Arthur Guinness.  He has been involved in the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and he is proud to say that he knew young Jim Larkin for more than 25 years.</P>
    <P>In later times he has been involved in the Seanad.  He first contested a Seanad election in 1969 and from 1973 to the present time he has been a Member of this House.  He has been the party whip here since 1973 and for the past 12 years he has been on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  For the past ten years he has been on the panel of chairmen of this House.</P>
    <P>In recent times he has scaled down his trade union activity; he has scaled down very many other aspects of his life but the one thing that has remained as a central priority is the Seanad.  Over recent times Jack Harte has concentrated his efforts on his Seanad work.</P>
    <P>As I have said, Jack Harte has wide experience.  He has qualities of leadership and loyalty.  In his trade union work he developed negotiating skills and picked up quite a bit of administrative experience. Those of you who know Jack Harte will agree with me when I say that he is the essence of decency, the old fashioned face of decency, and that is something which is very worthwhile in a world that sometimes tends to pass these things by.</P>
    <P>It is for me a great honour, pleasure and privilege to propose the name of Jack Harte to be Leas-Chathaoirleach of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great pleasure in seconding the motion that Senator Jack <Col N="100" /> Harte be elected Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I have known Jack for many years outside of this House and I believe that he is, of all people, most suited for the position of Chair and, in this context, of Leas-Chathaoirleach of the House.  He has had, as has been pointed out by the proposer, the widest experiences in life that anyone could possibly have.  He worked as a soldier, as a boxer, as a labourer, as a trade unionist and now as a parliamentarian. He has seen life at every level and aspect and every facet of the spectrum.  He has come from the lower levels, with a sympathy for the underdog, to, you might say, the upper level in this House.  In all his dealings I have found him a most dignified and fair-minded person.  If there was one word to describe Jack Harte, it would be the word &ldquo;gentleman&rdquo; and that would ensure that in this office he would act with fairness and equity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always very difficult to choose between two particular people in this House, especially when you have got the freedom to make that choice which is something which we on these benches enjoy.</P>
      <P>I rise to support the nomination of Senator Harte for this post and I agree with everything the proposer has said, except possibly when he introduces as one of his great qualifications for this job his powers at boxing.  I find that difficult to accept as a qualification but everything else mentioned is something which would recommend Senator Harte for this post.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that the post of Cathaoirleach is always divided as one of the great spoils between the political parties and it is a pity that there seems to be a tacit understanding that the post of Cathaoirleach always goes to the Government and the post of Leas-Chathaoirleach always goes to the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first time I have seen a competition for the post of Leas-Chathaoirleach and I welcome it.  I support Senator Harte for several very good reasons, but the principal reason is this: Senator Harte has been in the Seanad for much longer than I have and Senator <Col N="101" /> Harte is someone whose commitment to the Seanad, and only the Seanad, is undisputed.  Whereas I have no doubt that the other candidate, Senator Naughten, was and will be a very good Member of the Lower House, I think it is a pity, with great respect to you, Sir, that we are now proposing to elect to the second most prestigious job in this House a man who I think has only about six months experience in this House and so, between the two officers of this House, we will have someone with no experience in this House whatsoever, who may well do a very good job and someone with virtually no experience in this House.  That points to one of the great faults in this House, that this job is given to people regardless of their past commitment to the House. I do not say this in any way to castigate or chastise Senator Naughten but I suspect that his interests do not lie in this House at all and that his ambition and his reason for being in this House is purely and simply to get into the other House.  If that is the case, I do not believe he is the best candidate for the job.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte has been here since 1973, for 16 years.  His commitment stands for itself.  His record, as I know, is second to none in the Labour Party and is second to very few in this House in terms of speaking, in terms of voting and in terms of commitment.  I can think of no-one in this House who has greater experience, who has greater commitment and who has, indeed, served in the Chair of this House before.  It would be a great gesture for Members of this House to forget their party allegiance in the election to a non-party job and to elect Senator Harte.</P>

In this context, I would like to compliment a Member of this House, Senator Mooney, on the work he has done over the past few years.  Senator Mooney would agree with me that one person in the Oireachtas who deserves much praise is Deputy David Andrews for his consistent and <Col N="102" /> committed support for the cause of the Guildford Four.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the occasion of the election of <Col N="103" /> Cathaoirleach the Opposition parties broke with tradition.  I warned that once one tradition was broken then there was the danger of another tradition being broken.  That was not the first time tradition was broken.  It was broken in 1973 on the election of Leas-Chathaoirleach. I remember that occasion well when Fine Gael supported Senator Evelyn Owen as Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I remember clearly Senator Michael O'Higgins being particularly embarrassed at that time.  He said that when it came to an issue or a vote between Fianna Fáil and Labour, he would vote for Labour.  Those words stuck in my mind.  There was heated debate and afterwards Senator Robinson asked Senator Lenihan, who was here with us as that time, what would he do in the event of a Fianna Fáil Government being returned and Fianna Fáil having a majority in the House.  He gave an undertaking that we would not oppose the main Opposition party for the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I was committed to that undertaking because it was given on my behalf the same as everybody else on the Fianna Fáil side. Subsequently there was a vote and we abstained on it.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of the election of the Cathaoirleach I alerted the Opposition benches that tradition was being broken. Now I understood why they felt they had to make a protest but I felt they could have made it in some other way rather than breaking with tradition, because when traditions break down in the House there is very little left to fall back on. Tradition is important.  I have given no such undertaking to vote for the main Opposition party.  I like to be fair at all times if I can.  Perhaps it is because I am getting old that I like to be at peace with everybody.  At least the members of the main Opposition parties had the courage of their convictions and they said &ldquo;Damn the torpedoes: I will take all the risks of whatever you might do and I am going to vote.&rdquo; The Progressive Democrats did nothing.</P>
    <P>After the last general election I was <Col N="104" /> involved in discussions with the Progressive Democrats at the request of the Taoiseach but I had to withdraw from those discussions because of my anti-Coalition stance.  I was later shocked to see the price we had to pay for Progressive Democrat support.  Since then, of course, Progressive Democrat members have been speaking on matters of public policy completely outside their ministerial briefs.  Again, recently we had a Progressive Democrat Minister stating publicly that he would not accept collective decision-making by the Cabinet on the issue of local government elections. In 1987 the Labour Party withdrew from Government when it could no longer accept collective Cabinet responsibility.  That is the only honourable course open to a party or an individual who cannot accept the normal principles of government.  I cannot understand how people could accept nominations to this House, which they have committed themselves to abolish.  I might also add that I cannot help wondering why the Taoiseach did not nominate to this House somebody from the constituency of Limerick East.  Many names were mentioned in this regard.  Any one of them could have given great service and made valuable contributions to this House.</P>
    <P>I respect both candidates.  My vote was requested by the Labour candidate.  I gave my commitment to Senator Jack Harte and I intend to honour that commitment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, first of all, to welcome some of the substance of what Senator Hanafin has said.  It is important in a situation like this that there should be the element of a free vote.  The really significant point is that there is a difference when there is a contest between two parties.  Of course, a Labour Party Senator, unless there was some spectacularly compelling reason to do otherwise, would have to vote in support of a Labour Party candidate.  What this vote is about is not a vote on a Fianna Fáil nominee so it would seem to me that it is only honourable to expect that the Fianna <Col N="105" /> Fáil side of the House will permit a free vote.</P>
      <P>I believe that it is wrong to give these kind of undertakings behind the back of the Seanad so that votes will be committed in advance of the arguments put forward here on behalf of the candidates. If this is a proper democratic Assembly, then surely it is incorrect to make this kind of binding commitment on a matter where the party is not so directly involved.  I applaud Senator Hanafin's decision to commit himself to vote for Senator Harte, as I shall be doing myself.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Harte.  I have only had three years, so far, in the House.  I have listened with great respect and great attention to a series of speeches from Senator Harte on a wide range of topics. I was slightly surprised to hear Members of the left talk about upper levels and lower levels.  I doubt very much if Senator Harte found this flattering because he is the kind of person who to me represents the best elements of socialism, and this kind of rubbish about upper levels and lower levels of Irish society simply does not come into the argument.  I have never contemplated Senator Harte's social background.  It is a matter of total irrelevance to me, as I would hope my social background, such as it is, would be a matter of complete irrelevance to him.  It is not on the basis of any of these pseudo socio-economic criteria that I will be casting my vote.</P>
      <P>However, there is no question at all that Senator Harte does reflect a voice of the people.  His is the kind of voice we have just been talking about on the broadcasting of Seanad Éireann.  There is no doubt that Senator Harte's measured tones are the tones of a man whose voice will be heard by the people, that they will identify with a lot of what he says and that they will identify with the tone of voice he employs.  I have been in the company of fellow Dubliners when Senator Harte's dulcet tones came across the airways.  They said, &ldquo;Well, begob, there is somebody I can agree with &mdash; a plain man talking sense.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the kind of thing that we need in this House, despite the fact that I think <Col N="106" /> some of the compliments were slightly exaggerated.  One would think Senator Harte had the widest possible range of experience of anybody on the face of the globe.  Surely that is hyperbole.  I suspect there are several experiences which I have entertained which Senator Harte has not, and I assume this is true of a number of Members of this House in different fields.  It seems that to make so wide-ranging a claim in support of a nomination is to make it slightly ridiculous. I would not wish to join in the process of making, my exaggeration of the virtues of a candidate, the whole procedure of election ridiculous.  It is for this reason that I am modifying my admiration for Senator Harte, but I certainly will be casting my vote in his favour.  I hope that a certain independence of mind will on this occasion at least distinguish the ranks of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I would have to say in conclusion, however, that to date I know nothing to the discredit of Senator Naughten.  The reason I am voting for Senator Harte is because, as my colleague, Senator Ross, has said, I am not convinced of the degree of experience of Senator Naughten.  In fact, I had to turn to Senator Ross and ask him <i>sotto voce</i> whether Senator Naughten had already been a Senator, because I was not sure of his degree of experience.  It seems on balance to be considerably less impressive than that of Senator Harte.  So, with no disrespect to Senator Naughten, I feel that it is an obligation on me as an Independent to vote for Senator Harte.</P>

      <P>I have a very simple reason for voting for Senator Harte.  I am beginning to realise as I look around me that, much to my own amazement, the number of people who have been in this House longer than myself is getting smaller and smaller.  That is a matter of some dismay. Senator Harte is one of the longest serving Members of this House.  He is also an old friend and an old ally on many an issue in this House.  He was an ally of mine when he had the difficult job of being a Whip on the Government side. Precise details of that alliance perhaps could be outlined on a later occasion, when tempers have cooled somewhat further. On one particularly difficult occasion for me Senator Harte was a good friend and a good ally and, I may say, a good soldier.  He is also one of the most distinguished Members of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was, like Senator Ross, a bit taken a <Col N="108" /> back to hear of his involvements in certain activities that I would not be inclined to boast about.  I know of all his activities on many other occasions.  He is a man of adventurous spirit.  He is also a committed Member of this House.  He is hard-working, participates in all issues that are debated in this House, and has taken an active role.  He is experienced.  He is well regarded.  He is well recognised and I think he would make a most eminent Leas-Chathaoirleach of this House.</P>
    <P>I know Senator Naughten for a considerable period of time and I have no doubt about his qualities but I have on this occasion, without any disrespect to Senator Naughten, no difficulty in making up my mind to support Senator Harte.</P>

      <P>It would not be my intention to make any comment at all at this point but it would be extremely discourteous of me if I were not to very briefly express my thanks for the gracious, if unexpected and undeserved, comments of Senator Hanafin in relation to any contribution I may have made in relation to the matters he raised.  Suffice it to say &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; to Senator Hanafin, for whom I have great respect, and to say for his benefit that one of the most exhilarating experiences of my life was embracing Gerard Conlon and Paul Hill in the free air of Dublin last weekend. Let us hope I will have a similar experience with the Birmingham Six.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the Leas-Chathaoirleach, it is for all of us to make up our own minds.  My comments are not to be misinterpreted in any way as to the motives or actions of any Member of this House on how they vote or otherwise. Suffice it to say that I was elected as a Fianna Fáil Senator.  Therefore, I have taken the Fianna Fáil Whip.  Consequently, in a democracy one accepts the majority.  Both Members of this House who are putting themselves forward for consideration as Leas-Chathaoirleach are known to me personally.  One comes from my neighbouring county and I know him very well.  The other is someone <Col N="109" /> whom I have met through my membership of this House.  Both of them, to use the Shakespearian accolade are honourable men.  Both of them would be worthy Leas-Chathaoirligh.  However, as a Member of the Fianna Fáil Party, I am accepting the Fianna Fáil Whip.  I, therefore, accept the majority view.  The majority view is that we abstain; therefore, I abstain.</P>

He is a man for whom I have a great deal of respect.  It gives me great pleasure to cast my vote in favour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As probably the final speaker in the debate I would like to say, although I never see it as my role to congratulate previous holders of office, that it would be quite remiss of us at this time not to congratulate the outgoing holder of this office, Senator Charlie McDonald, who did an excellent job for his period of office.  We used the occasion of the election of the Cathaoirleach to refer back to the excellent contribution made by the previous Cathaoirleach.  I would like to put on the record, at least from my own point of view and certainly I know from my colleagues, that we have always found in our dealings with the previous Leas-Chathaoirleach that Senator McDonald indeed did an excellent job.  At all times he was tolerant, helpful and supportive and showed a knowledge of procedure <Col N="110" /> and an implementation of procedure which was always fair and honest.  I think that should go on the record.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say that Senator Naughten, I have no doubt, would do an excellent job.  The vote is something we can all anticipate at this point.  Therefore, I would wish him well in that position.  I would hope that he continues the good approach and traditions of his predecessor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make a few comments.  It has been the tradition in this House that the Leas-Chathaoirleach should come from the Opposition benches.  In abstaining on this vote we are going along with the traditions of this House.  Just because of some political aberration in 1973 Fine Gael did go against the traditions of this House but that does not mean that we should fall into the same trap.  We are believers in the traditions of this House.  We were sorely put to the pin of our collars to support the motion, or to abstain on this particular vote, because of what happened last week on the election of the Cathaoirleach.  Let it be said that, if tradition is broken willy-nilly in the House, we will not be part of continuing what has been built up as a traditional method of working in the House in the future.</P>
      <P>It is in accordance with the traditions of this House that we are abstaining on the vote for the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  It does not give me any great pleasure to do so, in the sense that Senator Jack Harte is one of the contenders for this office.  Senator Jack Harte, as has been said, has been a very great friend of this House and, indeed, has been a great friend of Members of the House for many years.  I would compliment him on the gentlemanly way in which he has conducted himself at all times on behalf of this House and to all Members of the House.  In particular, I am sorry that Senator Jack Harte did not get the opportunity to be selected here for the Chair today.  As it appears Senator Naughten will be the person who will be selected as the chairperson, I wish him every success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to add my compliments to <Col N="111" /> those of the other speakers for the work that was carried on on behalf of this House by Senator Charlie McDonald over a long number of years.  He is probably the longest serving Member of the House at present, with the exception of Senator Hanafin.  Senator McDonald did a fantastic job in the Chair when he was Leas-Chathaoirleach and I thank him for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank my proposer and seconder and the Members of this House for electing me to this high office.  I want to thank every Member of the House for his or her support. I wish to state that on all occasions it will be my intention to be fair with all Members.  I have no doubt that every Senator will co-operate with me in this regard.</P>
      <P>My political career in the Oireachtas started here in 1981.  At that time I got to know Senator Jack Harte.  I must say he is an honourable and distinguished Member of this House, a gentleman, and I have no doubt that, had he been elected, he would have carried out the function of Leas-Chathaoirleach in a very honourable manner.  I want to compliment the outgoing Leas-Chathaoirleach for the work he did in that office, for the dignity he brought to that office and for the way in which he discharged his duties.</P>
      <P>I also want to compliment Senator Honan for the way she discharged her duties as Cathaoirleach in the past and to congratulate Senator Lanigan on his appointment as Government Leader in the House and Senator Manning as Leader of the Opposition.  Lastly, but by no means least a Chathaoirligh, I want to congratulate yourself on your election to office of Cathaoirleach.  I have no doubt that you will carry out your duties in a fair and dignified manner in that office.  I wish you every success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate Senator Naughten and to say that I offer him my fullest support possible.  If he wants to vacate the Chair on any occasion and I can be of any assistance I will be <Col N="113" /> available.  I would like to thank Senator McDonald for his contribution not only for his short period as Cathaoirleach, and as Leas-Chathaoirleach, but for the courteous and tactful way in which he dealt with the proceedings of the House.  Congratulations to him.</P>
      <P>I would also like to welcome the Cathaoirleach, to the Chair.  I hope it will be for a lengthy period.  I say that with a little selfish interest as well as in your intersts.  I hope that we will have a good period of time here in the Seanad and that everything will work out for us.  I hope that over the years we can work in harmony that when we have arguments they will be constructive and that we will be genuinely concerned about bringing matters around to the way we think and feel and that we will do it in a correct and balanced way.</P>
      <P>I owe a special vote of thanks, of course, to the people who supported me. I would like to thank each and every one of them.  I have to say thanks to Senator Hanafin for the bonus.  It was a very brave and wonderful thing he did.</P>
      <P>In relation to running for the office, I would like to explain, firstly, that when I decided to run for this office nobody was in the field because I decided to do so on the day I was re-elected.  I told Senator Manning on that occasion that I would have &ldquo;a go&rdquo; at trying to break the tradition. I did not know then that Senator Naughten was going forward or who, in fact, would emerge.  In that sense, I was not in opposition to a person as such.  I felt that there should be some means of coming up with a ratio of sharing that power.  However, that is not the case. The Fianna Fáil people have nothing to be concerned about.  They discussed this openly and frankly.  I do not believe the wrong information which leaked out after their first meeting was leaked maliciously. I believe it was accidental.  I offer my co-operation and understanding to them in that respect.  I have to say these few words for my ego more than anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the start, even though I wanted to win, I respected my adversary sufficiently to know that it was really a David <Col N="114" /> and Goliath situation and, as somebody who knows about frontal attacks, it could not be done by a frontal attack.  I used all my experience.  I have used the principle of the lever trying to use the lesser intensively to replace the greater.  I tried from the flank, from the unexpected angle, the unusual, I even chose the timing a bit differently but unfortunately I did not succeed.  I have no bitterness about that. I accept the decision totally.  The sling-shot was no match in this case.  I do not look at it as a victory or a defeat.  It matters little to the true lover of democracy whether one wins or whether somebody else gains.  I have gained a lot and I have had a lot of support down the years from both sides of the House.  I would not be in the House if I had not been getting some support from both sides.  My only regret now is that, because this is very likely my last term, if we go the three years, I will not be able to go around saying, &ldquo;Do not forget the scratches&rdquo;.  I will miss that.  I have tried everything and done everything possible.  I offer my sincere thanks to everybody who voted for me and who was tolerant of the pressure I tried to exert to try to win.  My feelings with regard to the way they tolerated me are much stronger than words.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, first of all, to congratulate Senator Liam Naughten on his election as Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I know he will do everything that is required to make a success of the office. He will be fair, understanding and he will have a very special regard, I know and as you will, a Chathaoirligh, for those on the backbenches who frequently can find themselves somewhat squeezed out.  He will do everything within his power to protect the rights of all groups in the House.  In referring to the backbenches, I was not referring to the Independent group who do not suffer from that disability of being squeezed out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to pay a special tribute to Senator Jack Harte.  He holds a very special place in the affection of all Members of this House and his speech, on what must be a great disappointment for him today, was dignified, gracious, <Col N="115" /> generous and had all the characteristics of the Senator Harte whom we all know and respect so much in this House.  I hope it will not be beyond the ingenuity of this House to find some special way in which the House can recognise his very special talents during the lifetime of this Seanad. I certainly hope that some such way can be found.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay my tribute to Senator McDonald, the out-going Leas-Chathaoirleach. It is difficult to think, in looking at Senator McDonald, that he is in fact the father of the House, that his record of service goes back over 20 years and that he is the elder statesman of this House.  For him, too, today must be something of a disappointment.  He had hoped to be Leas-Chathaoirleach; he put his name forward for re-election; he lost and accepted the loss with dignity and generosity.  It is good that we on these benches have Senator McDonald as an elder statesman who can advise us on various issues during the lifetime of this Seanad.  I know he has a very real contribution to make.</P>
    <P>I want to place on record my thanks to Senator Lanigan and to the Fianna Fáil group.  Senator Lanigan was under pressure and there was a certain sense in which the tradition might have been broken.  I want to put on record my thanks to the Fianna Fáil group for taking what must have been a difficult decision.  They abided by this tradition and it is something which this side of the House appreciates.  I would not want that to go unrecorded.  Once again, I congratulate Senator Naughten on his election today.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to deal with the situation that has arisen following a judgment of the Supreme Court on 2 November in which the court ruled that a health board does not have the necessary statutory authority to act as a &ldquo;fit person&rdquo; within the meaning of the Children Act, 1908.  The effect of this is that the health boards are no longer able to take into their care children who have been <Col N="117" /> neglected, ill treated or abused or who are otherwise at risk.</P>
    <P>When the Government became aware of the Supreme Court judgment they considered whether the Child Care Bill, 1988 which is before the Dáil should be rushed through as a matter of urgency.  In view of the many complex and sensitive issues dealt with in the 1988 Bill, the Government decided that this would be the wrong approach and that it would be better to introduce a short amending Bill to deal with the key point of the Supreme Court's ruling that is that health boards do not have statutory authority to act as fit persons within the meaning of the Children Act, 1908.  The Government believe that this approach offers the best prospect of urgently protecting the interests of a very vulnerable group of several hundred children who are in care under fit person orders.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court judgment and the earlier judgment of the court in the same case last July raise a number of important and complex issues which impact on the whole issue of child care proceedings.  It is, of course, crucial that the right balance be struck in these proceedings between the rights of parents and the rights of children.  The issues raised require detailed and meticulous consideration and the Government feel that this can best be done in the context of the Child Care Bill, 1988.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Child Care Bill, 1988 I would like to take this opportunity to correct a number of inaccuracies in the leading article in today's <i>Irish Times.</i>  The clear impression is given that the Government decided only recently to revive this Bill which had lapsed with the dissolution of the last Dáil.  This is not correct.  One of the first actions of the new Government was to have a motion passed in the Dáil on 20 July last restoring the Bill to the Dáil Order Paper at the stage it had reached prior to the dissolution that is the Committee Stage.  Furthermore, the new Government gave a firm commitment that the Bill was one of their top legislative priorities.  To this end, the Dáil Committee Stage debate on the Bill commenced last week, before the Supreme <Col N="118" /> Court judgment, when some four hours was spend discussing a number of the 200 amendments which have put down to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The leading article also states that the Dáil voted last week to &ldquo;postpone consideration of the Bill for another year&rdquo;. This is also incorrect.  What was defeated by the Dáil last week was an Opposition amendment to section 1 of the Child Care Bill, the effect of which, if it had been passed, would have been to place completely unreasonable restrictions on the Government by requiring all sections of this long and complex Bill to be brought into effect within 12 months.  This had to be rejected as it would have seriously affected the orderly implementation of the Bill once enacted by the Oireachtas and similar to all Bills being taken by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to ensuring the earliest possible passage of the Child Care Bill has never been in doubt and has been reiterated publicly on a number of occasions.  Only yesterday the Government had a motion carried in the Dáil with the agreement of all parties referring the Bill to a Special Committee of the Dáil to process the Committee Stage of the remaining sections of the Bill at the request of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>I might also point out that a large number of amendments which the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, had circulated in advance of the Supreme Court judgment last week deal with many of the issues raised in that judgment including the whole question of access by parents to children when they are in care. There are no simple answers to some of these issues, impinging as they do on very fundamental human and constitutional rights.  However, I am confident that the Child Care Bill, 1988 when enacted will lead to an enlightened and balanced legislative framework.</P>
    <P>The existing law in relation to child care is contained primarily in the Children Act, 1908.  Briefly, that Act allows any person who believes that the health, safety or welfare of a child is in jeopardy to bring the matter before the District Court.  If, having considered the <Col N="119" /> evidence, the justice is satisfied that it is necessary in the child's interests to do so, he may order that the child is removed from the custody of his parents or guardians and be committed to the care of a relative or other &ldquo;fit person&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The expression &ldquo;fit person&rdquo; is defined in section 38 of the 1908 Act:</P>
    <P>In this Part of this Act unless the context otherwise requires, the expression &ldquo;fit person&rdquo; in relation to the care of any child or young person includes any society or body corporate established for the reception or protection of poor children or the prevention of cruelty to children.</P>
    <P>Senators will note that this definition is not exclusive.  It does not spell out who may and who may not act as a &ldquo;fit person&rdquo;.  The only thing it does is to indicate that the expression &ldquo;fit person&rdquo; includes certain societies and other bodies involved in the area of child welfare.</P>
    <P>Following the establishment of the health boards in 1970, my Department obtained legal advice to the effect that health boards could act as fit persons for the purpose of taking deprived children into care.  It was considered that such work formed an integral part of the community care and social work services that were beginning to be built up under the health boards.  Increasingly, health boards got involved in dealing with child abuse and neglect, bringing cases before the court and offering themselves as fit persons.  This practice has been endorsed by successive Governments to the extent that the health boards are now recognised, in fact, if not in law, as the State's child care and child protection agencies.</P>
    <P>From time to time, doubts were expressed by some lawyers and other about the legal authority of health boards to involve themselves in child care. However, the general view was, and is, that this is essential work which must be done in the interests of the children concerned and that the most appropriate agencies to perform it are the health boards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="120" /> The question of the legal authority of health boards eventually came up for judicial consideration in the High Court in earlier proceedings in relation to the same case that was the subject of last weeks Supreme Court judgment.</P>
    <P>In order to explain matters further, it is necessary for me to give some brief details of that case without, of course, revealing the identities of those involved. Briefly, the facts are that in November 1986 a child was placed in the care of a health board as a fit person following allegations that she had been sexually abused by her father.  Some months later the parents made a <i>habeas corpus</i> application in the High Court challenging the validity of the detention of their child on a number of grounds, including a claim that the health board's statutory powers did not include a power to act as a fit person.</P>
    <P>The High Court delivered its judgment on 15 July 1988 and in relation to that aspect of the application the High Court held as follows:</P>
    <P>As to whether the (named) Health Board possesses the necessary statutory powers to act as a fit person, Section 6 (1) of the Health Act 1970 (the 1970 Act) provides that a health board shall perform the functions conferred on it under the Act, and any other functions which immediately before its establishment, were performed by a local authority (other than as a sanitary authority) in the functional area of the health board in relation to the operation of services provided under or in connection with the administration of the enactments specified in subsection (2).  Among the functions which were performed by the local authority were functions in connection with the administration of Part I of the 1908 Act (concerning infant life protection) and Sections 2 and 3 of the Children (Amendment) Act 1957.  These enactments are specified in Section 6 (2) at paragraph (g).  This however, does not prevent the health board from carrying out other functions conferred on it under the 1970 Act connected with <Col N="121" /> other parts of the 1908 Act which were not carried out by the local authority.</P>
    <P>Under Section 66 (2) of the 1970 Act, a health board shall make available without charge a health examination and treatment service for pupils attending a national school.</P>
    <P>It is under this section that the (named) Health Board claims to derive its power to take the child into care under the Section 24 Order.  In my opinion, if a child has suffered sexual abuse, her health is endangered and she is in need of treatment.  The provision of care is therefore within the broad description of a treatment service. If the health board is to provide an adequate service it is essential that it be involved either directly as a fit person or indirectly with the fit person nominated.  There is no reason why a suitable employee of the health board should not be named as a fit person but if for any reason that person ceased to be employed by the health board or become incapacitated, another application would have to be made to the District Court for another person to be appointed.  There are therefore, good reasons why the board itself should be appointed.  It would not seem wise that one of the actual foster parents should be named as this would identify the whereabouts of the child in a case where secrecy is deemed essential.</P>
    <P>For the above reasons I am satisfied that the District Justice had power to make the Order which he did make committing the child to the care of the (named) Health Board as a fit person until she is sixteen unless the Order is sooner revoked or varied.</P>
    <P>The essential point here is that as recently as 16 months ago the activities of health boards in acting as fit persons was specifically upheld by the High Court.</P>
    <P>The parents appealed the case to the Supreme Court.  In a preliminary judgment on 27 July last, the Supreme Court ruled that the fit person order was unsafe because the procedures in the original trial in the District Court had not <Col N="122" /> been in accordance with the necessary requirements of natural justice.  The child returned to her parents shortly afterwards.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court said that it would give its decision at a later date on other issues raised on behalf of the parents. This was the judgment delivered last Thursday, 2 November.  While the court found in favour of the health board on four of the five grounds, it found against the health board in the final point when it decided that health boards do not have the necessary legal authority to act as fit persons.  In doing so, the Supreme Court reversed the decision given by the High Court just 16 months previously.</P>
    <P>I now wish to briefly explain the provisions of the Bill before the House.  Section 1 provides for two matters.  First, that the expression &ldquo;fit person&rdquo; in the Children Act, 1908 includes and shall be deemed always to have included a reference to a health board; secondly, that the functions of a health board include and shall be deemed always to have included the power to act as a &ldquo;fit person&rdquo; within the meaning of the 1908 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that every fit person order made before the passing of this Act shall be read and have effect as if this Act were in force when the order was made. This means that the order is to be read as if at the time it was made the definition &ldquo;fit person&rdquo; included a reference to health board, the health board concerned had at the time the necessary legal authority to act as a &ldquo;fit person&rdquo; and the health board had the power to make suitable arrangements for the care of the child.</P>
    <P>Section 3 also contains two elements. First, it provides that where on the passing of this Act a child or young person is in the actual possession or control of any person, for example, a social worker, a foster parent, or the manager of a children's home and he is in that person's care as a result of a fit person order committing him to a health board, he shall be deemed to be lawfully in the possession or control of that person that is the social worker, the foster parent or the manager <Col N="123" /> of the children's home, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>Secondly, this section provides that any person, which would include a health board, may apply to the court for a new fit person order or may apply for the renewal, variation or revocation of an existing fit person order.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that where a child or young person has been placed in the care of a health board under a fit person order the health board shall provide such care in one of a number of ways.  It may place the child in foster care or in residential care or where the child may be eligible for adoption it may place him with a suitable person or persons with a view to his adoption.  Subsection (3) gives statutory backing to the practice of health boards in allowing children in care to go home for weekends or for holidays so as to maintain links with their families in the hope that they may be able to go home permanently.  The main purpose of subsection (4) is to apply the Boarding Out of Children Regulations, 1983 to children placed in foster care under this Act.</P>
    <P>Section 5 assigns responsibility for the functions of a health board under this Bill to the staff of the health board rather than to the members of the board.  It is, of course, not intended that the functions will be performed by the CEO personally. The CEO will be able to avail of his powers under the Health Act, 1970 to delegate these functions to other officers of the board.</P>
    <P>Section 6 sets out the options available to a court where it finds or declares that a fit person order is invalid, whether by reason of the recent Supreme Court judgment or for any other reason.</P>
    <P>First, it provides that in such a case the court, either of its own motion or on the application of any interested person, may refuse to order the delivery or return of the child or young person to its parents of any other person if the court is of opinion that this would not be in the best interests of the child.</P>
    <P>Instead the court may do any of the following:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="124" />  (a)  make a fit person order in the respect of the child or young person as if he had been brought before the Court in accordance with the relevant provisions of the 1908 Act,</P>
    <P>(b)  make an order referring the matter to the justice of the relevant District Court and in such case the justice may deal with the matter as if an application for a fit person order had been made to him in accordance with the relevant provisions of the 1908 Act,</P>
    <P>(c)  where a person having custody, charge or care of a child or young person has been convicted of commiting certain offences or has been committed for trial for such an offence or has been bound over to keep the peace towards the child or young person, the court may make a fit person order under section 21 of the 1908 Act or refer the matter to the court by which the person was so convicted, committed or bound over so that it can consider the need to make an order under section 21,</P>
    <P>(d)  where an order under paragraph (a) or (c) has been made by the court it may be deemed to have been made by the District Court.  This is a technical device so that any subsequent proceedings can be dealt with in the District Court rather than in a higher court.</P>
    <P>(e)  Where a higher court makes an order under paragraph (b) or (c) returning the case to a District Court the higher court may make a temporary fit person order pending the determination of the matter by the District Court.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that nothing in this Act shall affect any order of a court made before the passing of the Act in which a fit person order was found or declared to be invalid.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that the Bill is to be known as the Children Act, 1989 and that the Children Acts 1908 to 1957 and this Act shall be read together as if they <Col N="125" /> formed one Act.  This means that the various definitions contained in the Children Acts 1908 to 1957 automatically apply to this Act.  The most important are those of &ldquo;child&rdquo; and &ldquo;young person&rdquo; which are defined as follows: &ldquo;Child&rdquo; means a person under the age of 15 years and &ldquo;young person&rdquo; means a person who is 15 years of age or upwards and under the age of 17 years.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I would like to assure the House that this Bill has been very carefully drafted in the Attorney General's Office to take account of the Supreme Court judgment and other recent judicial pronouncements.  I am satisfied that it deals with the immediate difficulty that has arisen.  The more detailed consideration and clarification of our child care legislation can best be done in the context of the debate on the Child Care Bill, 1988 in the Special Committee. I appeal to all sides of the House to support this Bill so that we can regularise the position of the large number of children who are in care.  I am appealing, therefore, for the co-operation of all Senators in processing this Bill as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the ambition of my party to obstruct this Bill.  We will not attempt to obstruct the quick enactment of the Bill because of the significance of this legislation for the 900 children who are in involuntary care.  I might mention that there are in fact 2,500 children in care altogether and indeed many children in our country are marginalised and in a very questionable position.  However, while we will not obstruct the Bill, we will positively and constructively seek to amend the legislation and, just as we are co-operating with the Government in the quick enactment of the Bill, we are expecting equal co-operation from the Minister in the acceptance of suitable amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very sad that the Minister and the Government did not hear the alarm bells ringing over the last 12 months on this legislation.  It has been the opinion of leading family lawyers and, indeed, of <Col N="126" /> Oireachtas Members that there were significant legal pitfalls in the initial legislation and that in fact amendment was needed.  Nothing was done in this regard. The emergency legislation brought before us today is in the fine Irish tradition of closing the door when the horse has bolted.  To avoid further problematic court rulings my party are specifically asking the Minister to have the constitutionality of this Bill tested.  This should be done to reassure the foster parents, the child care workers, the extended families of affected children and, obviously, for the sake ultimately of the children themselves.  We believe, on very good advice, that it is necessary to have the constitutionality of this legislation tested before it receives its final signature.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Supreme Court ruling having upset the High Court decision of 16 months ago.  I hope and I certainly would like to believe that there is no implied criticism of the Supreme Court of our land in this.  The High Court ruling was found by our Supreme Court to not be in order and it is perfectly in order that they should so over-rule it.</P>
    <P>There has been a general tardiness in enacting legislation in relation to child care.  In 1974 the then Government started the process of setting up a task force.  In 1977 the task force on child care was in fact set up.  There was a clear belief at that stage for the task force to draft legislation.  In 1980 the task force reported that child care was in a general mess.  What has happened since has been very little.  What, in effect, we have had in the child care area I respectfully submit is crisis management.</P>
    <P>I want to proceed now to some of our concerns in relation to this legislation. The first concern that my party have in relation to the legislation, and I would appeal to the Minister, given our constructive attitude, to address this tonight by accepting an amendment on it, is that the legislation does not ensure access to the child for the parents and I am talking particularly here about the non-offending parent.  I would be extremely concerned that the non-offending parent and, <Col N="127" /> indeed, the extended family of the child, would not have access to the child and would not have access to evidence, both written and video evidence, being used in relation to the child.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill the courts cannot make an order for access.  We are now proposing an amendment to cover that.  I believe all Members of the House would see that it is very important that the parents have access to the child, that the extended family have access to the child and I would cite in this case the many parents who are not the sexual offenders, who are not the child abusers, who are not the child-beaters.  I would earnestly request the Minister to show concern for those parents and to amend the legislation immediately to allow them access.</P>
    <P>We are concerned also that there be a right to independent assessment.  We believe it is the right of parents who are in the dock on the issue of sexual abuse, child molesting, neglect of child, child beating, whatever, to have an independent assessment carried out and that right must be clearly in the legislation.  It is implicit in the Supreme Court ruling &mdash; and I have a copy of that ruling for any Members of the House who wish to have a look at it &mdash; that the court is concerned that there be more rigorous assessments of children in the case of sexual abuse. The time honoured method that has been used to establish sexual abuse is the anatomical doll device.  That method has come under major question.  In recent times considerable evidence has come up to suggest that the method is questionable. What my party are saying is that there is a need for more rigorous assessment methods and that it is in the interest of the parent and the child that it be clearly established in the most objective possible fashion and in the most thorough fashion that there is abuse and in fact very recent court cases would substantiate that need.</P>
    <P>I will be putting it to the House on behalf of my party tonight that we need as well a Bill of Rights for children.  Just as we have correctly stated clearly in recent times that the rights of women <Col N="128" /> should be clearly delineated the time has come when we must clearly delineate the rights of children and there should be a Bill of Rights for children.  That is a contention that my party are putting before the House tonight.  We believe that what must be achieved in all child care legislation is a balance between the rights of the parents and the rights of the child and that ultimately that balance will create a favourable environment for the child.  Because we submit that there should be such balance not only are my party seeking a Bill of Rights for children but we are also suggesting that a supervision order be put within the terms of the Bill.  We believe that in cases where it is not deemed appropriate to take a child into care and where there is a significant question mark over the welfare of the child a supervision order should be made in that case.  We will be proposing an amendment to that effect.</P>
    <P>The final point I would make on this legislation is that if we are to give any meaning to this legislation, if this legislation is to be anything more than empty rhetoric, further pompous and pious cant, then to give effect to it there is a need to channel greater staffing and greater resources into the child care area and also into the assessment area.  We must renew our entire approach to child care; we must revise our attitudes and we must match that revision of attitude, that renewal of approach, that change of direction with adequate funding.  I would submit to the Minister on behalf of my party that just as we need immediate legislation, and unquestionably we do, we also need adequate staffing, adequate resources and a complete change of direction in our approach to child care.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach seo agus comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leat féin as an phost mar Leas-Chathaoirleach a fháil.  I certainly welcome this Bill.  I think it is very appropriate and I would like <Col N="129" /> to congratulate and pay tribute to the Minister and to his Department for the speedy way he acted on foot of the Supreme Court ruling.  The 800 or so children who were in care were adequately looked after and nobody had any need to fear.  I would like, too, to congratulate the health boards and all the various organisations who had been dealing with the care of deprived children and children in care.  Over the years they have done a marvellous job and our congratulations to them.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister corrected some of the points that were made in the papers today.  Early on many people who are fostering children and have children in care were very worried because the media did say that under the Supreme Court decision parents would have access to children in care.  Those people are very worried because, as we know, many of the children in care are from broken families where alcohol, or drugs of a harder nature, are the source of the problem.  If the whereabouts of the child was known to the parents they could hold those people up to ransom or, indeed, could call on them in one of their frenzies when they would not be capable as a result of drugs or drink and could cause grave problems for people who were doing a good job looking after those children.  I want to assure those people that there is no worry in that regard, that that was not correct.  What the Supreme Court did say was:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context submissions were made on behalf of the respondent Health Board to the effect that there could be exceptional circumstances under which it would be detrimental to the welfare of a child for the identity of the &ldquo;fit person&rdquo; and the location of the home to be known to a person in whose custody that child had previously been.  In such exceptional cases, the fact that the application does relate to the welfare of the child and is not a <i>lis inter paites</i> would, in my view, justify the court in being made aware of the identity and location of the fit person who is willing to undertake the care of the <Col N="130" /> child in a manner which would exclude that knowledge from one or both of the parents or persons who had previously had custody of the child.  Such as exclusion of knowledge should not, however, be lightly undertaken, having particular regard for the fact that questions of proper access and communication between such parents and the child may in some instances still be a very necessary ingredient in the welfare of the child.</P>
    <P>That clearly states that in this type of situation there are three parties involved &mdash; the person who makes the order, the child and the person who is looking after that child.  We must at all times think of what is in the best interests of the child and that is what this Bill is all about.  I am sure the Minister will reassure people who are playing a very important part in the welfare of children.  If we had a perfect society there would be no need for this or many other Bills but unfortunately we have not a perfect society.  If after careful consideration it is decided that it is in the best interests of the child that the parent does not know of its whereabouts then the parents will not know so those people have no need to worry.  I am sure the Minister will clarify that later on.</P>
    <P>I am amazed at talk about alarm bells and that the Government did not act more quickly.  I do not think it was possible for them to act more quickly because, first of all, the High Court ruled that the law as it was, was perfect so therefore until that High Court decision was overturned by the Supreme Court there was no necessity to bring in another Bill.  Indeed, Deputy Alan Shatter, who is an expert on child care, said and I quote him:</P>
    <P>Nowadays the overwhelming majority of such proceedings are brought by health boards and in practice a health board is usually named as a fit person.  Although no express authority is conferred on health boards by the Health Acts to so act section 51 of the Health Act, 170 does, however, provide that the health board is a body corporate and as undoubtedly part of <Col N="131" /> the health boards' function is to provide for the reception and protection of poor children ...</P>
    <P>The most expert people in our country felt there was no need for this Bill until the Supreme Court overruled, which indeed it has a right to do.  Again, it clearly illustrates that while politicians are very often blamed for not doing the right thing we see here too that the most eminent lawyers in our land who become judges, and High Court Judges, can disagree on the interpretation.  Therefore, the Supreme Court in their wisdom upturned the decision of the High Court and until that was done there was no way that anything could be done to bring in legislation.</P>
    <P>The Government were working on the Child Care Bill, 1988 and, indeed, as the Minister said today, they acted immediately they came to power and took off from where they left off.</P>
    <P>I am pleased and I congratulate the Government and the Opposition and all in the Dáil for tackling this with the care, determination and sincerity that it needs because it is very complicated legislation. I am delighted that an all-party committee has been set up to discuss this legislation and I know that when it comes before this House we will have an absolutely perfect Bill.  It is not something that can be rushed through and I know that the committee that has been set up are all very deligent, industrious people who have the welfare of the children at heart and, indeed, of the parents because, God knows, parents too, who find themselves in this situation are to be as much pitied as are the people they abuse, whether physically or sexually, or neglect them in any way.  There is really some want in the parents and that want is created by outside influences such as drink and drugs.  I have said on many occasions that if we could cure that curse in our society we would need fewer Bills and, we would have a lot more happy homes.  Unfortunately, that is the problem but how we cure it is another matter.  I am very very pleased that the all-party committee will <Col N="132" /> deal with this.  I know they will deal with it expeditiously and it will be back in the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible.  Possibly all the amendments the previous speaker spoke about will be embodied in that Bill.</P>
    <P>It is important that we get this Bill through the House as soon as possible to allay any fears or any doubts that are in people's minds.  I wish the Bill well and I sincerely hope that we can get it through the House in a short time because it is very necessary legislation.  It will be superseded by the new Child Care Bill, 1988.  It is a great thing that we will have an all-party Bill coming before us and it must be perfect.  Until then, we should move as quickly as we can and get this Bill through the House.  I thank the Minister and all concerned for the speed with which they are operating.</P>

It is a pity that it arises from the fact that once again the courts are setting the pace for the Oireachtas.  I would have hoped that some of the problems which this Bill seeks to resolve might have been anticipated.  While Senator Farrell very well expressed the judgments of the High Court, I understand that in the last Oireachtas a distinguished lawyer forecast that this problem would arise.  Now it seems that it has become a reality.</P>
      <P>It is also in many ways a pity that the Bill is so restrictive.  We have to accept that the restrictive nature is partly determined by the anxiety to get it through the Oireachtas rapidly.  We are concerned that the Children's Bill has taken so long to find its way into law.  The matter was considered by a task force in 1974 and it is now 15 years on.  However, I am reassured to hear the Minister say that this Bill is an urgent matter in relation to the legislation programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many lawyers have expressed concern <Col N="133" /> about the constitutionality of this Bill. Our advice is that it may in some aspects be unconstitutional.  It is for this reason that I am very anxious that the Government would test the constitutionality of the Bill before it finally becomes law.  It is very desirable that we would avoid a repetition of the sort of procedure we are seeing being enacted in the Dáil and in the Seanad these last few days.</P>
    <P>We would also be concerned that parents of these unfortunate children would have as much access to them as possible.  That should be spelled out as specifically and as clearly as possible in the legislation.  We accept that in some cases it may not be possible to provide access for parents.  We would certainly be very anxious that, where it is not clearly undesirable, parents and relatives would be assured of access to these children.</P>
    <P>We are also concerned about the position of what are called the innocent parents in this regard.  We are very anxious that these parents' rights should be assured and that they be afforded every protection and encouragement by the law.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is the thorny question of evidence of sexual abuse.  It now seems to be quite clear that there are very great difficulties in determining what is clear evidence of sexual abuse.  It is a matter, as it were, for debate.  People have revised former positions, and so on.  We would, in this regard, be very anxious that independent third party views should be taken into account.  There is difficulty in establishing evidence of sexual abuse.  We have to accept that this is a difficult matter. It is very important that every protection should be afforded and, as far as possible, that that evidence should be beyond reasonable doubt.  I accept that there are these technical difficulties but we are going to have to live with them.  In that context every effort should be made to avoid mistakes.</P>
    <P>We will, in the course of the next Stages, be introducing some amendments.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats we are pleased that this legislation has been introduced so speedily in response to the ruling of the Supreme Court last week.  We will support it.  However, it would be very remiss of me not to point out that this legislation is a fire brigade reaction to a situation which should not have arisen in the first place.  What we are doing is to a great extent papering over cracks even though there was an awareness since at least the initial ruling of the Supreme Court last July that we would arrive at this predicament.</P>
      <P>As already referred to by Senator Upton in passing, the Progressive Democrats flagged this decision as early as 14 July 1988 when Deputy Michael McDowell spoke on the Second Stage debate of the Child Care Bill, 1988 in Dáil Éireann.  We warned then of the urgency of passing the Child Care Bill particularly in respect of the rulings in the High Court which raised serious questions on the legality of health boards invoking the powers on the District Court to have a fit persons order made in respect of a child or to have children detained against the wishes of their parents.  In addition, we warned that there could be some parents who would go to the High Court and have a District Justice order quashed under the 1908 Act.  Instead of heeding that warning we are now responding to it with an emergency measure.</P>
      <P>This illustrates only too well the neglect of child care legislation, particularly the Child Care Bill.  It seems incredible that we are still in the process of updating the 1908 Act some 81 years later.  However, I welcome the fact that a special committee has been established for the Committee Stage of the Bill and I hope and expect that the legislation will be completed as soon as possible and enacted without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must have been a sigh of relief by those involved in the social services when this Bill came before the House, <Col N="135" /> not least because up to 800 children were in what could have been termed a state of limbo since the Supreme Court ruling last week.  The implications for those children in care were enormous and, therefore, this Bill alleviates enormous concerns.</P>
    <P>Issues such as the suitability of District Courts to deal with these matters should be faced.  We in the Progressive Democrats look forward to a situation where a scheme of family courts are available nationwide as promised in the agreed <i>Programme for Government.</i> Nevertheless, we must now look forward to the introduction of the Child Care Bill to this House.</P>

      <P>It would be remiss of me not to compliment the Senator on his election as Leas-Chathaoirleach.  Without any irony I welcome him back to this House.  I know he was a former Member. Some of my colleagues are misinformed on that issue.</P>
      <P>Nobody in this House, or the other House, could be other than happy that this legislation is being moved through both Houses of the Oireachtas with the maximum speed.  There is nobody either, looking at our record on social legislation over the past number of years, who could not be taken with the fact that it is either the courts or international conventions who seem to drag us, albeit apparently reluctantly, into reforming legislation. The Data Protection Act for instance was passed because we had to do it to meet certain international conventions.  The Incitement to Hatred Bill, which is before the other House, was passed or is going through because of international conventions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Status of Children Act, is one of the pieces of legislation which I for one am most happy to have been associated with as a participant in the debates in this House during the period when Deputy Nuala Fennell was Minister of State in the <Col N="136" /> Department of Justice.  It largely came about because we were not in a position to ratify certain international conventions and because of certain decisions that were taken in the European Court of Human Rights.</P>
    <P>It is not the way to do our business. We are either in a position where our Government are under-advised or poorly advised or profoundly conservative, if every piece of social legislation of significance can only be taken seriously when somebody outside the country or somebody separate from the political process forces us to confront it.  This is another regrettable issue.  Without trying to pronounce on things on which I do not have a particular degree of expertise there are many who would say that since last July the Government have been on notice that they were going to have a problem.  There were many eminent lawyers of varying political allegiances who identified that there would be a problem. Yet, when we finally got the decision of the Supreme Court it appears that there was almost a state of surprise and shock.</P>
    <P>This failure to understand and to anticipate the general view of the courts and the advice the Ministers receive to perhaps anticipate what will be the view of the courts, is nothing less than a failure, and a failure which must be rectified and dealt with.  We cannot continuously have to be redirected by the courts because we fail to understand our Constitution or our international obligations.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his introduction was very spirited in his refutation of <i>The Irish Times</i> editorial.  I think he was quite right; obviously there was a misunderstanding. We have all got considerable reason to be very wary of the Department of Health's record on legislation.  The 1981 Mental Health Act has not yet been brought into force.  Eight years later no section of the 1981 Mental Health Act has been brought into force.  What is any independent citizen looking at our legislative process supposed to think?  After eight years a major piece of legislation to do with the rights, services and the protection of a particularly vulnerable section of our society has not been <Col N="137" /> brought into force.  We are still working with legislation which, in greater part, is 40 years old.  That does not reassure me. That is why the debate in the other House about the substantive Children's Bill took place.</P>
    <P>Many of us have a considerable worry about when large sections of that legislation will be passed.  Large sections of the Tobacco Bill that went through the Houses of the Oireachtas have still not been implemented.  Large sections of the Clinical Trials legislation are still far from operating satisfactorily.  It is because of that record of the Department of Health that many of us have substantial doubts about leaving anything to discretion and because of their apparent ability to ignore the decisions and the will of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>We need to remind ourselves again and again that it is not the Government which actually decides legislation: it is the Oireachtas.  The Government can only propose legislation.  It is the Oireachtas which passes the legislation that it sees fit to pass, in the form that it sees fit to pass it.  We would need a considerable readjustment to the constitutional realities in this country.  We elect an Oireachtas.  We do not elect a Government. The Oireachtas then picks a Government whose duty it is to propose legislation to the Oireachtas.  It is the obligation of the Oireachtas to respond to that legislation as it sees fit.</P>
    <P>The development of party whips, etc., has clouded the fundamental constitutional realities.  That is why it is with considerable reservations that one looks at the Department of Health in this area. I have no reason to be other than at one on this issue with the Minister of State and Minister O'Hanlon.  Both of them, I know, are committed people and take their responsibilities very seriously, but I will remind the Minister of State that we are still waiting for a substantial Adoption Bill.  We had a minor Bill to deal with one specific problem.  There is a massive amount of concern in the country about aspects of adoption that have not yet been addressed, such as adoption agencies.  All of this was well reported on <Col N="138" /> and the report is now some years old. One would wish that we did not just have small pieces of legislation.  Whoever was responsible for it, the substantive Children's Bill has been floating around these Houses for more years than was proper or correct.</P>
    <P>I continue to be amazed at the difference between our procedures and those of the Houses of Parliament in Westminister where, apparently, Government can announce a programme of legislation at one period of the year and be certain that all of that legislation will be published, dealt with, proceeded with, amended, and finally passed into law within virtually one parliamentary session.  It is because of that that we run into the situations we are now in, where emergency legislation has to be rushed through.  It is emergency legislation that we all agree with.</P>
    <P>On the Bill itself, without wanting to pre-empt or to go into Committee Stage arguments, there are a number of questions that the Minister can answer.  Will the legislation make a distinction between a family and a household in terms of the rights of parents to their children or vice versa?  There are an increasing number of households in this country that are not families under the definition of the Constitution.  The second question I would be interested in is what precisely constitutes an &ldquo;interested person&rdquo; as referred to in section 6 of the Bill?  It is an interesting phrase.  I would welcome some elaboration on it particularly since I understand section 6 was not debated in any length in the other House.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I hope to come back to a more detailed discussion of what precisely section 6 means.  At this stage I would like, for my own clarification, to get a definition.  I would like the Minister to indicate, if he can, whether, in the course of the legal advice that is being presented about this legislation, we are talking about direct rights for children.  Are we talking about derived rights of children?  Do children under our Constitution have any direct rights, or are all their rights derived from <Col N="139" /> and related to their position as members of a family or of children of parents?  Do we recognise that children have rights?</P>
    <P>Many constitutions, and many United Nations declarations, have considerable detail about the rights of children.  Do our children have any rights because they are children, because they are persons in their own right, or are all their rights effectively related in a greater or lesser way to a relationship between themselves and their parents?  It is an extremely important question in terms of the whole philosophy of child care.  We have an extraordinarily primeval concept of juvenile justice where, after years and years, the age of criminal responsibility is still seven, where our children really have no justice and where there is considerable doubt as to whether our children have rights.</P>
    <P>There is even more doubt about whether our children have any real guarantees, as distinct from an enormous amount of rhetoric about our children. Without wanting to broaden the scope of the debate, in order to understand what the legislation is about we need to have some sort of background about where our children fit into our constitutional and legislative processes.</P>
    <P>There are other concerns that have been raised quite legitimately.  I would like the Minister to elaborate, as far as possible, on why he is so sure, given the apparent inadequacy of his advice on previous occasions, that it is possible to give retrospective effect to this legislation. It would be useful to have some more detail on the precedents on which that advice was based.  I know the Attorney General's advice to the Government is confidential, but I am sure the Minister can give us some information to justify the retrospective provisions of this legislation.  Many people working in the child care area are deeply concerned.  I wonder has the Government given any thought to the apparent insistence of the Supreme Court that the natural parents must have some sort of guaranteed right of information about <Col N="140" /> the names, addresses, etc., of foster parents.</P>
    <P>That is a problem which I know many people working in the area of child care have adverted to.  It raises serious problems about the whole question of foster care.  If it turns out to be a serious obstacle to the proper care of our most vulnerable children, and if we need a constitutional amendment to protect the children &mdash; not to protect the foster parents, but to protect the security and the future of the children &mdash; then it should be done.</P>
    <P>I am glad Senator Upton mentioned child sexual abuse.  I would like to put on the record of the House a comment that was made to a meeting I attended by a superintendent of the Garda Síochána who said that the gardaí were, in his opinion, convinced that the vast majority of offences of a sexual nature against children were carried out by homosexuals. That suggests to me that we have a long way to go before we get a proper national consensus on the issue of child sexual abuse when that level of authority in our society can express an opinion of that kind at a public meeting and remain in office.</P>
    <P>That does not mean that we should be deterred from the issue.  It is time we got away from the conspiracy theory about child sexual abuse, suggesting that somebody is trying to undermine the family. What we are all trying to do is to protect our children.  That is what this legislation attempts to do.  If our Constitution, because of the period in which it was written or because of a fear of the totalitarian State or whatever, is inadequate in its capacity to allow us to protect our children, then we have a simple solution at our disposal which I am quite sure would be acceptable to the Irish people, and that is to amend our Constitution in such a way as to make perfectly clear that the primary concern of our Constitution and our laws must be the welfare of the child and that no other rights can be used or claimed to interfere with that fundamental concern.</P>
    <P>We may wish to balance those rights. We may wish to ensure that there is a proper and fair hearing for people who <Col N="141" /> are concerned but we cannot get away from the fact that at the centre of our legislation must be the rights of children, not the rights of those of us who have children and not some sort of proprietorial rights, but the rights of children to the best we can offer them, whether it be in terms of financial support, family support, income support or security.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to welcome the Minister, Deputy Treacy, to the House.  He has been a regular visitor to us over the years.  We are always glad to have him back with us in a new portfolio, one that I know that he will excel in.  I also welcome yourself, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, and congratulate you on your appointment.  I congratulate also the two Senators who have made their maiden speeches, Senator O'Reilly and Senator Keogh.</P>
      <P>This is a short Bill.  We would also agree that the measures that are with us today are vitally important.  What we are doing is bridging a gap in the law which has been brought to our attention in a judgment of the Supreme Court which was handed down last Thursday.  We all know that there are over 800 children in the care of the various health boards as a result of decisions taken by various district justices to place children whom they decided needed care in the custody of the health boards.  In making those decisions, we all accept the fact that the district justices believed that the existing law enabled them to deem the health boards to be fit persons.  It now transpires that the law does not enable district justices to deem the health board to be fit persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, as a health board member &mdash; and I am sure I speak on behalf of many of the health board members around the country &mdash; we would see the position as being a little disappointing.  I want to make it quite clear that I am not querying in any way the judgment of the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court and, indeed, the earlier judgment of the court raise many complex issues which would have an impact on the whole area of child care proceedings.  In any debate of this kind, <Col N="142" /> it is crucial that the right approach and the right balance be struck as between the rights of the parents and the rights of the children.</P>
    <P>More than 800 children are in the case of health boards on foot of court orders. This highlights the need for State agencies to be given the responsibility of caring for children whom the courts consider to be in need of care and protection. We cannot ignore the fact that the health boards have had for 18 years the experience of undertaking that particular role of the satisfaction of the courts and the Irish people.  Clearly they are the appropriate agency to be given that task of continuing to perform this vital work.</P>
    <P>The judgment that was handed down by the Supreme Court last week identified a gap in our existing law and did not make any judgment on the way the health boards, as child care agencies, have carried out their responsibilities. What we are being asked to do now here this evening in this legislation is to give to the court and to the health boards the powers they have been exercising, in my opinion with great care and with great sensitivity for the past 18 years.  What we are doing is bridging a gap until the passing of the Children Bill of 1988.</P>
    <P>The Government have acted wisely and understandably in this issue.  When they became aware of the Supreme Court judgment, they obviously thought about whether they should rush through the Child Care Bill of 1988 or wait and deal with it differently.  Because of the many complex and sensitive issues that are being dealt with in the 1988 Bill, they were wise to stop and to bring forward a short amending Bill to deal with the key point of the Supreme Court's ruling, that is, that the health boards do not have statutory authority to act as fit persons within the meaning of the Children's Act of 1908.</P>
    <P>The Government acted correctly.  In my opinion this Bill is certainly appropriate for the action that was necessary.  It will bridge that gap until the passing of the important Child Care Bill of 1988.  I wish this Bill a short life, as it were, until <Col N="143" /> such time as it will be brought under the umbrella of the Child Care Bill of 1988.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Congratulations to you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, on your election and the ease with which you have taken up your position.</P>
      <P>I would like to respond to Senator Farrell.  I am surprised he has not heard the alarm bells ringing which enabled this legislation to be rushed through so quickly.  I am increasingly disturbed that we are seeing the courts having to push the Oireachtas into legislation.</P>
      <P>In relation to the emergency Children Bill, I have a question to the Minister of State and it concerns section 4(3).  I will read the bit that causes confusion with me.</P>
      <P>Without prejudice to subsection (1) a health board may either in a fixed period or until the health board otherwise determines, allow a child or young person who has been committed to its care under an order made pursuant to Part II or IV of the Children Act, 1908 to be under the care and control of a parent or other suitable person.</P>
      <P>That reference to &ldquo;a parent or other suitable person&rdquo; is loosely worded from my viewpoint and to the non-trained legal eye.  It gives the impression that perhaps the child may be allowed to go back to the home from which the court order decided in the first place to take the child away.  I would like a comment on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the commitment given by the Government to revive the 1988 Child Care Bill at Committee Stage and to appoint an all-party select committee to facilitate its quick passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I would like to draw attention to the area of resources. Like everything else, emergency focuses the mind of the general public and it is just now that the general public are taking into account the importance of children in relation to this area.  Obviously we are talking about under-resources, both financial and personnel, and support facilities for families.  The implications for the social workers in the child care <Col N="144" /> area are great because now places of safety orders must be brought before the court within eight days rather than the three to four weeks previously allowed and that will put a burden on the existing few social workers.</P>
    <P>I will give an example of how hard pressed our social workers are.  If you take a community care area like north Tipperary, and it is typical of many community care areas in the country, in a population of 100,000 people they are serviced by five social workers, which is one to 20,000.  In that area there are 100 children in care of whom 40 were in care for whom a fit person court order had to be obtained.  My investigations have shown that a new case comes up every two weeks so what are social workers to do?</P>
    <P>First, they must have time for the investigation of the case, they must have time to recruit foster parents.  There is absolutely no weekend availability of social workers and at a time when a child is placed in a foster home with parents who do not know this child you could imagine the tension that child will place on a family if the child happens to be in his or her teenage years.  There is no weekend help for emergency action if the foster parents need help at that particular time.</P>
    <P>There is not enough staff to bring the children to see their families once a month.  When one thinks in terms of the pressure on the existing social workers, at the end of the day no matter what legislation we put into place we are only covering over the cracks.  In Ireland, we are supposed to be fanatical about our children, and I say supposed because here we find that the children most at risk are being starved of the resources necessary to integrate them into what I hope would eventually be full family life.</P>
    <P>There is one area that worries me, the limbo area within the age group 16 to 18. As a parent of a 20-year old and knowing the traumas of teenage years, the years from 16 to 18 are certainly a time when children are most at risk.  They are in a limbo area.</P>
    <P>I referred a moment ago to a case every <Col N="145" /> two weeks in the north Tipperary area of sexual abuse where a child will have to be taken from its home and placed in fosterage or elsewhere.  International research has now shown that 95 per cent of women in prostitution had been sexually abused.  We are talking about something that has just come into public focus in this country in the past few years.  As a teacher I am very much aware of the rate of sexual abuse of the children I teach.  Social workers cannot possibly look after those cases already known to them, let alone those that they do not even know about.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Child Care Bill, 1988, I understand there are at least 64 sections with possibly 200 or more amendments. Obviously this will take considerable time to be debated, plus the fact that more time has to be made available until the final ministerial order is actually going through.  My point here is that while we are actually debating the emergency Bill it is important to realise the consequences of this emergency Bill if it goes through. For me and the Fine Gael Party the priority area is to ensure a reduction in the number of children being taken into care in the first place.  I would be looking for preventive action not remedial action.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Reilly that I would like the Fine Gael Party to have the constitutionality of this Bill tested before it becomes law.  Technicalities, plugging loopholes is important but in the context of the importance of children in this nation everything must be in order before we go forward to working towards the implementation of the Bill in 1989.</P>

      <P>First, I would like to join in congratulations and best wishes to yourself for taking the Chair so very promptly and for your courtesy.  On this Bill, we should recollect why we have not only this Bill but the many other Bills which preceeded either in this Legislature or in the United Kingdom.  Basically what we are talking about is cruelty to children <Col N="146" /> and trying to prevent or obviate that cruelty.</P>
      <P>It is as one of the other speakers has suggested very much an international problem.  We may not have in this country the horrific tens of thousands, some have estimated millions, of children who at this time are regarded by international organisations as being in a state of slavery. It seems an old-fashioned world but it still happens today to small children. We are fortunate in this country in these days that we do not have cruelty to children as a result of starvation.  We have seen that recently on our television screens.  We are fortunate also that we do not have that most appalling cruelty of all to children, torture of children, which still happens unfortunately in certain régimes where children are tortured either individualy or even in front of their parents.  Cruelty to children is widespread. It is appalling and something which we thank God do not have in this country in that sense.</P>
      <P>That does not mean that we can pat ourselves on the back.  We have 800 children in care, four to five children every week going into care.  Listening to the last speaker the implication would be that the numbers should be increased.  I agree wholeheartedly with the speaker's suggestion of prevention rather than treatment or custody.  The situation is not just one of simply sexual abuse.  That may be very fashionable to talk about at present, it may be very appalling, but there are many other circumstances and reasons.  Parents are unable to look after their children for one reason, bereavement, leaving small children literally with nobody to look after them.  There are many reasons why children are taken into care.  Drug abuse, unfortunately, is going to mean that more Irish children are going to have to be taken into care either because their parents are drug addicts or because the children themselves at an early age have become drug addicts.  We may be thankful that we do not have the appalling cruelty which exists elsewhere but we have not all that much to thank ourselves for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to suggest that in addition <Col N="147" /> to the care of the children we should also not forget the rights of parents &mdash; although I do not like that word &mdash; the concerns of a mother who finds she just cannot look after her child.  Is she to be deprived of the opportunity of seeing that child because she has had to go through the agony of giving it up, of having to give it out to foster parents?  There are certain aspects there which need to be examined and not just assume that they are totally there.</P>
    <P>What about the child itself?  We have had too many cases in the past of broken up families, of small children being separated from the few friends they had, their little sisters and brothers and, perhaps, not meeting them again until many years afterwards or, maybe, never being able to meet them again despite what agonies they may go through looking for them and, equally, of their parents perhaps never seeing them again.  Let us not talk as though there is just an isolated child or an isolated parent.  Very often there is a much deeper and complicated story.</P>
    <P>This Bill arises from a Supreme Court decision; it is very necessary and expeditious and I am glad to see the Minister and Minister of State showing this degree of expedition and urgency.  I have sympathy with the view that has been expressed about testing its constitutionality but we are not really in a situation where one could allow any time to go by.  This Bill is necessary, it is urgent.  It appears to have been thought out very carefully and that is appropriate and necessary.  As we all know, it is accompanied with and has been preceded by a very detailed Bill, the Child Care Bill of 1988, and we will be looking forward in this House to seeing this Bill and debating it in detail.  It is one of the most complicated Bills which has come before these Houses of Parliament.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of references to the Children's Act of 1908 and it is true that the Bill we are referring to relates very much to the 1908 Act.</P>

      <P>Perhaps at some stage we will again have a situation when, from time to time, the Dáil will be kind enough to extend to us the same courtesy and adjourn when we are having a vote here.  Continuing with the Bill, we are looking at, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, we are really basically talking about a Bill in relation to cruelty, or preventing cruelty to children.  That is the basic purpose, the avoidance or cessation of it and, indeed, the Act that is being referred to here so often &mdash; the 1908 Children Act of the United Kingdom Parliament &mdash; is very largely a follow-on of the Cruelty to Children Act, 1904 of the United Kingdom Parliament.</P>
      <P>It is interesting &mdash; section 38 is the quoted section &mdash; that this Part of the Act, 38 (1) &ldquo;and this Part of this Act unless the context otherwise requires, the expression &lsquo;fit person&rsquo; in relation to the care of any child or young person includes any society or body corporate established for the reception or protection of poor children or the prevention of cruelty to children&rdquo;.  Obviously the Supreme Coourt has taken a view and I think it is very appropriate.</P>
      <P>May I welcome the Cathaoirleach to his new post at this time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been suggestion that we did not see the warnings and so on.  I think in this country it is very appropriate and excellent that we have a Supreme Court, and that the legislation that we are putting through this House, and the other House of Parliament, should be subject to query and review in the Supreme Court.  May it always be so, however inconvenient or awkward it may be at times.  Again, I think the Government have very rightly responded in an appropriate manner, very rapidly and expeditiously, but not prematurely, to the requirements of the Supreme Court <Col N="149" /> judgment.  Looking at the 1908 Act, Parts I and IV are quoted in that Act.  Part III is not, but there has been a good deal of mention here, in one sense or another, of children's abuse.  I wonder is Part III still valid today, is whereby anybody who sells to a person apparently under the age of 16 years any cigarettes, whether for his own or use or not, shall be liable on summary conviction in the case of a first offence to a fine.  It would be not inappropriate if that section is, in fact, still law.</P>
    <P>May I make one plea to the Minister? There is reference to industrial schools. This is an appalling archaic term which in itself carries overtones of cruelty and lack of true concern or compassion for children.  May I make the plea, a Chathaoirligh, to the Minister that in the full legislation which he is considering this archaic and inappropriate term be removed from each and every section of the Bill which is to come before us.</P>
    <P>Finally, there has been mention here of legislation and the time taken for legislation to go through and how in the United Kingdom Parliament it is possible to have a list of legislation, including such Acts as, for example, the corresponding Act of the Child Care Bill, and that that is duly passed and it is known that it will be passed by the end of a given session. The Senator who raised the matter, and I myself &mdash; and maybe that would be a good thing, at any rate as regards myself &mdash; under the United Kingdom system would probably not have the opportunity to speak to a Bill such as this because the guillotine is brought down so frequently and so early in order to ensure that that legislation passes.  It would be a great pity if we followed that sort of authoritarian, bureaucratic regime which pertains there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I would like to offer my congratulations to yourself on your election to your present high office. I have no doubt that you will follow in the tradition of many distinguished predecessors in exercising your duties expeditiously and fairly and also in relation to how you treat all the Members of this <Col N="150" /> House.  Secondly, I would like to welcome the Minister here and congratulate him on his appointment to his new office.</P>
      <P>In dealing with this Bill it is probably useful, first of all, to mention why we have this Bill before us.  It is because a section of the 1908 Act was struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court last week.  In mentioning that, it might be useful to consider that an Act 81 years old is still the Act governing one of the most important areas of legislation because of the fact that it governs how our children are looked after.  As a result of that decision and various other decisions that have been handed down by the courts over the last number of years in relation to changing EC legislation and changing constitutional interpretations, one should be considering for the future that legislation should, as a matter of course, be looked at after a certain period so that we would have the situation that very important legislation passed many years ago in very different circumstances should come up for some sort of review, although in many cases it may not need change.  Acts which were passed before the previous two wars and which are still the law of the country should, as a matter of course, come before parliament or before reviewers, whether it is lawyers or the draftsman's office, to look at what the present day situation is and to look at where changes can possibly take place. It is a practice that should take place after a certain period of time, whether it be five, ten or 20 years.  I say that because more and more bits of law are at times being struck down and we are ending up having to rush in.  We are all guilty of that process, that we are inclined to react after the event.  It might be appropriate, therefore, that legislation for the future should be reviewed on an ongoing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Government have reacted quickly and speedily in the light of last Thursday's decision because I think it would be a totally unacceptable situation if for any reason laws, decisions or orders affecting the most vulnerable and most important members of our society could in any way be possibly struck down and children who have <Col N="151" /> been looked after or taken into care could suddenly find themselves in difficulty or under further threat or re-threatened in some way.  It is good that we are dealing with this as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>It was the right decision to go along with, just bringing in one small piece of enabling legislation to get over the matter raised in the Supreme Court judgment, because it would have been wrong if one were to have it included in the major Child Care Bill which has been sent to a special committee.  If that had been rushed through that would have been compounding an error.  It would have been very wrong to rush through legislation which we have all looked forward to, legislation which is very important. We hope that the committee will look at it as soon as possible.  There are many complex areas here and to rush it through or guillotine it would have been the wrong approach.</P>
    <P>The urgent action which was required has brought the Bill before us.  Most of us would agree with its contents.  If we have suggestions, particularly in relation to its constitutionality, I personally would favour referring it to the Supreme Court. It is a matter that could be dealt with relatively quickly.  I know the Minister has given his views on why he is quite happy with it, and obviously he is getting the best advice available.  But other legislation has been struck down.  I presume the Supreme Court could, in the light of the urgency of the legislation, consider it quickly and give a quick judgment.  It would be a further catastrophe if we were back here in six months, or in 18 months, with some other change having been made necessary, perhaps as a result of a court decision.  Perhaps the Minister could consider that option.  I would also ask him, when replying, to say what opinion was given in relation to the fact that it is retrospective legislation and that previous Acts and previous orders made are in fact being rubber-stamped under the new Bill.  Is the Minister quite satisfied that it is not going to be overturned? One would hope that, if there was any doubt in relation to it, a court, even if <Col N="152" /> they questioned it, would not release a child or put a child into any difficult situation.</P>
    <P>The whole area of child care and child abuse and the various forms it takes is a very complex and delicate area.  In any legislation you obviously want to have sufficient powers available so that matters can be moved on quickly if a dangerous or difficult situation for a child is developing.  One also has to consider very carefully the rights and concerns of parents, who for one reason or another may find themselves in difficulty.  There are many situations in which parents may find themselves in difficulties.  It may be a minor case of neglect owing to financial circumstances.  We would be aware of the present situation in which some parents, or even single breadwinners in a family where there is only one parent, are just making ends meet and trying to bring up a large family often on a very low income and basically a grossly inadequate income.  We have to look at various situations. We also have to consider that at times there can be possible vindictive actions where one parent or both parents can be blamed, perhaps in the wrong, or where reports can be put through to a health board or to a social worker which in fact may be malicious.  There are all these areas where we have to be very careful when we are bringing forward such legislation as this.</P>
    <P>As we are aware, there are about 900 children in certain care and there are many more children in other types of care.  It is important that as far as possible information be made available to the parents, if that is the right course of action in certain cases.  We have to remember what has happened in England and what went on in Cleveland.  I would suggest to the Minister that, when he is looking at the boards and the people who are going to deal with these cases, he would ensure that sufficient funding is made available and that the properly qualified people be appointed.  He should also ensure that there is sufficient right of appeal in cases where social workers or doctors may be starting off from a wrong point of view, which remains <Col N="153" /> throughout a case, when, in fact, they may have either been misled or misinformed. All of these matters have to be looked at in relation to examining cases that come before the board.</P>
    <P>I would suggest &mdash; I think the Minister referred to this last night in the other House &mdash; that the term &ldquo;industrial school&rdquo; should be dropped as soon as possible.  It is archaic and I would hope that when the substantive Bill comes forward some of these archaic references will be struck out.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say that we welcome this Bill.  I would ask the Minister to reply in relation to the constitutionality aspect.  It is often a safety first procedure to refer legislation and I would hope that if this were to be referred to the Supreme Court they would not unduly delay it.  It is amazing what can happen when all minds are alike.  We often have complaints about understaffed draftsman's office in relation to getting legislation.  This just goes to show that when the will is there legislation can be produced quickly.  Obviously, it has to be considered whether it should be referred.  If the Supreme Court were to give a judgment within a week or two, it might copperfasten the situation rather than having a doubt hanging over decisions made and whether a health board, through its officers, was deemed a &ldquo;fit person&rdquo; as is in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would also like the Minister to consider, when he is replying, the retrospective element and whether proper advice is being taken in relation to that. I know that in some aspects, such as crime, changes in certain legislation, cannot be made retrospective.  I would hope that any orders made by the health boards, who in many places have been doing great work in this area, will be proper and valid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to compliment the Minister and the Government for the speedy manner in which they acted to redress a situation that has resulted from the Supreme Court ruling in relation to the <Col N="154" /> health boards.  I would also like to compliment Minister Treacy on what he said about the articles in the newspapers and to concur with him in stating that the suggestion that the Government were not concerned or were not anxious to bring forward the Children Bill was just not true.  I think the media regularly give bland headlines and give a slanted view which in many cases, while there may be facts interspersed, is very much not the case.</P>
      <P>I was interested to hear Senator Jackman referring to north Tipperary in relation to a particular study that was done on child care and child abuse and the problems in that area.  I think that this particular problem is not peculiar to north Tipperary; it is a problem that is quite indigenous to and indicative of society throughout the country and, indeed, of many other countries.  One would have to agree with her when she mentioned the difficulties that are experienced by health boards in dealing with the child care problem.  As I understand it, one of the reasons she has given for, to an extent, not agreeing with this legislation was the fact that the resources were not available.  One could argue at length about what adequate resources are in relation to particular situations; but, as I see it, if the legislation is not in place, then whatever resources were available could not be used to put the operation in place.</P>
      <P>It is very important to understand what we are talking about in this legislation. The opening paragraph of the Minister's speech is very important, and I quote:</P>
      <P>The effect of the Supreme Court ruling is that the health boards are no longer able to take into their care children who have been neglected, ill-treated or abused or who are otherwise at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is the kernel of the whole problem.  All of us have accepted that since the health boards were established in 1970 they have taken onto themselves the responsibility for dealing with children at risk.  One Senator referred to preventive measures rather than <Col N="155" /> remedial measures.  The fact that the majority of families would not find themselves in the difficult situation that would result in children being taken into care is proof that the vast majority of people do avail of preventive measures.  The difficulty in relation to the whole child care problem is that it involves a huge social area.</P>
    <P>We all know that when you are dealing with families you are dealing with a very private unit.  Many people will never know at any one time what exactly is the case in relation to the relationship, either between husband and wife or between husband and children or between mother and children at any one time.  The only time you get to understand that is when something happens that comes to the notice of either social workers or the Garda or whoever.  It would be ludicrous to suggest that there should be people going around to every household to find out exactly how the families are functioning. That is something that none of us would ever wish to become embroiled in.  Families are composed of human beings and the best families in the world are going to have their ups and downs at different times.</P>
    <P>What we are concerned about here is the situation that develops when, for one reason or another, children must be taken into care.  If anything, we have to err on the side of the child.  It is extremely important that the rights of the children are borne in mind, because if the child is being abused or misused in any way then somebody else must accept the responsibility of ensuring that that situation is corrected.</P>
    <P>I remember speaking at length here last year in relation to the Bill dealing with rape and dealing with the consequences of children being put at risk in that situation.  It is absolutely traumatic. It is a most unusual development that the organisations that were playing a major role in relation to this whole childcare situation, and were seen to be the appropriate authorities to do so, are those that are in dispute in relation to the Supreme Court judgment.  While the 1908 Act <Col N="156" /> states that a person would be entitled to put a child into care if that child was at risk, we all know that in fact it is the health boards who have assumed that responsibility, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>As the Minister states, in a social area like this there are no easy answers.  It is a very very complex business.  As he said, to wait until the Child Care Bill, 1988, would have been finalised would have been a big mistake.  I commend him for bringing forward this legislation, because it is extremely important that someone in authority &mdash; in this instance the health boards &mdash; would have the power to take children at risk into care.</P>
    <P>Access by parents to their children and all that entails is a very difficult situation but, as I said already, it is extremely important that somebody would be responsible for the welfare of the children. I suppose one has to acknowledge that throughout the country, even at present, there are a number of children who are at risk and nobody just knows about it.  That is the unfortunate thing about this situation.  It is only when it is probably too late that it comes to notice.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister and the Government on bringing forward this Bill in such a speedy manner.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief comment on this very important Bill.  Before doing so, I would like to congratulate yourself on your election as Cathaoirleach.  I have no doubt that you will be an excellent and most impartial Cathaoirleach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to endorse some of the sentiments made by other speakers.  As already pointed out, the purpose of this Bill is to deal with the situation that has arisen following a judgment of the Supreme Court on 2 November in which the court ruled that a health board does not have the statutory authority to act as a fit person within the meaning of the Children's Act, 1908.  The effect of this is that the health boards are no longer able to take into their care children who <Col N="157" /> have been neglected, ill-treated or abused, or who are otherwise at risk.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave made the point that it is of major concern to everybody throughout the length and breadth of the country and the Supreme Court decision caused a storm and was of major concern to many parents.  The various health boards were concerned as well, because for the first time their position was jeopardised because it was accepted that when the health boards were set up in 1970 the then Minister made provision under the Child Care Act to protect their interest with regard to child care because it was a part of the social work of the various health boards.</P>
    <P>The existing law in relation to child care is contained mainly in the Children Act, 1908.  Briefly, that Act allows any person who believes that the health, safety or welfare of a child is in jeopardy to bring the matter before the District Court.  If, having considered the evidence, the district justice is satisfied that it is essential in the child's interest to do so, he may order that the child be removed from the custody of his parents or guardians and be committed to the care of a relative or other fit person.</P>
    <P>The common denominator here is the description of &ldquo;fit person&rdquo;.  While the decision was given in favour of the health boards on four points out of five, the main point is the reason for this legislation going through here this evening. The expression &ldquo;fit person&rdquo; is defined in section 38 of the 1908 Act as follows:</P>
    <P>In this part of this Act unless the context otherwise requires the expression &ldquo;fit person&rdquo; in relation to the care of a child or young person includes any society or body ...</P>
    <P>For that reason it was a disappointment but, of course, the Supreme Court were within their jurisdiction to give that decision.  It does not, however, spell out who may or may not act as a fit person. The only thing it does is to indicate that the expression fit person includes certain societies and other bodies involved in child care.  This is where the Minister is concerned.  I congratulate him and the <Col N="158" /> Government on the way they moved so speedily after that Supreme Court decision.</P>
    <P>From time to time doubts were expressed by some prominent legal people about the legal authority of health boards to involve themselves in child care.  When a problem arose which eventually resulted in going to the District Court and then to the Supreme Court, where the decision was challenged, it highlighted the inaccuracies in that legislation.  The Minister has already given details without naming the particular health board.  We have had, and still have, situations in our constituencies where serious problems arose from time to time when children were abused due to various problems within the home. It may be due to financial problems or domestic problems, but the only hope for these children was the safeguard of the health boards.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill provides for two matters, firstly, the expression &ldquo;fit person&rdquo; in the Children's Act, 1908 includes and should be deemed always to have included a reference to a health board and, secondly, that the functions of a health board will be covered well within the Act.  Section 2 provides that every order made before the passing of this Act shall be construed and have effect as if this Act were in force when the order was first made.</P>
    <P>Section 3 states that where on the passing of this Act, a child or young person is in the actual possession or control of any person, that is, a social worker, foster parent or a manager of a children's home and he is in that person's care as a result of a &ldquo;fit person&rdquo; order, committing him to a health board, he should be deemed to be lawfully in the possession or control of that person, that is, the social worker or health board.</P>
    <P>The whole area of child care and child abuse is very complex.  This is of great concern to parents and especially to legislators because we must be sure that in this legislation will stand up to any constitutional challenge, I have no doubt it will.  I would like to compliment the Government and the Minister on the <Col N="159" /> speedy way in which they have dealt with this situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome this emergency legislation, the purpose of which is to deal with 800 children in care as a result of the unanimous Supreme Court judgment of 2 November 1989, delivered on behalf of a full five member Supreme Court by Chief Justice Finley.  The Fine Gael Party are most anxious, as all Members of this House are, to facilitate the early enactment of this emergency legislation because we are concerned to remove any possible anxiety or stress for those 800 children who are in care.</P>
      <P>This emergency legislation seeks to deal with the crucial point contained in the Supreme Court ruling, namely, that health boards do not have the statutory authority to act as a fit person within the meaning of the Children's Act, 1908.  In spite of the firm assurances from the Minister for Health that this Bill has been carefully drafted in the Attorney General's Office to take account of the Supreme Court decision and other recent judicial pronouncements there is doubt about the legality and constitutionality of certain aspects of the Bill.</P>
      <P>This legislation is of such a rushed nature that the Minister had to table three amendments on its passage through the Dáil, one correcting a draftsman's error and two others providing linking clauses.  I am particularly concerned that the provisions in this Bill which seek retrospectively to validate court orders for the care of children may not be legally and constitutionally sustainable.  In this regard, I must point to the recent High Court judgment which overturned efforts by the Oireachtas to validate retrospectively the appointment and actions of a District Justice.  I recall that on that occasion also when that legislation was passing through both Houses of the Oireachtas we were assured by none other than the then Minister for Justice that that particular legislation was legally and constitutionally sound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister <Col N="160" /> for Health referred to section 62(2) of the Health Act, 1970 which obliges a health board to make available without charge a health examination and a treatment service for pupils attending national schools.  The Minister goes on to indicate that it is under this section, namely section 66 (2) of the 1970 Act, that a health board claims to derive its powers to take a child into care under a section 24 order. Referring to the Supreme Court judgment of 2 November, 1989, the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>While the court found in favour of the health board on four of the five grounds, it found against the health board on the final point when it decided that health boards do not have the necessary legal authority to act as a fit person.  In doing so the Supreme Court reversed the decision given by the High Court just 16 months previously.</P>
    <P>These are the words of the Minister for Health speaking for the Government. Here it seems to me we have obvious annoyance and indeed an implicit criticism on the part of the Government of the unanimous decision of the Supreme Court.  I believe the Minister and Members of both Houses would do well to read into the records of these Houses the relevant and pertinent part of the Supreme Court judgment delivered on behalf of a unanimous Supreme Court by Mr. Justice Finlay when he said:</P>
    <P>Having regard to the universal nature of the provisions contained in Part II of the Act of 1908 in respect of the protection and welfare of children, and, in particular, in respect of the making of care orders and the designation of fit persons, it would appear to me extraordinary if the health board, by virtue of an obligation to make available to children over the age of six years a health service, provided only that they are attending a national school or a specially designated school, could be construed as making a health board a fit person, presumably in respect of such children only under the Acts of 1908 but having no function of <Col N="161" /> a like kind in regard to other children even of the same age who did not happen to be attending such schools.</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice continued:</P>
    <P>It would in my view be an unwarranted extension of the obligations imposed on a health board by that subsection to consider that they are a fit person. </P>
    <P>Almost 20 years ago the Kennedy report made the case for a new Children's Act.  For several years politicians and professionals in the area have known that decisions such as those that were handed down by the Supreme Court on 27 July 1988 and on 2 November 1989 were entirely predictable and, I suggest, virtually inevitable.  The present crisis has at least pushed the issue of child care to the head of the political agenda.  However, these two rulings of the Supreme Court have raised important issues about how care orders are made and the rights of parents in this matter.</P>
    <P>I would be most anxious in the light of the Supreme Court judgments that as many aspects as possible of the Supreme Court judgments should be implemented in this legislation.  I believe, in particular that access to children by the natural parents and by those in <i>loco parentis</i> should be provided for in this legislation and that the parents and people in <i>loco parentis</i> should be entitled to know where their children are and to visit them while they are in care.  The Supreme Court in their judgment of 2 November, 1989 indicated quite clearly that the taking of a child into care, except in very special circumstances, should not automatically cut off that child from its parents and extended family.</P>
    <P>There must be proper arrangements for access and communication.  We need to consider the devastating impact on a child, not simply being taken out of contact with an abusing parent but being cut off from the innocent parent and the extended family of aunts, uncles, grandparents and cousins.  I believe, also, that it is absolutely necessary for health boards in the light of the facts revealed in this case to furnish the parents in <Col N="162" /> respect of whose child the care order is being sought with any documentary or assessment evidence regarding the child on the pre-trial basis.  This would include, I suggest, the video recordings referred to in this case, the assessment and indeed the written submissions by social workers.  There is also emerging from the Supreme Court judgment the clear right of parents to have a separate independent assessment of their child.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that unless we make the changes in the requirements as outlined in the Supreme Court judgment, the changes dealing with access reports, assessments, video recordings and the right of parents to have an independent assessment, this legislation may also be defective.  The crisis precipitated by the Supreme Court decision on 2 November 1989 will have achieved considerable long-term good if it results in the early passage of the Child Care Bill, 1988, a long promised and much delayed Bill.  A comprehensive new Children Bill would have obviated the need for action by the courts.  This is another example of essential reform taking place only when the Oireachtas has been forced into it by the courts.</P>
    <P>I know there are some amendments likely to be tabled and I do not wish to detain the House too long.  I hope that the matters I have referred to may prove unfounded.  I welcome this enactment and I hope the legislation is legally and constitutionally sound but I would suggest the Minister would be well advised to take on board the additional matters that have been outlined by the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>At the outset I would like to sincerely thank all the Senators who have contributed to the Second Stage debate.  Their contributions were very positive.  I especially wish to pay tribute to new Senators making their maiden speeches.  I hope they all make many more positive and interesting speeches, as we have heard here this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a short narrow Bill, which is an <Col N="163" /> immediate response by the Government to deal with the situation which has arisen as a result of the Supreme Court judgment of Thursday, 2 November 1989.  I am satisfied that this Bill deals with the technical problem which has been identified by the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Some of the media coverage and public comments relating to that Supreme Court judgment have suggested that the decision that health boards do not have statutory authority to act as fit person was in some way signalled by the earlier judgment in the same case which was delivered on 27 July 1989.  I have studied that judgment in great detail and I have to say that there is no foundation for this assertion.  The judgment of 27 July 1989 dealt solely with the pre-trial procedures of a trial itself in the District Court where the fit person order in question was originally made.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court came to the conclusion that these procedures had not been carried in accordance with the necessary standards of natural justice, thus rendering the fit person order unsafe.  As a result the court ordered the release of the child and its return to its parents.  I want to make it quite clear that the judgment of 27 July did not allude in any way to the question of whether a health board is empowered to act as a fit person or not.  This is one of five issues in which the court reserved its judgment and its decision on these points were delivered Thursday, 2 November 1989.</P>
    <P>In the judgment last week the Supreme Court upheld the original rulings of the High Court on four of the five issues but allowed the appeal on the question of whether a health board had power to act as a fit person.  As this House, is aware, the court held that health boards do not have such a power.  This is the factual position and my remarks in my opening address were not, and could not be, construed as an implied criticism of the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court in making its judgment last Thursday was acting properly in accordance with our Constitution. It is for the Supreme Court to interpret <Col N="164" /> the law of the land.  The Government recognise that this is the responsibility of the Supreme Court and completely accept its judgment in relation to the power of health boards to act as fit persons within the meaning of the Children Act, 1908.  As I have said, I simply stated the factual position in my opening address namely that the High Court judgment represented the law until last Thursday.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to deal with the difficulties which have arisen as a result of the Supreme Court decision. The court held that the health boards do not have a power to act as fit persons.  It must be said, however, particularly in view of the comments which have appeared in the media, that there were no reasonable grounds for the Government, the Minister for Health, or the Department of Health, to believe before last Thursday that the court would find against the health boards in any way.  It is all very well for certain Senators, with the benefit of hindsight, to criticise the Government for not anticipating this ruling.  However, the fact is that up to last Thursday the legal position was as laid down by the High Court in July 1988 by Miss Justice Carroll, that is that health boards could act as fit persons.</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed to deal with the immediate difficulty which has arisen. The Government are satisfied that the Bill before the House does that.  The improvement in clarification of our child care legislation generally can, in the Government's view, best be done in the context of the debate on the Child Care Bill, 1988 which has now been referred to a special committee of Dáil Éireann. I look forward to working with this committee and I am sure we will get the maximum co-operation from the Opposition parties so that a comphehensive and enlightened Child Care Bill can be enacted as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The issues to be discussed by the all-party committee are extremely complex and involve careful consideration of the correct balance between the rights of parents on the one hand and the rights of children on the other hand.  While the <Col N="165" /> State and its agencies must have the authority and the resources to protect children who are being assaulted, ill-treated, seriously neglected, sexually abused or who are at risk it is equally important to protect children and families from unwarranted or excessive interference.</P>
    <P>I would see children being taken into care against the wishes of their parents only in exceptional cases.  Our child care legislation must pose no threat to family life generally, or to the vast majority of parents who are doing an excellent job, sometimes under very difficult circumstances, to rear and care for their children.  Legislative provisions to provide for the correct balance between the rights of parents and the rights of children require very careful consideration.  It will be the purpose of the all-party committee to ensure that this balance is correctly struck.  It is the Government's desire in relation to the larger and broader child care question to reform the law in this area as quickly as possible.  I dealt with this in my opening address but I feel I must emphasise it once more in view of the comments of some of the speakers.</P>
    <P>One of the first actions of the new Government was to have a motion passed in the Dáil, on 20 July last, restoring the Bill to the Dáil Order Paper at the Stage it had reached prior to the dissolution of the previous Dáil, the Committee Stage. Furthermore, the new Government gave a firm commitment that the Bill was one of their top legislative priorities.  This was confirmed in the Dáil by the Taoiseach. The Government have already taken action in relation to this commitment. The Committee Stage debate commenced last week, before the Supreme Court judgment whose decision has created the necessity for today's Children Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure Senators that in drafting this Bill the Government have had the benefit and the advice of the highest law officers in the State.  So far as humanly possible every effort has been made to ensure that the legislation does the job it is designed to do, that is to overcome the technical defects identified by the Supreme Court.  Similarly, great <Col N="166" /> care has been taken to protect the status of existing &ldquo;fit persons&rdquo; orders.  I want to assure Senators that the Children Bill, 1989 is not a replacement, nor has it been intended as a replacement for, the Child Care Bill, 1988.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Bill should contain a comprehensive statement of children's fundamental rights. This suggestion is based on the frequently repeated but mistaken contention that children have no rights.  Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House cannot be considered in isolation but must be read in conjunction with the Constitution and the various judicial pronouncements about the rights of children and parents. The Constitution guarantees rights for all the citizens of the nation including children.  Article 42.5 refers to the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.  In other words, the Constitution acknowledges that children have natural rights over and above any rights granted to them under the Constitution.  In recent years the courts have begun to enumerate these rights.  For example, in the case known as G. <i>v.</i> the Adoption Board 1980 the Supreme Court declared:</P>
    <P>The child's natural rights spring primarily from the natural rights of every individual to life, to be reared and educated, to liberty, to work, to rest and recreation, to the practice of religion and to follow his or her conscience. The right to life necessarily implies the right to be born, the right to preserve and defend (and to have preserved and defended) that life and the right to maintain that life at a proper human standard in matters of food, clothing and habitation.  It lies not in the power of the parent who has the primary natural right and duties in respect of the child, to exercise them in such a way as to intentionally or by neglect to endanger the health or life of the child or to terminate its existence.  The child's natural right to life and all that flows from that right are independent of any right of the parent as such.</P>
    <P>This judgment makes it clear beyond <Col N="167" /> doubt that children have rights and that these rights are protected by the Constitution. I do not accept, therefore, that there is any need to try to spell out in this Bill the rights of children.</P>
    <P>This House now has before it this short, eight section Bill as a direct consequence of and response to the Supreme Court's decision of Thursday last.  A number of interesting questions have been raised by several speakers during the course of this debate.  I intend to respond to each of these queries during the forthcoming Committee Stage debate.  I thank Senators for their generous contributions.</P>

      <P>There are a number of amendments to the section.  Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 4 are related and may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 9, to delete &ldquo;includes and&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall include and&rdquo; in line 11.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is not in any way to obstruct the passage of the Bill.  Indeed, we are anxious that the Bill should be processed through the House and the protection it will afford be applied.  But it does indicate a matter which results from a hasty formulation of the Bill and an attempt to close off loopholes arising out of the Supreme Court decision which may cause problems for the future.  We are very much aware of the statement of the Supreme Court and a question has been raised in this House and in the other House about constitutionality and whether this Bill should be referred to the president for referral to the Supreme Court.  We believe it should.  There is a matter which these two amendments seeks to address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 1 seeks to validate the orders that have heretofore been passed but the wording implies that it would be validating in the same fashion orders for the future.  In line 9, &ldquo;includes&rdquo; would suggest inclusion for the future.  That would be going a step further than what is deemed to be dealt with, namely validation in the past.  Secondly, in line 11, &ldquo;shall include&rdquo; very firmly implies inclusion in relation to the future.  The problem is, of course, that this Bill by attempting retrospectively to validate <Col N="169" /> orders has itself a question mark after it, but seeking to establish the same type of validation when the Supreme Court Judge, Mr. Justice Finlay, clearly stated that a fit person should be nominated would seem to be contrary to the intention of the Supreme Court judgment and could be compounding the situation for the future.  It is for that reason that we seek to eliminate those words in lines 9 and 11 and to add a further subsection which we would call section 1 (b), to come in after &ldquo;any subsequent Act&rdquo;, namely:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That servants or agents of the health boards shall be nominated as fit persons for the purpose of placing a child or young person in the care of a health board under part II or IV of the Children Act, 1908&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Thus the Act would incorporate a subsection, which would deal with the statement made by the judge, namely, that in future when anybody was taken into care by the courts through the health boards that there should be fit persons named or nominated for that purpose.  We believe this Bill would be faulty if it did not include a provision for that purpose, seeing that the judge emphasised so strongly the importance of having a person named who would be the person appointed by the court or the person who would be dealing with the situation and who, except in exceptional cases, would be there as a nominated person.</P>
    <P>What we seek to do here is to provide an amendment which would improve the Bill and provide for the closing of some of the loopholes that were referred to by Justice Finlay in the Supreme Court judgment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though I have not got notification of the amendment as proposed by Senator Costello, I am prepared to debate it.  We must reflect back on the original scenario and take it in its broadest context and see how the situation has arisen.  In November 1986 a health board in this country applied for a fit person order and was granted that <Col N="170" /> order by the District Court.  The following year the parents appealed that decision to the High Court.  The High Court found that taking the 1908 Children Act along with the 1970 Health Act the fit order as confirmed by the District Court was in order.</P>
      <P>An appeal of that decision was taken to the Supreme Court.  Originally, there were 24 different considerations: 19 of those were withdrawn at the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court then took its decision on five questions. It gave its reserved judgment last Thursday on those five remaining questions. On four of the questions it found in favour of the health boards, but on the fifth question on the technicality that the 1970 Health Act did not include section 2 of the 1908 Children's Act, it declared that the health board was not a fit person to hold children in care.  In order to rectify that technicality we have this Bill before us tonight.</P>
      <P>I do not understand the thinking behind these amendments.  The effect of the proposed amendment of section 1 would be to prevent health boards acting as fit persons from the passing of this Act. In other words, we accept that they were fit persons in the past.  The interpretation by lawyers, the High Court and by everybody in the health services and the advice available to successive Ministers for Health and to the Department of Health was that the health boards were fit persons to hold children in care.  If we accept this amendment now we are saying that we accept that in view of the Supreme Court decision, but we are not prepared to accept it in the future.  That would be a serious situation.  Instead of the health boards acting as fit persons the Senators seem to envisage that this function will be performed by servants or agents of the board.  Presumably the intention here is that individual social workers, foster parents or managers of children's homes would be nominated as fit persons.  This is the complete negative to what we are trying to do in the Bill, which is to give health boards the statutory authority to act as fit persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="171" /> The whole thrust of the Bill is, as I have said, to provide health boards with the necessary statutory authority to act as fit persons.  This is in keeping with the approach proposed in the Child Care Bill, 1988 which seeks to establish health boards as statutory child care and child protection agencies throughout the country.  The idea of appointing named individuals as fit persons is completely at variance with this approach and would, in any event, give rise to major practical difficulties.  For example, if an individual social worker was nominated as a fit person and that person subsequently left the service of the board, or moved to other duties, it would then be necessary to go back to court to have the fit person order varied.  Similarly, in the case of foster parents there would have to be an application to the court if the child had to be moved for whatever reason from one foster parent to another.  All in all, I think the approach is impracticable.</P>
    <P>I would ask Senators to reconsider the situation.  These amendments, as proposed, have various and severe connotations. They would totally negate what we propose to do in the Bill, which is to legalise the right of the health boards to act as fit persons.  The common interpretation was that they were suitable; they have done it and they are doing it. We want them to continue to do it and to recognise what has been done and to rectify the anomaly and the difficulty or the deficiency which has arisen as a result of the Supreme Court case.</P>
    <P>I respectfully suggest to Senators that rather than negate all the good work that has been done and the positive contributions that have been made, they withdraw these amendments in the interests of the children who are involved in care orders throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a brief comment on the first amendment.  As I understand it, the difficulty arises from the fact that this is an attempt at retrospective legislation.  I speak only from a grammatical point of view.  The Minister has stated, if I follow him correctly, that <Col N="172" /> this difficulty has arisen as a result of the decision of the Supreme Court that there was a technical defect, so that certain powers could not continue to be used. It seems to me that by using the word &ldquo;includes&rdquo; in the present tense you are asserting, before the passage of retrospective legislation, that it already includes a matter that the Supreme Court decided that it does not include.  I may be incorrect in this, but this appears to me to be the intention of the amendment. In other words, to recognise that because of a defect acknowledged by the Supreme Court it does not, until the passage of this Bill actually, &ldquo;include&rdquo; but after the passage of this legislation shall retrospectively &ldquo;include&rdquo;.  I may have taken the sense of the amendment up wrongly, but this is the way it would appear to me. If that is the case I would simply have to add my weight as a grammarian to the interpretation that I assume is the intention of the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Senator Norris, the Bill cannot become law until it is first passed by this House and, secondly, it is signed by the President.  We accept the decision that has been taken by the Supreme Court.  We are here, as a result of that, to remove the deficiency which has been clearly identified by the Supreme Court in its judgment.  What I am saying is that if we accept the amendments as proposed then we are not going to remedy the deficiency.  We are declaring that the health boards will not be fit people.  We are not remedying the deficiency, so we are compounding the difficulties.  As far as we are concerned &ldquo;includes&rdquo; in the present tense would import the future &ldquo;will&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  Of course, we accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may tease this out a little bit further &mdash; I understand, of course, that it would be intended to include the future, but should it include <Col N="173" /> the present as of this present now?  Perhaps I am incorrect in this, but my understanding of the intention of this section is that it is to cure a situation in which, as a result of a decision by the Supreme Court, section 38 of the Children Act, 1908 does not at the moment &ldquo;include&rdquo;. Is it a correct reading that at the moment it does not, in fact, &ldquo;include&rdquo;?  If that is the case, then it is grammatically, I think, incorrect to assert that it does &ldquo;include&rdquo; until the passage of the Bill, at which point it &ldquo;shall include&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to concur vehemently.  This is just the type of issue which can be grist to the mill of a smart lawyer.  We are talking about new legislation and the short title of the legislation may be cited as the Children's Act, 1989. The Children's Act, 1989 is an amending piece of legislation.  It is amending the 1908 Act.  By amending it says it shall &ldquo;include&rdquo; from the moment the Bill is enacted into law.  In other words, from the moment the President takes his pen off the paper, it shall &ldquo;include&rdquo; from that point.  It is not correct to say that that particular section as it is written at the moment in the 1908 Act &ldquo;includes&rdquo;.  The reason that is not correct is because the court has said it is not correct.  Words mean what the courts say they mean.  The courts have been very clear and succinct on this.  It does not &ldquo;include&rdquo;.  The section as it is written does not &ldquo;include&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;include&rdquo; is wrong from any point of view.  The reason we are here tonight is because it does not &ldquo;include&rdquo;.  There is no point sitting here and saying it does &ldquo;include&rdquo;.  The court has said it does not &ldquo;include&rdquo;, but we are rectifying that. Because it does not &ldquo;include&rdquo; up to this point, we are saying as and from the moment this Bill is enacted into law it shall &ldquo;include&rdquo;.  It is very clear.  It does not leave any room for difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just two points arising from that.  Senator O'Toole has made one point that I was concerned about and I do not propose to develop it any further until I hear the Minister's response to it.  The second point I wish <Col N="174" /> to raise in relation to this matter is, if I heard the Minister correctly when he replied to Senator Costello that there were difficulties in the use of named persons. Nonetheless &mdash; and I will be dealing with this when section 5 arises &mdash; section 5 clearly states that if it is established that the health boards are fit persons then the function will be discharged by the chief executive officer of the health board.  Perhaps we better leave that subject until section 5 comes before us, unless the Minister would care to comment on it.</P>
      <P>The other point I want to make relates to amendment No. 4.  I am not aware that amendment No. 4 has yet been discussed and I would like to have a discussion on that amendment.  I would like to know what the Minister's response to it is.  If there are aspects of the amendment that he does not find satisfactory, I would like to know his reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>If we go back to the 1908 Act the actual statement in section 38 (1) is that in this part of this Act unless the context otherwise requires the expression &ldquo;fit person&rdquo;&mdash; and we are thinking of some particular abstract definition &mdash; it is not a person in the sense of a human individual person.  It is a person in a much more abstract case.  In relation to any child or young person this includes any society or body corporate established for the reception or protection of poor children or the prevention of cruelty to children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said previously, we are basically talking here about cruelty to children.  As I understand this Bill seeks to meet the Supreme Court's very correct suggestion. I would feel that it would be quite dangerous to delete the word &ldquo;includes&rdquo; or, indeed, &ldquo;servants or agents of the health boards.&rdquo;  Effectively, we would be moving away from the basic definition of any society or body corporate.  I would imagine what we are attempting in this Bill to establish is that health boards are legally and rightfully empowered by this Bill, which we hope to pass, as bodies, and that they are included and are seen always to be included.  If we delete &ldquo;includes&rdquo; and talk about the future I <Col N="175" /> suspect we might be opening a minefield of legal queries in relation to the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister responds, I think Senator Conroy has put his finger on the precise difficulty.  The Senator mentions &ldquo;the Bill which we hope to pass&rdquo;.  It is impossible for us to call the courts liars and not to accept their decision.  I use the word &ldquo;liar&rdquo; not in any pejorative sense but simply in the purely semantic sense.  The courts have ruled that it does not &ldquo;include&rdquo;&mdash; end of story. There is no point in our saying to the courts: &ldquo;You are wrong; it did include&rdquo;. We do not interpret the law.  We make the law and the courts interpret the law. The Supreme Court has interpreted the law to say it did not &ldquo;include&rdquo;.  For that reason we have to amend or modify the law, or perhaps to add to the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We must look at the function or what section 1 purports to do. It purports to provide for two matters that is that the expression &ldquo;fit person&rdquo; under the Children Act 1908 includes and always has included a reference to a health board, and that the functions of the health board include and always have included the power to act as a fit person within the meaning of the 1908 Act.  The existing definition is contained in section 38(1) of the 1908 Act which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>In this part of this Act unless the context otherwise requires the expression &ldquo;fit person&rdquo; in relation to the care of any child or young person includes any society or body corporate established for the reception or protection of poor children or the prevention of cruelty to children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supreme Court has ruled that this definition does not encompass a health board.  Hence the need to provide that it is to be taken to include and always has included a health board.  There is no specific provision in the Health Acts authorising a health board to act as a fit person.  Health boards have always operated on the basis that they have an <Col N="176" /> implied power to do so.  The effect of the Supreme Court judgment is that health boards cannot assume such a power. Hence the need to provide here that health boards have and always have had, the power to act as fit persons.</P>
    <P>When the 1970 Health Act was passed, bringing the health boards into being &mdash; before that they were different bodies such as corporate bodies, local authorities, various societies and organisations &mdash; they assumed these responsibilities.  When the 1970 Health Act was passed it did not include section 2 of the 1908 Act.  Even though the health boards have continued to do this work in the knowledge that they had the responsibility to do so, the Supreme Court found that as the 1970 Health Act was not technically amended by the inclusion of section 2 of the 1908 Act they were not fit persons.  We are trying to remedy that deficiency as a result of that decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has illustrated possibly the point I was trying to make and which Senator O'Toole has amplified, that is, that the Supreme Court has decided as the situation is at the moment it simply does not &ldquo;include&rdquo;.  If we take the position advocated by the Minister, what is occurring apparently is legislation by assertion, even if this includes a contradiction of a judgment of the Supreme Court.  That is a very dangerous precedent indeed.  It underlines one of the difficulties of any form of retrospective legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the attempt at amending the situation by retrospective legislation is covered by the phrase to which the Minister has drawn our attention.  If the section is changed to say that the expression &ldquo;fit person&rdquo; in section 38 of the Children Act 1908 &ldquo;shall include&rdquo; that covers what we are trying to amend.  It continues &ldquo;shall be deemed always to have included&rdquo;.  It is possible for the Oireachtas to pass a section which states, and becomes law, that this expression &ldquo;shall be deemed always to have included&rdquo;, but until that is passed it does not &ldquo;include&rdquo; in the present tense.  The meaning of this section at the moment is <Col N="177" /> to assert, in the face of a Supreme Court judgment, that regardless of that judgment it does at this moment &ldquo;include&rdquo; the phrase which the Minister has clearly indicated to the House it does not include.  That is not to say that it is not possible to work backwards and to pass a section which retrospectively validates.</P>
    <P>What I believe the present legislation to be doing is, as I say, to assert legislatively that a position exists which does not exist.  The Supreme Court has handed down a judgment which plainly says it does not exist.  That is a very difficult situation in which to place the House.  I do not think it is frivolous, but it is an important matter where grammar and law come together.  It is an impossible situation, I believe, to amend satisfactorily by the present wording.  I understand the Minister's difficulties and the difficulty of the Government because they wish, as we all wish, a speedy passage of this Bill.  Even if a technical amendment is accepted the Bill would have to go back to the Dáil.  That is a problem, but I think it is better for us to face this problem now rather than to have a legal challenge which could be successful in the court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The remarks by the Minister indicate the level of confusion that can arise in a situation like this.  He referred to the wording in line 9 &ldquo;and that it be taken to include&rdquo;.  That is not what is in the Bill.  That is really what is meant, that it be taken to &ldquo;include&rdquo;, but what is inserted here in the Bill is contrary to what has been ruled by the Supreme Court which is categorically that it does not &ldquo;include&rdquo; at this time.  In terms of what is before us, we are liable to run into the difficulties in relation to retrospective legislation.  Here again we have a wording which compounds that difficulty, because it is contrary to what was the finding of the Supreme Court judgment, as I understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the second amendment, the purpose of this amendment is to reflect the views and the statements of the Supreme Court judge where he found <Col N="178" /> that the health board was not a &ldquo;fit person&rdquo;.  It was a corporate body and could not be a &ldquo;fit person&rdquo;.  The implication of that would be that the &ldquo;fit person&rdquo; would be henceforth a named person as distinct from a corporate body. Can we help the matter by dealing with it in that manner in line with the recommendations of the Supreme Court judge, who stated that the court itself was not a &ldquo;fit person&rdquo;?  While we seek to validate what has gone before, we must seek to establish proper wording and proper, responsible people who would be nominated as required, as stated by the judge, who would have care of the child entrusted to them.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 4, what is sought here is to look at the present situation and to seek again to ensure that all means are exhausted before a child is taken into custody.  It must be established whether there is a &ldquo;natural person&rdquo; who is capable and available to provide for the welfare of the child.  Let us remember we have over 40 homes for the care of children and young people, and approximately half of those are certified industrial institutions.</P>
    <P>Many Senators will have read the report by Eileen Kennedy, when she was District Justice.  She chaired a committee to report on the industrial schools.  They were certainly not the most desirable of institutions for young, impressionable children.  Certainly there have been improvements since that time but, at the same time, they are institutions to which young people are taken from their homes.  We believe that the removal of a child or a young person from their homes should be the last resort.  It certainly should not be taken lightly and we believe that all the resources possible should be made available to ensure that that does not happen.</P>
    <P>We know that the vast majority of young people who are removed from their homes come from deprived backgrounds. We know the situation that gives rise to various forms of abuse.  We would like to ensure that rather than putting the emphasis on the removal of the child from an abusing situation, the <Col N="179" /> resources would be provided to support in so far as possible a person who would be a suitable person, whether a relative, a grandparent, a parent who would not be an offending parent, an aunt, uncle or cousin.  All of these people could have the interests of the child at heart.  They could also be &ldquo;natural persons&rdquo; who would take the welfare of the child in hand.  The resources should be provided to support them.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the rights of the children are considered and that they should be paramount.</P>
    <P>We have in our Constitution very considerable rights in relation to parents but we are quite lacking in our assertion of rights in relation to children.  What we wish here is to emphasise the necessity of ensuring that a child or young person is removed from his home only as a last resort.</P>

      <P>If I may address the House on amendment No. 4, while I applaud the sentiments, the drafting of this amendment also suffers from the flaws that this side of the House suggested existed in what may well have been hasty drafting of the Bill itself.  I am not, for example, aware of the legal definition of a &ldquo;natural person&rdquo; or, indeed, an &ldquo;un-natural person&rdquo;.  This seems to me to be so wide as to leave a dangerous flaw in this proposed amendment although, as I say, I am quite happy to applaud the sentiments expressed by Senator Costello.</P>
      <P>It is also clear to me from what he said that there is a far wider intention behind this amendment than is actually expressed in it.  Reference was made to funding being made available to enable these &ldquo;natural persons&rdquo; to undertake properly the task of providing for the welfare of children.  Yet, there is no machinery contained in the amendment whereby this laudable aim would be carried out.  For those reasons, I would have hesitation in supporting this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I return, if I may, very briefly, to the fact that it is very important that serious note be taken of the confusion with <Col N="180" /> regard to the use of language, particularly the use of the word &ldquo;includes&rdquo; in amendment No. 1.  The sense of it is very clearly that the expression &ldquo;includes&rdquo; before the passage of the Bill.  This can not be maintained. As I say, this is legislation by assertion.  It is nonsense.  If the Minister, by publishing a Bill, had the power to alter legislation there would be absolutely no need for either House of the Oireachtas.  They could just issue proclamations from the Department.  It would save the taxpayer a great deal of money but it would not be particularly democratic. That would cause a number of us some considerable concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In an attempt to be helpful on the question of the word &ldquo;includes&rdquo;&mdash; the sequence of events is that the Oireachtas, which is both Houses of Parliament and the President, decide what that law is.  The interpretation of that takes place in the courts.  The Supreme Court has interpreted the Children Bill, 1908 to say that a health board is not a fit person.  The problem we are faced with here is that the Minister's amendment says that the expression &ldquo;fit person&rdquo; in section 38 of the Children Act, 1908 &ldquo;includes&rdquo; but we all know, because we read it in the papers last week and we heard it all over the media, that the court says it does not &ldquo;include&rdquo;.  Who says what the words mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who pronounce on this are the courts.  The Supreme Court has given its view.  When I raised the question, and this is where I am attempting to get both points of view together, I was hoping the Minister would respond to me along the following lines: that the interpretation of legislation takes place from the moment it is enacted and that the word &ldquo;includes&rdquo; in this legislation can only &ldquo;include&rdquo; from the time the Bill is passed, without any retrospective sense. If the Minister were to assure me on that point I would be, I think, more responsive to his point of view on it.  But he has not said that in four attempts.  Therefore, I must conclude that our original point was correct: that the Minister's proposal does not stand up to scrutiny.  We cannot <Col N="181" /> say it includes when the Supreme Court says it did not include.  What we can say is that it shall include in the future and therefore the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should be included.</P>
    <P>I now want to make two points on amendment No. 4.  Amendment No. 4 is the proposal of the Labour Party group from Senator Costello.  It states that the health board should only be called in when in the words of the amendment &ldquo;there is no natural person available, able and willing&rdquo;.  I must say to my colleagues in the Labour group &mdash; this is disunity of the Left for a short period of time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is just the honesty of those of us on the left of the political spectrum that we need to make our position clear on it.  I would support the position outlined by Senator Norris.  I am not sure what a natural person is, and the older I get the less sure I am.  I have heard philosophers, psychologists, every buxorologist in the world, trying to tell me what a natural person is, and I still do not know.  The more I see of life and the more I meet people, the less I know about it.  I have difficulty with the natural person.</P>
      <P>However, I have a more fundamental question.  There is implied in the amendment the view that the health board could never do the job as well or be as acceptable as a natural person.  I would not be happy with a law which allows any person who is available, able and willing to do what the health board might do.  I would have difficulty with that.  Without appearing to be over-statused about this, I think there is a tendency in Irish legislation, and in our general attitude towards State institutions, to feel that the institution can never do it quite as well as the individual. As somebody who subscribes to certain institutions of the State, I would have difficulty with that general line of thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would think that nobody could educate a child as well as the national school <Col N="182" /> system, even though the Constitution give the right to people to do otherwise. But there is also this general view, with is implied right through the Constitution, that the parents can do it better than anybody else, whatever it is.  This bias in legislation is written that way.  It is a bias towards a parent, and so it should be.  We also need to make it clear that there are times when that system breaks down. The people might be available, able and willing, but they might not be responsible or suitable.  There might be other reasons where they may be available, able and willing, why they may not be as suitable as the health board.  I would have a very fundamental difficulty with that.  Childrens' legislation does not even have the coherence of a patchwork quilt; it is a jumble; it is a series of interpretations.  It is made up of bits of common law because there is very little legislation of any description for it.  It is significant that the Minister made two references to the Consititution in his response earlier to justify what we are doing here.  The real difficulty is that, unfortunately, the majority of Irish people think that the line which says &ldquo;We should cherish all our children equally&rdquo; is somewhere in our Constitution whereas you and I know that successive Governments of all sides have conspired to ensure that those words never got into any Constitution and never got beyond the steps of the GPO. Because of that there is no equality or rights for children.  Therefore we need to be absolutely careful about how we deal with them.</P>
    <P>To sum up, I have three points.  I have asked the Minister to come back on the word &ldquo;includes&rdquo; again.  I have shown, I think an &ldquo;out&rdquo; on the matter in my unfailing attempts to be helpful in this House. On subsection (4) I have difficulties, which I outlined, about the natural person and about the institution as opposed to the to the person.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might clarify for Senators Norris and O'Toole, my erstwhile colleagues of the Left, in relation to the natural person it is not the opposite to an unnatural person.  All of us in this <Col N="183" /> House are very much natural persons.  As citizens of this country, ordinary men and women in the streets, that is the technical meaning of the word &ldquo;natural&rdquo; person. There is nothing terribly difficult about it.  It is in the context of an ordinary man and woman.</P>
      <P>There is no implication in my remarks or no suggestion that I was stating that the health board as not a fit body or that there was any criticism of the health board.  What is stated and what we are seeking to assert in amendment No. 4 is that, where there is a person as distinct from a body or an institution who is available, capable and willing &mdash;&ldquo;able&rdquo; there means capable, and it means responsible &mdash; where this is clearly shown, as it is stated here in our amendment, unless it is clearly shown that all of these necessary criteria are there, but if they are there and if they are sought after and found to be there, then we would wish that they should provide for the welfare of a child who would otherwise go into care.</P>
      <P>That is what we are saying in this.  We are saying further that we do believe, considering statistically the youngsters who are taken into care, that a very high proportion came from the more deprived and impoverished sections of our society. The corollary of that is that resources should be made available and the State should think in terms of dealing with the problem within the community, that is, in the local sense rather than by externally taking the person away.  There is the danger of other problems arising there.  I am not in any way criticising the excellent work that is done by the health board in this matter, but we do say that this matter should be explored more fully and that is the content and the intent of that amendment.</P>
      <P>Again, I want to refer to amendment No. 1.  We are not happy so far with the explanation from the Minister.  What he seems to be doing here is asserting &ldquo;includes&rdquo; as though that is the existing situation which clearly the Supreme Court has found it is not.  Therefore, we seek to have the words &ldquo;includes and&rdquo; deleted.</P>

      <P>It is rarely that I stand up to defend health boards and I served on them for a long time.  Looking at some of the cases that have been dealt with by the Mid-Western Health Board &mdash; Senator Howard would be aware of some of those cases as well as myself &mdash; these children have been looked after properly and with great care.  I appreciate that Senator Costello said he was not critical of the health boards but I think &mdash; in fairness to the Minister and to the draftsman in his Department &mdash; all through this legislation he has gone out of his way to make sure that every individual child is looked after by a fit person.  I personally looked at the situation in the mid-west when I knew this emergency legislation was coming.  If I were not happy with the way the children were being dealt with I should have no trouble in stating it here this evening. That is amendment No. 4.  I am not trying to cut across Senator Costello.  I am only trying to express my knowledge of the health boards and how they are dealing with these children.</P>
      <P>I appreciate what Senator Costello is saying, but, as serving politicians, we know the reality of life.  We all have had to get health boards to take some of these children.  These fit persons and fit relatives just would not look after the individual children for us.  I am on record as having deep reservations about the functions of health boards.  I served for a long time on health boards, I served even before they became health boards and hope to go on serving when the Minister. Deputy Treacy, comes up with a bright new idea for dealing with them.  I am happy that a child in the care of Mid-Western Health Board at the moment is in fact cared for.</P>

      <P>Again in regard to the interpretation of Senator Costello, I have a difficulty there with the word &ldquo;able&rdquo;.  I interpret that to mean &ldquo;able&rdquo; in a financial sense.  Senator Costello changed it then afterwards, perhaps not necessarily changed it but interpreted it as being &ldquo;capable and responsible&rdquo;.  I would like to know from him is he stitching in there help and resources from the health board <Col N="185" /> if the natural person were found he would be willing to provide for the welfare of the child?  Is he automatically looking for funding in the nature of the wording of that amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>What the amendment states is that a court shall not commit the care of a child to a health board by way of an order under the said section unless it is clearly shown that there is no natural person who is available, able and willing to provide for the welfare of such child. It must be clearly shown that no such person is available.  The corollary of that is that a person should be sought who would fall within those categories or criteria and that they are willing and that they are able to do the job.  Able to do the job in my mind is that they are capable, and somebody who was capable of doing it would also be responsible. You are not capable of doing something unless you do it responsibly.</P>
      <P>In the context of resources, obviously if somebody is going to be taken into care the resources of the health board will have to be employed to ensure that the person or the institution responsible for the care is financed satisfactorily.  What I am saying is that it would be better if the resources of the State would be first and foremost put in to the support of a child who would otherwise be taken into care and support where a natural person is available and capable of doing the job rather than the child being taken into care.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I concur with Senator Costello that we are all very natural people and it would be my own opinion that I am surrounded by very fine natural people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to Senator O'Toole, I think there can be no ambiguity or doubt about the fact that the Constitution is very clear in its confirmation and direction <i>vis-á-vis</i> the rights of the child &mdash; Article 42 and indeed other Articles.  In my response earlier today to the Second Stage debate, I read into the record a Supreme Court judgment of 1980 G. <i>v.</i> the Adoption Board, an excellent, outstanding <Col N="186" /> judgment where the Supreme Court, in interpretating the Constitution <i>vis-á-vis</i> the child, gave a very clearly defined and detailed interpretation of the constitutional position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the child.  I do not think there can be any ambiguity about that.</P>
    <P>It would be an opinion if one were to say that successive Governments have conspired to discriminate against the child.  I would not accept that.  I think the common good is the overall desire of every Government and indeed every public representative but how we achieve that may be in different ways.  We have different ways of achieving it, but I think the overall thrust of Government policy, of democracy, of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the various agencies serving the State is to serve the common good.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court was only concerned with interpreting the law as it stood at the time of its judgment last Thursday, 2 November.  The Bill is to change the law not to assert that the Supreme Court was wrong.  The Supreme Court interpreted the law.  As a result of its interpretation we have this Bill here before us now and we have a profound duty as legislators to remedy the deficiency which was declared by the Supreme Court in its reserved judgment. The words &ldquo;includes only&rdquo; have effect only from the date that the Bill is passed. The Supreme Court will recognise that the Bill is a change in the law using the type of language which the courts are interpreting all the time in applying dozens of Acts which contain language in the present tense.  The Supreme Court will recognise that situation.  I do not think we need to have any worries on that score.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers have asked me to refer back to the various amendments. I was very clear and specific on amendment No. 1 in that I clearly said that it would negate what we propose to do in the Bill, that is, to clarify and ensure that health boards are fit people to take children into care.</P>
    <P>As regards amendment No. 2, the Supreme Court in delivering its judgment <Col N="187" /> had to deal with the situation within the terms of the legislation as existed on that day.  It delivered its judgment as the law stood and as they interpreted the law as of that day.  In particular the court had to have regard to its own ruling that health boards do not have the authority to act as fit persons.  That is why the court said that the orders should have been made in favour of named individuals.  In this Bill we are changing the legislation, enabling health boards to act as a fit person.  In section 4 we are setting out the manner in which health boards shall provide care for children.  I am advised that henceforth it will be possible for a health board, as a health board, to be nominated as a fit person and that it will not be necessary to nominate a specific individual.  As far as we are concerned that would be inoperable and impractical.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 would prevent a court placing a child in the care of a health board unless it is clearly shown that there is no natural person available, able and willing to care for the child.  I take cognisance of what Senator Jackman has alluded to.  It seems that this would create enormous practical difficulties for the courts, which would be required to exhaust all the possibilities of placing the child with a natural person before it ever begins to consider placing the child in the care of a health board.  We must accept that the health boards do not put children into care easily or quickly or go for orders.  The proposed Child Care Bill, which is a very detailed Bill, will be taking care of all that and defining the different types of orders.  One could count on one hand, less than one hand, the number of care orders or decisions that are taken each week.  We in Ireland have the lowest rate in Europe and that shows the responsibility and the positive attitude adopted by the health boards in this case.</P>
    <P>How would the court conduct such inquiries to ensure that there was no natural person available?  What would the court do with a child while it was carrying out these inquiries?  These are questions <Col N="188" /> which must be addressed.  Would this process needlessly delay securing a placement for the child?  These are some of the questions that occurred to me, questions that do not seem to have been considered by this amendment, which means that by accepting the amendments we would render the Bill inoperable and render it impossible for the health boards to operate or for us, as a nation, as a State, as legislators, to provide the proper care that our children need in certain circumstances. Again, I would respectfully suggest that these amendments should be considered for withdrawal because they would cause a major upset to the narrow Bill before us.</P>
    <P>Both Senator Norris and Senator Costello have spoken about hasty drafting. Last Thursday, the Supreme Court made its decision.  We were under pressure, in this House and in the other House and right across the nation.  Everybody was saying &ldquo;What are you doing?  Why are you not responding?  Where is the Bill?&rdquo;  Firstly, as legislators, you cannot legislate for decisions that may not be made.  That would be bad law.  We can only legislate for the need that arises.  I still take into account the fact that we should have a proper Child Care Bill in operation and I am very confident that this House will play a key role in this later this year and definitely next year.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General and his staff, the senior law officers of the State, and the best experts in my Department, have spent the whole weekend working on this.  Both the Minister for Health and I had consultations with them on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.  We put a simple three-page, eight-section Bill together and that was made available to all Members of the Oireachtas on Monday morning.  We see it as a narrow Bill, a direct response to the decision of the Supreme Court, filling the deficiency that the Supreme Court decided was there.  That is the function of the Bill and we cannot go outside that on this occasion.  I want to clear up the confusion about the word &ldquo;includes&rdquo;.  What we are saying here is that from the moment the <Col N="189" /> Bill is signed by the President the functions of health boards will from that point onwards include the power to act as a fit person.</P>

      <P>Could I come back?  The Minister has actually illustrated precisely the point I was trying to make earlier. I would certainly not wish to cast any aspersions on the professionalism of the draftsmanship but it was a difficult situation, as has been admitted, and one in which work had to be done under great pressure.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that after the passage of the Bill it will be deemed to have included, the Bill will include.  I am not going to get into the difference between &ldquo;will&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  The Minister himself has placed this clearly in the future.  I also would have to say that I take issue with my distinguished colleague, Senator O'Toole, when he suggested that he invited the Minister to place a certain interpretation on these words which the Minister very obligingly did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not alter the situation at all, because if we take the interpretation in the present tense, that it includes from the passage of the Bill and it basically means in the future, that it means in the future although it is written in the present tense, there is no necessity for it to be there at all.  Why is it there?  Because the phrase &ldquo;shall be deemed always to have included&rdquo; covers the moment at which I am speaking and the moment at which the Supreme Court made the decision that it did not include. <Col N="190" /> That is the whole point of retrospective legislation.  The inclusion of the expression &ldquo;includes&rdquo; is at the very least provocative of the kind of discussion we have had.  Although it is only one word, it is the most significant of the amendments we have discussed.  The others are largely unsupportable.</P>
      <P>Obviously, what is being considered under the phrase &ldquo;natural person&rdquo; is actually &ldquo;natural relative&rdquo; rather than natural person.  That is how it seems to me.  It is not really natural person.  The notion of Occam's razor comes into operation with regard to this notion of funding being provided for the health board, because it is nowhere mentioned. Occam's razor, as the Minister well knows, makes it perfectly clear that it is invalid in argument to discuss things which do not exist in the substance of the argument.  It is absolute nonsense to start talking about all this funding that is going to be provided.  It is not going to be provided in the amendment.  So let us not waste time talking about it.</P>
      <P>The final thing I would say is with regard to the very moving contribution of the former Cathaoirleach, Senator Honan.  I have no doubt whatever that anything with which she is connected is conducted to the extreme of excellence. The legislation does not cover merely the operations of the Mid-Western Health Board.  If it did I have no doubt that it would be little&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The point I was asking is that you cannot generalise from the particular experience.  There may well be excellent health boards in operation. That does not mean the operation is universally excellent.  As Senator Honan has <Col N="191" /> indicated with some small degree of heat, I am not a member of a health board and so I am not in fact competent to say, just as she is not competent to say, that the operation of all the health boards throughout the country is as uniformly excellent as I have not the slightest doubt the one on which she serves with such distinction is.</P>
      <P>The final point I would make is in regard to the abstract notion of time, with which the Minister and his advisers appear to me to have some little difficulty. That is not surprising if I heard all right when the Minister said that it was possible to count certain things on less than one hand.  I am not sure how you can count anything on less than one.  Perhaps that is an Einsteinian notion that is perhaps best left aside.</P>

      <P>The Minister has come a certain distance in explaining his intention in relation to the words &ldquo;include&rdquo;<Col N="192" /> and &ldquo;shall include&rdquo; but I am not convinced that is how the Bill will be interpreted by others.  We will not be making the interpretation in the future.  The Labour Party would certainly be much happier if that phrase was deleted.  What would remain would cover the matter adequately, would not interfere with the intention of the section and would certainly be quite in line with the Supreme Court decision and the attempt to validate future orders which the Supreme Court had deemed to be invalid at that point in time.</P>
      <P>In relation to the other amendments, the Minister has stated that the Child Care Bill will cover a lot of ground.  The Child Care Bill has covered a lot of ground already and there is no sign of it reaching this House or, indeed, getting through the Dáil.  It is disgraceful that it has taken so much time, when one considers the 1908 Children Act, the committee set up in 1970, the interim committee in 1974, the report of that interim committee, the full report in 1980 and all of the recommendations of all of the voluntary organisations as campaigning for work to be done.  Now it has been delayed for a long time and there is no sign of any progress being made.  Therefore, I am not convinced we will see much progress in relation to amendment No. 4 which I consider very important.</P>
      <P>We have to think in terms of resources and the rights of children.  Children are not given the strongest protection either in our Constitution or under the 1908 Children Act.  Therefore, I do not propose to withdraw amendment No. 1.  I take the Minister's point that many matters of substance will be dealt with in the Child Care Bill, but amendment No. 1 is specifically related to validating the situation arising out of the Supreme Court decision and we would be much happier to see the matter clarified.  For that reason we will be pushing for a vote.</P>

      <P>I do not want to delay <Col N="193" /> the House because there is no point in repeating what we have said earlier.  I am treating everything that has been said with broad, objective consideration, and I appreciate the sincerity with which it was said.  Likewise, when I say something to Members, it is on the best and most expert advice available to me and, of course, I have my own thoughts also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very optimistic about the Child Care Bill.  I hope the Senator is not attaching any blame to me because I was only handed this job on 20 July.  We took the Child Care Bill into the Dáil last week for the first time and we passed two sections.  We then had the Supreme Court decision on Thursday and the Government, in consideration of that decision, also considered a request from the Opposition parties and have now transferred the Child Care Bill to an all-party <Col N="194" /> Dáil committee.  I am very optimistic we will put very good legislation together. There are 64 sections and 200 amendments and I believe Senators will play a key role when it comes before them.</P>
    <P>I appreciate Senator Norris' elucidation of the whole situation.  I thought he was being very positive until he said that we should push forward with amendment No. 1 but that is his privilege.</P>
    <P>With respect to Senator Costello, the wording we have is regarded by the highest law officers in the land as the best wording available, taking into account the decision of the Supreme Court.  We, as legislators have a duty to fill the vacuum that that decision created.  We have had the best advice, we are satisfied that it is in order and I would ask the House to accept that.</P>

      <P>The point of this amendment is to delete &ldquo;certified industrial schools&rdquo; because we believe that this is an outmoded term and reflects an attitude and a set of values that are not current today.

      <P>I can appreciate what Senator O'Reilly says and, indeed, I would like to be able to agree because a number of people have alluded to this during Second Stage debate.  I want to assure the House that in the Child Care Bill, 1988, which has gone to an all-party committee, we intend to change this situation.  I sympathise with Senators in their desire to retain the term &ldquo;certified industrial school&rdquo;, but I regret that for legal reasons I cannot accept the amendment. The reason for this is that some 21 of our children's homes, that is about half of the total of children's homes in the land, are still legally certified as industrial schools.  Those homes no longer deal with young offenders but provide a service on behalf of health boards in providing accommodation for children in care. Among the homes in question at St. Kieran's in Rathdrum, Mount Carmel in Moate, St. Joseph's in Kilkenny, St. Joseph's in Salthill and, indeed, many others.  They are just examples; I am sure many Senators are familiar with some in their own areas.  It is proposed in the Child Care Bill to de-certify these homes, but in the meantime I am advised it is essential that this expression be used in the Bill to ensure the health boards can continue to place children in these homes.  I hope the House can accept my reasoning on that.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash; (1) Where an application is made pursuant to Part II or Part IV of the Children Act, 1908 in relation to the care of a child or young person and the Court is satisfied that it would be proper to make an order under the relevant part of the said Act in substitution for any such order the Court may, where it is in the best interests of a child to do so, make an order (in this Act referred to as a &lsquo;supervision order&rsquo;) in respect of the child authorising the health board of the area within which the child resides to have the child visited on such periodic occasions as the health board may consider necessary in order to satisfy itself as to the welfare of the child and to give to his parents or to a person acting <i>in loco parentis</i> any necessary advice as to the care of the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Any parent or person acting <i>in loco parentis</i> who is dissatisfied with the manner in which a health board is <Col N="199" /> exercising its authority to have a child visited in accordance with this section may apply to the Court and the Court may give such directions as it sees fit as to the manner in which the child is to be visited and the health board shall comply with any such direction.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where a court makes a supervision order in respect of a child it may on the application of the health board, either at the time of the making of the order or at anytime during the currency of the order, give such directions as it sees fit as to the care of the child which may require the parents of the child or a person acting <i>in loco parentis</i> to cause him to attend for treatment or attention at a hospital, clinic or other place specified by the court.</P>
    <P>(4)  Any person who fails to comply with the terms of a supervision order or any directions given by a court under subsection (3) or who prevents a person from visiting a child on behalf of the health board or who obstructs or impedes any such person visiting such a child in pursuance of such an order shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £250.</P>
    <P>(5)  A supervision order shall remain in force for a period of twelve months or such shorter period as may be specified in the order and, in any event, shall cease to have effect when the person in respect of whom the order was made ceases to be a child.</P>
    <P>(6)  On or before the expiration of a supervision order, a further supervision order may be made on the application of the health board with effect from the expiration of the first mentioned order upon the court determining that to make such further order is in the best interests of the child.&rdquo;.  </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this very important amendment is to ensure that the capacity to arrange supervision will be there for the courts.  The first subsection of the amendment suggests that the court can make a supervision order. The second subsection says that the court can adjust to meet justifiable concerns of parents.  The court can adopt its findings to meet justifiable concerns of parents. The third subsection provides that the court can order specialised care for the child.  The fourth subsection allows for a fine where the supervision order is not adhered to, and this is effectively a device to copperfasten the supervision order. Subsection (5) is delineating the time. Subsection (6) is facilitating further orders.  The basic concern that in the case where there is an area of doubt that the capacity for a supervision order be there. We would ask the Minister to accept this as a reasonable amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate this and, indeed, the meticulous detail that the various Senators have gone into in regard to all the amendments that have been put down.  This amendment is very long and detailed and I can appreciate the time that has gone into it.  The purpose of this amendment and a later amendment from the Senators is to bring forward into this Bill a proposal contained in the Child Care Bill in 1988.  In that Bill it is proposed to create an entirely new form of order, to be known as a supervision order, which would allow the courts to grant health boards right of access to children in their homes where there is a reasonable suspicion that they are at risk. There is no such thing as a supervision order in the current law and it is important that the whole concept should be teased out in detail rather than attempt to rush it into law by inserting it in this Bill.  This matter was discussed in great detail in the Dáil yesterday and last night <Col N="201" /> when the Minister made the Government's position very clear.  That is that this particular proposal is an integral part of the new care proceedings envisaged in the Child Care Bill, 1988, and that it would not be appropriate or helpful to take it out of its proper context and insert it here.  What I am saying in essence is that this Bill is a narrow Bill as a direct consequence of the Supreme Court decision.  The amendments we have are taken from the Child Care Bill, 1988, and we do not want to take them out of that context, of giving long, detailed consideration to the proposals contained in that Bill.  Senators will have that opportunity when the Bill comes before this House later on.  For that reason, I regret that we will not be able to accept these amendments.  I hope the House can appreciate the reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>We see no reason why the amendment cannot be accepted now. The Minister has stated directly that he accepts the principle that there is a need for the capacity to be there to have supervision orders.  Now, given that the Minister accepts the principle and accepts that it is a correct position, the arguments put forward by him that we hold this back until the substantive Bill goes through the Houses of the Oireachtas does not seem to me to hold up on the grounds that if it is a worthwhile thing, I see no reason not to do it now.  I also feel that this amendment succinctly and coherently put forward solid proposals for supervision orders to be enacted immediately. I would accept then that if it needed further modification it could be done in the substantive Bill.  If not, our amendment could then be incorporated directly into the Bill.  I cannot accept the Minister's contention on that one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Senator cannot accept my contention.  I want to clarify it again.  The Bill we are dealing with is a three page, eight section Bill.  Clearly, as a Government response <Col N="202" /> to the decision of the Supreme Court taken last Thursday, we cannot take sections from another Bill which is presently being considered by the Dáil and insert them into this Bill.  That would not be good legislation.  That Bill has gone to Committee and all the amendments that are coming in here are already part of the proposals for the other Bill and in the future will be considered in the all-party committee, subsequently by the Dáil, and subsequently again by the Seanad.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, this is an important new proposal which demands careful consideration and it would not be desirable to rush it into law through this Bill.  In their haste to table this amendment, the Senators have simply re-circulated the Minister's proposed amendments to the 1988 Bill dealing with supervision orders. In doing so they have failed to bring the terminology of the amendment into line with this Bill.  In the 1988 Bill a child is defined as a person up to 18 years.  In this Bill we are using the definitions of &ldquo;child&rdquo; and &ldquo;young person&rdquo; contained in the Children Acts.  In those Acts &ldquo;child&rdquo; means a person under 15, and &ldquo;young person&rdquo; means a person between 15 and 17 years.  In their amendment, the Senators refer only to a child and make no reference to a young person.  The effect of this is that if this amendment were to be accepted it would be possible for the courts to make supervision orders in respect of children, that is those under 15 years, but the courts would have no power to do so in the case of young persons, that is people aged between 15 and 17 years old.  This illustrates the danger of trying to rush through important changes in the law.  In doing so, we may end up with a provision that does not deal fully or properly with the matter that it sets out to address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would again remind Senators that proposals on supervision orders are contained in the Child Care Bill, 1988. Indeed, they are very broad and a lot of new orders are being considered.  I would suggest that it would be better to wait for <Col N="203" /> that Bill before trying to proceed with this proposal.  I appreciate the sincerity of the Senators in their efforts to make sure that this legislation is good.  I hope that they can in turn accept my reasons for sticking rigidly to the Bill which is a response to the Supreme Court decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I contend, on behalf of our party, first, the amendment is within the spirit of the Supreme Court ruling, secondly, that the notion of supervision <Col N="204" /> orders is objectively correct and, thirdly, that in a very detailed fashion we suggest how they are to be implemented.  For that reason I must once again press for the acceptance of the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;.&mdash; Where an order is made in relation to the care of a child or young person pursuant to Part II or Part IV of the Childrens Act, 1908 removing a child or young person from the care of a parent or any other person a Justice may of his own motion or on the application of any person give such directions (if any) as he thinks proper having regard to the rights and duties of parents, whether under the Constitution or otherwise: the rights of the child whether under the Constitution or otherwise and having regard to the best interests of the child with respect to &mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> (a)  whether the address or location of the place at which the <Col N="205" /> child is residing or is going to reside is to be revealed to the parents of the child or either of them, a person acting <i>in loco parentis</i> or any other person,</P>
    <P>(b)  the access, if any, which is to be permitted between the child and any named person and the conditions under which the access is to take place,</P>
    <P>(c)  the medical or psychiatric examination or treatment of the child. </P>
    <P>(2)  A direction under this section may be given at any time during the currency of the order and may be varied or discharged on the application of any person.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to establish access and again this is in compliance with the spirit of the Supreme Court ruling and also what would be the best possible practice. What it attempts to do is to make, at the discretion of the court, the new address of the child available to parents and to the extended family where it is appropriate to do so.  Obviously I do foresee situations that could arise where it would not be so appropriate to give a particular parent the address.  In so far as is possible to make the address available to the parent to the extended family that is the first section of the amendment.  It attempts that.  The second subsection is establishing the principle of access, that access be freely available where appropriate. The third subsection establishes that medical or psychiatric treatment, or whatever medical attention be needed, be given to the child where appropriate and that that could be directed by the court.  When you consider the ruling which gave rise to the entire debate today and when you consider the justice of the cause and the right of parents, the rights of the extended family and, indeed, the welfare of the child, I honestly see no reason why the Minister could not accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for his contribution on this long proposed amendment again.  This amendment is based on amendments which were circulated by the Minister early last week in advance of the Committee Stage of the Child Care Bill, 1988.  It proposes certain improvements in the existing law in relation to whether the address or the place where a child is being kept is to be revealed to his parents.  The access that his parents may be given and the medical or psychiatric examination or treatment that may be provided &mdash; while these improvements are necessary there is no pressing need for them to be rushed through now and they can better be dealt with and considered in the context of the Child Care Bill, 1988.  In the meantime, I am advised that matters dealt with in this amendment are covered by existing law.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (a) of the amendment would give the court power to decide whether or not the address or location of the place where the child is residing should be revealed.  I am aware that many foster parents were concerned with reports in the media that the Supreme Court last week ordered that they should be named and that their addresses should be revealed to natural parents.  I would like to assure them that this was not the case and that the Supreme Court specifically indicated that it would be justifiable for the country to order that the address and location of the place where the child is being kept should not be revealed to one or both of the parents.  Where the welfare of the child requires it, that is now the law of the land, so there is no need for us to enact paragraph (a) in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards paragraph (b), which deals with the question of access of parents and other children in care, I would like to point out that we have circulated comprehensive proposals on access by way of ministerial amendment of the Child Care Bill, 1988.  I believe it would be appropriate <Col N="207" /> to deal with the matter in the context of that Bill.  In the meantime, I am advised that parents already have the right under, for example, the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, to apply to court for a decision on any matter affecting the welfare of their child, including the question of access.  Furthermore, I would point out that, in general, questions of access are agreed between parents and the health boards. I would also like to say that contrary to the impression given in the media over the last few days, most parents whose children are in care do have access to them, some on a regular basis, some on an unsupervised basis.  In all the circumstances, I believe there is not an urgent need for this paragraph to be inserted in the Bill.  With regard to paragraph (c), which deals with medical and psychiatric examination and treatment of a child, I am advised that under section 22 of the 1908 Children Act a fit person, that is a health board, possesses the necessary power to authorise such examination and treatment for a child in its care if the need arises.</P>
    <P>If a parent is dissatisfied with this he can apply to the court under section 21 of the 1908 Act, firstly to have the fit person order varied, that is to ask the courts to restrict the health board's power to have a medical examination made or have treatment carried out.  Alternatively, the parents could apply for a direction from the court under the Guardianship of Infants Act.  In view of all those considerations I am satisfied that the improvements proposed here can await the larger proposed legislation, that is the Child Care Bill, 1988 and I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;.&mdash; Where an order committing a child or young person to the care of a fit person has been made under Part II or IV of the Children Act, 1908 and a court finds or declares in any proceedings that the order, for whatever reason, is invalid that court may refuse to exercise any power to order the delivery or return of the child or young person to a parent or any other person without first determining whether it is in the best interests of the child that such delivery or return be ordered and the court may in any such case of its own motion or on the application of any interested person make such determination having first heard all evidence relevant to making such determination and where following such determination the court refuses to exercise any power to order the delivery or return of a child or a young person it may &mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  make an order committing the child or young person to the care of a fit person under Part II or IV of that Act as if it were a court before which the child or young person had been brought under section 24, 58 or 59 of that Act,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  where a person having the <Col N="209" /> custody, charge or care of a child or young person has been&mdash;</P>
    <P> (i)  convicted of committing in respect of such child or young person an offence under Part II of the said Act or any of the offences mentioned in the First Schedule to that Act or,</P>
    <P>(ii)  committed for trial for any such offence or</P>
    <P>(iii)  bound over to keep the peace towards such child or young person</P>
    <P>make an order under section 21 of that Act,</P>
    <P>(c)  Direct that any order under paragraph (a) or (b) shall if necessary be deemed for the purposes of the Children Act, 1908 to have been made by a Justice of the District Court for the time being assigned to a District Court district specified by the Court.&rdquo;.  </P>
    <P>Amendment No. 9 seeks to establish a situation where if the courts deemed it inappropriate that a child be taken into care, rather than return the child to the home in an unsupervised fashion and inappropriate circumstances, the court could make orders directing the child elsewhere and prevent a situation where the child was immediately returned to the home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to Senator O'Reilly and I appreciate his contribution.  However, I do not propose to accept this amendment on two main grounds.  Here he proposes to insert a new section.  In the first place the amendment would greatly reduce the discretion of the court in dealing with a case before it.  The Senators in their amendment propose to delete paragraph (b) and part of paragraph (c) of section 6 of the Bill. Under these provisions the court which hears the case initially may refer the case to the relevant District Court so that it <Col N="210" /> can decide whether it is necessary to make a fit person order under the appropriate provisions of the 1908 Act.  This is a sensible provision which would allow the case to be heard by the District Court for the area in which the child resides or the court which convicted the parent or guardian of the offence.</P>
      <P>On a monetary basis, taking into account the very high costs of access to the higher courts for many people, this is a very wise provision.  The Senators in their amendment would remove this discretionary power from the court and on this ground alone I would have to decline to accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of the amendment with which I am unhappy is that it purports to tell the court, which could be the High Court or the Supreme Court, how it is to deal with the case before it.  I do not think it is unreasonable to suggest that the courts are well aware of the need to hear evidence and they can be relied upon to do so without having to specifically provide for it here.  We must accept that the courts, under the Constitution, have a key role to play.  They take account of all the information available to them and they always seek out that information.  I hope the Senators will accept what I say. I regret that I am not able to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take the matter a bit further.  We are seeking to establish in putting down this amendment, and it is stated quite clearly in it, that where a court for any reason may decide that an order is invalid we want to ensure that the court has discretion and can examine the conditions in the home from which the child was first removed to be satisfied that the conditions have so improved that it would be safe and just to return the child to that environment. That is the purpose of the amendment. That is what we are trying to ensure and perhaps the Minister would comment further on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are concerned that in the situation <Col N="211" /> that prevails for any reason that a court would decide &mdash; and it is open to courts to decide in relation to some of the present orders &mdash; they may well be invalid.  Therefore, it is to prevent a situation in which the child would be returned to a home or to an environment that would be damaging to it.  We want to be assured that as the law now stands the court has that discretion.  We are not satisfied that it has and we are endeavouring, through this amendment, to ensure that it has that authority and that discretion to examine the conditions in the home from which the child was first removed before allowing a situation to develop in which the child or young person could be returned to that home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what Senator Howard wants to achieve but if he reads section 6 carefully he will see we are really fulfilling what he wishes.  The difficulty is that what he wants to achieve is complicating the matter and would infringe on the rights of the courts, as we would be dictating to the courts.</P>
      <P>This section sets out the options available to a court, whether the Circuit, the High or Supreme Court, where it finds or declares that a fit person order is invalid whether by reason of the recent Supreme Court judgment or for any other reason. It provides that in such a case the court may either of its own motion, that is at its own discretion, or on the application of any interested person &mdash; it is a matter for the court to decide who is interested &mdash; refuse to order the delivery or return of the child or young person to its parents or any other person, for example, grandparents, if it forms an opinion that this would not be in the best interests of the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the court reaches such a conclusion it may again, either of its own motion or an application to it, do any of the following: first, make a fit person order in respect of the child or young person as if he had been brought before <Col N="212" /> the court in accordance with the relevant provisions of the 1908 Children Act.  Secondly, make an order referring the matter to the justice of the relevant District Court and in such case the justice may deal with the matter as if an application for a fit person order had been made to him, this is at District Court level, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the 1908 Children Act.  The relevant District Court is the court for the district in which the child or young person is living or is, for the time being, when the original order is declared invalid of the district where the child was living or was for the time being when the original order or the application for that order was made.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, where a person having custody, charge or care of a child or young person has been convicted of committing certain ofences against the child or has been committed for trial for such an offence or has been bound over to keep the peace towards the child or young person, the court may make an order under section 21 of the Children Act, 1908 or refer the matter to the court by which the person was convicted, committed or bound over so that it can consider the need to make an order under section 21.</P>
    <P>Section 21 enables a court to make a fit person order where a parent or guardian has been convicted of committing certain offences or has been committed for trial or bound over to keep the peace in respect of such an offence.  Where a person has been committed for trial for an offence, the order lapses if he is acquitted of the charge or if the charge is dismissed. Details of the offences to which section 21 are very long indeed and are included in one of the accompanying documents which will be circulated. Where an order under paragraph (a) or (c) has been made by the Circuit Court, the High Court or the Supreme Court it shall be deemed to have been made by the justice of the District Court specified by the higher court.  This is a technical <Col N="213" /> device so that any subsequent proceedings can be dealt with in the District Court rather than in the higher court. Where the Circuit Court, the High Court or the Supreme Court makes an order under paragraph (b) of (c) referring the case to the District Court, the higher court may make a temporary fit person order pending the determination of the matter by the District Court.</P>
    <P>That is a very complex, broad, democratic structure within which an order can be made, an application can be made, a declaration can be made or an order can be considered.  We would suggest that the discretion is given to the higher court to consider the matter in its entirety and make a conclusive decision.  It still has the right to refer that back to the District Court who, on referral back, can consider the matter as if an application was made to the District Court itself.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would ask the House to accept that this is a very fair section.  It gives maximum consideration to the child in particular and to the parents, and indeed takes into account the ultimate welfare of the child which is of paramount importance.  I ask the House to accept this section and would be grateful if the Senators would consider withdrawing these amendments.</P>
