    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a brief word.  First, I would not like the impression to go out from here this morning that this Bill has passed through this House today on the nod or that we are in any way casual about the matters concerned. The reality is that this Bill has received very wide and searching examination of all its sections in a special committee of the Oireachtas.  This Bill probably has taken up more parliamentary time than almost any other Bill in the lifetime of the current Dáil. I would like to put on the record very firmly that the Bill we have here today has been very carefully examined and scrutinised and has been referred back to the other House on a number of occasions.</P>
      <P>This Bill is the first Private Members' Bill to be enacted in almost 30 years. It is not in the normal run of Private Members' Bills.  It is a very substantial Bill which is aimed at addressing a very significant and major problem in our society, that of marital breakdown.  It is a subject upon which in the past it has been almost impossible to get all-party agreement.  Indeed, there were very many people at the beginning of this session of the Oireachtas who doubted that it would be possible to get all-party agreement on a matter of this kind.</P>
      <P>This Bill originated from Deputy Alan Shatter.  It was debated in the other House at great length.  Finally, after a series of lengthy, detailed discussions it was possible to find agreement on the issues which divided the Fine Gael Party and the Government.  In saying that, I want to put very clearly on the record the appreciation of those in my party to the attitude of the Minister for Justice who had, as his objective, the objective of Deputy Alan Shatter.  That was to tackle this problem in a way which would find as wide an acceptance as possible and which would lessen the trauma of marital breakdown and remove, as far as possible, much of the great hardship and suffering which attaches to that experience in so far as the law can address these particular problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that we are here today on what is an historic day for the Oireachtas is something which reflects credit on <Col N="900" /> Deputy Alan Shatter, the Minister and on all parties in both Houses.  It is a benchmark of the growing maturity of our society that we can now face up to the problems which in the past were almost beyond the realm of open, reasoned, fairmined discussion.  It is interesting that in the course of this debate people who may have begun by doubting the goodwill or the bona fides of those whose points of view opposed theirs have ended the debate accepting that there was a point of view on all sides.</P>
    <P>This Bill, as it is now leaving this House today to go to the President for his signature before it becomes law, is not as ideal as I would have liked it or as my party would have liked it.  It is not as ideal as the Minister would have liked it but it is, I believe, the most significant measure of reforming legislation in this area of marital breakdown since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>As well, this Bill establishes certain principles and guidelines.  The experience of this Bill in practice should be monitored very carefully by all politicians, by both Houses of the Oireachtas and by the Department of Justice to ensure that if there are any defects in this Bill, or if there are any ways in which it can be improved, that we will have no difficulty in tackling these particular problems with a certainty that at least the debate can be open and comprehensive.</P>
    <P>Having made those points, I say that this Bill offers hope and some sort of better way for the very many thousands of people who find themselves, for whatever reason, in a situation of marital breakdown.  This Bill, with its simplified court procedures, with its more just and equitable systems, with the elimination of much of the name calling and allocating of blame which has been an integral part of our system up to now, will at least lead to a more civilised and a more humane way of tackling this problem.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want once again to put on record the debt of both Houses to Deputy Alan Shatter, whose Bill this was and who guided it through the other House.  Equally, I want to put on the record our gratitude to the Minister for Justice whose willingness to listen, to argue his case and, ultimately, to <Col N="901" /> compromise in the interest of getting the best legislation possible has also brought us to this stage today.  I hope the example they have given and that has been given to this House in the passing of the legislation will be something which we can follow in other legislation which is not of a party political kind, where we are dealing with the problems of real people and where there are real issues which can be sorted out in open debate.  This will be an example that we can do this without any party suffering any loss of face.  In fact, the real winners today are the people whose problems can now be addressed, the legal profession which now has a new framework within which to operate in this particular area and, I believe also, the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I believe that what we have done today will be warmly welcomed and applauded by all fair-minded people outside.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot join in this paean of congratulations.  It seems to me that the passage of this Bill through both Houses has been unfortunate.  I have to say this because 60 years ago a distinguished representative of my tradition made a heartfelt plea for divorce which at that stage was ignored.  This Bill, which I cannot in conscience vote for, is a half measure, and a half measure that has only very grudgingly, after a long time and in a mutilated form been accepted by this Government.  I merely wish to say that I wish to dissociate myself completely from a congratulation which is inappropriate, misplaced and does not represent the facts, as will be clear to anybody who studies the record of both Houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy to see the Bill go through in its present form.  Before we conclude I should like to take this opportunity to commend, as I have done in the other House, the initiative of Deputy Shatter and the Fine Gael Party supporting him in having the Bill published, as well as the work that he and others put into reaching agreement with me on a range of matters which I felt needed to be met by way of amendment to the Bill.  All those efforts, I am glad to say, have <Col N="902" /> resulted in a Bill which meets my concerns. It is in my view a very worthwhile Bill.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Bill provides for all the circumstances in which a decree of judicial separation should be granted and that the comprehensive powers given to the courts will enable the best possible protection and financial security to be given to a spouse and dependent children following a judicial separation.  I also wish to commend Senator Manning for the role he has played in steering the Bill through this House.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I repeat an important point.  While the Bill provides for substantial changes in the law on judicial separation, the fact remains that out of court settlements will, for the most part, be the most appropriate procedures for spouses who wish to formally separate. It is generally better for couples to come to mutually satisfactory solutions for a separation rather than involve the courts. The Bill, indeed, recognises that point by encouraging spouses to avail of counselling or mediation and my thanks to all those who have helped to have this legislation enacted.</P>

    <Title>Jurisdiction of Courts (Maritime Conventions) Bill, 1988: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="903" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable Ireland to ratify two maritime conventions &mdash; the 1952 Brussels Convention on the Arrest of Sea-going Ships and the 1952 Brussels Convention concerning Civil Jurisdiction in matters of Collision &mdash; both of which have implications for the civil Jurisdiction of the Irish courts in maritime matters.</P>
      <P>The conventions are to some degree related &mdash; they were drawn up at the same diplomatic conference.  However, the convention relating to the arrest of sea-going ships, otherwise known as the Arrest Convention, is by far the more important of the two.</P>
      <P>While the term &ldquo;arrest&rdquo; is normally associated with the criminal law, I would emphasise at the outset that the Bill relates to civil matters only.  It has no implications for the criminal jurisdiction of our courts.</P>
      <P>The intention behind the Arrest Convention was to produce uniform international rules in relation to the arrest of a ship in order to secure a civil claim. In particular, the convention sets out in Article 2 to limit the circumstances under which a ship may be arrested.  Our existing admiralty law is actually more restrictive than that envisaged by the convention so that accession to the convention will lead to an increase in our admiralty jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>Accession will have a double benefit for Ireland.  First, it will strengthen the position of parties in Ireland dealing with foreign ships and at the same time it will ensure that ships flying the Irish flag will be protected from arbitary arrest in respect of civil claims in other contracting states.  It is not surprising, therefore, that Irish maritime interests have for some time advocated that Ireland accede to the Arrest Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need to accede to the Arrest Convention has become more urgent because of the coming into force of the EC Judgments Convention on 1 June 1988. This convention was given effect in <Col N="904" /> Ireland by the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments (European Communities) Act, 1988.  During the negotiations leading to our accession to that convention it was agreed that jurisdiction in maritime matters would best be left to be dealt with by the Arrest Convention.  As Ireland and Denmark were not parties to the Arrest Convention, transitional provisions were included in the accession arrangements to allow time for Ireland and Denmark to accede to that convention.  These transitional provisions, which are modelled on the provisions of the Arrest Convention, will expire for Ireland on 1 June 1991 or on our accession to the Arrest Convention, whichever is the earlier.  If we did not accede to the Arrest Convention before 1991 our maritime jurisdiction in EC related cases would be governed by the general jurisdictional rules of the Judgments Convention and we would suffer a significant loss of admiralty jurisdiction as a result.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Arrest Convention cannot be easily understood unless one is familiar with existing admiralty law.  I, therefore, propose to outline briefly the existing law before discussing the detailed provisions of the Arrest Convention.</P>
    <P>The distinguishing feature about admiralty actions is that it is possible to take an action <i>in rem,</i> the <i>res</i> being the ship or its cargo.  This can be contrasted with an action <i>in personam</i> or, in other words, an action against a person, which is the normal type of civil action taken in our courts.  In an action <i>in rem</i> the <i>res</i>, which is the object of the action, is arrested.  For example, if an Irish company supplies goods or services to a foreign ship while it is in an Irish port and the owner of the ship refuses to pay, the Irish supplier may initiate an admiralty action <i>in rem</i> against the foreign ship and have it arrested.  If the owner does not enter an appearance, the ship can be sold and the proceeds of the ship may be used to satisfy the claim.  Normally, however, the ship's owner will enter an appearance and the ship will be released on the payment of sufficient bail or security.  Bail would be the amount claimed in the action together with a sum for costs.  The <Col N="905" /> action on the claim will then proceed in the normal way.</P>
    <P>The action <i>in rem</i> is an extremely valuable procedure for persons dealing with foreign ships as it would usually be the case that the person liable, that is, the owner, will be outside the jurisdiction and will have no assets within the jurisdiction to satisfy a claim other than the ship which, of course, can disappear overnight.</P>
    <P>It is in the context of admiralty actions <i>in rem</i> that the question of the arrest of a ship arises.  It is only these types of actions which are affected by the Arrest Convention.</P>
    <P>Having set out the existing legal background I will now turn to the Arrest Convention itself.  Article 2 provides that a ship flying the flag of a contracting state may be arrested in respect of a maritime claim as defined in Article 1 and in respect of no other claim.</P>
    <P>The list of maritime claims in Article 1 corresponds generally with the claims which can give rise to an admiralty action under existing Irish law and in some instances is wider.  As a result the convention does not impose any new restrictions on the circumstances in which a ship may be arrested in this jurisdiction. Indeed, it significantly extends the existing circumstances by providing in Article 3 for the arrest of sister ships which up to now has not been possible under Irish law.  A sister ship is a ship which is in the same ownership as the ship which gave rise to the maritime claim.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the right to arrest a sister ship will not apply if the claim relates to a dispute as to ownership or between co-owners or as respects a mortgage of a ship.  In these cases only the particular ship in respect of which the claim arose may be arrested and this is quite understandable.</P>
    <P>This new power to arrest a sister ship will greatly extend the admiralty jurisdiction of the Irish courts and should be of considerable advantage to Irish plaintiffs.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the Arrest Convention I should again point out that it deals only with the arrest of a ship in connection with a civil claim and does not affect the arrest of ships in any other connection. The convention itself makes this clear in <Col N="906" /> Article 2 where it states that nothing in the convention shall be deemed to extend or restrict any right or powers vested in Governments, their Departments, public authorities or dock or harbour authorities to arrest, detain or otherwise prevent the sailing of vessels within their jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the other convention dealt with in the Bill, the 1952 International Convention on certain rules concerning civil jurisdiction in matters of collision, otherwise known as the Collisions Convention.  The purpose of this convention is to prescribe uniform rules relating to civil jurisdiction arising out of collisions involving a ship or ships.  In the case of a collision at sea, the rules of the Collision Convention determine which country's courts have jurisdiction to deal with any civil claim arising therefrom.</P>
    <P>Article 1 of the convention limits jurisdiction in cases of collision to:</P>
    <P>(a)  the courts where the defendant has his habitual residence or place of business;</P>
    <P>(b)  the courts where the defendant ship or sister ship has been arrested or bail furnished; and</P>
    <P>(c)  the courts for the place where the collision occurred provided it occurred in a port or in inland waters.</P>
    <P>The convention, however, does allow the parties involved to agree to confer jurisdiction on some other court.  There are also jurisdictional provisions relating to counterclaims, cases where there are several claimants and cases involving related claims.</P>
    <P>The circumstances where the Irish courts would normally assume jurisdiction at present in cases of collision correspond more or less with those prescribed in the convention.</P>
    <P>While the convention limits to some extent the existing jurisdiction of the courts, I am satisfied that it does not do so in a way that is of material disadvantage to this country.  For example, under existing law the Irish courts may exercise jurisdiction if the defendant has been served with the proceedings while temporarily present in the State.  This jurisdiction is of a type regarded internationally as exorbitant &mdash; this means that few, if any, <Col N="907" /> countries would enforce a foreign court order based on such a jurisdiction.  This jurisdiction is no longer exercisable in our relationships with contracting states to the EC Judgments Convention and the Collisions Convention would restrict its exercise further in convention cases of a non-EC nature.  This should not put Irish plaintiffs at any major disadvantage, however, as such jurisdiction is of limited value in any event because of the difficulties associated with enforcing a judgment obtained in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>The major advantages of acceding to the Collisions Convention are that it will bring our law in this area into line with that of most other maritime countries as well as ensuring that ships flying the Irish flag will be protected from courts in other contracting states exercising exorbitant jurisdiction over them.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself is short and straightforward. Sections 4 and 11 give the force of law to the Arrest Convention and the Collisions Convention, respectively. Section 14 abolishes the Cork Local Admiralty Court.  This is essentially a tidying up operation.  The Cork Circuit Court, when sitting as the Cork Local Admiralty Court, is the only court in Ireland other than the High Court which has admiralty jurisdiction.  However, its admiralty jurisdiction, which is limited to claims not exceeding £2,000, is no longer availed of in practice.  I have been informed that the Law Society and the Southern Law Association have no objection to the abolition of the Cork Local Admiralty Court.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill deals with the arrest of state ships.  It is a recognised principle of international law that warships and ships in the service of a state, not being used for trading purposes, are entitled to claim sovereign immunity. This principle was specifically provided for in Article 5 of the Collisions Convention but there is no such provision in the Arrest Convention.  Section 6 of the Bill is necessary, therefore, to avoid any danger that the Irish courts would interpret the Arrest Convention as changing the law on the arrest of state ships.  Since the matter has not been provided for in <Col N="908" /> the Arrest Convention, a formal reservation will be required to deal with the question when we deposit our instrument of accession.  Many other countries have made a similar reservation.</P>
    <P>The other provisions of the Bill deal with procedural matters and questions of interpretation.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I would like to thank the Irish Maritime Law Association for their co-operation in the preparation of this Bill.  The international parent body of that association was actively involved in the drafting of both the Arrest and Collisions Conventions.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no difficulty whatsoever in welcoming this Bill which, as the Minister said, brings our law in this area into line with that of most other maritime countries.  It ensures that ships flying the Irish flag will be protected from courts in other contracting states exercising exorbitant jurisdiction over them. Essentially, that is the gist of this Bill which, I think, will find general welcome.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister one or two very brief questions about the Bill. First, can he tell us why it has taken so long for us to ratify this convention?  We are talking about the 1952 Brussels Convention on the Arrest of Sea-going Ships and the 1952 Brussels Convention concerning Civil Jurisdiction in matters of Collision.  Perhaps the Minister could indicate why it has taken us almost 37 years to ratify these conventions.  I did not know that there was a Cork Local Admiralty Court.  I suppose most people in the country did not know that.  It did have a great ring and sound to it and perhaps for that reason alone one could be sorry to see the end of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we look at this Bill the subject which will come to most people's minds is one that may not be contained in it, that is, the question of submarines in the Irish Sea and around our coast.  Only last week we saw the surfacing of a submarine off the Donegal coast where it was, for once, endeavouring to rescue people from a trawler which was foundering. There are many stories which we hear from time to time of the nets of trawlers being entangled in submarines and of <Col N="909" /> trawlers disappearing without any explanation &mdash; again because of submarines &mdash; in the Irish Sea.  This is not just a matter of worry for Irish fishermen; it is one which is causing considerable concern also in the UK.</P>
    <P>I am wondering, if not in this Bill perhaps in some other legislation or in bilateral or multilateral discussions, whether this particular question is being addressed by the Government at the present time?  Is the Minister in a position to tell us if he is aware of the extent of the problem and what discussions are taking place and what sanctions, if any, a small neutral country like ours may have in a situation where there is genuine danger to our peaceful fleet engaged in purely commercial operations?  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this Bill.  As we have heard from the Minister, the purpose of this Bill is to enable Ireland to ratify two maritime conventions &mdash; the 1952 Brussels Convention on the Arrest of Sea-going Ships and the 1952 Brussels Convention concerning Civil Jurisdiction in matters of Collision &mdash; both of which have implications for the civil jurisdiction of the Irish courts in maritime matters.</P>
      <P>This Bill will also enable us to produce uniform international rules in relation to the arrest of a ship in order to secure a civil demand for it.  It will strengthen the position of parties in Ireland dealing with foreign ships and, at the same time, it will protect Irish ships flying the Irish flag.  It will protect from arbitrary arrest in respect of civil claims in other states. It is not surprising that Irish maritime interests have for some time advocated that Ireland accede to the Arrest Convention. Ireland and Denmark were the only two countries that had not ratified the convention.  The Bill is something we welcome.  It was very necessary for the shipping interests of our own country and I would like to thank the Minister for introducing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Senator Manning and <Col N="910" /> Senator McEllistrim for their contribution to the debate and to express my gratitude to the House for the prompt and the swift way in which it dealt with this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill deals with some rather technical aspects of admiralty jurisdiction, a topic which is not of immediate interest to the ordinary citizen in the street and a difficult matter to debate unless one has a specialised knowledge of the subject. Nevertheless, as was said, it is a topic of considerable importance to those interested in maritime affairs.  Our accession to the Arrest Convention and to the Collisions Convention is of some significance.</P>
      <P>As I have explained, our accession to the Arrest Convention is vital if we are to retain our admiralty jurisdiction after the transitional provisions and the EC Judgments Convention expire.  I have mentioned already that the most dramatic extension of admiralty jurisdiction which would be brought about by the Arrest Convention will be the power to arrest sister ships.  The convention will also, however, extend our admiralty jurisdiction in certain other respects.  For example, under existing Irish law no specific provision is made for an admiralty action in respect of disbursements made by shippers, charterers or agents.  The convention does make such provisions in Article 1 (1) (n) and because of this particular benefit the Irish Ship Agents Association and the Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers have strongly advocated that we accede to the convention. In fact, I have had a number of meetings with these people.  Also, if a person suffers personal injuries in connection with the operation of a ship but the injuries are not directly caused by the ship, there is doubt whether he can take an admiralty action <i>in rem</i> under existing law.  The position is clear under the convention. Article 1 (1) (b) defines a maritime claim as including loss of life or personal injury caused by any ship occurring in connection with the operation of any ship and in such cases <i>in rem</i> action will be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These two examples are a good illustration of the type of benefits the Arrest Convention will bring once it is in force <Col N="911" /> in Ireland.  The existing rules of the court dealing with admiralty matters in the arrest of ships are set out in Order 64 of the Rules of the Superior Courts.  In particular, the order deals with the procedures to be followed in arresting a ship. It is likely that the order will have to be amended somewhat to take account of our accession to the Arrest Convention. As soon as this Bill is enacted I will arrange for the question of amended rules of court to be raised with the Superior Courts Rules Committee.</P>
    <P>Senators will have noticed that the convention do not enter into force in respect of an acceding statement until six months after notice of accession is deposited with the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We have until the end of 1990 to notify our accession to the Arrest Convention if we are to meet the deadline of 1 June 1991 imposed on us by the transitional provisions of the EC Judgements Convention. Because of the prompt way in which this Bill had been dealt with we should have no difficulty in meeting this deadline.  Indeed, I expect that both conventions will be enforced some considerable time before that date.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning raised the question of submarines and the danger they pose for fishing boats.  I have taken careful note of his comments and will bring them to the attention of our Oireachtas colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and also to the attention of the Minister for the Marine.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning asked why we were so long in bringing this legislation forward. The urgency of our adherence to these conventions arose in the context of the EC Judgements Convention, as I have already indicated.  The provisions of this Bill in relation to the arrest of ships are already in force in the Act which gave effect to the EC Judgments Convention which we had about 12 months or more ago.  That was another extremely highly <Col N="912" /> technical legislation which we had to contend with.</P>
    <P>On the question of the Cork Local Admiralty Court, since the early 1970s that court has been something of a dead letter.  Indeed, a constitutional cloud has hung over it since 1974.  Its sister court, the Cork Local Bankruptcy Court, was abolished in the Bankruptcy Act, 1988. The abolition of the Cork Local Admiralty Court is, in effect, nothing more than a piece of statute law reform.  The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure in its 20th interim report, dated 1 August 1978, considered that the vesting of admiralty jurisdiction, as does the Cork Circuit Court, does not give any material advantage to anybody as orders which are needed on the admiralty side are frequently needed very urgently and only the High Court is immediately available for these purposes.  The Admiralty Marshal of the High Court, the Law Society, the Southern Bar Association and the Irish Maritime Law Association were all consulted on this issue and saw no objection to what has been proposed, which is in effect a statute law reform measure.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
